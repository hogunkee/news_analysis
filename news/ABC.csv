1,ABC,"Biopharma investors breathed a collective sigh of relief Friday after a drug-pricing speech from President Trump was consistent with earlier views that he would offer ""more rhetoric than reform,"" according to one analyst.On the stock market today, biotech and pharmaceutical stocks stayed in the black at the close, up 2%-3%. Pharmacy retailers like CVS (CVS) and Amerisource Bergen (ABC) briefly retreated before jumping a respective 3.2% and 1.6%.Trump's plan to cut foreign drug prices would actually help pharmaceutical companies, says Topher Spiro, vice president of health policy for American Progress, a nonpartisan policy think tank. Spiro was critical earlier in the week of a potential blueprint for pricing reform.""Why are Big Pharma stocks way up?"" Spiro said in a tweet. ""Trump is promising their number one priority: trade deals that boost prices abroad. And virtually nothing touching U.S. prices.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseSpecifically, Trump said he had instructed Robert Lighthizer, the U.S. trade representative, to work on trade agreements with foreign countries for drug prices. The president called for Lighthizer to ""end global freeloading once and for all.""Outside that, Trump's plan was light on details. He pledged to ""eliminate the middlemen"" but stopped just short of identifying those as pharmacy benefit managers. He swore to take on the ""tangled web of special interests,"" but didn't say how.Pharmacists should be allowed to tell patients how to save money, Trump said. He also called out firms for using patents to ""choke out competition."" And Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar argued drugmakers should be required to list the prices of their drugs in commercials.Altogether, ""Trump's drug-pricing plan has gaping holes,"" Spiro said on Twitter. It doesn't address how to cut prices on existing and launching drugs for private insurance, Medicare Part D nor Medicaid. It only looks at cuts for Medicaid Part B, he said.Height Capital Markets analyst Andrea Harris didn't expect the proposals to have any teeth without Congressional support. Trump says he's working on it, but didn't outline which specific proposals he expects to send to Congress in the coming weeks.But one piece of Harris' report did come to fruition: Trump had a lot of blame to spread for the ""broken system."" Among those, he identified drugmakers, insurance companies, distributors, pharmacy benefit managers and the government for keeping prices ""artificially high.""Trump also called out ""twisted incentives"" under ObamaCare. He promised to give Medicare Part D plans, which cover pharmaceuticals, new tools to negotiate and incentives to keep prices low. He pledged to end ""dishonest double dealing"" that enriches middlemen.""We are not going to reward companies that constantly raise prices,"" he said.Harris had predicted ""fiery rhetoric"" from Trump.""The president never shies away from fiery rhetoric, and we expect that in his speech he will finger manufacturers, pharmacy benefit managers, insurers, hospitals and foreign countries as responsible for high drug prices,"" she said in a report before the speech.Health Secretary Azar said Trump's blueprint has more than 50 actions planned. The goal is to ""reorder an entire, complex system of our economy,"" he said.Earlier in the week, Azar outlined a laundry list of hurdles the HHS is working to solve. He noted issues with high list prices, seniors and government overpaying due to a lack of negotiation tools, rising out-of-pocket costs, and foreign governments ""free-riding off American innovation.""""HHS' blueprint for addressing these issues will build on the proposals put forth in President Trump's 2019 budget, but he wants to go much, much further,"" Azar said at the time. On Friday, though, he was more subdued on the specifics.Trump is working on ""real change while continuing to lead the world in innovation and patient access.""Harris had expected Trump to blame rebates, a pricing practice in the pharmaceutical supply chain that makes it so patients don't have to pay the full list prices for drugs. These are often negotiated by middlemen called pharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs.In a speech earlier this week, Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Scott Gottlieb called out PBMs for allegedly failing to pass savings onto patients. The FDA has the power to approve drugs, but it can't dictate their prices.""The top three PBMs control more than two-thirds of the market, the top three wholesalers more than 80%, and the top five pharmacies more than 50%,"" he said, according to Business Insider. ""Market concentration may prevent optimal competition.""Harris doesn't expect Trump to ban rebates altogether. But she did expect for him to call on the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to require PBMs to pass rebates onto patients. The HHS could also be asked to deem rebates as kickbacks, she said.But some highly priced drugs will likely be spared, American Progress' Spiro said ahead of the speech.""There is nothing, absolutely nothing in this plan to lower the sky-high launch prices of new specialty drugs,"" he said. ""These drugs are for diseases like cancer and multiple sclerosis, costing tends of thousands or even $100,000.""Heights' Harris expected Trump to call on the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation to use HHS authority to write new payment models in Medicaid and Medicaid Part B. Part B is health insurance coverage, whereas Part A covers hospital expenses.It's possible Trump could require physician-administered drugs to be negotiated under a PBM-like payment model. Currently, these receive reimbursement at 106% the market price, she said.This ""would force these drugs to compete for placement on a formulary like prescription drugs currently do,"" she said. ""This could be a material headwind for manufacturers, but it is politically challenging.""In the blueprint posted by Spiro, the proposal allows for greater flexibility in negotiating for prices under Medicare Part D. Part D is the prescription-drug side of Medicare. It would also offer free generics to low-income patients and require plans to share rebates with patients.But, American Progress' Spiro added, ""There is nothing, absolutely nothing in here to lower drug prices for the 150 million Americans with employer coverage or the millions more with other private insurance.""Trump also praised efforts by the FDA to approve more generic drugs and said that will continue. In 2017, the FDA approved a record number of generic drugs in an effort to increase competition. The FDA is soon to unveil a plan to boost the number of biologic copies, called biosimilars.It's possible Trump could also call on Congress to crack down on patent and market exclusivity ""gaming practices"" between branded- and generic-drug manufacturers, Harris said. He could further require the Federal Trade Commission to enforce ""pay for delay"" violations.Hospitals are also at risk, she said. The Trump administration is rewriting regulations that require manufacturers to sell drugs to hospitals and clinics at deep discounts. This allows providers to be reimbursed at market price and pocket the extra cash, she said.""We expect the president to call for further pro-patient (and pro-manufacturer) changes to this program, some of which can be achieved unilaterally through regulation and others that will require congressional action,"" she said.As expected, Trump blamed foreign governments for ""exploiting U.S. drugmakers."" The same pill with the same ingredients, in the same package, made in the same plant, costs more in the U.S. than it does in other countries, he said.""When foreign governments extort unreasonably low prices from U.S. drugmakers, Americans have to pay more to subsidize the enormous cost of research and development,"" he said. ""It's unfair and it's ridiculous and it's not going to happen any longer.""But, this will all have ""much more bark than bite,"" Heights Capital Markets' Harris said. The outcome will be dependent on trade agreements, she said. American Progress' Spiro agrees.""This is the biggest item on Big Pharma's wish list!"" he said. ""How the heck is this going to lower drug prices in this country?""RELATED:How Do You Spot A Major Market Top?

8,ABC,"The ""news"" you see at night on broadcast television is defined by what ""outrage"" has been perpetrated by President Donald Trump.Last week, ABC, CBS and NBC devoted an enormous chunk of their airtime to parents who immigrated to the country illegally being separated from their children by federal agents — 128 minutes, almost half of their total nightly airtime not including commercials, according to the Media Research Center.By contrast, other parts of the nation's business are nearly invisible. Take, for one example, America's war in Afghanistan, which is obviously not a new topic, since it started in 2001 and is now the longest war in American history. If it doesn't feel like that, it's because it's out of sight, out of mind.Last week, U.S. Central Command said it conducted 591 airstrikes in Afghanistan in May, the most of any month this year. And more bombs were dropped in April and May than over all of 2015.But from January through June 22, the networks only mustered 32 minutes between them, barely 10 minutes each. ABC led the pack with a measly 12 minutes and 49 seconds, and CBS (11 1/2 minutes) and NBC (seven minutes and 11 seconds) were even worse.One reason should be obvious: The number of dead Americans is very low. Only two American soldiers have died in combat in Afghanistan in 2018. Those men, Sgt. 1st Class Mihail Golin and Spc. Gabriel Conde, each drew about 20 seconds of airtime on each network when they were killed.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseA second reason is less obvious: The networks don't have many reporters overseas anymore, and certainly not reporters covering ""forgotten wars"" with few casualties. The networks are, by nature, more likely to cover American military action when it goes wrong, as in when civilians die in the bombings.But neither reason is an excuse. This is not how war is meant to be covered — when it's your country at war.The networks haven't been any more interested in the war on terrorism in general. Trump can largely vanquish the Islamic State group as a territorial power and you can hear the crickets.Try this: On May 9, The New York Times, to its credit, reported that ""a complex cross-border sting carried out by Iraqi and American intelligence"" concluded with the capture of five senior Islamic State group officials. On CBS that night, this triumph drew 35 seconds. ABC and NBC did nothing. But all three offered full stories on the black Yale University student who was upset because someone called the police when she was found napping in a dormitory common room.So let's go back to the big picture of 2018. What did the networks obsess over instead of spending more than 32 minutes on Afghanistan? In the same time period, ABC, CBS and NBC offered 442 evening-news minutes on the still-unproven allegations of the Trump campaign colluding with the Russian government in 2016. (That's in addition to the 1,234 minutes on this subject in 2017, adding up to a whopping 1,676 minutes total.)The hush-money scandal with porn star Stormy Daniels has received 107 minutes of evening-news attention. That's not counting another 81 minutes devoted to the exploits of Trump's personal lawyer Michael Cohen (who wrote the check to Daniels) and whether the FBI raid on his office will uncover nefarious Trump-enabling secrets.The American Army at war in Afghanistan is 30% as important as a two-bit prostitute.Whatever might cause the end of the Trump presidency is ""news."" Whatever might cause the re-election of Donald Trump is treated like it belongs in a deep, dark cave like containers of radioactive waste.Whatever is news is not news if it doesn't fit that narrative.More Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

They nominated Hillary Clinton and her seven-mile train of scandalous baggage for president, and that's jake. They elected Bill Clinton as president, who perjured himself and sullied his office. Not a problem.The one guarantee with Trump appointing Judge Brett Kavanaugh is that the Democrats, fueled by their mindless street mobs, will try to destroy him. It's how Democrats behave. It is not how the ""news"" media should behave. Is there anyone who disputes that? But it is how they will comport themselves, because they are one with their Democratic brothers and sisters.One by one, leftist Democrats have been making preposterous comments since the moment Trump made his announcement. Sen. Kamala Harris, for instance, immediately described Kavanaugh as a deadly threat, saying, ""his nomination presents an existential threat to the health care of hundreds of millions of Americans.""The ""news"" media reaction to Democratic rants? Nothing but airtime.Leftist websites like the Daily Beast presented Trump's short list of candidates as a plot by ""Catholic fundamentalist"" puppet masters. Where are the news reports about Kavanaugh being slandered for his Catholic faith? To beat this old saw, what if National Review had attacked Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's nomination as a plot led by Zionist puppet masters? You could have heard journalist heads explode.Instead, reporters like NPR's Nina Totenberg — who not only smeared Associate Justice Clarence Thomas with unsubstantiated sexual harassment bilge but also openly allies herself in public appearances with Justice Ginsburg these days — are warning that Kennedy's retirement will be the ""end of the world as we know it,"" leading to ""a hardcore conservative majority of a kind not seen probably in three-quarters of a century.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseTo conservatives, that sounds great. But this reaction underlines why people don't trust the liberal-media fun house anymore. Under President Obama, the Democrats tried to socialize health care with Obamacare. They pushed same-sex marriage, and the Supreme Court imposed it on 50 states. Obama also imposed radical federal ""guidance"" on public schools with ""inclusive"" policies for transgender students.Our liberal TV anchors and taxpayer-funded Totenbergs never described all this as the ""end of the world as we know it."" It wasn't the work of a ""hardcore leftist"" administration. But now the idea of reversing any of this is called a shift ""sharply to the right.""When Obama nominated then-Judge Sonia Sotomayor and then-Solicitor General Elena Kagan to the court, no journalists talked about extremes. They gushed like schoolgirls. Try ABC's Claire Shipman (Mrs. Jay Carney) on Sotomayor nine years ago. This sounds like an Obama campaign advertisement: ""Even as a little girl, growing up in a drug-ridden South Bronx housing project, stricken with juvenile diabetes, she had that trademark knack: Instead of seeing dead ends, young Sonia saw possibilities. ... She's also an avid Yankees fan, a mean guacamole maker and a fierce biker.""Sotomayor sits at the left-wing extreme of the Supreme Court, but at her confirmation hearings, the networks were in denial. Jan Crawford Greenburg at ABC said, ""Sotomayor ... calmly, persistently, repeatedly ... described herself differently, sounding almost conservative.""But any research seems to bring us back to the eternally shameless Totenberg. She said of Sotomayor, ""In fact, on a lot of criminal law issues, you could say that she's more conservative than some members of the Supreme Court, including Justice Scalia.""When Kagan was nominated in 2010, Totenberg took to NPR and — we're not making this up — put on the theme song of the ""Superman"" TV show from the '50s to compare Kagan, the former Harvard Law School dean, to Superman: ""Kagan, who can raise money by the millions! Kagan, who can end the faculty wars over hiring! Kagan, who won the hearts of students ... !""They are about to show the world what first-class hypocrites they really are.

14,ABC,"Investors may be overlooking a big factor in who wins the takeover battle for 21st Century Fox (FOXA) — whether the Murdoch family wants to be the biggest shareholders in the new company, or would they rather cash out?The question is the proverbial elephant-in-the-room as a bidding war rages between Comcast (CMCSA) and Walt Disney (DIS) for a chunk of Rupert Murdoch's Fox media empire. Fox on Wednesday accepted Disney's sweetened, $71 billion cash-and-stock bid, at $38-a-share. That countered Comcast's $65 billion all-cash bid. Experts expect Comcast to fire back soon.Murdoch, along with sons Lachlan and James — all three of them Fox board members — are legally bound recommend the best offer to shareholders. Whether Comcast or Disney prevails in the showdown over Fox likely boils down to the highest offer, tax issues and regulatory approval.But a lurking concern is whether Murdoch and family want to stay in the pantheon of the media and entertainment industry. Murdoch owns 17% of Fox's outstanding shares. The family stands to be the biggest shareholders in a combined Disney-Fox. It's possible a Murdoch one day could run Disney.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe Murdochs, however, become smaller media industry players if Fox ultimately accepts Comcast's all-cash bid.Comcast and Disney are fighting over Fox's film and TV studios, cable networks, international TV business and a 39% stake in satellite broadcaster Sky. Not everything in Fox goes, however. Fox retains its news channel, TV stations, sports networks and other assets and spin it into a new company, with Lachlan Murdoch as CEO.It's not clear if the Murdochs will get a Disney board seat if the Mouse prevails vs. Comcast, says Blair Levin, analyst at New Street Research. The reason: Disney owns a TV broadcaster, ABC, and the Murdochs still would have Fox.Craig Moffett, a longtime industry analyst, on Thursday published a report saying Disney holds an edge over Comcast. He says Disney's mostly stock offer provides tax advantages. He notes that Fox shareholders have a choice of taking cash or stock. And, Moffett says Disney may have a better chance of getting regulatory approval, despite AT&T's (T) recent court victory in the Time Warner acquisition.Asked about Murdoch winding up as the biggest shareholder in Disney as a factor, Moffett replied in an email: ""Yes, that too.""Disney CEO Bob Iger said Wednesday the company has legally committed to not split Fox assets with Comcast. That raises the stakes for the Roberts family.Ralph Roberts co-founded Comcast in the 1960s. A dual-class stock structure gives the Roberts family control of about a third of the company's voting power.Comcast stock dropped 1.8% to close at 32.79 on the stock market today as Fox rose 0.5% to 48.34.

16,ABC,"Former President Barack Obama is swaggering around and claiming he didn't really have any scandals as president. In February, he said we ""didn't have a scandal that embarrassed us."" This only means shamelessness can seem like a winning tactic. In May, he said, ""I didn't have scandals, which seems like it shouldn't be something you brag about.""By any objective measure, this man is a liar.Obama can claim he was only following the lead of his servile press corps. CNN, which screams about Donald Trump scandals all day long, ran a two-hour Obama special at the end of his second term during which host Fareed Zakaria claimed: ""He ran an administration that was largely scandal-free. ... And he did it all the while under a microscope — because he looked different.""This man is a liar as well. There's no other way to put it.So when the Justice Department inspector general released a report on the Hillary Clinton email scandal on June 14, it's not surprising that the network newscasts ignored any reference to Obama, who is certainly scolded in the report, including pages 66 to 69.ABC, CBS, NBC and PBS did multiple segments on the IG report, and all of them completely skipped an Obama angle. They centered their coverage on how the IG scalded former FBI Director James Comey, and they ignored that Comey was appointed by ... who? Obama in 2013.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThese networks also skipped over the report's discussion of the scandal of then-Attorney General Loretta Lynch meeting with former President Bill Clinton on a tarmac shortly before the Justice Department announced it would not prosecute. Naturally, in their liberal eyes, the scandal here was that President Trump was claiming he was vindicated by the IG report. This was apparently the false statement.Obama can lie without any consequences. For starters, in 2015 he denied knowing that Hillary Clinton used a private email address for her government business. The IG report makes clear that Obama ""was one of the 13 individuals with whom Clinton had direct contact using her clintonemail.com account."" As he so often did during eight years of assorted scandals, Obama claimed he only learned about it ""through news reports."" No one called him a) dishonest or b) clueless.But it was worse than that. Obama caused indigestion inside the FBI when he went on television and insisted nothing Clinton did was worth prosecuting.On ""60 Minutes"" on Oct. 11, 2015, Obama insisted, ""I can tell you that this is not a situation in which America's national security was endangered."" CBS' Steve Kroft nudged him, saying, ""This administration has prosecuted people for having classified material on their private computers."" Obama replied: ""there's no doubt that there had been breaches, and these are all a matter of degree. We don't get an impression that here there was purposely efforts ... to hide something or to squirrel away information.""Lynch told the IG that Obama stepped in it by prematurely proclaiming on CBS that there was no national security damage. It created a suspicion of political bias at the top of the Justice Department. Obama repeated his line about Clinton's lack of harm to national security in a ""Fox News Sunday"" interview on April 10, 2016.It's not like the networks couldn't find these video clips. As energetically as they create a persistent ""crisis"" for Donald Trump, they have put a protective bubble around their precious Obama. He can boast that he has no scandals because the ""facts first"" media have manufactured that false perception for 10 years.Hillary Clinton email scandal explained.More Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

17,ABC,"Who knew we would look back at Roseanne Barr's crotch-grabbing massacre of the national anthem in 1990 and see a mere flesh wound on her career? She embarrassed herself, mocking America in front of America, but her hit show rolled along.But one egregiously racist tweet destroyed the ""Roseanne"" reboot of 2018 in a Hollywood minute. Tweeting that former Barack Obama top aide Valerie Jarrett is a mixture of the Muslim Brotherhood and ""Planet of the Apes"" put an abrupt end to the top broadcast television program of the year.ABC made the right decision — and the obvious business decision. You cannot compare blacks to monkeys. That is an old, dehumanizing trope. It is viciously mean-spirited to compare President Donald Trump to an orangutan, as many leftists have. But that is a mockery of one man's hair and intelligence, not the rhetorical equivalent of a burning cross.In retrospect, everyone said ABC should have known this was going to happen. Barr has always been a loose cannon, and her politics have zigzagged from running on the presidential ticket of the nutty-left Green Party all the way over to backing Trump. But the network thrived with the original formula of ""Roseanne,"" and it saw a win-win with a reboot: The show's old audience would tune in, and ABC could sell itself as reaching out to the red states after mysteriously dumping Tim Allen's hit show. The ratings were terrific. Then Roseanne drove the reboot over a cliff.Dehumanizing tropes about black people don't always destroy careers ... when the black is a Republican. For example, Pat Oliphant didn't stop being the most widely syndicated political cartoonist in the world after he drew then-Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice as a parrot with large lips sitting on then-President George W. Bush's hand in 2008.This was a trend. Christian Science Monitor cartoonist Jeff Danziger drew a barefoot Rice in a rocking chair saying, ""I knows all about aluminum tubes! (Correction) I don't know nuthin' about aluminum tubes ..."" In the radical fever swamps, cartoonist Ted Rall drew one with Rice saying, ""I was Bush's beard! His house n----!"" And a black male character replies, ""Now hand over your hair straightener."" He is wearing a T-shirt that says, ""You're not white, stupid.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

We protested until Behar apologized on air, and she has since compared Trump to an orangutan, because it's just another day in the Resistance.Days before the Barr debacle, Disney-owned ESPN rehired Keith Olbermann, fresh off a series of unhinged Trump-hating videos for GQ magazine and a book titled ""Trump Is F---ing Crazy (This Is Not a Joke).""

18,ABC,"Comcast (CMCSA) launched a takeover bid for 21st Century Fox Entertainment (FOXA) on Wednesday, offering $65 billion in cash for Rupert Murdoch's entertainment company and at a 19% premium over Walt Disney's (DIS) offer.Comcast's takeover bid had been expected in the wake of AT&T's (T) court victory late Tuesday that cleared its purchase of Time Warner (TWX). The nation's largest cable TV firm has been waiting for a ruling on the AT&T-Time Warner merger before announcing a formal bid for Fox.Comcast, which also owns NBCUniversal, has already bid $31 billion for satellite TV broadcaster Sky, in which Fox holds a 39% stake.Disney, however, in November agreed to buy Fox — including its stake in broadcaster Sky — for $54.4 billion in an all-stock deal.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

In Wednesday's regular session, Fox popped 7.4% to 43.41. Comcast edged down 0.2% to 32.32. Disney gained 1.9% to 106.30.While Wall Street fears a bidding war, one scenario is that the companies carve up Fox, with Comcast getting Sky as well as video streaming service Hulu and perhaps other assets.Disney's deal includes Fox's stake in U.K.-based Sky, a film studio, cable networks and other assets. It excludes the Fox Broadcasting Network. Disney already owns broadcaster ABC.One obstacle to a truce is the history between the companies. A much smaller Comcast tried to buy Disney in 2004 but was rebuffed.Meanwhile, AT&T fell 6% to 32.22, despite its court victory. One analyst said AT&T's fall may be tied to arbitrage over the Time Warner transaction. MoffettNathanson also downgraded AT&T to sell.The Department of Justice sued in November 2017 to block AT&T's $85 billion acquisition of Time Warner on grounds that the merger could hurt competition in the pay-TV industry.Shares in CBS (CBS), Lions Gate Entertainment (LGF), Discovery Communications (DISCA) and other media firms rose in the wake of AT&T's (T) court victory.The landmark antitrust victory over the U.S. Department of Justice is expected to open the door to more acquisitions of media assets by telecoms or even internet companies, such as Amazon.com (AMZN).Viacom (VIA) gained 0.7% to 33.55 while CBS was up 3.6% to 54.27.

Privacy Policy & Terms of UseExcept, here in the middle of 2018, that President is still Barack Obama and the First Lady is still Michelle Obama.What?Talk about ingratitude.  Thanks entirely to President Trump and his tax policies, Disney announced earlier that they were going to give over 125,000 of their employees a one-time cash bonus of $1,000 and invest $50 million into an employee education program.Great news for Disney and their employees and yet, a year and one-half into the presidency of Donald J. Trump, he and First Lady Melania Trump are still seemingly banned from The Disney Channel.Why?Just a modicum of research shows that for the eight years of the Obama presidency, The Disney Channel featured President and Mrs. Obama in virtually all of their children's programming and even wrote numerous parts exclusively for Michelle Obama.  The Obamas literally got more airtime than some of the child stars of the network.That saturation of a liberal president and first lady into children's programming being no surprise as a majority of the leadership of both The Disney Corporation and The Disney Channel is liberal to far-left in their political beliefs.But was it fair?  Has Disney gone too far in letting personal ideologies control their public content?I happen to be a conservative Christian who does believe we are all God's Children born with the exact same rights.  The exact same.  No matter our gender, no matter our color, no matter our faith, and no matter our sexual orientation, we are all born with the exact same rights.  We must recognize and protect those rights.Does Mr. Iger, the Disney Corporation and the Disney Channel actually believe the same?Is President Trump banned from The Disney Channel because of liberal frustration, anger and even hate directed at the man himself? Is he banned because he's a Republican president pushing conservative agendas. Or is it a bit of both?Why ban Melania Trump in the process?  A woman, who by every measure, is not only a very good person, but an exceptional mother.Years ago working for former Senator Bob Dole, I had the chance to speak with Iger a couple of times.  He could not have been nicer, more professional, and more caring.  In the years since, he has proven himself to be one of the most exceptional executives in the world.That said, he has made no secret of the fact that he's a liberal Democrat, strongly supported Hillary Clinton, and even entertained the idea of running for President himself.Last year, Iger quit President Trump's business advisory council because of Trump's decision to withdraw from the Paris Climate Agreement.  In a tweet, Mr. Iger stated:  ""As a matter of principle, I've resigned from the President's Council over the #ParisAgreement withdrawal,""Leaving aside President Trump acted solely in the best interests of our nation by withdrawing from the laughably flawed and extremely punitive fake agreement, it's certainly Mr. Iger's right to quit for any reason.That said, would Mr. Iger acknowledge that also because of ""Principle,"" millions of parents — and paying Disney customers — who switch on The Disney Channel, happen to side with President Trump on that issue and others?  Are they entitled to see a president they support pop up on The Disney Channel from time to time?Why are the current president and first lady of the United States censored from the Disney Channel?How much ""adult"" ideology and bias should be inserted into children's programming?What age is too young?How would liberals react if conservatives controlled the media, entertainment and academia and continually inserted conservative bias into those arenas?What if President Trump and Mr. Iger respectfully discussed those questions and more in a public and televised forum?As we contemplate those questions, I am going to switch on The Obama Channel…I mean The Disney Channel…to check out the latest in children's political programming.Click here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

20,ABC,"Roseanne Barr lost her new television show.Barr, in a tweet about Barack Obama aide Valerie Jarrett, said of Jarrett: ""muslim brotherhood & planet of the apes had a baby=vj."" The comedian deleted the offensive tweet, but the damage was irreversible. The reaction was swift.The Rev. Al Sharpton tweeted: ""The comparison ... of ... Valerie Jarrett to an APE is racist and inexcusable. ABC must take action NOW!"" The Disney-owned ABC issued the following statement: ""Roseanne's Twitter statement is abhorrent, repugnant and inconsistent with our values, and we have decided to cancel her show."" Barr left Disney little choice. Standing by her would have meant advertiser boycotts, forcing any company that advertises on her show to explain their association with a ""racist.""But what are the rules?Disney also owns ESPN, the sports cable channel that employs Keith Olbermann, whose angry, unhinged tweets about President Donald Trump make Barr's anti-Jarrett tweet look like a love note. Here's one Olbermann tweeted at Ivanka Trump, Trump's daughter: ""Then tell your racist, white supremacist, neo-nazi father to get the f--- out of our society."" One would think that Disney would find Olbermann's tweets ""abhorrent, repugnant and inconsistent with (their) values.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseAs for MSNBC's Sharpton, he also said that Barr's tweet shows that Trump is ""normalizing"" racism. Remember Sharpton became famous by falsely accusing a white man of raping a black teen. A New York grand jury called the accusation a hoax, and Sharpton was successfully sued for defamation. But to this day, Sharpton refuses to apologize.Sharpton helped fan the flames during the deadly 1991 Crown Heights, New York, riots by leading some 400 protesters through the predominately Jewish section of Brooklyn. Days before the deadly riots, Sharpton said at a rally in Harlem, ""If the Jews want to get it on, tell them to pin their yarmulkes back and come over to my house."" Sharpton once called David Dinkins, the first and only black New York City mayor, a ""n----- whore."" Sharpton described Jews as ""diamond merchants"" and whites moving into Harlem as ""interlopers.""Unwilling to wait for the Ferguson grand jury to finish its investigation of the police shooting death of Michael Brown, Sharpton took to the streets of Ferguson yelling, ""No justice, no peace."" The grand jury exonerated the officer. No remorse by Sharpton. No apology. No cancellation of his show.Bill Maher has long hosted a show on HBO and gets top pundits to appear. No guest seems bothered by Maher's sexist, vicious put-downs of Republican women. In his stand-up, Maher called Sarah Palin a ""c---"" and a ""dumb t---"" — both offensive and derisive slang words for female genitalia. Maher defended himself by insisting that in his stand-up act, political correctness is off-limits. Michael Richards committed career suicide when, during a comedy stand-up, he shouted down black hecklers by repeatedly using the N-word. That this occurred in a stand-up act was no defense for him. Richards has barely been heard from since.Maher also called Palin and Michele Bachmann ""two bimbos."" Maher referred to Palin's son with Down syndrome as ""retarded."" In January 2013, Maher said that Donald Trump should prove he wasn't ""the spawn of his mother having sex with an orangutan."" Isn't this pretty much what Barr said?Meanwhile at CNN, Erin Burnett hosts a daily show. When Burnett worked for MSNBC, she referred to then-President George Bush, standing in a group of politicians, as ""the monkey in the middle."" CNN's Van Jones called Trump's election a ""whitelash,"" and fellow host Don Lemon, who calls himself a ""journalist,"" recently pronounced President Trump ""a racist."" Well, that settles that.One can't even keep track of the many offensive things said on the Disney-owned ABC show ""The View."" Panelist Sunny Hostin attributed Trump's victory to racism: ""Twenty percent of people voted because of racism, and I think after eight years of a black president there was no way that (Clinton) was going to win.""The outrage over Barr's offensive tweet is understandable. But why is there a no-fly zone over Maher, Olbermann and Sharpton? Laura Ingraham took a relatively mild swipe at Parkland gun control activist David Hogg, apologized, but had to weather an advertiser boycott.The swift cancellation of Barr's show demonstrates yet again that the National Review editor John O'Sullivan was right. ""White racism,"" Sullivan said, ""does exist, but its social power is weak and the social power arrayed against it is overwhelming.""Other columns by Larry Elder

Sources told ABC News that Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz's draft report on the FBI's Clinton email investigation calls former FBI Director James Comey ""insubordinate"" and says he ""defied authority"" in investigating the Hillary Clinton email scandal.So what do all these things suggest? That the Mueller investigation is unraveling fast. For more than two years, both the FBI and the Special Counsel's office have investigated the alleged collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russians.They have found nothing. In Mueller's case, the big fish is Manafort. But he has not tied anyone in the Trump campaign, including Manafort, to any efforts by the Russians to meddle in the 2016 presidential election with the Trump campaign. Manafort's charges have nothing to do with that, and show how absurdly broad Mueller's investigation has been.He cast a net on the waters and caught nothing.Meanwhile, revelations that the FBI spied on a major presidential campaign using information supplied and paid for by that campaign's political opponents has the potential to send FBI and DOJ officials to prison.This is the kind of shameful behavior you see in Zimbabwe, Venezuela and other tin-pot, one-party dictatorships. But not in the world's oldest true democracy. In our country, such behavior is illegal — considered both election tampering and a subversion of our democracy.This enormously complex U.S. intelligence scandal is difficult to follow, even for the media who do so for a living. But the revelations have been adding up. As they do, they create an ever-clearer picture of massive political corruption at the DOJ, FBI and CIA.That is, ""deep state"" collusion by our three main intelligence agencies, not collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russians.As much as anyone, former CIA Director John Brennan, an admitted former Communist sympathizer whose questionable past behavior clearly should have disqualified him from a senior intelligence post in the U.S., worked assiduously to undermine the campaign and later the very presidency of Donald Trump.On whose behalf was he doing this? His own? Or someone else's? Was it part of an Obama administration scheme to torpedo any chances that Trump would win the election?Indeed, in recent weeks, the rationale for the Trump investigation — alleged concern about Russia hacking our election — has been shredded.What's left is a major scandal, SpyGate as some call it. It makes Watergate look like a two-bit burglary conducted by political amateurs. Which is what it was.That rumbling you now hear? It's the volcano of political corruption that now is shaking the earth and set to erupt in Washington, D.C.YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:Spying On Trump: Was Obama Behind CIA, FBI Plan To Elect Hillary?Mueller's Leak: Deep State Doubles Down On Collusion With DemocratsFBI Scandal: Deep State Corruption Of FBI, Justice Was There From Very Start Of Hillary Email ProbeClick here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

22,ABC,"The intense fear and loathing that permeates news coverage of President Trump is being multiplied on television dramas. Impeachment scenarios and 25th Amendment removal strategies are rolling around in the brains of scriptwriters.Barbara Hall, the creator of the pro-Hillary Clinton CBS show ""Madam Secretary,"" claimed ""We just take things that are already in the atmosphere, and if we find them interesting in terms of a civics lesson, we show you what it would look like. We're not campaigning for it. We're not politicizing it, really. We're just saying, 'Here's what the process looks like.'""Agenda? What agenda? It's a civics lesson.So CBS debuted a show called ""Madam Secretary"" with a heroic white female secretary of state in 2014, and it wasn't intended to promote the presidential ambitions of Hillary Clinton. It was merely showing ""what the process looks like"" when there's a noble, intelligent female president in waiting.In January, ""Madam Secretary"" had an episode where the president sounds too recklessly warmongering about going after Russia with ""force and ferocity"" (""fire and fury,"" anyone?), so our Madam Secretary and the White House chief of staff plot to remove him via the 25th Amendment.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseCan anyone imagine this plot twist if President Clinton were in office? We'd suggest there would be other topics for hot scripts, maybe a plot or two about the sexist ""deep state"" and crypto-fascist Congress that can't abide a brilliant female chief executive.CBS is also pushing an even less fictional scenario in its streaming program ""The Good Fight,"" a sequel to another Hillary-inspired drama, ""The Good Wife."" This show has real-life liberal horror Donald Trump at its center. The liberal lawyer main character, Diane Lockhart, has her firm competing with others in getting a piece of the Democratic Party's impeachment business after the midterm elections.""It's become this wet dream. We wanted to satirize that while (being realistic) about how Democrats, in our imaginations, are preparing to prosecute it,"" said the show's creator, Robert King. ""With something very controversial in the news, it's always fun to drive toward it, not run away from it."" Later this season, King and his wife and co-creator, Michelle, are promising an episode that exploits the tabloidish DNC-funded Trump-Russia dossier by former British spy Christopher Steele.The Kings do put some wretched liberal excess in their plot. A character played by Audra McDonald makes it plain she doesn't care whether the allegations that remove Trump are true or false, as long as they work.CBS is also employing a 25th Amendment plot over on the CBS-owned cable channel Showtime, in ""Homeland."" Here their paranoid female president Elizabeth Keane is fighting with her vice president, who begs her not to create a crisis by firing cabinet members who would vote to remove her.On ABC, the show ""Designated Survivor"" has its noble HUD Secretary-turned-president Tom Kirkman facing a 25th Amendment process after his wife was killed in a car accident and he turned to a therapist, whose tapes discussing the president's mental state have been leaked to the press. Kirkman is no Trump. He's more of a Mr. Smith-goes-to-Washington character. But impeachment is impeachment.In The Washington Post, TV writer Scott Tobias unloaded an unintentionally funny line that these writers are ""working at a time when television has embraced open partisanship, rejecting the firm political neutrality of the past."" Because in the Bush years, ABC's female-president drama ""Commander-in-Chief"" or NBC's heroic Democrat in ""The West Wing"" were firmly neutral?Is Hollywood just indulging itself with a liberal fantasy? Or is it preparing the public to accept impeachment and/or removal of the president as a desirable reality? If our times are so extremely partisan and desperate, why should we imagine this is all just a fictional exercise?Word to the wise: Hollywood is having a bigger impact than most realize.YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:More Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Other columns by L.

23,ABC,"Scandal: Whatever James Comey's motives were for writing memos about his meetings with President Trump, they reveal how duplicitous the former FBI Director was with the new president.News of those memos first broke last May, after Comey gave four of the seven he'd written to a friend, who then shared some of the details with the New York Times — details designed to make it appear that Trump was attempting to obstruct justice in the ongoing Russia investigation. Comey later admitted that he leaked the memos in hopes that it would prompt the appointment of a special counsel. Which, of course, it did.Now, nearly a year later, we finally have the chance to see the complete Comey memos — minus a few redactions. (You can read them here.)But the picture that emerges most clearly from them is not one of a crazed, deranged Trump trying to obstruct the FBI's investigation into Russian election meddling. If anything, Trump comes across as sympathetic.Instead, Comey manages by his own hand to show how he repeatedly lied and deceived Trump, and how he purposely withheld information from him knowing full well that by doing so he was hurting Trump's ability to do his job.Here's a rundown.In his first memo, dated January 7, Comey recounts the meeting in which he briefed Trump on the dossier. He says he did so because reporters already had the information.But then he told Trump that the press hadn't reported on it yet because they ""were looking for a news hook"" and stressed to Trump that ""it was important that we not give them the excuse to write that the FBI has the material.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseHe says Trump was surprised that the press hadn't already run with the story, to which Comey replied ""they would get killed for reporting straight up from the source reports.""It turns out it was Comey himself who gave the press the hook they were looking for. Just days after, CNN used Comey's briefing of Trump as the very pretext to report on the dossier that, up until that point, they'd refused to touch.In other words, it's far less likely that Comey briefed Trump because he was worried the press would report on the dossier, and more likely that he briefed Trump to ensure that those details would leak.Further evidence that Comey wasn't being honest with Trump comes in his Jan. 28 memo, in which he fundamentally changes the reason given for why he briefed Trump in the first place.In that memo, he says the reason he gave Trump the briefing was because ""the media, CNN in particular, was telling us they were about to run with it.""Comey also relates in his memos how Trump repeatedly asked him to investigate the claim in the dossier about Trump hiring prostitutes in Moscow to pee on a bed that President Obama had slept in.Comey advises against it because ""I wouldn't want to create a narrative that we were investigating him,"" and that ""it is very difficult to prove a lie.""But at the time, Comey could have easily put that story to rest, because he knew that the dossier was bought and paid for by Hillary Clinton and the Democratic National Committee. All he had to do was tell Trump, or the public, and the entire story would have been dismissed as a Democratic smear campaign.Instead, he never told Trump the truth about the dossier's origins. He told ABC News this month that he didn't because ""it wasn't necessary for my goal.""Wasn't necessary for his goal?In fact, out of all the leaks coming out of the FBI about Trump, the origins of the dossier remained the best kept secret in Washington all the way until October 2017.In his March 30 memo, Comey says Trump talked about the pall the Russia story was casting over his presidency. He ""said he was trying to run the country and the cloud of this Russia business was making that difficult.""Trump told Comey that ""he was trying to make deals for the country, the cloud was hurting him (and mentioned going to G-7 with it hanging over him), and he hoped I could find a way to get out that he wasn't being investigated.""According to his memos, Comey repeatedly assured Trump that he wasn't being investigated, and Trump repeatedly asked him to make that publicly known so he could do his job.""I told him I would see what we could do,"" Comey wrote in March. But Comey admitted later that he had no intention of doing so.The topic of FBI leaks comes up several times in the Comey memos. At one point he told Trump how ""I was eager to find leakers and would like to nail one to the door as a message.""At the time, however, Comey likely knew that his own deputy director, Andrew McCabe, had authorized a leak to the Wall Street Journal in 2016 regarding the status of the FBI's investigation into the Clinton Foundation. That's what McCabe claims, at least.And for all we know, Comey knew about or authorized the leak about his briefing Trump on the dossier.He also kept telling Trump how McCabe was a ""true professional,"" and ""you would come to value him.""But Comey also likely knew that McCabe had for weeks sat on the discovery that many of Hillary Clinton's State Department emails were on Anthony Weiner's laptop.Not exactly the mark of a ""top pro.""But the biggest lie Comey makes in his memos is when he tells Trump how ""he could count on me to always tell the truth.""""I said I don't do sneaky things. I don't leak. I don't do weasel moves.""Yet everything Comey has done — both the things he recounts in the memos and what he's done since — proves the exact opposite.He leaked classified information contained in at least one memo. He misled Trump repeatedly. He withheld key information about the dossier's funding. He did all this knowing it would undermine the presidency.The irony of it all is that Comey is now raking in vast sums of money peddling his memoirs, which he titled: ""A Higher Loyalty: Truth, Lies and Leadership.""YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:Is James Comey A Serial Liar?FBI's Andy McCabe Faces Possible Criminal Charges — Are Hillary Clinton & Co.

24,ABC,"Amazon (AMZN) has shelved plans to become a wholesale distributor of prescription drugs due to the cost and complexity, CNBC reported.The news lit a fire under shares of beaten-down drug retailers and distributors. CVS Health (CVS) shot up 4.2% and Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) jumped 3.8% on the stock market today. Both were off session highs.Among drug distributors, McKesson (MCK) rose 3.5%, AmerisourceBergen (ABC) 2.25% and Cardinal Health (CAH) 3.1%.Amazon shares didn't react negatively to the news, rising 0.75% on Monday.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe report seemed to have the most direct connection to the trio of major drug distributors that handle logistics for major drug manufacturers, a big revenue but low-margin business. Complexity, such as handling temperature-sensitive products, and the lack of interest among hospitals in switching purchasing relationships, will keep Amazon out of the business.Investors seemed to interpret the move as decreasing the likelihood that Amazon will enter the retail prescription business, giving a boost to CVS and Walgreens. If so, then Amazon investors apparently don't think the internet retail giant needs prescription drugs to win over and keep customer loyalty.Amazon could still enter the prescription business, such as via an acquisition of Walgreens. Or it could start small with just online pharmacy.Meanwhile, Walmart (WMT) appears to be increasingly focused on health care and pharmacy as a key to boost sales and loyalty. Walmart is reportedly in talks to merge or deepen its partnership with Humana (HUM), whose managed care businesses is focused on the Medicare population.Shares of Walmart climbed about 1%, but didn't see much of an uptick after the Amazon news broke.Cigna (CI), the managed care provider that is buying pharmacy benefit manager Express Scripts (ESRX), rose 2%.Shares of UnitedHealth (UNH), the largest managed care provider, rose 2.7%.

25,ABC,"Fired ex-FBI head James Comey told ABC News ""chief anchor"" George Stephanopoulos that Donald Trump is ""morally unfit to be president""? Think about this. Comey offered this assessment to Stephanopoulos, whose former boss, first candidate and then President Bill Clinton, was credibly accused of rape and sexual assault, had sex in the Oval Office with an intern, and then lied about it under oath, for which he was impeached.But Comey tells Stephanopoulos that Trump is ""morally unfit to be president""?Also, Fox News' Sean Hannity, a staunch President Trump defender, got hammered for not revealing his relationship with Donald Trump's attorney, Michael Cohen. Hannity claims his relationship with Cohen did not rise to client-attorney, but that he had merely sought out Cohen's informal advice on real estate matters. Still, Hannity, now the face of Fox News, who at times has referred to himself as a ""journalist,"" should have known that critics would cry ""conflict of interest."" So he should have disclosed the relationship out of abundance of caution.Shouldn't ""chief anchor"" Clintonopoulos have also given full disclosure? Shouldn't he have informed the viewers that he was a top campaign aide for then-Gov. Clinton's presidential race; that he helped Hillary Clinton malign Bill's female accusers; and that after the election he served as a top aide to President Clinton?Why didn't Stephanopoulos disclose that as a top campaign aide to Bill Clinton, he went on TV and accused Gennifer Flowers, a Clinton mistress, of lying? And yet with Comey, Stephanopoulos clenches his jaw in indignation over Trump's alleged treatment of women.Stephanopoulos, in his Comey interview, never challenged the ex-FBI director's assertion that Trump is ""morally unfit"" to be president. Democratic icon President John F. Kennedy, according to former New York Times reporter and New Yorker contributor Seymour Hersh, had venereal disease for decades, slept with a mobster's mistress, partied with hookers in the White House, etc. But Trump's ""morally unfit""?! Stephanopoulos never asked Comey how and why he found that Hillary Clinton lacked ""intent"" to violate the Espionage Act -- when the provision in question does not require intent. All it requires is ""gross negligence.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseIf the goal of Comey's book was to defend his reputation, it's not working. Former New York Times statistician and writer Nate Silver tweeted: ""It's also not particularly honorable, if you have information that you believe is of immediate and vital national importance, to wait to 11 months to release it until you can have a giant book launch and publicity tour around it.""If anti-Trumpers were hoping for a smoking gun, Comey didn't not deliver. First, he flat-out admits that politics colored his decision to re-open the Hillary Clinton email investigation days before the election. He writes: ""It is entirely possible that, because I was making decisions in an environment where Hillary Clinton was sure to be the next president, my concern about making her an illegitimate president by concealing the restarted investigation bore greater weight than it would have if the election appeared closer or if Donald Trump were ahead in all polls.""Second, Comey says he doesn't know if Trump broke the law. ""I have one perspective on the behavior I saw,"" Comey writes, ""which while disturbing and violating basic norms of ethical leadership, may fall short of being illegal.""Meanwhile, the Trump-Russia collusion investigation continues without, so far, evidence of Trump-Russia collusion, while the media's Trump Derangement Syndrome rages on. Anti-Republicanism has, of course, long been a staple of the mainstream political news media. In the 40-plus years The Washington Post has been endorsing presidential candidates, they have never endorsed a Republican. The New York Times has not endorsed a Republican president in 60 years -- since Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1956. But this is a whole new level of hostility.America would be on fire had President Barack Obama spent the first year and a half of his presidency battling bogus charges of Russian ""collusion,"" and then an Obama collusion probe turned into an investigation about lying to investigators; expanded into an investigation of obstruction of justice; became an investigation of tax fraud; and morphed into an investigation about the validity of a nondisclosure agreement with a porn star with whom the President may or may not have had a sexual relationship with 12 years ago.Even Democratic former President Jimmy Carter, a few months ago, offered this observation about Trump and his treatment by the media: ""I think the media have been harder on Trump than any other president certainly that I've known about. I think they feel free to claim that Trump is mentally deranged and everything else without hesitation.""Comey is making millions, but his reputation is now in tatters.

26,ABC,"Liberal journalists have spilled a whole lot of ink in the Trump era, boasting how they've suffered watching a week or so of Fox News programming to explore the strange informational terrain of the Trump voter. They pompously proclaim it's television for your crazy Uncle Frank, pushing conspiracy theories for dumb people while nurturing resentment toward the elites — meaning, of course, them.That nasty cartoon is rebutted by the new Fox News program ""Life Liberty & Levin,"" hosted by Mark Levin. It is more intellectual than anything produced on ABC, NBC, CBS, CNN or MSNBC. Nothing they have on air comes even close.For an hour, at 10 p.m. Eastern on Sunday nights, Levin interviews one guest — remember that? — drilling deep to explore how the guest has worked to protect and preserve the principles of freedom. It's substance over sizzle. It serves to enlighten, not to entertain. It is serious programming, so the liberal critics have demeaned it as a ""glacial slog.""It takes a nanosecond for Levin to go further than today's typically superficial television interview. He begins by reviewing his guest's biography, and viewers may learn a tidbit that immediately puts the guest's career in its proper perspective.Sen. Mike Lee, for example, is the son of former Solicitor General Rex Lee, and he gained his interest in politics by watching his father work in court.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseWhen interviewing Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Levin told viewers that they graduated from the same high school in the Philadelphia area (at a different time), and that Netanyahu spent a year after college working at the same consulting firm as former Gov. Mitt Romney. With just those two introductory nuggets, Levin has transcended the claptrap one hears from the elites at CNN or MSNBC.The series began with an interview of economics professor and columnist Walter Williams, a true icon in his field who we believe, like Thomas Sowell, has been insulted throughout his career (he's too much of a gentleman to say so himself) by so often being typecast by the media as an expert ""black economist,"" as if that were a notable or limiting descriptor (take your pick). You doubt us? Google that term and you'll find his name. Google ""economists"" and you'll find a list of the top 54 economists, and he's not on it.Levin put him front and center, where he belongs. Here's a question and an answer you'll never find on the other networks: Levin asked, ""Do you think liberty has the seeds of its own demise?"" Williams responded by explaining how tyrants always welcome freedom of speech to get their foot in the door only to undermine others' freedom of speech.The episode might remind older viewers of Milton Friedman interviews back in the '80s on his PBS series ""Free to Choose."" It will remind you of absolutely nothing on television today.How about Levin digging into matters like the meaning of the words in the Declaration of Independence, of natural law and inalienable rights, with Hillsdale College President Dr. Larry Arnn?They discussed how progressives undermine America's founding principles, and Dr. Arnn expertly put matters in proper perspective: ""(T) he first thing that happens is ... they start writing about this Declaration of Independence — 'It was really good for the time but not relevant anymore.' ... and that won't work, by the way, because if the Declaration is false now, it was false then by its own terms, right?""Liberals also peg Fox News as toeing the Trump line 24/7. That's certainly not true of Levin. In the last few weeks, he and several of his guests have brutally pounded on the Republican leadership for passing a 2,200-plus-page monstrosity of an omnibus spending bill, and passing it with absolutely no time for members of Congress to actually read it first (never mind debate it).One of those guests is former Attorney General Ed Meese, Levin's old boss in the years of President Reagan. On the other hand, Meese also deemed President Trump's judicial appointments ""outstanding,"" praising Trump for selecting judges that adhere to the Constitution, and consulting The Federalist Society and The Heritage Foundation. It's the kind of discussion those dumb conservatives want to hear and those elites don't want dumb conservatives to hear.Millions of Americans have enjoyed Levin's books on liberty and tyranny, and now it's possible to get some of that wisdom every Sunday on cable TV. All credit should go to Fox News for daring to put a calm hour of serious talk about political philosophy on the air.YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:Facebook Still Hasn't Owned Up To One Huge Privacy BreachThe Gender Pay Gap Is Nothing Compared With These Other Workplace GapsBy Handing Out Driver's Licenses, Far-Left California Invites Illegals To Stay — And Taxpayers To Pay

Momo stock soared.Salesforce.com (CRM) reported Q1 earnings and revenue that topped expectations and increased its full-year 2019 revenue outlook by $400 million to a range of $13.075 billion to $13.125 billion. About $300 million of the hike comes from its recent MuleSoft acquisition, which will be dilutive to margins and cash flows.

The company has stepped up marketing for next-generation mobile payment devices it sells to small merchants.Box (BOX) stock fell as guidance disappointed, though Q1 profit and revenue edged past analyst estimates as large deal momentum continued for the online data storage and file-sharing service provider.Crispr Therapeutics (CRSP) tumbled Thursday after the Food and Drug Administration placed a clinical hold on its application to begin in-human studies of gene-editing drug, CTX001. CTX001 is being developed under a collaboration with Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) to treat sickle cell disease.Alibaba (BABA) is investing $1.38 billion in ZTO Express (ZTO) to bolster delivery and logistical capabilities. Shares of the express delivery company surged to a record high of 21.70.Universal Display (OLED) stock jumped nearly 18% on a news report that Apple (AAPL) might switch to all OLED displays for next year's new iPhones. But the gains quickly evaporated as analysts poured cold water on the speculation.Analog Devices (ADI) stock surged into the buy zone after the chipmaker beat its fiscal second-quarter targets and guided higher for the current quarter thanks to strong industrial and communications chip sales.MedMen, a large U.S. marijuana producer and retailer, began trading on the Canadian Securities Exchange on Tuesday, making it the latest big pot producer in either country to go public. A $100 million private placement gave MedMen an implied valuation of $1.65 billion.Ulta Beauty (ULTA) reported a 32% EPS jump and a 17% gain to $1.543 billion revenue, both above estimates. Same-store sales rose 8.1%. But the beauty products chain sees Q2 EPS of $2.35-$2.40, below forecasts for $2.50, and sees same-store sales slowing.Marvell Technology (MRVL) edged above Wall Street's targets for its fiscal first quarter, but offered mixed guidance for the current quarter. The company credited momentum from the Internet of Things, data center and mobile markets for its Q1 beat.

29,ABC,"Over Memorial Day weekend, NBC's Chuck Todd opened his show ""Meet the Press"" by angrily lecturing his viewers about a so-called Trump ""tactical playbook"" on how to spin the Robert Mueller probe and the FBI informant in his presidential campaign.Here's Todd's list of Trump tactics, with our commentary:1. ""Perhaps fearing that Mueller is closing in, the president is applying a well-worn tactical playbook. Number one, distract with an invented crisis that attacks the investigators without evidence to plant a seed of doubt.""Let's pick at two phrases here. Many of Trump's supporters and more than a few independents would tell Todd that ""distract with an invented crisis ... without evidence"" is a better description of ABC, CBS and his own NBC offering about 1,500 minutes of evening-news hype about Russian ""collusion"" that still hasn't surfaced.Let that sink in: a full 25 hours of coverage about nothing much to date.In contrast, what is ""invented"" about the FBI confidential informant? You can spin about how he was really ""spying on the Russians,"" but was The New York Times making up Stefan Halper?Instead of actually reporting on Halper and his attempts to ""inform"" on Trump aides, they would rather just call it a ""distraction"" and, therefore, somehow a lie.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of Use2. ""Brand the crisis. According to The Associated Press, Mr. Trump wants to brand the FBI's confidential informant a spy, believing the more nefarious term would resonate more in the media and with the public. The president used some version of the word 'spy' 24 times in 15 tweets over 10 days.""Earth to NBC: Calling Trump's current standing a ""crisis,"" even as his polls are actually improving, is ... branding. Is Todd saying NBC would never dream of using ""nefarious"" terms that ""resonate ... with the public""? Here's Todd lead off in his May 22 MSNBC show: ""Fatal distraction! Are the president's systemic attacks on the Justice Department undermining the rule of law as we know it?"" ""Fatal""? Who died, Chuck? It sounds like he's writing Democrat direct-mail copy for his wife's company, Maverick Mail & Strategies.The media also use branding in a positive way. For example, immigrants who live in the country illegally and arrived to America as minors are typically framed as ""Dreamers,"" and with no ""so-called"" warning necessary.3. ""If accused of wrongdoing, use the 'I'm rubber, you're glue' defense, pinning anything you're accused of on your opponents.""This is especially obnoxious coming from journalists whose first rebuttal is often ""You can't call us biased! You are biased!"" We wonder if Todd slept through the Clinton years. When the then-President Bill Clinton's 1996 re-election campaign took donations from Chinese communists and Indonesian businessmen, ""everybody does it"" became the dominant media spin.4. ""If still caught with irrefutable facts closing in, assert that all facts are relative anyway.""President Trump's lawyer Rudy Giuliani is worried about Trump walking into a perjury trap. He told the Washington Post ""truth is relative"" and the Mueller team ""may have a different version of the truth."" At least those are the quotes the Post used.When the irrefutable facts of Clinton's lying about having a sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky were closing in, it was NBC's Matt Lauer who enabled Hillary Clinton to distract the country with warnings of ""a vast right-wing conspiracy."" Lauer even suggested this Lewinsky scandal could be ""the worst and most damaging smear of the 20th century.""The liberal media have no right to lecture about ""distractions"" and ""branding"" and treating facts as relative. These are all well-worn moves in their own ""tactical playbook.""Other columns by L. Brent Bozell and Tim Graham.

30,ABC,"Trump Derangement Syndrome: Over the long weekend, President Trump's critics were in a sputtering rage over his supposedly losing 1,500 illegal immigrant children, sticking them in cages, and putting others on specially equipped prison buses. Turns out, it was all 100% bogus.On Sunday, photos of children laying inside a chain-link fence cage starting flying around the internet. New York Times Magazine editor-in-chief Jake Silverstein forwarded it to his followers, saying that ""all of these photos are disturbing, but the first two are especially awful.""CNN's Hadas Gold described the pictures as ""First Photos of separated migrant children at holding facility.""Outrage quickly followed.""This is happening right now,"" said former Obama speechwriter Jon Favreau. ""Speechless. This is not who we are as a nation,"" said Antonio Villaraigosa, who is running for California governor. Actress Rosanna Arquette called it a ""sick crime against Humanity""Turns out the photos were taken in 2014 — when, ahem, President Obama was in the White House, a fact that nobody bothered to check before blowing a gasket. Once word of that fact got out, many of these same people deleted their tweets, rather than admit that the ""sick crime"" happened under their beloved Obama.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseNext, there was a picture showing a bus outfitted with child safety seats being used at an ICE family detention center in Karnes County, Texas. ABC Houston reporter Antonio Arellano tweeted the picture on Sunday, describing it as ""a prison bus just for babies.""Again, outrage ensued.""Unconscionable and inhumane, ""said Texas Sen. Sylvia Garcia. ""This is what we've come to under Donald Trump,"" said Stephen King. Others tweeted: ""your new gestapo at work,"" ""this is what fascism looks like,"" ""we live in a dark period of American history,"" ""moral abomination."" Etc., etc.Oops. Turns out this picture, too, was taken when Obama was president. And, the bus was actually used to take the children on field trips to places like the San Antonio Zoo, a nearby park, the movies, as well as for medical treatment and court appointments.So much for the Trump-era inhumane prison bus for babies.Finally, there was the story flying around over the weekend about how the Trump administration had ""lost"" almost 1,500 illegal immigrant children who'd been ""ripped"" from their parents after crossing the border.That sparked yet out another round of hair-pulling outrage.""What is more shameful than forcibly separating, in America, parents from infant children at the border? And then, losing track of those children?"" Preet Bhara, former U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, tweeted.Texas Rep. Joaquin Castro said that ""when I think about the 1500 lost children … I come back to the same thought: If we can't stop this in America we can't stop it anywhere.""Turns out the children hadn't been ""forcibly"" taken away from their parents, and they weren't lost, either.As the New York Times explained on Monday, these children didn't come across the southwest border with their parents, they came across illegally on their own. As the Times explains, the children in question are part of the government's long-standing relocation program for ""unaccompanied alien children,"" in which the children get released to sponsor families.Back in 2008, the inspector general for the Health and Human Services department noted that HHS and Homeland Security weren't regularly checking in on these children to make sure they were doing OK with their sponsor families. So, HHS started following up with the sponsors 30 days after the children's release.But, as the IG noted in a follow-up July 2017 report, HHS doesn't always succeed in its attempts to reach the sponsors. It reported that in the first half of 2016, HHS couldn't reach 16% of the 25,975 children placed with sponsors during those months.In other words, under President Obama, the government ""lost"" 4,156 illegal immigrant children in just the first six months of 2016!Anyone recall anyone complaining about the inhumanity of this when it was happening under Obama? Of course not.Trump's critics are increasingly behaving like reckless, irresponsible, childish, hate-filled, divisive, uninformed scaremongers who will believe anything that makes Trump look bad. In other words, they are showing themselves to be everything they accuse Trump of being.Bad News For Dems: Household Income Hits All-Time High Under Trump … And He's Getting Credit For ItDemocrats Blast Trump For High Gas Prices … After They Spent Years Trying To Force Them UpDemocrats' Turn To Socialism Is Ominous Sign For The Party — And For The Country

32,ABC,"Scandalous Media Bias: There have been two major ongoing investigations involving President Trump. One is looking into whether Trump colluded with Russia. It's borne no fruit. The other involves abuse of power at the highest levels of government to hurt Trump and is producing damning evidence by the bushel. Guess which one the press is ignoring?National Review reporter John Fund relates an interesting story. He was waiting to go on the air and struck up a conversation with another prominent reporter in the network's green room.Why, he asked, aren't reporters actively investigating the suspicious activities at the Justice Department and the FBI regarding the Trump/Russia and Hillary/email investigations?Fund says the reporter ""bluntly told me 'There's only room for one narrative on all this. And it's all about Trump.' ""You might think that reporters are chasing facts wherever they might lead, and ""speaking truth to power,"" especially when that power involves the CIA, FBI and Justice Department.Instead, it's all about the ""narrative.""And when it comes to the Russia story, the only narrative the press will consider is that Trump somehow colluded with Russia to steal the election from Hillary Clinton. Or if not that, he did something illegal or improper that Special Counsel Robert Mueller will ferret out.Anything that doesn't fit this narrative gets dismissed as conspiracy talk, fueled by conservatives and Trump supporters, to distract attention from the ""real"" story.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseHere's how Vox.com — a site putatively devoted to ""explaining"" the news — put it:""Trump and his allies, most notably House Intelligence Committee Chair Devin Nunes as well as major conservative media outlets, have long sought to create a counternarrative to the Russia scandal.""But even Vox's attempt to dismiss this ""counternarrative"" shows why it's very real and troubling. As it says, the threads involve ""criticism of the FBI's use of the Steele dossier, a focus on text messages exchanged between two key FBI officials, and the Nunes memo's argument that Carter Page was a victim of 'FISA abuse.' "" Vox doesn't bother to mention the Clinton email scandal.While Mueller has turned up no evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia, this ""counternarrative"" has led to: former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe fired for lying to investigators; Peter Strzok and Lisa Page booted off Mueller's team for virulently anti-Trump texts; Deputy Assistant AG Bruce Ohr demoted after contacts with a Trump oppo-research firm came to light; the quitting of former Deputy Assistant AG David Laufman, who played a key role in both the Russia and Clinton email investigations; and FBI general counsel James Baker reassigned after evidence emerged that he'd been in contact with leftist reporter David Corn.In other words, while the Mueller investigation sputters along, the evidence of political abuse at the FBI and Justice is piling up.This ""counternarrative"" also has uncovered the fact that the FBI had a spy in the Trump campaign, and that the FBI has not been entirely forthcoming about how the Trump investigation got started, or when.Alan Dershowitz — by no means a Trump ally — said over the weekend that the revelation that the FBI had an informant in the Trump campaign is ""worth investigation."" (To which ABC News' George Stephanopoulos responded: ""It sounds like you're in league with President Trump on impeaching the credibility at this point of the special counsel."")It's also worth pointing out that while Trump officials have been, by most accounts, reasonably forthcoming with the Mueller investigation, congressional inquiries into the FBI's handling of the Clinton email and Russia probes have been, and still are being, met with stonewalling by government officials.Even some Democrats are starting to notice that the ""counternarrative"" deserves more attention that it's getting.""The full origins of the (Trump/Russia) investigation and its lack of any real intelligence needs to come out in the open,"" wrote former Clinton administration pollster Mark Penn in an op-ed — titled ""Stopping Robert Mueller to protect us all"" — published by The Hill on Monday.Yet the press still shows only grudging interest, at best, in any of this because it doesn't fit their anti-Trump narrative.It reminds us of the story about the cub reporter who is sent to cover a routine meeting of the local town council. The reporter later returns to the newsroom without a story. When the editor asks why there's no story, the reporter responds: ""I couldn't get to the government building because a massive train wreck blocked the street.""A good reporter, or at least one who isn't hopelessly biased, would be able to see that the real story isn't the go-nowhere Mueller investigation, but the more troubling story of abuse of power by Obama administration officials to protect Hillary Clinton and then derail the Trump presidency. YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:Spying On Trump: Was Obama Behind CIA, FBI Plan To Elect Hillary?FBI Scandal: Deep State Corruption Of FBI, Justice Was There From Very Start Of Hillary Email ProbeMueller's Leak: Deep State Doubles Down On Collusion With DemocratsComey's Memos Reveal How He Repeatedly Lied To Trump

He hiked his price target to 96 from 90.In North America, where peers like Nike (NKE) have been struggling to show positive comparable growth, Lululemon's same-store sales and store traffic rose in low single digits year over year.

And comparable sales of men's bottoms rose 21% in Q4, driving double-digit comps in the men's category as a whole.Cowen's Chen says that momentum has only accelerated into the current quarter, and the additional ABC silhouettes and color offerings will drive consumer loyalty among men.Still, not everyone's keen on investing in Lululemon right now. Jefferies' Randal Konik praised the company's fundamentals, notably its ""leadership position in women's athleisure and growing share in men's, and solid omnichannel model,"" but is shying away from the high valuation, citing a smaller opportunity for near-term earnings upside.The slowing athleisure market, in addition to valuation, is also sidelining B.

40,ABC,"Bias: You might think that national news outlets would be extra careful not to sensationalize or distort what's happening in Gaza and the West Bank in response to the U.S. moving its embassy to Jerusalem, Israel's capital. But if you did, you would be incredibly naive.The mainstream media went out of their way to portray the U.S. embassy move to Jerusalem as an incitement to violence by Palestinian ""demonstrators.""Headlines often give away the underlying bias. Typical was one from the New York Times: ""Israel Kills Dozens at Gaza Border as U.S. Embassy Opens in Jerusalem.""Get the linkage? It's all our fault — and the Israelis'.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseABC News' reporting went out under this title: ""Over 50 Palestinians in massive protest are killed by Israeli military, bloodiest day in Gaza since 2014 war.""The BBC, Britain's taxpayer-funded fountain of left-wing news, ran this succinct topper: ""Jerusalem embassy: Why Trump's move was not about peace.""But that wasn't all. The Beeb's piece weirdly sank into a vile anti-Semitic and anti-Christian tirade, blaming Trump's decision to relocate the embassy on, among others, ""right-wing American Jews whose message was amplified by the conservative Orthodox Jews dominating Mr. Trump's inner circle"" and ""evangelicals whose voice was amplified by the devout Christian in the White House, Vice President Mike Pence.""The Huffington Post effort, to its credit labeled ""Opinion,"" ran with a similar theme: ""Trump's Jerusalem Embassy Ceremony Was One Big Dog Whistle.""A dog whistle, for what, you ask? Just like the BBC, the HuffPost blames Christianity and Judaism, of course.By far the worst bias, however, was in the New York Daily News. It ran a front page picture of Ivanka Trump attending the U.S. embassy opening, contrasted with a picture of the violence in Gaza with the headline: ""Daddy's Little Ghoul.""Report after report in the Western press credulously cited ""Palestinian authorities"" for the number of dead and injured in the violence that took place in Gaza and the West Bank. At last count, some 60 people, among them ""eight children,"" were reported dead.CNN reported that ""among the dead were eight children, including 8-month-old Laila Anwar Ghandour.""Heartbreaking if true, but as AP reports: ""Gaza health officials are casting doubt on initial claims that a 9-month-old baby died from Israeli tear gas fired during mass protests on the Gaza border with Israel. A medical doctor said Tuesday that the baby, Layla Ghandour, had a pre-existing medical condition and that he did not believe her death was caused by tear gas.""Nonetheless, the reports were pretty much all in line, suggesting that peaceful protesters were fired on by bloodthirsty Israeli troops.""The deaths and injuries to over 2,400 people came mostly from gunfire by Israeli forces as Palestinians amassed at the border in far greater numbers than in other recent demonstrations,"" ABC News reported, in what was a fairly typical report.But who were those ""authorities"" who gave them the casualty figures? Of course, the Health Ministry, cited by many news outlets. But it's controlled by the terrorist group Hamas, and Hamas has a long and well-documented history of lying about, well, all sorts of things, including casualties. Why believe them now?In its piece, the Washington Post painted a picture of ""tens of thousands of Palestinians,"" of which ""many came to peacefully demonstrate, bringing their children and carrying flags. Food stalls sold snacks and music blared.""Just another day in the park peacefully demonstrating, right? No bias there.Not exactly. As the Media Research Center points out, the very same Post piece lower in the story only reluctantly provides the real truth: The demonstrations, which by the way have been ongoing since March 30, ""appeared to have a more violent edge.""""At a gathering point east of Gaza City, organizers urged protesters over loudspeakers to burst through the fence, telling them Israeli soldiers were fleeing their positions, even as they were reinforcing them,"" the Post said.In fact, many of those engaged in ""demonstrating"" or ""protesting"" were armed with grenades, pipe bombs, knives and guns, and were intent on breaching the security fence to kill as many Israelis as possible. They also flew kites with firebombs attached over the fence to start fires in tinder-dry Israel. As the Post itself reported, their own leaders urged them on to a suicidal clash with armed and trained IDF troops.And by the way, the Israeli military dropped thousands of leaflets on border areas, warning Palestinians against attacking the border fence. They did it anyway.Even so, the media's overwhelming narrative is that the Palestinians are somehow passive and helpless against a brutal Israeli occupying force. In fact, they instigated the violence, not the Israelis or the U.S. And the Palestinian leaders achieved what they wanted: martyrs for their lost cause.Taking them at their word, they encouraged 60 people to become ""shaheeds,"" or martyrs, for nothing more than short-term leverage in their cause of creating a new Palestinian state. They got the response they wanted: The media played along by contrasting the celebrations marking the opening of the U.S. Embassy with the violence on the border, and by implying it was Israeli bloodthirstiness to blame.""The Palestinian strategy paid off once again, of course,"" wrote Matt Philbin at Newsbusters. ""The U.N. and Human Rights Watch condemned Israel for using 'excessive force.' Noted human rights stalwarts Turkey and South Africa recalled their ambassadors to Israel."" Not to be left out, the EU joined the blaming of Israel: ""Israel must respect the right of peaceful protest in Gaza.""The media have a lot to answer for in their bias and misreporting and distortion of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Let's just leave it at this: By not telling the truth, the media have contributed to the pain and misery of Palestinians, who will never have a homeland unless they recognize Israel's right to exist and to live within secure, defensible borders.YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:Trump Keeps Big Promise To Israel — Next Up, Peace In Mideast?Another Trump Promise Kept: Recognizing Jerusalem As Israel's CapitalCutting Off UNESCO: Nice Start, Now How About The Rest Of The Israel-Hating U.N.?Click here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

41,ABC,"Biotech stocks and pharmaceutical companies added to recent market gains Monday after Trump's top health aide delivered a speech that largely spared them the brunt of drug-pricing reform.Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar delivered his speech on drug-pricing reform Monday. Like Trump, his speech was light on its impact for biotech companies and pharmaceutical companies. Instead, the White House is considering changes to Medicare and caps on out-of-pocket spending.Most proposals will impact so-called middlemen including pharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs and drug distributors. They include the likes of Express Scripts (ESRX), CVS (CVS) and AmerisourceBergen (ABC). But Azar was critical of pharmaceutical companies' high list prices and a lack of transparency in direct-to-consumer advertising.""We look forward to working with industry to build a better system,"" he said. ""But if industry isn't willing to work with us to lower prices, President Trump and his administration will keep turning up the pressure — until the system finally puts American patients first.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseShares of pharmaceutical companies had rallied but ultimately slipped marginally at the close while biotech company stocks gained 1.2% on the stock market today following the speech. The Nasdaq Biotechnology (NBI) was flat while the iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology (IBB) index rose 1%.Among the proposals, RBC analysts see changes to Medicare Part B and Part D as having the biggest impact on biotech stocks. Still, they wrote in a note to clients even that will still be ""relatively benign overall.""Part B covers physician-administered drugs whereas Part D covers prescription drugs. Under the proposal, negotiation from some Part B drugs would be more similar to Part D negotiation. More broadly, the president is calling for Part B to merge into Part D, Azar said.""Inflation-capped price increases in Part B is likely most impactful proposal in biotech, as well as out-of-pocket transparency for Part B vs. Part D drugs (infusions vs. self-injectables) and unifying Part B billing codes,"" RBC analysts said.Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) has the largest exposure among large-cap biotechs to Part B through its eye disease drug called Eylea. Celgene (CELG), Biogen (BIIB) and Amgen (AMGN) also are exposed. Further, Sage Therapeutics (SAGE), Alder Biopharmaceuticals (ALDR) and Dynavax (DVAX) face difficulties.Azar also suggested changes to how PBMs issue and negotiate rebates. He proposed an end so-called ""gag clauses"" on pharmacists. These prevent pharmacists from telling consumers when they'd actually save money by paying out of pocket for their medicines.""Right now, we're asking a pretty straightforward question: What if, instead of the current system where drug companies get paid rebates and middlemen take a cut, we just had fixed-price discounts?"" Azar said. ""This would fix the situation where even the pharmacy benefit manager, who is hired to help keep prices low, makes money from higher list prices.""He also suggested pharmaceutical companies include their list prices in advertising that goes out directly to consumers. Further, Azar said he and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services are developing incentives to lower list prices.But most of these changes are long-term ""further actions,"" Raymond James analyst Michael Baker said in a note. Changes to Part D contracts that prevent pharmacists from explaining when out-of-pocket costs are cheaper ""will likely not have a meaningful impact.""RELATED:Biotech Stocks Fly As Trump Speech Seen As 'More Bark Than Bite'Much Money Do You Need To Start Investing?Long-Term Retirement Investing Strategies With ETFsShould You Buy A Stock Ahead Of Its Earnings Report?

42,ABC,"The television networks have flooded us with hours and hours of coverage of the Robert Mueller probe as they continue to look under every rock for some sign of Russian collusion with the Trump campaign. But on May 4, a federal judge harshly blasted Mueller's tactics in court, even going as far as challenging the scope of his authority in this probe.Was this a big story for our objective press? Did they insist on giving us a dispassionate examination of the facts? No. NBC and CBS gave it 30 seconds of airtime combined. ABC devoted two minutes to it, and that was that.A new Media Research Center study shows that in the first four months of 2018, these three networks have aired 321 minutes of evening-news coverage of the Russia investigation, and the tone toward President Trump was 98% negative. When you're this close to being perfectly negative, why wreck the trend?At least the Washington Post put the judge's bombshell rebuke on the front page Saturday. The New York Times buried it on the bottom of page A13, below other Trump-scandal stories.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseOn the taxpayer-subsidized airwaves, ""PBS NewsHour"" offered nothing. NPR asked a reporter one question at the end of a segment on Saturday morning's ""Weekend Edition."" This is a story that broke on Friday, but it didn't make either network's regular ""week in review"" panel.This was a test for the Mueller-obsessed media — and they flunked. They are thoroughly invested in how Mueller's team could help them damage, or even end, the Trump presidency. They have zero interest in undermining their white knight. Apparently, they're not alone.""You don't really care about Mr. Manafort's bank fraud,"" federal judge T.S. Ellis III scolded Mueller's team during a court hearing in Alexandria, Virginia. ""You really care about getting information Mr. Manafort can give you that would reflect on Mr. Trump and lead to his prosecution or impeachment or whatever.""He added: ""I don't see what relation this indictment has with anything the special counsel is authorized to investigate. ... What we don't want in this country is we don't want anyone with unfettered power.""It can't get much tougher than that.Mueller would appear to have unfettered power over the networks, too. While they have used the Russia investigation to bury Trump in negative evaluations, they haven't shown any interest in transparency for Mueller and his supervisor, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. Judge Ellis and House Republicans have demanded that Mueller fully disclose the (heavily redacted) contents of the instructions Rosenstein gave him on the scope of his investigation.On Jan. 3, when Manafort's lawyers challenged Mueller's investigation as being too broad, ABC gave it 51 seconds; NBC gave it 30 seconds; and CBS gave it 13 seconds. Add that up and so far this year, by our count, the networks have devoted roughly four minutes to serious allegations of Mueller's overreach with a team of investigators that clearly believes it has the power to delve into anyone's private life if it will harm the president.That's sure not how these transparently liberal networks treated Kenneth Starr when he threatened Bill Clinton's presidency. Back then, The Center for Media and Public Affairs found that from July through September 1998, Starr's network evening news evaluations were 15% positive and 85% negative. In the same time frame, Clinton received 37% positive coverage — while he was being impeached!Liberals pretend that criticizing or questioning Mueller reeks of obstruction of justice, but the public isn't buying this nonsense. The Media Research Center has documented that from January to April, there was another long stretch of 90% negative Trump coverage on the evening news.

43,ABC,"In the final days before the West Virginia primary, breathless media coverage suggested that businessman Don Blankenship was gaining ground rapidly and had a real shot at winning the Republican Senate nomination.ABC News quoted a ""national Republican operative"" who said it's ""down to the wire"" and it wouldn't be a surprise if the controversial candidate won.All this concern even prompted President Trump to tweet that Blankenship ""can't win the General Election"" and encouraging West Virginia voters to cast their ballots for someone else.But Blankenship didn't win or even come close. Instead, he finished a distant third with just 19% of the vote. It's possible that the presidential tweet turned the tide. But it's even more likely that there wasn't any real Blankenship momentum to unwind.A couple of weeks before the primary, public polls showed Blankenship a distant third, trailing two quality candidates — Attorney General Patrick Morrissey and Congressman Evan Jenkins. A Fox News poll showed Blankenship picking up 16% of the vote, not far from the 19% he actually received on Election Day. It certainly doesn't provide any sense of pro-Blankenship momentum.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe Blankenship-was-surging storyline came from ""internal polling"" leaked to the media. As a general rule, it's wise to be very skeptical of such internal polls and to remember that the leaker has an agenda. But such skepticism was missing in the run-up to primary day as Politico reported that victory was ""within reach"" for Blankenship. Not only that, there were reports of ""finger-pointing"" going on behind the scenes in GOP circles. Some were blaming the White House, some the other West Virginia candidates, and some Mitch McConnell.How did this happen? I suspect the story took off because elite journalists and national Republican political operatives were predisposed to believe it.Blankenship was a horrible candidate. He recently spent time in prison on charges relating to a mining disaster that killed 29 miners. His campaign rallies and comments included racist and hateful commentary. Many in the national media believe that conservative voters are primarily driven by racial resentment, especially in places like West Virginia. So, it made sense to them that a candidate like Blankenship was surging.On top of that, the West Virginia Senate race represents a prime pick-up opportunity for the GOP. Incumbent Democrat Joe Manchin is vulnerable in a state that President Trump won by 42 percentage points. A good candidate could defeat Manchin and help the Republican party retain control of the Senate. Blankenship could not.Sadly, many national Republican political operatives also have a condescending view of their party's voters. They were ready to believe in a Blankenship surge because they feared those voters weren't smart enough to understand what was at stake.When the votes were counted, however, it was the journalists and operatives who looked foolish. Their frenzied speculation in the election's final days were as far off the mark as their discussions about how big the Hillary Clinton landslide victory would be in 2016.Once again, the elites demonstrated how little they understand the American people.Editor's note: Michael Barone is off this week.More Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

45,ABC,"Let's imagine the following statements were part of a public opinion poll. How many people would agree to these assertions?1. ""We're concerned about the troubling trend of irresponsible, one sided news stories plaguing our country. The sharing of biased and false news has become all too common on social media.""2. ""More alarming, some media outlets publish these same fake stories ... stories that just aren't true, without checking facts first.""3. ""Unfortunately, some members of the media use their platforms to push their own personal bias and agenda to control 'exactly what people think.' ... This is extremely dangerous to our democracy.""This is precisely what the left-wing media would say about Fox News. But these statements aren't part of a poll. They are part of a script that Sinclair Broadcast Group sent to its stations across America. In a 60- to 75-second second promo, the local anchors in each market read the script, and the Trump-hating media gave birth to a large cow. Clearly, Fox News wasn't the target. They were.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseSo let's add some more Sinclair copy and wonder why this is offensive to liberals: ""At (name of station), it's our responsibility to pursue and report the truth. We understand truth is neither politically 'left nor right.' Our commitment to factual reporting is the foundation of our credibility, now more than ever. ... But we are human and sometimes our reporting might fall short. If you believe our coverage is unfair please reach out to us ...""The left would certainly embrace factual reporting as ""the foundation of our credibility,"" and yada, yada. What it found offensive is that a new entity not as enlightened as it could profess this belief.What of the second part, about Sinclair inviting criticism from its audience? No wonder the left doesn't like it. Virtually all of them have gotten rid of their ombudsmen. Networks aren't in the habit of offering corrections. Accountability is not their bag.Sinclair has long aired conservative commentary on its local stations, and the liberal media hate that, too. MSNBC's Joe Scarborough shamelessly lectured that it is like the days of Pravda in the Soviet Union: ""A national broadcasting system that is shoving propaganda down local anchors' throats straight from the pen of somebody who's a Trump acolyte,"" he stated hysterically, ""is really, really chilling.""Chilling? This man appears on a national broadcasting system pushing propaganda daily. A network whose motto in former President Obama's years was ""Lean Forward"" (which sounded like former Communist Chairman Mao Zedong's Great Leap Forward) and that passes judgment on propaganda is why networks like Sinclair have emerged.On HBO, John Oliver denounced Sinclair anchors as sounding like ""members of a brainwashed cult."" So, exactly how do anchors of news or entertainment shows across the country deliver their reports? Oliver doesn't have a script? The HBO denunciations of a ""brainwashed cult"" are especially hilarious, since it creates Democratic propaganda films like last year's ""fly-on-the-wall"" documentary ""The Final Year"" on Obama's team of supposed foreign-policy geniuses.Now, remember that most of these Sinclair stations are affiliates of ABC, CBS and NBC. So liberals object to a 60-second promo — but see nothing wrong with ""60 Minutes"" promoting Trump's alleged porn-star lover or the forthcoming prime-time George Stephanopoulos interview hour with former FBI Director James Comey on these very same stations. One-sided news is the best kind of news for most of the broadcast day ... as long as your ""news"" skews to the left.YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:If Finland Is The 'Happiest Country In The World,' Why Is Everyone Coming Here?Trump Dismantles Another Obama 'Achievement' — Just One More To GoDid Facebook Break The Law To Help Obama Win In 2012?

46,ABC,"NBC News star Chuck Todd recently made a lectern-pounding speech to attendees of a journalism awards dinner. He proclaimed: ""One thing we're not is the opposition. We've never tried to be a part of the political debate, but people want to drag us into it. We shouldn't take the bait. We're simply a voice of truth.""So, let's consider the case of Andrew McCabe, former deputy director of the FBI.The FBI Office of Professional Responsibility recommended that McCabe be fired for lying, or, to be gentle, a ""lack of candor"" — even under oath — in the Justice Department inspector general's investigation of the Hillary Clinton email probe. The inspector general is a career department official. The head of the OPR was appointed in 2002 ... by then-FBI Director Robert Mueller.So when Attorney General Jeff Sessions sacked McCabe, the ""voice of truth"" media were pleased, right? Well, actually, no. They were so upset by the president's victory-lap tweets that they fast-forwarded past the facts about McCabe's lies.The ABC and NBC morning shows skipped the part about McCabe's ""lack of candor."" They went straight to McCabe's self-defense about being a target of partisans (despite his wife having run for office as a Democrat), not to the honesty problem for career government officials. ABC's Cecilia Vega reported, ""McCabe says he was let go as ' ... part of this administration's ongoing war on the FBI and the efforts of the special counsel investigation ...""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseTodd, who claimed he didn't want to be dragged into the political debate, enthusiastically made a guess, saying, ""I think it signals this president is no longer cooperating with Mueller. It's time for war.""The timing of McCabe's sacking looked harsh, since we were routinely told that he had just a few days left to qualify for his FBI pension. So, Todd's NBC colleague Andrea Mitchell even went to Twitter to beg for McCabe to get a job with a Democrat on Capitol Hill, which is what nonpartisan reporters at NBC are supposed to do: ""One suggestion from a McCabe supporter: if a friendly member of Congress hired him for a week he could possibly qualify for pension benefits by extending his service the extra days."" Former George W. Bush White House press secretary Ari Fleischer deliciously tweeted back: ""Pensions before Honesty. Great slogan.""But it turns out the ""pro-truth"" media missed the boat on that claim. McCabe was nearly eligible for pension benefits after 20 years of service, at the age of 50. Now he can't claim them until age 57. Good luck selling that as a terrible scenario to people who retire at the private sector-accepted age of 65, or whose meager pensions don't allow them to retire — ever.None of these not-the-opposition networks noted that McCabe was getting a sweeter treatment by the legal process than retired Lt. Gen. Mike Flynn, who was forced to plead guilty to lying to the FBI, rather than lying within the FBI. Nobody at the networks protested about a ""war"" on government officials or tweeted out help-the-poor-public-servant messages for Flynn. He deserved every criticism liberals threw his way. CNN mocked Flynn by quoting a tweet about his 24 days as national security adviser: ""I once had a fungal infection that lasted longer than #flynn.""The networks' coverage of Andrew McCabe matches their coverage of everything else in the Trump era. It's not that they look like the Opposition Party. They are the opposition party. Who's telling the truth doesn't matter. Resisting and ruining President Trump is what matters.

47,ABC,"Conservative watchdog organization Media Research Center examined the nightly news coverage of President Donald Trump on ABC, NBC and CBS in January and February and concluded that the stories were 91% negative. One consistent narrative, particularly given the recent firing of Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, is that ""chaos"" reigns in the Trump White House.Never mind that President Barack Obama went through four secretaries of defense and five chiefs of staff. Obama, goes the narrative, calmly navigated the country during his eight-year tenure. Trump, on the other hand, is reckless, dangerous, undisciplined and out of control.Never mind that the U.S. consumers' confidence is at a level not seen since the early 2000s. Forget the increased value in the stock market, and the appreciation in average home value since the beginning of the Trump presidency. ISIS fighters have been killed or surrendered in the thousands. North Korea's Kim Jong Un has agreed to resume talks about ""denuclearization."" The Middle East did not set itself on fire when Trump agreed to move the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. After nearly 14 months, even many Democrats admit they still, after a year of investigations, see no evidence of ""collusion"" between Russia and the Trump campaign.But things just look ... chaotic.President ""No-Drama Obama"" did indeed successfully push ObamaCare through Congress and signed it into law.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseWhen the House Democrats first revealed what eventually became ObamaCare, the Wall Street Journal called it ""the worst bill ever."" The Journal wrote: ""With spending and debt already at record peacetime levels, the bill creates a new and probably unrepealable middle-class entitlement that is designed to expand over time. Taxes will need to rise precipitously, even as ObamaCare so dramatically expands government control of health care that eventually all medicine will be rationed via politics.""The law did not, as Obama routinely promised, save every family $2,500 a year. ObamaCare did not, as the president insisted, ""bend the cost curve"" down. PolitiFact gave Obama their 2013 ""Lie of the Year"" award for telling the American people, ""If you like your health care plan, you can keep it,"" a guarantee that Obama made even when he knew it was not true.As commander in chief, the no-drama president signed the Iran deal that critics argue puts the world's No. 1 sponsor of terror on a path toward getting a nuclear bomb. Obama's first secretary of defense, Robert Gates, said Obama based the deal on a ""hope that over a 10-year period with the sanctions being lifted that ... they will abandon their ideology, their theology, their revolutionary principles, their meddling in various parts of the region."" Gates called this hope ""unrealistic.""Obama, over the objection of his entire national security team, pulled out all the troops from Iraq. Retired Army Gen. Ray Odierno, a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, later said he believed ISIS could have been dealt with had we left a stay-behind force.On the economy, Obama signed a $787 billion so-called stimulus package, averaged $100 billion in new regulations every single year of his presidency, and promoted the silly, wasteful ""cash for clunkers"" and the equally silly and wasteful ""cash for caulkers.""Obama defenders argue that the recession Obama dealt with was particularly severe. Yet historically, the deeper the recession, the higher the bounce back. Not so under Obama. The recession President Ronald Reagan dealt with was worse, at least by the metrics the Democrats and the media once used until those very metrics made Democrats look bad.Unemployment, for example, under Obama reached 10%. Under Reagan, it reached 10.8%. Inflation was 3.8% the year before Obama took office, but dropped to 1.3% his last year. Under Reagan, it was 13.5% the year before he took office, but dropped to 4.1% his last year. Prime interest rates under Obama, again, were 3.25% when he entered office, and remained low at 3.75% when he left. Under Reagan, prime interest rates climbed as high as 20.5% and dipped as low as 7.5%.It was a Democrat, Jimmy Carter, who, in running against President Gerald Ford in 1976, use the ""misery index."" It was simple. Just add up unemployment, plus inflation. The bigger the number, the worse the economy. Carter pointed out that under Ford, the misery index had gone up. Unfortunately for Carter, when he ran for re-election in 1980, Reagan pointed out that the misery index under Carter had grown even larger. Under Obama, at its worst point, the misery index reached 12.97 in 2011. During Reagan's administration, the misery index was at its worst point when he entered office, at 19.33.Obama, who supposedly governed without drama, delivered the worst recovery since 1949. On the economy and on foreign policy, he signed costly legislation and pushed counterproductive policies.

48,ABC,"Cigna (CI) just made a bid to join an elite group of health care industry titans with its $67 billion deal to buy drug-benefit manager Express Scripts (ESRX).X Yet the takeover, which includes $15 billion in assumed debt, comes as something of a shock because Express Scripts and pharmacy benefit managers, in general, have been under fire and unloved on Wall Street. To some extent, Cigna may be jumping into the frying pan.Cigna will pay $48.75 plus 0.2434 share for each Express Scripts share. At Wednesday's close that was equal to 96.03, a 31% premium for Express Scripts.Wall Street's initial reaction to the deal was skeptical. Shares of Cigna closed down 11% at 172.00 on the stock market today. Meanwhile, Express Scripts jumped 8.6% to 79.72. Among competitors, UnitedHealth (UNH) dipped 0.8%, CVS Health rose 1.3%, while Humana (HUM) lost 1.4%.Cigna sees the combination as giving it the scale and skill sets to deliver value to customers, hold down health costs and compete in a world in which its competitors like UnitedHealth and CVS, after it completes its merger with Aetna, own an increasingly formidable array of health care assets.Cigna told analysts on Thursday that the deal would immediately add to earnings and provide a significant boost in the intermediate term. The company raised its EPS target for 2021 to $20-$21 per share from $18.Yet some industry analysts worry that Amazon.com (AMZN) will disrupt the prescription industry. Amazon has flirted with entering the retail drug business and just launched a venture with JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) aimed at lowering health care costs. Washington has amped up the rhetoric on the lack of transparency in drug pricing, and PBMs are seen as a prime suspect. To top it off, Express Scripts had a falling out with Anthem (ANTM), its biggest customer, which accused it of not passing along drug manufacturers' rebates.Use IBD's MarketSmith For Free Until March 11

UnitedHealth acquired Catamaran, another PBM, in 2015.UnitedHealth this week announced that its OptumRx PBM would directly provide drug rebates to some 7 million insured members through employer plans, an apparent response to pressure on the industry from customers and politicians.Industry players have increasingly seen the stand-alone PBM model, meaning a pharmacy benefit manager that is not owned directly by a major insurer, as being under threat. Anthem is setting up its own in-house PBM while temporarily contracting with CVS.Some analysts had speculated in recent months that Amazon might bid for Express Scripts to ease its entry into the highly regulated and complex prescription industry. Yet the Cigna deal suggests that Amazon wasn't interested — at least not at anything close to the price that Cigna was willing to pay.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:These Three Dow Jones Stocks Are Near Buy Points As 2 FANGs Make Bullish MoveCVS: 'We're Going To Deliver' What Amazon, JPMorgan, Berkshire Seek To DoAmazon Health Care Disruption Fears Clash With This RealityThe Big Picture: This Is The Real News For InvestorsHere Are 10 Chip Stocks Breaking Out, Hitting New Highs Or Setting UpWhat Do Facebook, Grubhub, Salesforce And Epam Have In Common?

50,ABC,"When Bill Clinton was president, the liberal media establishment flogged itself for focusing on scandal over substance. In a four-hour PBS special during the fall election season of 1996, elitist Hedrick Smith confessed: ""By focusing on scandal and conflict over substance, and by our increasingly negative tone, the media has distorted the nation's agenda and lost touch with the public we claim to serve.""XNo one can imagine Smith complaining like this now that Donald Trump lives in the White House. One's a Democrat, the other a Republican. One is a man they genuinely admire, the other a man they genuinely despise.In the years of President Barack Obama, they pretended there were no scandals at all. Obama is still lying about this, having recently proclaimed at a closed-door session in Boston, ""We didn't have a scandal that embarrassed us."" The liberal ""fact-checkers"" like PolitiFact and Glenn Kessler at the Washington Post were napping on Obama, as usual.Fast and Furious? IRS scandal? Benghazi? Nope, doesn't ring a bell.But the Trump presidency is an ongoing and frenetic demonstration of the media choosing ""scandal over substance."" It is virtually all scandal all the time, even when there isn't a lick of evidence.A new Media Research Center study of the evening newscasts on ABC, CBS and NBC during January and February found that 91% of Trump evaluations were negative. Nearly 63% of news coverage was devoted to scandals like the Russia investigation (204 minutes), the allegations of wife beating against White House aide Rob Porter (54 minutes), unproven gossip from Michael Wolff's book about the Trump White House (53 minutes) and reports that Trump used the term ""s---hole countries"" in a discussion on African countries and immigration (31 minutes).Use IBD's MarketSmith For Free Until March 11

Because it's been that, or like that, every single month since the election.The networks obviously believe their nightly narrative should not be diluted by focusing on any matter where Trump might be succeeding. Thus far in 2018, they have barely bothered to evaluate how Trump is doing on the economy and jobs (12 minutes), or the positive impact of the tax cuts passed in December (nine minutes). Guess how much time was spent on Team Trump's war against al-Qaida and ISIS: 83 seconds.Since Trump took office on Jan. 20, 2017, the three evening newscasts have spent a combined 1,438 minutes on the Russia investigation, accounting for more than one out of every five minutes (21%) of ""news"" time on the Trump presidency.And still, there is no evidence of Trump colluding with the government of Russia to get him elected. There is proof that agents paid by Hillary Clinton's campaign met with the Russians to get dirt on Trump. But the Clintons created multiple layers of separation (or deniability), so, apparently, that wasn't scandalous in the slightest.Every study of the media's performance reveals the ""news"" product is hyperbolic, negative and seemingly designed to make the Trump presidency appear perpetually on the verge of collapse. How can any of these journalists be surprised that Trump backers don't trust their narration of the first draft of history as it unfolds?

52,ABC,"AmerisourceBergen (ABC) stock plunged Tuesday amid a report that the drug distributor's talks over a potential takeover by Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) have collapsed. But there's still a strong urge among health care services firms to merge in the face of stiff competition, including an Amazon (AMZN)-led alliance.AmerisourceBergen stock shot up earlier this month on reports that Walgreens CEO Stefano Pessina had met with his Amerisource counterpart Steven Collis to discuss a potential acquisition.But discussions have now ended without agreement, though insiders stressed the deal talks could once again resume, according to CNBC. The deal would likely have been valued at more than $25 billion, as Amerisource has a market cap of around $22 billion.AmerisourceBergen stock fell 2.9% to 97.64 on the stock market today, but well off session lows of 93.16 and settling above its 50-day moving average line.Walgreens stock lost 2.1%. The relative strength line, which tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index, is at a five-year low.Walgreens Boots Alliance, America's biggest drugstore chain, already owns 26% of AmerisourceBergen.On Jan. 30 a mooted plan by Amazon, JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) to form a nonprofit company sent CVS Health (CVS), AmerisourceBergen, Walgreens, UnitedHealth Group (UNH) and other big health care companies sharply lower.Last year, Walgreens gave up on an effort to buy all of No. 3 drugstore operator Rite Aid (RAD) due to regulatory objections, instead acquiring less than half of the smaller rival's stores.Grocery giant Albertsons agreed to merge with Rite Aid in a $24 billion deal, acquiring the stores that Walgreens isn't buying. Albertsons, privately held for several years, will go public via this deal.Health care companies see the need for bigger size and scope to rein in costs and compete. CVS last year announced a still-pending $69 billion acquisition of health insurance giant Aetna (AET). CVS Health is the No. 2 drugstore chain and a top pharmacy benefit manager.The CVS-Aetna deal was widely seen as a way to compete with a possible Amazon entry, as well as match up better vs. insurance giant UnitedHealth, which has its own PBM.YOU MAY ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Walgreens-AmerisourceBergen Takeover Talk Follows Sweeping Health Care DealsAmazon, Berkshire Hathaway, JPMorgan Chase Team On Health Care; CVS, UnitedHealth DiveBiotech And Pharma Industry News

The on-screen graphic also pointed out that 56% disapprove.Having established that America disapproves of her GOP president, it seemed fair to continue the narrative by connecting it to the next segment, with anchor Dan Harris and chief anchor George Stephanopoulos. Harris asked Stephanopoulos about his hourlong special that night that touted former FBI Director James Comey's book:""To your eyes, do you, do you see anything in this Comey book and interview that could hurt that approval rating?"" Stephanopoulos said it was ""a scathing personal assessment of President Trump, a scathing assessment of his presidency and what he believes President Trump is doing to the institutions and the rule of law in the country.""But the Washington Post poll also had bad news for Democrats in Congress.That part of the survey was covered ... on page A-4. ""Democrats hold an advantage ahead of the midterm elections, but a Washington Post-ABC News poll shows that edge has narrowed since January, a signal to party leaders and strategists that they could be premature in anticipating a huge wave of victories in November,"" the Post reported. Forty-seven percent of registered voters said they prefer the Democratic candidate in their district, and 43% favor the Republican. ""That four-point margin compares with a 12-point advantage Democrats held in January,"" the Post said.That ""blue wave"" could still happen. This is just one snapshot. But it's interesting that a shrinking advantage for Democrats didn't get a lick of airtime on ABC.

When former FBI Director James Comey's publisher, Macmillan, boasts that it will kill enough trees to print 850,000 copies — when a decent fraction of sales is in e-books and audiobooks — publicity is clearly booming.The ""news"" media are stuffing Comey's pockets with book profits, just as they're drooling over the possibility of a similar boom in their ad revenues. ""Telling all"" about Trump is a proven get-rich-quick scheme.Macmillan already made one mint this year with all the publicity granted to Michael Wolff's tabloidish Trump-bashing mess ""Fire & Fury."" How much better will the publisher do with the former head of the FBI? The national media lined up to provide Comey with publicity, a queue stretching endlessly. It started with ABC, which provided an hourlong prime-time special hosted by George Stephanopoulos.The funniest line in the ABC promos was ""Nothing's off limits."" ABC used to boast the same thing when promoting prime-time Hillary Clinton book specials, which was silly.

This was your original sin?""""Original sin""? What theologian penned this question?Stephanopoulos scolded Comey for having decided he had an obligation to inform Congress he was reopening the Clinton probe 11 days before the election: ""Boy, you seem to be alone in that judgment. You look at previous attorney generals for President Bush, for President Ford, for President Obama, Justice Department officials for President Clinton; they all disagree with you. They say this crossed a line.""Stephanopoulos even said, ""there's no precedent for putting out information like this at the end of a campaign?"" How quickly he forgot that on the last Friday of the 1992 campaign, ""independent counsel"" Lawrence Walsh indicted former Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger in the Iran-Contra scandal and released a pile of former President Reagan's administration memos.Stephanopoulos worked as Bill Clinton's communications director that year. CNN's Larry King interviewed then-President George H.W.

Ratings dipped 5% and 11% in the key demographic for advertisers, a six-year low.Hollywood may finally be getting the message that TV ratings are suffering because the public has grown weary of people turning live events into leftist political rallies.The New York Times reported the Oscars people are worried. ""Whenever stars use the platform to support progressive causes and make political statements, large numbers of viewers turn the channel, according to academy insiders, who cite minute-by-minute Nielsen data for past shows.""Channing Dungey, president of ABC Entertainment, said during their Oscars telecast, the campaign against sexual harassment should be limited to a prescheduled ""moment,"" so viewers don't feel it ""overshadows the artists and the films being honored.""

And the last thing I want to do is ruin that for someone ... by making it unpleasant.""But will Kimmel lash out at Republicans? When ""Good Morning America"" asked if he's been too political recently and ""pushed the envelope too far,"" he shot back ""Not at all. I don't think you can go too far."" So when it came to sexual assault, Kimmel said, ""I'm not going to stop any bad behavior with my jokes."" But ""making it unpleasant"" for people who couldn't vote for Hillary Clinton is apparently a patriotic duty.Awards shows have been unable to avoid political moments, and viewers are tuning out. The audience for the Screen Actors Guild Awards, which began with host Kristen Bell mocking the first lady, plummeted 30% (they were also scheduled against an NFL playoff game). The Grammy Awards — which mocked Donald Trump in a skit featuring celebrities and Hillary Clinton reading passages from Michael Wolff's unsubstantiated trash-for-cash book ""Fire and Fury"" — was off 10 million viewers (24%) for an all-time low.Live events — including sports — are being skipped by people who can't stand the political lectures. NFL ratings, after all the railing against racism, were down nearly 10% this season. NBC's coverage of the Winter Olympics — complete with gay Olympians bashing Vice President Pence — was down 7%, making them the least-watched Olympics on record.Even if ABC tries to rein in the Oscars, Americans know that Kimmel and the Hollywood crowd are likely to trash Trump, Pence and the National Rifle Association.

62,ABC,"Of all the desperate and futile attempts at revisionist history, few are as careless as the attempt to destroy the reputation of one of the finest Supreme Court justices this country has ever produced.XNow comes another volley. New York magazine has assembled ""The Case for Impeaching Clarence Thomas."" The author is longtime anti-Thomas journalist Jill Abramson. For more than 4,000 words, Abramson labors to relitigate Thomas accuser Anita Hill's dramatic loss in the court of public opinion. According to one poll at the time, only 24% believed her.Again the argument falls on its face.Justice Thomas has been a distinguished member of the Supreme Court for more than 26 years now. In the years since, Abramson has assembled ... well, nothing. Meanwhile, the case against Hill's unproven charges has grown only stronger, and Abramson's record of objectivity — if there ever was one — is evermore tattered. Liberals like her think you should impeach someone for allegedly lying under oath — but not if the person's name is Bill Clinton — and then lean heavily on ""alleged"" for protection.Abramson's newest attraction is attorney Moira Smith, who claims she was groped by Thomas at a 1999 dinner party. Her accusation, delivered in the last days of the 2016 presidential campaign, flopped so badly that ABC, CBS, NBC and CNN never touched it.The rationale for attacking Thomas all over again was the Harvey Weinstein expose. But just since then, Abramson has managed to hurt her own cause again. She has no credibility in this discussion. Indeed, she's on the wrong side of it. In October, the Washington Post reported that as executive editor of The New York Times and deputy to Michael Oreskes, she did nothing to stop Oreskes from allegedly sexually harassing a female news aide in the Washington bureau.Track Top Stocks And Market Trends With Free IBD Newsletters""If I had to do it again, I would have told him to knock it off,"" she said. ""I think I should have raised this with (the Times' human resources department). ... Maybe confronting him would have somehow stopped him from doing it to another woman.""In November, she wrote an editorial for the leftist British newspaper The Guardian that explicitly argued that feminist politicians shouldn't be ruined by sexual-harassment allegations. It said: ""Casting out Al Franken, who has been a passionate, zealous defender of women's rights in a Senate grown ever more hostile to them, could remove an important weapon in the embattled Democratic arsenal.""A reassessment of Bill Clinton's behavior era could have the same counter-productive effect.""That passage underlines that Abramson isn't really interested in stopping sexual harassment. She's interested in using sexual harassment against opponents of ""women's rights,"" especially abortion on demand.In fact, Abramson's tolerance for former President Clinton's sexual misconduct is this dramatic: A Nexis search of The New York Times for the terms ""Jill Abramson"" and ""Juanita Broaddrick"" brings up zero stories. When she finally acknowledged Broaddrick's existence in October 2016, she dismissed Broaddrick (and other Clinton accusers Paula Jones and Kathleen Willey) as part of a ""Soviet show trial"" before the second presidential debate.Abramson's ""new"" case against Thomas is so unconvincing that the liberal media passed right over it. Oh, she still has a few die-hard friends on the left. Washington Post media columnist Margaret Sullivan touted the New York magazine piece and lauded Abramson as a ""badass"" with ""unparalleled expertise on the subject."" They think alike. Last October, Sullivan also trashed Broaddrick & Co. as ""a twisted version of 'The Last Supper.'""Clarence Thomas has been recognized as a forceful legal mind on the Supreme Court, and he has staunchly argued against liberal barbarism like partial-birth abortion. It's obvious why liberal journalists with no real core principles on sexual harassment wished they had prevented his confirmation, and why Americans would have been denied an impressive justice.Character assassination means never having to say you're sorry.You might also like ...Media Enablers Protected Democratic Predators For YearsYes, Let's Talk About Bill Clinton's MisconductHollywood Moralists Exposed As Hypocrites

65,ABC,"The latest mass shooting, which claimed 17 lives at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida, was a horrible tragedy. But that's no excuse for the flurry of stories parroting a gun control advocacy group's false claims about school shootings.In the immediate wake of the shooting, headlines starting appearing at major news sites:When not in the headline, this claim shows up in just about every story about the Florida shooting.So, it must be true, right? Why else would every news outlet be reporting this?It's not true.That number comes from a gun control advocacy group — Everytown for Gun Safety — which arrived at 18 only by shoving everything it possibly could into the category of ""school shooting.""The simplest check of its list shows how misleading the group is being.No Hidden Agenda: Get News From A Pro-Free Market, Pro-Growth PerspectiveOne of the ""school shootings"" on the list, for example, involved a Greyson College, Tex., student who accidentally discharged a weapon at the school's Criminal Justice Center during a class supervised by a police officer on how to use handguns.Another on the list involved a third grader who accidentally pulled the trigger of a police officer's holstered weapon.Two were suicides that happened to take place on school grounds. One of them was a 31-year-old man who shot himself while parked in his car, which happened to be on a school lot— at a school that had been closed for seven months. Another was a student who shot himself in the head in the school's bathroom.Three ""school shootings"" involved fights that broke out between either adults or students in school parking lots — one of them at a college in North Carolina — in which one of the people arguing pulled a gun on the other.Another student was shot by a robber, during a robbery that happened to take place in a school parking lot.One involved a gun that a 12-year-old brought to school, which accidentally went off inside her backpack.In fact, of the 18 ""school shootings,"" only five occurred during school hours, and only four — including the latest — are what most people would consider a school shooting; in which someone brings a gun to school with the intent of shooting students.Of those three previous shootings, only one resulted in deaths, when a 15-year-old boy armed with a handgun opened fire inside a Kentucky high school and killed two fellow students while injuring 14 others. The two others resulted in two injuries.This is by no means meant to downplay the seriousness of this issue. These are all terrible tragedies, and parents have the right to expect that their children are safe at school.But it's clear that by lumping all these together under one misleading headline, Everytown for Gun Safety wanted to make this problem sound far more ominous and far more frequent than it actually is.In other words, the gun control advocacy group was trying to unduly scare people. And the press, most of whom enthusiastically embrace gun control, simply went along with the deception.(These journalists, by the way, have no excuse for taking this group's data at its word. The Washington Post fact checker blasted it two years ago for using shoddy methods to inflate the number of school shootings. And when it reviewed the current list, it came to the same conclusion we did. The Daily Wire also did what other most journalists haven't and looked at the list.)It's not uncommon for gun control advocates to distort or hide facts, or point the finger of blame at Republicans, or the NRA, or the lack of certain gun control measures (that wouldn't have prevented the shootings if they had been on the books).But in the most recent shooting, this play on gun-control emotions is particularly troublesome because it takes the spotlight off of what is really worrisome.In this case, the shooter was well known to the school, known to the FBI, and known to many others as a deranged person with a serious violent streak.So why isn't the focus of the public debate on what went wrong? Why didn't law enforcement intervene? Or the local education system? How did the school let the shooter get back into the building after he'd been expelled from that same school for violent behavior? Why wasn't the armed security guard on the scene sooner?More broadly, there's the question of whether a lack of resources, or legal impediments, or inadequate parental involvement needlessly hamper our ability to identify such people and defuse their hatred or treat their mental illness before they go on a murderous rampage.Pushing for one more piece of pointless gun control legislation, on top of the 270 federal laws already on the books, while misleading the public about the scope of the problem or what solutions will actually work, does no one any good.You might also find this of interest ...Facts, Not Emotions, Are Needed In Gun Debate — Here Are 3 IBD's Complete Coverage Of The Gun Control Debate

66,ABC,"Much of the recent chatter surrounding Walt Disney (DIS) has to do with either pay-TV subscriber losses (read: ESPN) or its studio performance (read: Star Wars, Marvel). But one segment of the media conglomerate, says one analyst, merits a little more attention from investors: parks and resorts.X Disney's theme park segment is ""underappreciated by the Street,"" according to RBC Capital Markets' Steven Cahall, who says the unit makes up a third of the company's operating income — in Q1, at least — but ""rarely gets one-third of the credit, in our view, and it arguably has the most scope for driving more upward consensus revisions.""Parks and resorts represent Disney's second-largest segment: In fiscal 2017, it accounted for over 33% of the company's revenue and 25.5% of its operating income. By contrast, the media networks segment, which includes its broadcast and cable channels, led with around 43% of revenue and nearly 47% of operating income last year.And in Q1, the Mouse's many Disneylands helped drive the company's revenue beat with 13% segment growth, offsetting year-over-year declines at the studio and consumer products segments and flattish performance from media networks.Disney CFO Christine McCarthy said on the post-earnings call late Tuesday that parks and resorts had ""so many records in quarterly (operating income) and revenue numbers.""Thanks to ""Pandora — The World of Avatar"" in Florida and ""Guardians of the Galaxy: Mission Breakout!"" in California, U.S. attendance grew 6%, and per capita spending rose 7%, topping Piper Jaffray's estimates.""The ability of Disney to continue to grow the business off of already-high margin levels has been remarkable,"" remarked Cowen analyst Doug Creutz in a note to clients on Wednesday, highlighting its ""impressive growth.""There's ""limited reason for Parks strength to wane,"" said RBC's Cahall. ""Demand and spending at Disney World and Disneyland are very, very healthy, while international parks are benefiting from a combination of stronger operations (Paris) and organic growth (Shanghai, Hong Kong).""Still, the heft of Disney's media networks segment — and its moderating but very much still-present subscriber losses — means that investors care a great deal about the Mouse's vision of the future of entertainment.CFO McCarthy pointed out that there was ""sequential improvement"" in subs for the second straight quarter, fueled by growth in digital MVPD (multichannel video programming distributor) adoption.But she also said equity losses for Hulu — of which Disney will be majority stakeholder, post-Fox deal — are now expected to widen by $250 million in fiscal 2018, worse than prior views for losses to widen by $100 million. (Some of that will ""largely be recouped"" by ABC program sales and affiliate revenue, she said, since Disney licenses shows to Hulu.)Its soon-to-be-launched sports subscription streaming platform, ESPN Plus, is supposed to help quell some fears about the decline of the longtime cash-cow sports network by picking up viewers who shy away from traditional cable bundles.IBD'S TAKE: By learning to use call options, investors can significantly reduce risk and capitalize on basing stocks that are making breakaway gains caused by earnings reports.Alongside ESPN films and exclusive original content, the service promises ""thousands of additional live events giving fans access to more leagues, more teams, and more games than ever before, including Major League Baseball, Major League Soccer and the NHL, along with a rich array of college sports as well as Grand Slam tennis, boxing, golf, rugby and cricket that aren't available on the ESPN linear networks,"" said CEO Bob Iger on the call.However, it's not clear how appealing that will be to viewers if high-demand games aren't available on the $4.99-a-month service, which has previously been pitched as a supplement to, not a replacement for, the main cable network. Iger told CNBC Tuesday that ESPN Plus would include ""an array of live programming that is not available — live sports, live sports events — not available on current channels.""Viewers can also access ESPN Plus on the overhauled ESPN app, which has undergone a ""dramatic"" makeover. The caveat: The app will provide users with access to all of ESPN's live streams — so long as they already have subscriptions to multichannel packages.There's likely greater hope for gaining streaming traction once the company unveils its stand-alone Disney-branded subscription platform in late 2019, sending out a siren call of Marvel, Pixar and Lucasfilm properties to subscribers of streaming services such as Netflix (NFLX) and Amazon (AMZN) Video.Disney shares reversed lower, closing down 1.3% at 104.76 on the stock market today.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN: Bitcoin And Cryptocurrency News And TrendsSpace Industry News And Top Aerospace StocksFANG Stocks News & Quotes

67,ABC,"Mark Johnson has been to the pinnacle, but he's still enjoying his journey.Johnson was a star player on the legendary 1980 USA Olympic hockey team. They stunned the heavily favored Soviet Union squad at those Lake Placid, N.Y., Winter Olympics and went on to win the gold medal. Sports Illustrated named what's become known as the ""Miracle On Ice"" as the greatest sports moment of the 20th century.Johnson went on to have a successful professional playing career and has continued to make his mark as a four-time championship collegiate women's hockey coach.He's the son of Hall of Fame hockey coach Bob Johnson, and his father left Mark a piece of advice the keeps him going today.""My father was upbeat and positive all the time,"" Johnson, 60, told IBD. ""He saw the light at the end of the tunnel no matter what situation he or his team was in. His slogan was: `It's a great day for hockey.'""And it's that mentality that Mark Johnson lives every day.Carla MacLeod, a two-time Olympic gold medalist who played for Johnson on the University of Wisconsin-Madison's women's hockey team, emailed him for advice when she coached Japan's women's hockey team at the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics.""Mark gave me some technical stuff and details, things like that, but what he told me to do was go for a walk every day and appreciate the fact that through hard work I was enjoying these Olympics, too,"" MacLeod said. ""Mark is incredibly grounded and incredibly humble.""As a player Johnson represented the United States in 13 international tournaments. At only 5'9"" and 160 pounds, he had an 11-year NHL career where he scored 203 goals, assisted on 305 others and amassed 508 points. He was chosen to play in the 1984 NHL All Star Game.Johnson was inducted into the Wisconsin Hockey Hall of Fame in 2001 and the United States Hockey Hall of Fame in 2004.""The big thing is the commitment that it takes individually to try to become the best player you can be,"" Johnson said. ""The hard part is doing it on a daily basis and creating those habits that are going to make you successful. You know along the way there is going to be some hurdles and obstacles but it's that you're willing to stay committed and form really good habits that will make you successful.""Mike Eruzione, the 1980 Team USA captain, said to the New York Daily News that Johnson was ""the best player and most important player on our team. … We don't win without Mark. … When we needed big goals, Mark scored them.""Johnson followed in his father's footsteps and began his coaching career with the Madison Monsters, a minor league hockey team, in 1995-96. From there he became an assistant coach for the University of Wisconsin-Madison men's ice hockey team from 1996 until 2002.Johnson served as an assistant coach for the American national men's hockey team in 2000 and 2002.Since 2002, Johnson has been the head coach of the University of Wisconsin-Madison women's ice hockey team. He led the team to its first NCAA national championship in 2006. They repeated as national champions in 2007, 2009 and 2011.Coming into this season, Johnson's career record is 428-78-39, good for a .819 winning percentage. He ranks third in NCAA history in career wins in women's hockey.In 2010, Johnson coached the United States women's national ice hockey team to a silver medal at the Vancouver Winter Olympics.""I see myself as a coach who serves the people in front of him,"" Johnson said. ""It's my job to try to serve to their needs and try to create a culture that's positive and gives the opportunity for each one of them to grow and reach their potential.""I try to set an example on how I conduct myself on a daily basis, whether things are going well or not going well, being consistent in that approach.""""Mark is always positive,"" said Wisconsin women's hockey associated head coach Dan Koch, who has coached under Johnson for 14 years. ""Mark makes it enjoyable to come to the rink every day. The players know they are going to be held accountable, they know they have to work hard but they know they are going to enjoy themselves.""Johnson makes the effort to understand his players as people, and treats them as he would want to be treated in the various situations that arise. ""I think developing those relationships is crucial and by doing so I have a better chance to understand them.""Born in Minneapolis, Johnson was raised in Wisconsin. With hockey in his blood and guidance from his father, he made his international hockey debut with the United States national team in 1976 at age 18. He played in 11 training games for the 1976 U.S. Olympic ice hockey team coached by his father.He went to play hockey for his father at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. In 1977, with father coaching and son playing, the Badgers won the NCAA national championship in ice hockey. Johnson was the first Badger to win the Western Collegiate Hockey Association's Rookie of the Year award.He went on to become a two-time All-American, the school's leading goal scorer and its second all-time scorer.Team USA in 1980 was composed of amateur collegiate players and fielded its youngest team ever, with an average age of 21. By contrast, the Soviet team was composed of full-time athletes battle-tested in international play. They were essentially professionals before that was allowed in the Olympics. The Soviet team had spent the previous 10 to 12 years together and had taken home the Gold Medal in hockey the previous four Winter Olympics and five of the previous six.Many of their players were in the Red Army. Their training regimen consisted of living in army barracks and training together four to five times a day. They had beaten an NHL all-star team 6-0 just the year before. The Soviet team was considered on par with NHL teams and had some of the best hockey players in the world.There was also a political backdrop to the games. The Soviet Union had invaded Afghanistan two months earlier and the Cold War was in full force. Talk from the Carter Administration of boycotting the upcoming Moscow Summer Olympic Games was already happening due to that invasion.Johnson recalls the team being shown thousands of telegrams encouraging them to beat the communist Russians.But just 13 days previously, the Soviets had routed Team USA 10-3 in a pre-Olympic exhibition game.Now at the Olympics, both Team USA and the Soviets were undefeated going into their medal match. The game was played on Friday, Feb. 22, 1980, starting a 5 p.m. in the East, not even prime time.With the Russians leading 2-1 with just five seconds to go in the first period, Johnson raced between two defensemen and slapped in the puck on a rebound with one second left.""I look up at the clock and see five seconds,"" Eruzione said. ""I'm starting to skate toward the bench and all of a sudden Mark flies by me and I'm thinking, 'Where the hell is he going?'""""You're trained to play until you hear whistles or horns and so you keep going,"" Johnson said.The Soviets dominated the second period but scored only once, taking a 3-2 lead into the third and final period. Nearing the end of a power-play man advantage, Russian defenseman Sergei Starikov mishandled the puck right in front of his own net. Johnson was on the spot and slapped the puck in to tie the game with around 10 minutes to play.On the heels of that, Eruzione scored to put Team USA in front 4-3. Despite a furious finish by the Soviets, the Americans hung on to win.After Team USA's victory over the Soviet Union, ABC announcer Al Michaels famously asked: ""Do you believe in miracles?""The answer was ""yes,"" and in the gold medal game vs. Finland, Johnson assisted on the game-winning goal and scored an insurance goal with less than four minutes remaining in the game to cap off Team USA's improbable run.The preparation that coach Herb Brooks put the team through was challenging and confusing to the players, Johnson said, but ""when the moment was presented to us, it was like oh that's why we had to be in this type of condition, that's why we had to be ready mentally to withstand some of the things that were being thrown at us. We were fortunate enough to have the preparation needed to create a situation where we had an opportunity and we seized it.""Star player on the 1980 ""Miracle on Ice"" USA Olympic Hockey Team, United States Hockey Hall of Fame inductee (2004), four-time NCAA championship coach of the University of Wisconsin-Madison women's ice hockey team.Overcame: The Soviet hockey machine that had dominated the Olympics.Lesson: Believe you can do it and then put in the work to make miracles happen.""You've got to be passionate about what you do.""

68,ABC,"Even before President Trump gave his first State of the Union, the left was complaining that he was going to look ""presidential."" It still can't accept that he is president and gets to give presidential speeches. But Trump took that opportunity and fully exploited it.XThe Trump speech was beautiful, at some points even poetic, and delivered well (for him). Maybe it was in the pronouns. Former President Clinton could never stop talking about himself. Former President Obama was worse, once using the first person singular 199 times in a 2014 speech in Austin, Texas.Trump is a narcissist, to be sure. But not on this night. He went Reagan. ""We"" was used an astounding 129 times. Couple that with an extraordinary string of first-year accomplishments and it was a homer both in style and content.Even The New York Times editorial page acknowledged through gritted teeth that Trump was ""right to observe"" that the economy and the stock market look great and ""deserved to take a bow for the degradation of the Islamic State.""But the Democrats sitting in the chamber weren't conceding a thing. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer scowled throughout. Democrats failed to stand and applaud even obvious lines, like the one about record-low African-American unemployment. Rep. Luis Gutierrez even walked out.This was the best-perceived speech in Trump's short political career. A CBS News-YouGov poll found that a whopping 75% approved of the speech, and 43% of Democrats liked it! People watching the speech at home saw the Democrats for who they are: bitter, insulting radicals incapable of being joyful for America.No Hidden Agenda: Get News From A Pro-Free Market, Pro-Growth PerspectiveAn objective press would have reported the above as objective analysis because what we just wrote is indisputable, except to those who would defend bitter radicals filled with such hatred.So when the speech was over, what happened? Nobody in the media focused on the Democrats' refusal to stand or clap, their puckered mouths and their walkouts. All the ""divisive"" demerits were handed out to Trump. On ABC, Cokie Roberts actually blamed Trump for talking about the national anthem: ""There were many African-Americans, members of Congress, there wearing kente cloth -- African cloth. The president never mentioned Africa, never said anything like that, so there was not anything there for them to relate to.""Read that again: African-Americans can't relate to the national anthem or record-low African-American unemployment, only to Africa.On NBC, Chuck Todd declared that Trump failed to be ""conciliatory"" to Democrats on immigration and claimed that the president painted a picture of ""this mythical immigrant criminal here that I want everybody to get fired up about.""NBC also proclaimed that the ""fact-checkers"" would crawl all over Trump's speech, but maybe they should check Todd's facts. Since when is the fact that some immigrants commit crimes ""mythical""?Even almost 24 hours later, ABC merely repeated Democratic statements and refused to question Democrat behavior. Cecilia Vega quoted Pelosi in full screech against Trump: ""'He brings tears to the eyes of the Statue of Liberty and instills fear in the hearts of people who are concerned about the Dreamers.' The White House may have been hoping, David, that speech would unite Congress, but those reviews from the Democrats are in: They are not on board.""Inside the media bubble, the Democrats can do no wrong. Nothing they said around this speech was too extreme. No one questions whether their behavior might turn voters against them.The public sees through this, too. The media are upset their approval ratings are so low and blame Trump. They never seem to take any responsibility and evaluate the craven partisanship of their own ""news.""The public saw a side of Donald Trump it heartily liked. It saw the Democrats in Washington for what they are. It saw the media as an extension of that party.That's three home runs for Donald Trump in one night.RELATED:Dems Vow To Repeal 'Parts' Of GOP Tax Cuts; But Which Ones?Democrats Dig Themselves Into A Hole After Trump's SpeechState Of The Union: Trump Hits It Out Of The ParkClick here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

71,ABC,"Activism: There's been a spate of companies taking political stands these days, and investors have a right to know whether that's good for business. One analysis shows that it carries a big risk in terms of brand reputation.X Morning Consult decided to look at brand reputation from the perspective of politics, to see which brands are most divisive.As it notes, ""brands that were once dutifully neutral have taken bold stands, and others have been involuntarily dragged into controversy."" So it compiled more than 330,000 online survey interviews taken in the final months of 2017 on brand favorability, and broke the results down by party affiliation.Perhaps not surprisingly, the Trump Hotel is the big ""winner"" in this analysis, with a spread of 78 percentage points between Republican and Democrat. (Net favorability among Republicans is in the +30s, while it's in the -40s among Democrats.)The findings also show that eight of the top 10 most divisive brands represent major news outlets: CNN, Fox, NBC, The New York Times, MSNBC, ABC, CBS, and the Washington Post. Given that news and politics go hand in hand, and most of the media skew liberal, this is hardly unexpected.One big surprise, however, is the NFL. It ranks as the sixth most divisive brand, with a +39 approval rating from Democrats, but a -11 among Republicans.No Hidden Agenda: Get News From A Pro-Free Market, Pro-Growth PerspectiveThis is particularly noteworthy, given that no other major sport has a negative rating (even NASCAR scores a +18 among Democrats), and the fact that the NFL's fan base tends to skew Republican. One survey found that registered Republicans were 21% more likely to be pro football fans than Democrats.The polarization is almost entirely the result of the fact that the NFL let players play politics on the field all season long with their National Anthem protests.This, in turn, helps explain why NFL ratings took a nose-dive in 2017. NBC's viewership, for example, was the lowest it's been since 2008. In-game ad revenue dropped 1.2%, and attendance fell 3% to the lowest level since 2011.Baseball, in contrast, appeals almost evenly to Democrats and Republicans, avoided political intrigue, and gets virtually identical (and very positive) promoter scores — with just a 4-point difference.The NFL is a case study in the perils of playing politics to which other companies would do well to pay heed. No matter what side a company takes in a charged political debate, it's guaranteed to upset a large chunk of its customer base. And for what?It would be better for everyone if companies would stick to what customers pay them for, whether it's great products, services or sporting events.Click here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

72,ABC,"""What great TV shows and movies are going to come out of the internet next year?"" isn't a question you might've asked even five years ago. But Hollywood's getting crowded with Silicon Valley types, and over-the-top platforms are all the rage these days, even in the critics' circle.X ""If you look at the landscape today, there's a — what I would call — a new and immense battle that is taking place in the entertainment industry, the likes of which we have never seen before,"" USC Marshall School of Business marketing professor Gene Del Vecchio told Investor's Business Daily.""It's going to be brutal, it's going to be nasty, and not everyone is going to survive.""So let's take a look at what Netflix (NFLX), Amazon (AMZN) Prime Video, Hulu and others (hi, Apple (AAPL)!) have in store for viewers and investors in 2018, as Walt Disney (DIS) prepares its own streaming arsenal for launch.Heads turned when the streaming entertainment platform said it would devote $7 billion to $8 billion to content in 2018, but it might still be shocking to hear that Netflix is going to release 80 (!) original movies in 2018. That's a 60% increase from the 50 films on its slate in 2017. (For comparison, box-office leader Disney has released eight original movies in theaters so far this year, and No. 2 Warner Bros. has released 17, according to Box Office Mojo.)A growing rival against traditional Hollywood studios, Netflix is also investing more in original kids programming and animated features, and executives have indicated that they'd like original content to make up 50% or more of Netflix's library by 2020.Previously Netflix has relied mostly on licensed content, an expensive endeavor. About $3 billion of that $7 billion-$8 billion budget will go toward originals, according to estimates from Loup Ventures, which sees Netflix's originals spending alone shooting up to $6.8 billion in 2022.Some of the shows and movies Netflix creative chief Ted Sarandos is most excited about releasing to its 109.3 million subscribers in the new year? Sci-fi TV series ""Altered Carbon"" and ""Lost in Space,"" Emma Stone comedy ""Maniac,"" and a ""Dark Crystal"" reboot, he said on UBS' annual media and communications call on Dec. 4.The strategy comes as its streaming programming costs rise relative to revenue growth, and as studios and networks look inward and try to strengthen their own streaming services. Disney notably made the choice to pull its movies off the service in 2019, choosing instead to build out its own stand-alone Disney-branded over-the-top streamer.Of course, burgeoning heavyweight Netflix is now armed with Shonda Rhimes, who until recently was a hit show creator for Disney's ABC Studios — though it's unclear when viewers can expect to put a new Shondaland production in their Netflix queues.One thing Netflix still doesn't care about, though? Live sports.""Is that the best use of the next billion dollars?"" Sarandos asked rhetorically. ""We've come to the conclusion so far to date that it isn't.""Prime Video is a player, and Prime Video is not going away.""I just want to be clear: We're going to continue to invest in video and increase that investment in 2018,"" said Amazon CFO Brian Olsavsky on the e-commerce giant's third-quarter earnings call in October.""And why are we going to do that? It's because the video business is having great results with our most important customer base, which is our Prime customers.""Estimates put Amazon's 2017 total content budget at around $4.5 billion, and that figure is likely to be higher in the new year. Loup Ventures Managing Partner and former Piper Jaffray analyst Gene Munster estimates that Amazon's video team spends about a third of that on originals now — and predicts that they'll drop a cool $8.3 billion on originals in 2022.Sure, online shopping and TV shows don't sound like they go hand in hand, but Amazon Studios is proving to be the piper that's leading viewers back to the virtual cash register.""Prime members who watch video also spend more on Amazon,"" said Amazon's Olsavsky, adding that he is ""very bullish on the video business.""The iPhone maker isn't a regular in conversations about streaming entertainment platforms, but it might be soon.In addition to talk of a billion-dollar budget for original content, Apple is reportedly beefing up the staff of WorldWide Video, its Los Angeles-based content initiative. So far the team includes former execs from Sony Pictures Television, Hulu, Amazon Studios and Legendary Entertainment, according to Variety.In the way of scripted television, the entertainment news outlet says a reboot of Steven Spielberg's ""Amazing Stories"" and a drama from Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon are in the works.By Munster's estimate, the Cupertino, Calif., titan is likely to multiply next year's budget to $4.2 billion by 2022.Hulu's newly shuffled ownership makes the company's long-term strategy something of a question mark, given that Disney doubled its stake with its $66 billion acquisition of 21st Century Fox's (FOXA) entertainment assets.The Mouse will have a controlling interest (60%) in the platform, which ostensibly gives it the loudest voice in the room. Aside from Disney, Comcast's (CMCSA) NBCUniversal owns 30% of Hulu and Time Warner (TWX) has 10%; both are currently silent partners, but that won't be true for long.Comcast agreed to hands-off management of Hulu when it acquired NBCUniversal in 2011, but come September 2018 the media giant will be silent no more. No one is sure what will happen when Comcast gets to have a say — particularly since Disney will still be integrating the Fox team into its massive system. (The Disney-Fox deal is slated to close mid-2018.)Still, expect Hulu's path to crystallize soon enough, now that there's one fewer cook in the kitchen. In the wake of the merger, Disney CEO Bob Iger said he plans to send more content to Hulu's more than 12 million viewers and make it a ""more adult-oriented product,"" thanks to Fox Television and FX's content.That conceivably means more ""The Handsmaid's Tale""-style content to compete with Netflix and Amazon's original offerings, though Hulu's total 2017 budget of $2.5 billion was just a fraction of Netflix's. (Netflix spent about $6 billion this year overall, including licensed content.)Long known for being a service where viewers could watch the previous night's broadcast content, Hulu also has its relatively new live-TV bundle, which costs $40 a month and offers shows, news and sports from more than 50 channels.Loup Ventures' Munster remarked recently that while Amazon and Netflix are each spending twice as much as Hulu is on content, Hulu is not distributed internationally (Amazon and Netflix are), and the service is not looking to be a star in the originals space.""Hulu's approach is to offer as much quality content as possible, both originals and programming licensed from major networks,"" he wrote in late November, noting that the platform added 7,500 episodes of content in Q3.Speaking of Disney's over-the-top streamers: In the spring of 2018, ESPN Plus is supposed to get a firmer price and launch date. The stand-alone over-the-top platform stands to benefit from Fox's sports properties.If you're hoping to watch football games through the service, though, maybe dial down your expectations for now. ""Plus"" has been tapped to be a complementary service to the premium sports cable network, which means it will dig into ESPN's well of rights for games and sports that don't currently air on the flagship channel. (Notably, the streaming service will launch without the direction of John Skipper, who was until recently the head of ESPN. He stepped down last week due to substance-abuse issues.)And to quickly recap the streaming sports realm: Soon-to-be-Disney-controlled Hulu Live airs both pro and college football, as well as pro basketball, baseball games and Premier League soccer; Amazon has a deal with the NFL to exclusively air ""Thursday Night Football"" for the season; and Facebook has reportedly indicated interest in plunking down a fortune for streaming sports rights. Twitter is also expanding its live sports and news content.Separately, Netflix, Amazon and Hulu will all have to find a way to coexist with a Disney-branded stand-alone streaming service come 2019, one filled with Pixar, Marvel, and ""Star Wars"" shows and movies, on top of the already-vast library of Disney entertainment.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Bitcoin In 2018: Can Futures, Mainstream Investors Tame The Hysteria?Here's Your Guide To The Stock Market In 2018Could These 10 Growth Stocks In The IBD 50 Have A Banner 2018?

74,ABC,"When you're the source for ""breaking news"" but it turns out to be ""faking news,"" you're in trouble.ABC News ""chief investigative correspondent"" Brian Ross reported on retired Army Gen. Michael Flynn's plea deal with special counsel Robert Mueller by claiming that Flynn is ""prepared to testify that President Trump, as a candidate, Donald Trump, ordered him, directed him to make contact with the Russians which contradicts all that Donald Trump has said to this point.""It was a nuclear explosion. Within minutes, the stock market plunged 350 points.It quickly became clear that was flat-out wrong. Later, ABC News added on the evening news what it disingenuously called a ""clarification"" — actually, it said, Trump directed Flynn to contact the Russians after the election. Not only is that not scandalous but it is also completely expected for a new president. After more uproar, ABC finally found the reporting to be a ""serious error"" and suspended Ross for four weeks without pay.No Hidden Agenda: Get News From A Pro-Free Market, Pro-Growth PerspectiveIt's a classic journalistic mistake to try and be first to report something before it's verified. But in the Trump era, when liberals believe the president is a uniquely dangerous threat to America — and even the world — any news that could lead to speculation about Trump's impeachment or resignation is like catnip. Journalists are prone to overhype anything that could spell ""The End.""This suspension might have been an adequate punishment ... if Ross hadn't already made a long line of whoppers. Conservatives remember the 2012 movie theater mass shooting in Aurora, Colorado, by James Holmes and how Ross came on in breaking-news mode to announce that there was a ""Jim Holmes"" on a Colorado Tea Party Patriots website ... as if that were a perfect starting point to identifying a mass shooter. It wasn't.But there are more.In 2001, Ross claimed that the anthrax used in deadly attacks after 9/11 in Washington, D.C., and New York was coated with bentonite, a chemical compound found only in biological weapons made by then-Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein's henchmen. Former President George W. Bush press secretary Ari Fleischer remembers the event. He tweeted: ""I explicitly told ABC News not to go with the anthrax story because it was wrong. Brian Ross went with it anyway — and one week later issued a murky, hard to understand correction.""XIn the first month of the Iraq War in 2003, Ross reported that Hussein's cousin Ali Hassan al-Majid (or ""Chemical Ali""), an Iraqi general, had been killed. Several media outlets forwarded that report. Six months later, U.S. officials announced that they had him in custody.In 2006, Ross claimed that Pakistani officials had arrested al-Qaida explosives expert Matiur Rehman, who had an ""official"" list of terrorist recruits and could lead to then-al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden. A Pakistani official denounced the report as ""fictitious."" Then-ABC consultant Alexis Debat warned ABC that the report was not true a day after it was initially broadcast.In that same year, Ross breathlessly relayed that the FBI was investigating then-House Speaker Dennis Hastert for bribery in the Jack Abramoff lobbying scandal. ""Justice Department officials describe the 64-year-old Illinois Republican as very much in the mix of the corruption investigation,"" he said. This prompted the Justice Department to deny that there was any federal probe of Hastert, and Hastert demanded a retraction of the statement and threatened to sue ABC.None of these whoppers ever led to any suspension of Ross, who's been at ABC since 1994. His liberal colleagues have given him six Peabody awards and six George Polk awards, so his reputation inside the network was apparently unscathed by his large errors.It's a little bizarre that these days, alleged sexual harassers like Charlie Rose and Matt Lauer are dumped abruptly, while Brian Williams has an hourlong nightly show on MSNBC, and Brian Ross gets a slap on the wrist. These supposed guardians against ""fake news"" make it look like fact mangling isn't really a serious offense. Brian Ross should be fired.Click here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market? Start with IBD University.

75,ABC,"Media Bias: In late November, President Trump suggested a new contest for what he called the ""Fake News Trophy."" Which news network, he said ""is the most dishonest and/or distorted in its political coverage of your favorite President (me)."" We took him up on his offer, and the results surprised even us.The IBD/TIPP Poll asked in its December poll ""which television outlet is the most and least honest and fair in its coverage of President Trump?""The answer to both questions was … Fox News.No Hidden Agenda: Get News From A Pro-Free Market, Pro-Growth PerspectiveThe poll found that 27% rated Fox as the most honest and fair in covering Trump, beating the No. 2 CNN by 11 percentage points. But when asked which network was the least fair in covering Trump, 34% said Fox, while 24% said CNN.The third-place finisher on both questions, CNBC, came in the single digits, with 7% saying it was most fair, and 7% least fair. Broadcast news networks barely registered among poll respondents.We can hear liberals cheering. But look into the numbers and you see that the reason Fox tops both lists is entirely due to partisanship.Sixty-percent of Republicans rated Fox as most fair, most likely because they think it's the only news network that isn't out to get Trump. But 59% of Democrats rated Fox as least fair, presumably because they also think Fox isn't out to get Trump.A similar, but less pronounced split shows up with CNN, with 27% of Democrats saying it's providing the most honest and fair coverage of Trump, while 45% of Republicans say it's the least honest and fair.Among independents, 23% rated Fox most honest and fair, while 14% said it was CNN. But 30% of independents ranked Fox as least honest and fair, with 27% giving CNN the thumbs down.Regionally, urbanites rank CNN as more honest and fair than Fox (20% vs. 17%), while rural dwellers give Fox much higher marks than CNN (36% vs. 13%).In essence, the poll results are less about the reliability and objectivity of the press and more a reflection of the deep division in the country when it comes to Trump. To Democrats, anything short of calling for Trump's head is to be dishonest.XBut poll results aside, we can say without question that it is the mainstream media — which includes CNN, MSNBC, network news, the New York Times, the Washington Post and other major outlets — have been about as dishonest and unfair as they could possibly be when it comes to covering Trump. That's not just our opinion. That's what various surveys and analysis of news coverage have concluded.Time and again, these news outlets have dropped all pretense of objectivity, and abandoned basic journalistic principles, in their Ahab-like quest to destroy Trump's presidency. In this context, any news outlet that isn't out to get Trump would look biased in his favor.Just look at the case of ABC News' Brian Ross, who got a crucial detail about Michael Flynn's guilty plea wrong, which sent shock  waves across the country and drove the market down.Ross claimed Flynn said he'd been directed to contact Russian officials while Trump was still a candidate — that is, before the election.But those meetings in question all took place after Trump won the election.Any cub reporter would understand the difference, and the importance of getting such a crucial fact straight.ABC suspended Ross for 30 days and has banned him from covering stories related to Trump.That's good as far as it goes. But what about all the other Democratic activists pretending to be journalists? When will they be pulled off their Trump beats?RELATED:IBD/TIPP PollPoll Confirms Media's Bias: Is 'Fake News' The New Norm?It's Official: The Biased Media Are Incapable Of Treating Trump FairlyDo The Media Hate Trump?

76,ABC,"Futures for the S&P 500 index jumped Monday morning following the latest tax-cut news and new M&A buzz. CVS Health (CVS) will buy Aetna (AET) for $69 billion, trying to prep for a possible Amazon.com (AMZN) entry.X Meanwhile, Walt Disney (DIS) reportedly is in talks again with 21st Century Fox (FOXA). Separately, Bitcoin jumped to fresh record highs, before paring gains.The U.S. Senate on Friday night approved legislation to cut the corporate tax rate to 20%. House and Senate Republicans will work this week on reconciling their versions.The major market averages rallied last week on tax-cut hopes. Shares initially plunged Friday after ABC News reported that national security adviser Michael Flynn was ready to testify that President Trump ordered him to contact Russian officials during the presidential campaign, but the S&P 500 and other averages slashed losses as it turned out the actions took place after the election.S&P 500 index futures leapt 0.7% vs. fair value. Dow futures jumped 0.9%. Both are signaling record highs at the open. Nasdaq 100 futures rose 0.55%. Treasury yields rose in extended trading.CVS Health will pay $69 billion for Aetna, the companies announced Sunday afternoon, confirming widespread reports. Including assumed debt it's a $77 billion deal.CVS will pay $207 a share for Aetna, $145 in cash and 0.8378 CVS share. That's a 29% premium to Aetna's close on Oct. 25, just before reports of talks surfaced. Aetna closed Friday at 181.31.Aetna rose 2.5% to 185.80 before the open in the stock market today. That's well below the offer price, suggesting some concern about regulatory approval. CVS fell 1.5% to 74.01.The deal combines the huge U.S. drug store operator and pharmacy benefits manager with a health insurance giant. In some ways CVS and Aetna are following No. 1 insurer UnitedHealth (UNH), which also owns a PBM. But CVS appears to be trying to get out in front of Amazon, which reportedly is eyeing the pharmacy distribution business.Walt Disney has renewed talks to buy much of 21st Century Fox, the Wall Street Journal reported over the weekend, adding that Comcast (CMCSA) is still a player. Disney talks with 21st Century Fox  continue focus on the 20th Century Fox movie and TV studio, some U.S. cable networks and international assets such as Fox's 39% stake in U.K. satellite TV broadcaster Sky. The Fox broadcast network, Fox News and sports channel FS1 aren't on the table. But Fox's 30% stake in internet TV operator Hulu is available. Disney and Comcast also each own 30% of Hulu.Bitcoin surged back above $11,000 over the weekend.

77,ABC,"U.S. stock indexes deepened their losses midday Friday, as Senate Republicans scrambled to salvage its tax-cut package. The indexes rallied Thursday on belief that the bill would pass, but doubts delayed a vote late Thursday.X The S&P 500 dropped 1.1% midday Friday, while the Nasdaq slipped 1.5%. The blue chip Dow Jones industrial average lost 0.9%. The small cap Russell 2000 fell 2.5%.Volume in the stock market today was running higher on both major exchanges.The Republican tax-cut package stalled Thursday after the Joint Committee on Taxation said the bill would not generate enough tax revenue to avoid increasing the deficit. That along with a parliamentarian snag derailed the vote Thursday evening. With additional fixes, a Senate vote is expected this morning.Selling picked up midday Friday after an ABC news report that former national security adviser Michael Flynn would testify against President Trump in a plea deal with special counsel Robert Mueller.Concerns over tax cuts and tax revenue is an old and tiresome story on the Hill. When Reagan sought passage of a tax-cut bill in 1985, the New York Times reported that the Joint Committee on Tax Revenue said it would reduce tax revenue. Reagan prevailed and the tax revenue rose in each of the next five years, proving the panel's projections wrong. The panel, though, always has a challenging job. Dynamic factors are difficult to predict, and economics is all but dynamism.In midday stock-market action, blue chips were roughly even between winners and losers. On the plus side, Merck & Co. (MRK) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) each initially rose about 1% before gains faded. On the negative side, General Electric (GE) sagged 1.4%.GE has been a laggard this year. The diversified manufacturer's stock is down 43% this year.In S&P 500, the biggest gainer for the day was oil and natural gas explorer Apache (APA). The stock rose about 6% in heavy volume. Apache is on track for its fourth daily gain in a row. The stock has gained 11% since Monday's close. Light sweet crude popped 1.31 to 58.71 per barrel.The Street expects Apache to turn in a profit of 4 cents a share in 2017 after two years of losses. In 2018, analysts expect a profit of  54 cents a share for Apache.Meanwhile, the exchange-traded fund Innovator IBD 50 Fund (FFTY) slipped about 1% as it tested its 50-day line. The ETF is based on the IBD 50 and is up 38% for the year. The stock  recently pulled about 5% off its Nov. 22 high.Money center banks, which are up almost 4% for the week, stirred midday Friday. Citigroup (C) rose 0.63 to 76.13 in brisk trade. Citigroup is trying to clear a 76.24 buy point. The stock crossed above an alternative entry at 74.95 in strong volume Wednesday.Bank of New York Mellon (BK) added nearly 1% in average turnover, then dropped 1%. The stock is in a shallow, cuplike pattern. The potential buy point is 55.39.Superregional bank KeyCorp (KEY) rose 1% to 19.21 in moderately higher volume, then lost its gains. The stock is just above a 19.13 buy point in a cup-with-handle pattern.The bank stocks launched a nice rally about a year ago, rising from November to March. The banks then traded in a shallow, mostly sideways channel until recently. On Thursday, the money centers and superregionals hit 52-week highs.The superregional group is No. 44 among 197 industry groups. Six weeks ago, superregionals were No. 140.

78,ABC,"After prospects for a big GOP tax-cut victory were thrown into doubt late Thursday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said that at least 50 senators are on board.Maine Sen. Susan Collins, the final GOP vote needed, gave her assent, citing some changes to property tax provisions.Futures had fallen overnight on news that a couple of fiscal hawks wanted to shrink the cost of the $1.4 trillion bill by as much as $500 billion.The S&P 500 index and other major averages tumbled on an ABC News report that Michael Flynn, briefly Trump's national security adviser, will testify that Trump ordered him to contact Russian officials before he took office. Others reported that Flynn would cooperate about the involvement of Trump's circle.Stocks came off their Flynn-Trump lows as McConnell sounded positive on the tax bill's prospects. The S&P 500 sank 0.2% on the stock market today, after falling more than 1.2% intraday.There were reports that part of the final deal to lock up support will be to ratchet up taxes on past earnings of multinationals like Apple (AAPL) and Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL) that have been stashed overseas to avoid being taxed at the 35% U.S. corporate rate. The Senate will apparently move toward the House provision. Up until now, the Senate bill would have applied a 10% tax on cash and 5% on illiquid assets, raising $185 billion. The House's 14% tax on cash and 7% on illiquid assets would raise $293 billion. Apple held $252 billion in cash overseas at the end of its fiscal fourth quarter.Earlier Friday,  Sens. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin and Steve Daines of Montana agreed to vote for passage after winning a sweeter deal for pass-through businesses, including sole proprietorships and partnerships, whose profits are taxed via individual returns.Republican leaders are working to secure the necessary votes for passage without depending on Sens. Bob Corker and Jeff Flake. Their support will be costly to win after their plan to trigger deficit reductions, if rosy economic projections don't pan out, was judged to violate Senate reconciliation rules.On Thursday, the Dow Jones industrial average and S&P 500 index hit new highs in what looked like an early tax-cut victory celebration, but the Nasdaq composite didn't fully join the parade, as shares of Alphabet slipped and other leading tech stocks only managed to cut into the prior day's losses. Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs (GS) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) were among the Dow's biggest winners, rising on the near-certainty of a boost to after-tax profits and hopes that broader economic strength will lead to higher market interest rates. JPMorgan and other financials have taken over market leadership, at least for now.Thursday's optimism came as Sen. John McCain said he'll vote for the GOP's near-$1.5 trillion Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, clearing away perhaps the biggest obstacle to passage.IBD'S TAKE: The bull market won't go on forever, so read IBD's The Big Picture column every day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines. As long as the current ""confirmed uptrend"" — the equivalent of a green light — stays in place, leading stocks breaking above a buy point are more likely than not to have the wind at their backs. Here's a good place to start looking for stocks that may be poised to move higher.McCain, who helped seal the defeat of ObamaCare-repeal efforts in the summer and fall and voted against George W. Bush's tax cuts in 2001, said he'll back the current bill, despite shortcomings: ""I believe this legislation, though far from perfect, would enhance American competitiveness, boost the economy, and provide long overdue tax relief for middle class families.""There still are a few outstanding issues. The family-first duo of GOP Sens. Marco Rubio and Mike Lee want to limit the corporate rate cut to 22% to pay for a more generous child tax credit. The White House has said that a 20% corporate rate is nonnegotiable, so prospects for the Rubio-Lee limit aren't clear.Meanwhile, Sen. Susan Collins wants the Senate to follow the House's lead in preserving the deductibility of property taxes and is looking for assurance that the individual insurance market premiums won't spike due to repeal of ObamaCare's individual mandate.RELATED:Tax Bill Will Pressure FANG, Momentum Stocks, Says JPMorgan5 Reasons Why JPMorgan, Citigroup, Other Financials Are Seizing Market LeadershipStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth Stocks

79,ABC,"President Trump is slated to deliver his State of the Union address before a joint session of Congress at 9 p.m. ET/6 p.m. PT on Tuesday, Jan. 30. Here's what to expect and how to watch the State of the Union online and on TV.Trump is likely to tout the robust economy and the S&P 500 index and Dow Jones industrial average setting new highs. He'll likely take credit, as he has done often on Twitter, for the positive news, citing regulatory cuts and recently passed tax cuts.Trump has been expected to announce infrastructure spending as his top priority in his second year as president, an initiative that potentially could have bipartisan appeal. That follows his first year in which Republicans passed sweeping tax cuts without Democratic support after a failed GOP effort to repeal ObamaCare.However, Trump's State of the Union comments on immigration will be in focus.

91,ABC,"11. And last, but not least: ""RUSSIA COLLUSION!"" Russian collusion is perhaps the greatest hoax perpetrated on the American people. THERE IS NO COLLUSION!Now, one can quibble with some of the entries. Paul Krugman, for example, was giving his opinion, not stating a fact. Nevertheless, Krugman writes for the ""newspaper of record,"" and is highly influential, and is supposedly very smart. So, his blatant error is noteworthy.Also, two of the false ""reports"" — about the MLK bust and the Pensacola rally — were actually tweets by reporters.Still, the rest of the ""winners"" are stories that were reported by professional journalists, overseen by layers of editors, and published in mainstream news outlets.Worse, these weren't minor errors. Most of them were fundamental to the story itself. In the case of Brian Ross, his false report that Trump had instructed Michael Flynn to contact Russian officials during the campaign set off a flurry of tweets suggesting that Trump's presidency was over, and sent the stock market into a tailspin. Ross should have been fired, but instead only got suspended.No Hidden Agenda: Get News From A Pro-Free Market, Pro-Growth PerspectiveThis isn't a biased sample, either. You'd be hard pressed to find any story where reporters got important facts wrong in a way that made Trump look good. All the errors go in one direction only.Nor is this list in any way comprehensive. The Washington Examiner has compiled an extensive catalog of stories and tweets attacking Trump or the GOP last year that were ""overhyped, inconclusive, misleading, half-true, or flat-out false."" And let's not forget the media's massive hype of Michael Wolff's Trump-bashing book, before bothering to check whether Wolff had any of his facts straight.Nevertheless, reporters say the ""fake news"" label is unfair because these news outlets issued corrections and occasionally reprimanded reporters and editors involved. Or they say that it doesn't matter because Trump lies all the time, thereby committing the logical fallacy of ""tu quoque"".As the Washington Post fact checker put it: ""To sum up, at least eight of the 'Fake News' winners resulted in corrections, with two reports prompting suspensions or resignations. Two of the winners were simply tweets that were quickly corrected and never resulted in news articles. One was an opinion article in which the author later retracted his prediction. Let's put it this way: If the president admitted error as frequently, he would earn far fewer Pinocchios.""So, is this the standard for journalism today? When covering Trump, it's no big deal if you repeatedly screw up major news stories, and end up spreading misinformation far and wide, so long as you eventually issue a correction or slap a reporter on the wrist?Have these reporters never heard Winston Churchill's aphorism that ""A lie gets halfway around the world before the truth has a chance to get its pants on.""Of course, every reporter makes a mistake now and again. But one would think the standard for the news media would be to not make such flagrant errors in the first place, and would consider anything short of that deeply embarrassing and intolerable.Apparently, in the age of Trump, anything goes so long as it pushes the anti-Trump narrative and ""rings true.""RELATED:Trump Is 'Inspiring Great Journalism'?Who Won The IBD/TIPP 'Fake News Trophy' Do The Media Hate Trump (Part II)?

92,ABC,"As we approach the first anniversary of Donald Trump's inauguration, it is painfully obvious that our ""news"" providers are a highly agitated brigade of the ""Resistance."" A new Media Research Center study finds that from Jan. 20, 2017, through Dec. 31, 2017, the evening news shows on ABC, CBS and NBC were overwhelmingly hostile in both content and tone.XThe study, co-authored by Rich Noyes and Mike Ciandella, comes with a jarring headline: ""2017: The Year the Media Went to War Against a President."" It is indisputable that no president in the history of the republic has been visited by such vitriol from the press. It is not to say that some of the negative coverage hasn't been deserved. But no man this side of Rep. Maxine Waters can defend their overwhelming hostility as fairness.Journalists often talk about President Trump's ""war on the media"" and can't possibly discuss the media's war on President Trump. When the president attacks the media, that's an attack on democracy. When the media undermine the president, that's the full flowering of democracy.Removing the statements made by Trump and other politicians, 90% of evening-news Trump evaluations were negative, and only 10% were positive. (Neutral statements were not counted.) There were only three months in 2017 during which the negative coverage dipped below 90%. For instance, it was 85% negative in December, when Trump succeeded in getting his tax-cut bill passed.The numbers don't tell the whole story. The qualitative measurement is just as awful. Trump news isn't mildly negative, like ""the president's message failed to resonate today."" The network anchors have felt compelled to signal that Trump is so undesirable he should be removed from office. Just over a month into the presidency, then-CBS anchorman Scott Pelley pressured Democrat Leon Panetta, former CIA director and secretary of defense, by saying, ""Is it appropriate to ask whether the president is having difficulty with rationality?""No Hidden Agenda: Get News From A Pro-Free Market, Pro-Growth PerspectiveThe Clinton die-hards couldn't stop reporting on their suspicion that the Russians colluded with the Trump campaign to beat Hillary Clinton. The Russia probe was the networks' favorite topic last year, resulting in an astonishing 20 hours and 34 minutes of coverage, or more than one-fifth of all Trump coverage.Nobody rooted for Trump to succeed and pass legislation as they did for former President Barack Obama. In 2009, then-NBC host Matt Lauer badgered Republican Party strategist Karl Rove on the stimulus-package vote. He complained: ""If you add up the House and the Senate, we have what, 219 Republicans? All but three of them voted against ... this plan. ... Two hundred and sixteen Republicans seem to have placed a bet on failure.""That spin didn't happen when House Democrats unanimously voted no on the Trump tax cut. Instead, NBC anchor Lester Holt sounded like a Democratic National Committee press release when he said: ""Unable to repeal and replace Obamacare, Republicans are instead trying to undermine it. Is this a body blow to Obamacare?""To the press, repealing anything Obama installed isn't an ""achievement."" It's a disastrous setback. Some of the repeal happened without much media protest. Trump's attempts to deregulate the economy barely drew 11 minutes of coverage. Trump's approval of new oil pipelines drew just over seven minutes.Oversight on their part? In a way, yes. They have other more pressing matters on their plates.They prefer reporting their Gaffe of the Day. Here's another number that proves the media's aggression: When the Washington Post reported that Trump referred to some immigrants as coming from ""s---hole countries,"" it became an intensely negative news story. CNN was the most intense of all. In the first full day after this story broke, it put decency aside and the word ""s---hole"" was said on air 195 times, according to Newsbusters staff. The cursing also appeared for days on screen.Those screens, in turn, grace airport terminals, doctors' offices and even schools all across America. Millions upon millions of Americans were offended. But for CNN, the effort was worth the insult if it could also damage the president it despises.Click here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

94,ABC,"In the midst of the media feeding frenzy over Michael Wolff's gossipy and fact-mangling book on the Trump White House, another piece of news broke. On Jan. 5, it was announced that the FBI has returned to investigating The Clinton Foundation. Yawn. First, the media ignored it. Then, they touched on it for half a story, after which pundits insisted that there is ""nothing new,"" as if they have access to the factual evidence being sought by the FBI.XDoes the ""nothing new"" response ring a bell? It should.Last year, some reporters stared at the clear evidence of corporate donations to The Clinton Foundation following State Department actions under Hillary Clinton and claimed there was ""no evidence"" of a pay-to-play scheme. Let's explore the depth of the investigations giving them the authority to make such pronouncements.In October 2016, NPR's Joel Rose acknowledged that some donors were awarded meetings with Clinton when she was secretary of state but that ""there's no evidence that big donors got any special favors from the State Department."" Rose didn't even bother to look at NPR's own reports. A few months earlier, NPR's Scott Detrow had laid out the 2009 case of the Swiss bank UBS and its problem with the IRS. The tax collectors wanted the identities of Americans with secret bank accounts. Clinton brokered a tentative deal with the bank, and it agreed to turn over a small fraction of the information the IRS sought. Then, presto! The bank's Clinton Foundation donations grew from less than $60,000 to about $600,000 by the end of 2014. It also showered Bill Clinton with $1.5 million for a series of speeches.But there's ""no evidence"" of favors.No Hidden Agenda: Get News From A Pro-Free Market, Pro-Growth PerspectiveOn Jan. 6, ""CBS This Morning"" brought on Kathleen Kingsbury, deputy editor of The New York Times editorial page. ""I think that given the fact that there doesn't seem to be new evidence on the table, the only conclusion we can come to is that this is a political vendetta brought on by the White House,"" she blustered. ""The FBI looked into these allegations in 2016 and said there wasn't enough evidence to actually bring charges. So, what's new now?""A perfectly Clintonian summary. Hillary would be proud.On ABC, Cokie Roberts seconded that emotion, saying: ""whether they've learned anything new is the real question there. Why would it continue now, when they've already been investigating it for a good long time? So there is certainly at least a whiff of politics here.""On Jan. 7, NBC morning anchor Morgan Radford implied that bad news for the Clintons is ""fake news."" She asked moderator Chuck Todd: ""So break something else down for us, this real versus fake news. We've learned this week about developing investigations into The Clinton Foundation and the author of that controversial dossier, but is this a real investigation, or is that just a political sideshow?""Todd agreed it ""could be a political sideshow."" Whitewater, perjury, pay to play — it's always a ""sideshow.""Journalists would probably excuse their boredom by saying, ""She's not president."" But history strongly suggests they would be just as bored (or twice as hostile) to a Clinton Foundation probe if she had actually won the election. We can just as easily guess that if Donald Trump had narrowly lost the election, the media would still be investigating his alleged Russia collusion.Any voters outside the Clinton bubble who negotiated their way around the ""who cares?"" media in 2016 could clearly see that the Clintons have filled a 50-car train with scandal baggage over the decades. But our ""real news"" reporters live in perpetual denial.RELATED:The Clinton Foundation Scandal ExplainedNow We Know: FBI Ignored Lawbreaking To Exonerate Hillary ClintonAs Investigations Of Misconduct Mount, Can Hillary Clinton Avoid Jail?Click here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

95,ABC,"Scandals: It's bad enough that lawmakers created a taxpayer-financed protection scheme that let them sexually harass their employees. The fact that the mainstream press has apparently been contributing to this cover up is even worse.On ABC News' ""This Week"", veteran journalist Cokie Roberts made a rather revealing admission in the wake of accusations from women that far-left Rep. John Conyers had assaulted them.""Every female in the press corps knew that, right, don't get in elevator with him,"" she said, apparently referring to Conyers. ""Now people are saying it out loud."" She added that ""we all talked about (it) for years.""No Hidden Agenda: Get News From A Pro-Free Market, Pro-Growth PerspectiveEvery female in the press corps knew that Conyers was abusive toward women ""for years"" and did nothing about it? Try to imagine a reporter making such a casual admission about a prominent Republican.It's hardly the first time reporters have covered for Democratic abusers.Press were extremely reluctant to cover the Anthony Weiner sexting scandal when it first broke, and even defended his behavior, as Wendy Kaminer did in the Atlantic in 2011 when she declared that Weiner's actions didn't constitute harassment because the ""women to whom he directed his texts had unmitigated freedom to delete and ignore him."" Recall that at the time, Weiner was a rising star in the Democratic Party.Likewise, the press covered for Ted Kennedy's rapacious behavior, including when he assaulted a waitress at a French restaurant on Capitol Hill.XBill Clinton's rapacious behavior toward women was an ""open secret"" back when he was governor of Arkansas, and the press either ignored credible charges of rape and assault or attacked his accusers. Only now are some in the press admitting that they perhaps shouldn't have been so quick to defend Clinton against these charges.The Daily Wire recently compiled a list of 24 sex scandals involving Democrats that CNN has ignored this year alone.At the same time, the mainstream press has been eager to find and call out Republicans who crossed the harassment line. Nothing wrong with that. But such accountability should be nonpartisan.Roberts' admission makes it clear that the problem isn't just that Congress circled the wagons, but that the press was willing to lend a hand to protect their fellow ""progressives.""(For years, reporters provided the same service for liberals in Hollywood, as well as for predators in their own ranks, which explains why virtually all the people being outed these days are Democrats.)But Roberts' admission also raises a question: How many other lechers in Congress have reporters known about ""for years"" and decided to keep quiet about?All we know for certain at the moment is that there have been lots of secret settlements in the past two decades.In 1995, Congress granted itself a get-out-of-jail free card when it passed — and Bill Clinton signed into law — the Orwellian-named Congressional Accountability Act.That law supposedly required lawmakers to live under the civil rights and labor laws they imposed on everyone else, but put taxpayers on the hook for any violations and prevented the settlements from being made public.In the wake of the Conyers and Sen. Al Franken groping stories, the ""Office of Compliance"" released a tally of these payments. Since 1995, there have been 264 that cost taxpayers more than $17 million.We don't know how many of these payments went to silence accusations of sexual harassment, since the complaints aren't detailed. But it's a safe bet that many of them were.The New York Times had it right when it pointed out in an editorial this week that ""Decades of hushed-up complaints show sexual misconduct is as terrible an open secret in Congress as in Hollywood. Legislators have a chance to correct their poor handling of a national problem. They should seize it.""The Times should have added that liberal press must also be held to account for working with Democrats to keep this misconduct under wraps.Click here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.

96,ABC,"At the ceremony to break ground last year on a new Toy Story Land in Shanghai, Walt Disney's (DIS) Bob Iger was beaming. To his right, and dressed similarly in a black sweater, was the man who could very well take his place as chief executive officer: Bob Chapek.X Shanghai Disneyland went on to exceed 11 million visitors in its first year. That was a big boost for Chapek, who has delivered steady returns as head of the parks and resorts division. In Disney's fiscal year-end results announced Nov. 9, Chapek's business was the only one of four major units to post an increase in sales and profit.Chapek, whose 24-year career at Disney has included roles in the film studio and consumer products, is now viewed as a likely successor to Iger, according to people familiar with the company. While no formal decision has been made, Disney is under pressure to find a replacement because Iger is scheduled to retire in July 2019, leaving 19 months to complete a transition. If history is any guide, Disney may soon name a chief operating officer or president, currently unoccupied roles that Iger held for five years before becoming CEO in 2005.Chapek's well-rounded experience is appealing for a company whose business ranges from selling toys in malls to churning out ""Star Wars"" films. He stands out at a time when other parts of the business are sputtering. Disney's once-vaunted TV division, home to ESPN, ABC and other channels, reported its second straight year of declining profit this month, as consumers shift to online viewing. The company's film studio, while still the envy of the industry, was dealt a blow last week when Pixar's chief creative officer, John Lasseter, took a six-month sabbatical following allegations of inappropriate behavior.Since taking over the theme-park division in February 2015, Chapek ensured the Shanghai resort, Disney's largest foreign investment, turned a profit in its first year of operation. He also guided the openings of an ""Avatar""-themed attraction in Orlando, Florida, and a ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" ride in Anaheim, California, that have led to attendance gains this year at the company's domestic theme parks.In July Chapek unveiled a flurry of new projects at the parks, including a ""Star Wars""-themed hotel in Orlando and Marvel superhero rides in Anaheim. Disney told investors on Nov. 9 that its budget for investments in the parks will expand this fiscal year by about $1 billion.Fortunes rise and fall within Disney all the time, and a leading contender can quickly lose favor. Iger, 66, has thrice postponed retirement with contract extensions, but said last month that ""this time I mean it."" While Disney has conducted a multiyear succession process in the past, a number of senior managers who would have been candidates to replace Iger have left the company, among them former Chief Financial Officer Jay Rasulo and Thomas Staggs, another former parks chief.Disney was little changed at $102.67 at 9:41 a.m. in New York. The stock has declined about 1.4% so far this year.Staggs was seen as the likely heir given his promotion to COO in February 2015, more than two years in advance of Iger's then-scheduled retirement. But last year he stepped down after being told the board had lost confidence in him.Chapek joined Disney after working in marketing at H.J. Heinz Co., the food-processing company, and at agency J. Walter Thompson. At Disney, Chapek reorganized the consumer-products division, cutting jobs and focusing the business on brands rather than lines of merchandise.At the parks division, Chapek has focused on pricing, introducing a tiered system of tickets that cost more during peak times and eliminating some annual passes. He's searched for ways to get patrons to pay extra for perks such as nighttime events and passes to get to the head of the line in the company's California parks.An Indiana native, Chapek cultivates palm trees at his homes in California and Florida. He said in an interview earlier this year that when he was growing up, his family went to Walt Disney World as an annual holiday outing.""I was sort of umbilically tied to it from the time I was really young,"" Chapek said. ""So, coming to Disney was a dream for me.""Investors are likely to find out in the coming months whether he's exceeded even his wildest dreams.

97,ABC,"It was bizarre watching KABC TalkRadio in Los Angeles — my hypocritical ex-employer — hold a televised news conference. It turns out that one of the station's news anchors, Leeann Tweeden, claims Sen. Al Franken groped her. In 2006, Tweeden said, before Franken became a senator, he and she participated in a USO tour to entertain the troops in the Middle East.But, claims Tweeden: ""(Franken) repeated that actors really need to rehearse everything and that we must practice the kiss. I said 'OK' so he would stop badgering me. We did the line leading up to the kiss and then he came at me, put his hand on the back of my head, mashed his lips against mine and aggressively stuck his tongue in my mouth.""I immediately pushed him away with both of my hands against his chest and told him if he ever did that to me again I wouldn't be so nice about it the next time.""I walked away. All I could think about was getting to a bathroom as fast as possible to rinse the taste of him out of my mouth.""I felt disgusted and violated.""Why was the KABC news conference about Franken's misconduct bizarre?Only a few years earlier, the same KABC radio executive who arranged the Tweeden news conference fired me for calling out the blatant left-wing hypocrisy over allegations not just of groping but of rape. I dared insist that the allegations made against President Bill Clinton by Juanita Broaddrick — who claims that she was raped by Bill Clinton and that then, two weeks after the rape, Hillary Clinton verbally intimidated the alleged rape survivor — should have been taken seriously. ""No one cares about this issue,"" said the very same KABC exec now allegedly incensed over the groping allegation against Franken. As for Broaddrick, the executive screamed, she is ""old news,"" as, he insisted, were Bill and Hillary's treatment of multiple accusers. He burst into my radio studio, with the show in progress, and literally yelled at me for pounding an ""irrelevant"" topic. Shortly before I got fired, the executive sent this letter to my agent:""I point out that from 3:15 pm to almost 4 o'clock, Larry is AGAIN talking about Kathleen Willey, Juanita Broderrick (sic), Monica Lewinsky, Paula Jones and somehow linking Hillary Clinton and James Carville to Bill Clinton being a rapist and sexual harasser. This line of discussion is repeated and repeated, day after day. It is neither timely or relevant to today — though I assume Larry thinks it is in some way. It is my opinion that the sheer volume of instances — sometimes multiple times a day — where he brings this old, arcane topic up is very detrimental to the ratings. While there are literally scores of current, important and compelling stories, Larry is talking, again, about an issue from over 20 years ago. For the better part of an hour. Please let me know if you have some idea of how to get it to cease, short of embargoing mentions of the names above. ... It was my understanding that Larry was going to stop by and see me. He has not.""XIt isn't enough to criticize Bill and Hillary Clinton — so-called advocates for women — for their hypocrisy. What about ABC News' ""chief anchor,"" George Stephanopoulos, who helped set up the ""war room"" to respond to allegations made by women against Clinton? Stephanopoulos, then a top aide to presidential candidate Bill Clinton, even said, ""Bill Clinton has no character problem."" How does a partisan like Stephanopoulos, who consistently defended Clinton's behavior and blamed the ""Republican attack machine,"" become the ""chief news anchor"" of anything, let alone of ABC News? If, at last, much of the country is reassessing their opinion of Bill and Hillary Clinton, what about enablers like Stephanopoulos?What about media executives, like the one I once worked for, who downplayed the hypocrisy and, in his case, actively attempted to squash any discussion of it? What about these media enablers? Comedian Chelsea Handler recently tweeted: ""Imagine being molested by an older man. Then that man denies ever doing it and then goes on and gets elected to United States Senate. What kind of message does that send to young girls everywhere? And men to all the men who abuse women?""Juanita Broaddrick tweeted back: ""I can imagine. I was raped by the Arkansas AG who then becomes Governor & President and NBC held my interview explaining the rape until after his impeachment hearing. But I'm sure you don't want to go there."" Handler apologized: ""You are right and I apologize to you for not knowing your story. Democrats along with Republicans and the rest of the world's political parties all need to do better and respect the firsthand accounts of victims. I believe you.""Why did Handler not know her story? Blame media decision-makers who ignored or downplayed this issue — and even threatened the careers of those who dared call out the hypocrisy.RELATED:Hollywood Moralists Exposed As HypocritesFLASHBACK: Obama Admin Protected Sex Offender, Helping Re-electionHollywood Harassment Scandal Now Envelops Amazon And TwitterClick here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

98,ABC,"As the media elites roll their eyes and sigh at people who deny the apparently inevitable approach of traumatic climate change, there's one category of denial they always endorse: a liberal bias in the ""news."" Chest-pounding journalistic activism defines the Trump era, and yet shameless journalists still claim media bias is a myth.James Warren, a former managing editor and chief of the Chicago Tribune Washington, D.C., bureau, now works at The Poynter Institute for media studies (or media denial?). He posted a commentary on Nov. 20 headlined ""How Mega-Media Deals Further Erode the Myth of a 'Liberal' Media.""Liberals made fun of Mitt Romney when he claimed that ""corporations are people,"" but they subscribe to the cartoonish idea that ""corporations are all conservative."" Corporations have a profit motive, so that somehow inexorably translates to Republican propaganda?Rupert Murdoch is looking at unloading some of his Hollywood assets, and among the suspected potential buyers are The Walt Disney Co. (DIS) and Comcast Corp. (CMCSA). To Warren, this somehow heralds a new era of ""not just unceasing consolidation but the unceasing influence of folks of distinctly conservative ideology."" The Murdochs explore selling off assets, and that's conservative consolidation?Not only that, Warren says the ""caricature"" of a liberal media is ""dubious"" and can be rebutted by the fact that the ""aggressively conservative"" Sinclair Broadcasting Group ""is primed to become the biggest local TV broadcaster."" Yet Sinclair stations are routinely airing network news and entertainment content from ... ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox.Warren then rounds up academics who sound like they never read or watch the liberal media. Matthew Baum, the Marvin Kalb professor of global communications at the Harvard Kennedy School, claims that conservatives ""mostly point to the political views of journalists at mainstream media outlets, who tend to lean Democratic."" He adds: ""Of course, the core journalistic norm of balance and objectivity run directly counter to that. So at minimum it isn't obvious why personal political views would trump professional norms."" He then argues that some ""research"" shows that ""news reporting tends to reflect the interests of ownership,"" so that predicts ""a more pro-conservative bias.""It's official: This professor sounds dumber than a grade schooler.XHe seems to have ignored every story written or broadcast over the last two years about President  Trump and his allegedly racist, sexist, homophobic, Islamophobic voters, as the ""professional norms"" have included demeaning Trump and the Republicans as a dangerously ignorant gang shredding democracy.Warren then cites Danny Hayes, a political scientist at George Washington University who doubles down on the idiocy. ""The debate about ideological bias in the media is not productive at all,"" he says. That's true ... if you're a liberal who wants the average (and, apparently, ignorant) media consumer to think the news is objective. Hayes insists ""the social science research finds virtually no evidence in the mainstream media of systematic liberal or conservative bias.""Hayes should be teaching geology because, clearly, he is living under a rock. We've been churning out daily evidence of a dramatic liberal bias in the ""objective"" news media for 30 years, and this ""scientist"" in Washington, D.C., thinks there's ""virtually no evidence""?This is a little like arguing that ""research"" shows there's virtually no evidence of pro football players kneeling during the national anthem this season. Everyone's seen it. No one is fooled. The only fool is the one who thinks denying the obvious just might work.Click here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

99,ABC,"Comcast (CMCSA) faces a tough regulatory climate if it acquires a sizable part of 21st Century Fox Entertainment (FOXA), based on the trouble AT&T (T) has had in winning approval for its Time Warner (TWX) acquisition, says an analyst.Comcast owns NBCUniversal, and regulatory conditions placed on that deal expire in 2018. The Department of Justice, meanwhile, reportedly wants AT&T to divest Turner Broadcasting, including CNN, to win approval of the Time Warner deal.""It's hard to see how an attempt by Comcast to acquire more content assets wouldn't have a very tough row to hoe with the Department of Justice,"" Vijay Jayant, an analyst at Evercore ISI, said in a note to clients.Reports late Thursday said Comcast is in talks to buy some of the assets of Rupert Murdoch's Fox. Shares in Fox jumped 6.6% to close at 30.48 on the stock market today, while Comcast shares slipped 2.5% to 36.16.Walt Disney (DIS) also has reportedly been in talks to buy parts of Fox, including its movie and TV studio as well as some cable TV channels.Neither Disney nor Comcast can buy the Fox broadcast TV network because they already own ABC and NBC, respectively. Comcast tried to buy Disney in 2004. The Mouse-Peacock rivalry has grown since Comcast bought NBCU from General Electric (GE) in 2011.IBD'S TAKE: Read IBD's The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.Comcast is most interested in Fox's stake in satellite TV broadcaster Sky and Star India, say some reports. But if Comcast also aims to acquire Fox's U.S. entertainment assets it could invite regulatory trouble, says Jayant.The DOJ's antitrust chief, Makan Delrahim, said at the American Bar Association on Thursday that the agency is not interested in placing ""behavioral remedies"" on the AT&T-Time Warner deal and is seeking structural solutions to competition issues.""The AT&T and Time Warner deal is facing pushback due to concerns about vertical integration — an acquisition of material Fox assets by Comcast would face not only those concerns, but also horizontal merger concerns,"" added Jayant.Verizon Communications (VZ) has also approached Fox about some assets, but talks do not seem as serious as those involving Disney or Comcast, say reports.RELATED:Will iPhone X Promotions On Black Friday Renew Wireless Price War?Telecom Stocks To Watch And Industry NewsCable TV's Hail Mary: Hike Broadband Prices Amid Cord-Cutting

100,ABC,"Airport Security: Anyone standing in an endless security line at the airport can at least take comfort in the fact that it's keeping air travel safe. Right? Wrong. It turns out that the government-run TSA repeatedly fails to do its job properly.XABC News learned this week that undercover agents from Homeland Security were able to sneak weapons and other banned objects through TSA checkpoints most of the times they tried. The findings are classified, but when ABC asked its source whether the failure rate was 80%, the source said ""you are in the ballpark.""The news prompted Rep. Mike Rogers to tell TSA head David Pekoske, ""This agency that you run is broken badly and it needs your attention.""That's the understatement of the century.The TSA was created in the aftermath of 9/11, when lawmakers decided that airport security was best handled by a federal agency and staffed by unionized government employees, rather than private contractors who had been doing the screening.Not surprisingly, it made matters far worse.In 2006, agents with fake bombs got past TSA screeners 75% of the time at Los Angeles International and 60% of the time at Chicago O'Hare — two of the busiest airports. The public didn't learn about these results until 2007, when USA Today managed to get its hands on a classified report. TSA officials dismissed the findings by saying that the tests were too hard.In 2008, CNN reporters filmed a tester as he successfully got a mock bomb through security at the Tampa airport.In early 2015, undercover agents from Homeland Security got contraband past security checkpoints at the nation's busiest airports 67 out of 70 times. That's a failure rate of 96%.The acting director of the TSA was reassigned in the wake of those 2015 findings, and the agency said it had set out to ""implement a series of actions, several of which are now in place, to address the issues raised in the report.""But later that year, Homeland Security did a second round of testing and concluded that ""the test results were disappointing and troubling. ... The failures included failures in the technology, failures in TSA procedures, and human error. We found layers of security simply missing.""Now we have fresh evidence that in the two years since then there's been little progress.Most likely the solution to these chronic failures will be to throw more taxpayer money and fancier technology at the TSA. ""The Trump administration must invest innovation security to strengthen TSA effectiveness,"" said Democratic Rep. Bennie Thompson, who is the ranking member on the House Homeland Security committee.Never mind that this approach has never worked before. A few years ago, for example, the TSA dumped $160 million for body scanners that routinely failed to catch illegal items. Before that, it spent $44 million on ""explosive trace detectors"" that an investigation said it didn't need.There's a better solution: Fire the TSA.Then bring back the private inspectors who've been shown to do a better job. That 2005 audit, for example, found a far-lower 20% failure rate at San Francisco International Airport, which still used a private security firm. That is comparable to an FAA test conducted in the late 1980s.Unlike government-run operations, private firms have a powerful incentive to do their jobs efficiently and well, since if they failed at TSA rates they would be out of work.Only in government can an organization repeatedly show that it is incapable of doing its job and then expect to be rewarded with a bigger budget.RELATED:Fire The TSATSA Spent $160 Mil For Scanners With A 96% Failure RateNo, Budget Cuts Aren't Why You're Waiting Hours To Get Through Airport SecurityClick here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

101,ABC,"Islamic Terrorism: It didn't take long before we learned that the alleged New York terrorist who plowed into pedestrians in a well-planned attack that killed eight had been on the government's  radar. That makes 10 terror attacks over the past eight years carried out by Islamic extremists ""known to authorities.""Shortly after the attack, President Trump blasted the misbegotten Diversity Immigrant Visa Program, signed into law in 1990, which enabled Sayfullo Saipov to enter the country. Under the program, 50,000 are awarded visas by lottery if they're from countries that otherwise wouldn't send immigrants to the U.S.At the start of 2010, the year Saipov came to the U.S., the State Department under President Obama announced that it was going to use the program to bring in thousands of immigrants living in terror watch list countries.Rep. Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., said at the time that ""There are a lot of holes in this program in terms of security and in terms of fraud.""Republicans have been trying to kill the visa lottery for years (the House passed a bill in 2012 that was later blocked by Democrats in the Senate). There are two bills in Congress now to get rid of it, and Trump has been calling for its termination.So Trump is right to attack this program. Had it not existed, Saipov likely wouldn't have been in the U.S. and those eight people would be alive today.But there's a deeper problem that's been exposed, yet again, by the New York attack.It turns out that Saipov wasn't some lone wolf who came out of the blue. Like just about every other terror attack since 2009 — both here and abroad — he had attracted the notice of federal officials before he killed.ABC News reported on Wednesday that the FBI had interviewed Saipov in 2015 about possible ties to suspected terrorists, and that he was ""listed as a 'point of contact' for two men who were listed in a Department of Homeland Security counterterrorism database."" Nevertheless, agents didn't open a case on him.This has become a grim pattern. Islamic terrorists kill Americans, and almost immediately federal officials acknowledge that they had known about them.Ahmad Khan Rahami, who set off bombs in the Chelsea neighborhood of New York that injured more than 30, had been flagged two times in 2014, after a yearlong trip to Pakistan and after his father called to warn police about his suspicions.After Omar Mateen carried out his terror attack at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, in which 49 were killed, it came out that the FBI had interviewed him three times, and that there had been ""strong indications of radicalization.""Likewise, the terrorists who carried out attacks in San Bernardino, Chattanooga, Garland, Boston, Fort Hood, and Little Rock had all been on the FBI's radar. And in the case of two attacks that failed, but could have cost hundreds of lives — the ""underwear bomber"" and the failed Times Square bomber — officials later admitted they had missed warning signs.This isn't just a problem in the U.S. Recent attacks in the UK and France were carried out by terrorists who had been known to authorities in those countries.That was the case for two of the three Islamic terrorists who carried out a vehicle-and-knife attack on the London Bridge last summer, as well as the Manchester suicide bomber who killed 22 at a concert after having been repeatedly flagged by British authorities.French officials knew about two suspects who carried out an attack against police on the Champs-Elysees this summer. The 2016 car attack in Nice that resulted in 86 deaths was committed by a known Islamic extremist. Several terrorists who carried out coordinated attacks in Paris in 2015 had been known to authorities.On and on it goes.This raises some obvious questions that for some reason never get addressed after these attacks occur.If these people are all ""known to authorities"" beforehand, why didn't the authorities take more aggressive action? What are the Department of Homeland Security, the FBI, and all the other agencies whose mission is to protect American lives doing with the tens of billions of dollars they get from taxpayers each year?And how many other likely terrorists do the authorities ""know about"" who might right now be plotting attacks? What exactly are these agencies waiting for?Finally, how many other parts of the nation's immigration law are as ill-conceived and potentially dangerous as the Diversity Immigrant Visa Program?RELATED:The Left's Dangerous Denial About Radical IslamOnce Again, The Obama Administration Missed Terrorist Red FlagsMore Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.

102,ABC,"Politicizing Everything: When it comes to running a big business, politics can be poison. Don't believe it? A new survey shows just how polarizing a brand can become by strongly identifying itself with either side of a political debate.But a recent survey (hat tip to Zero Hedge) by Morning Consult looks at net favorability of major brands — that is, the share of those saying they have a ""favorable"" opinion of a company vs. the share saying they have an ""unfavorable"" opinion. Then, it's broken down by respondents' vote in the last election.XFor companies that have become embroiled in national politics in recent months, the news is not good. Many have become what Morning Consult calls the ""most polarizing"" brands in America.The National Football League is a good recent example. However you might feel about the players' ongoing protests of taking a knee during the national anthem to protest race relations in America, it's had a major negative impact on the NFL's corporate brand — or ""the shield,"" as the NFL calls it.At one time, the NFL was one of the most admired brands anywhere, especially among conservative voters. Not anymore.The Morning Consult data show a negative 24% favorability reading among Trump voters, a group that demographically was once a bulwark for the NFL. President Trump's criticisms of the players late in September seemed to further polarize opinion about the NFL.Maybe that explains the plunging ratings for football this year. During the first three weeks of the season, Nielsen reported NFL viewership was off 11% from a year earlier.""Ratings continue to go down; more people are saying they're watching less football because of the protests, so it's real,"" Rick Gentile, director of the Seton Hall University Sports Poll, told Morning Consult.But it isn't just the NFL. Indeed, despite the NFL's very public woes, it ranks only sixth among the most polarizing brands right now.The most polarizing brand of all, perhaps not surprisingly, is Trump Hotels. Among Hillary Clinton voters, Trump Hotels has a negative favorability of -54% — while Republicans give Trump's main business a 48% positive rating.Clearly, Trump's flagship hotel group mirrors the current stark political split in the American electorate.So if Trump is No. 1 and the NFL is No. 7, who are Nos. 2 through 6?As the chart shows, it's overwhelmingly the media. No industry is more polarizing. Indeed, of the top 15 most polarizing brands, 11 are media outlets. By allowing themselves to become politicized, the media have abandoned the pretense of objectivity and, by doing so, have shrunk their potential readership and viewership.No. 2 is CNN (-28%  favorability with Trump voters, +54% Clinton voters), No. 3 NBC News (+1% Trump voters, +72% Clinton voters), No. 4 the New York Times (-28% Trump voters, +47% Clinton voters), No. 5 MSNBC (-16% Trump voters, +54% Clinton voters), and No. 6 Fox News (-14% Clinton voters, +55% Trump voters).Never fear: Other media made the top 15, including ABC News, HuffPost, CBS, Fox Business, Breitbart and NBC Sports.Only two other nonmedia made the list: fast-food chain Chick-fil-A and outdoor sports purveyor Cabela's.Two major lessons come from this.One is, it's quite easy to get into political hot water and endanger your brand if you're a major corporation with a high public profile. It doesn't take much.Just take a very public political stand or, as was the case with Chick-fil-A, have one of your corporate founders sound off on a controversial debate, such as same-sex marriage.Or you can simply be associated with something controversial — as in the case of outdoors hunting, fishing and camping emporium Cabela's, which became a cause célèbre for gun-control activists after a Cabela's outlet sold guns to Las Vegas mass murderer Stephen Paddock..The second lesson is for the media. The media once were trusted in this country to tell the truth and report the facts, no matter how it affected one party or the other, Republicans or Democrats.Today, that's plainly not the case. Most of the media are held in exceedingly low esteem by the Trump-voting public (and Fox News, perhaps not surprisingly, is loathed by Hillary voters).One would think that, given the difficulties of running a business these days, corporate leaders would do all they could to avoid political controversies, especially those that have nothing to do with their businesses.To be sure, most of these companies will survive, and some even thrive. But by politicizing your image and reputation, you will limit your growth and profits.Sadly, we live in a time when nearly everything is politicized. Families have been split, friendships lost, and now companies are losing long-cherished customers as a result of letting politics interfere with serving their customers.The old saying is that you never talk about politics, religion or sex in public. Companies might want to remember that sage advice.RELATED:Memo To The NFL: Remember Your Middle Name NFL To Fans: Drop Dead — How's That For Lack Of Respect? Is The Tide Turning On Tech? Click here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

103,ABC,"CVS Health (CVS) isn't taking the threat from Amazon.com (AMZN) lying down.XNews that the drugstore chain is reportedly in talks to buy health insurer Aetna (AET) for more than $200 per share hit just after reports that Amazon has obtained wholesale pharmacy licenses in at least a dozen states.Aetna shares vaulted 11.5% to close at 178.60 on the stock market today. CVS shares fell 2.9%, recovering somewhat after the Aetna news followed the Amazon report. Amazon shares changed little during regular trading but surged 7.8% late after reporting quarterly results that sailed past estimates.Meanwhile, news about Amazon's pharmacy licenses sent Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) down 3.2%, while a host of drug distributors also got whacked.

A good starting point is to regularly review screens that highlight the top-rated equities.CVS and Aetna, which serves 22 million members, already had close ties, with Aetna signing up the drugstore giant's Caremark unit as its pharmacy benefit management partner this spring.In June, Tarun Mehra of the Fuld & Co. consultancy wrote that CVS should buy Aetna: ""CVS has an impressive suite of assets already, but if it were to add a health plan to its portfolio, it would create a truly large-scale integrated platform across retail, PBM, MCO (managed care organization), and a distributor joint venture (with Cardinal Health, providing CVS with a strategic advantage over UnitedHealth Group (UNH)-OptumRx.""Yet in just a few months, the potential entry of Amazon has shaken up the $300 billion prescription-dispensing industry, and analysts are now speculating that UnitedHealth could partner with Amazon.

104,ABC,"Election 2020: The wave of enthusiasm sweeping Democrats and liberal pundits for an Oprah Winfrey presidential run in 2020 shows just how bankrupt the party is of ideas and how bereft it is of credible national leaders.XTalk of talk show celebrity Oprah Winfrey running for president is hardly new. There were appeals going back more than a decade — ABC News ran a segment in 2003 called ""Oprah for President?"" Almost as soon as Trump won the 2016 elections, some were arguing that she was the person to beat him in 2020. But it was her acceptance speech at the Golden Globes over the weekend that created the tidal wave.Everywhere, Democrats and media pundits gushed about the prospect of Oprah running, even though none could identify a single issue on which she's taken a stand, and even though advocating for her goes against pretty much everything Democrats have been saying about what qualifies someone to be president.Take for example, the party's alleged devotion to issues. Oprah has taken no noticeable stands on any of them. She's claimed to have voted for both Democrats and Republicans in the past, and refused to publicly endorse any president until Barack Obama.Staying politically neutral was a smart business decision, since she didn't want to alienate any part of her fan base. But for all Democrats know, Oprah could be a New Democrat centrist. After all, as a successful businesswoman, she has, unlike most Democratic politicians, actually had to make payroll, deal with government regulations and pay enormous amounts of taxes. Putative conservative commentator Bill Kristol seems to think she's a closet moderate, at least, saying in a tweet this week: ""Oprah: Sounder on economics than Bernie Sanders, understands Middle America better than Elizabeth Warren, less touchy-feely than Joe Biden ... .""The problem is that a centrist Oprah would put her well out of the mainstream of the increasingly leftist Democratic Party, which insists its candidates endorse socialized medicine and attack the rich.What about her lack of experience? Democrats once insisted that at least some political experience was a prerequisite for the job — Obama, for example, blasted Trump during the 2016 campaign as ""uniquely unqualified"" because he'd never held office. Oprah has less experience at politics than Trump, who, by the time he threw his hat in the ring, had authored several books detailing his views on various issues.No Hidden Agenda: Get News From A Pro-Free Market, Pro-Growth PerspectiveOprah's record is so blank that when ""explanatory journalism"" site Vox.com set out to tell readers ""What we could expect from an Oprah administration,"" it provided absolutely no information on the topic.For the alleged ""party of science"" to gush over Oprah is especially amusing. It wasn't that long ago that Newsweek ran a cover story blasting Oprah for repeatedly peddling medical quackery on her show.""All too often,"" the article said, ""Oprah winds up putting herself and her trusting audience in the hands of celebrity authors and pop-science artists pitching wonder cures and miracle treatments that are questionable or flat-out wrong, and sometimes dangerous.""Oprah provided a massive platform for anti-vaccine advocate Jenny McCarthy, which prompted parents across the country to avoid vaccinating their kids and contributed to outbreaks of measles and whooping cough. She promoted Suzanne Somers' hormone therapy, which science has shown can increase a woman's risk of heart attacks, strokes, blood clots and cancer. She touted James Arthur Ray, whose $10,000-a-pop ""Spiritual Warrior"" retreat — which involved days of fasting in an Arizona desert before sitting in a sweat lodge — led to three deaths and got Ray convicted of negligent homicide.There's also the inconvenient fact that pundits don't get to anoint presidents, or even presidential candidates, in this country. They first have to get through the buzz saw of the primaries. Does anyone think that Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren or Joe Biden or whoever else is dreaming of taking on Trump in 2020 will simply step aside and hand the nomination over to Oprah because she's a billionaire celebrity?More likely, they will be busy hiring Fusion GPS to scour the earth for dirt in hopes of ruining the reputation Oprah and the sycophantic celebrity press have spent a lifetime protecting. How she'd respond to such attacks is a complete mystery.There's no doubt that Oprah Winfrey has an incredible rags-to-riches story to tell, and like Trump, she's been hugely successful in business. She deserves all the credit for this tremendous achievement, which she accomplished against long odds. Her story is a testament to what is great about America.But whether Oprah would make a good president depends entirely on the sorts of economic and foreign policies she'd pursue, about which we know absolutely nothing.In the meantime, the over-the-top response to Oprah's substance-free acceptance speech at a Hollywood award ceremony has left Nancy Pelosi as the voice of reason in the Democratic Party.""I think one of the arguments for Oprah is 45,"" Pelosi said, referencing the 45th president, Donald Trump.

105,ABC,"Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., once falsely accused President Ronald Reagan's CIA of all but causing urban cocaine dealing in the '80s. She claimed that Reagan, by working with Nicaraguan drug dealers to defeat the communists running that country, colluded with them to created the urban drug epidemic.Never mind that The New York Times, The Washington Post and the Los Angeles Times all debunked Waters' claim.XAt a town hall meeting about these allegations, Waters shouted, ""If I never do anything else in this career as a member of Congress, I'm gonna make somebody pay for what they've done to my community and to my people!""Yet as to ""Politico's"" bombshell claim that in order to negotiate a nuclear deal with Iran, President Barack Obama allowed an Iran-funded Hezbollah terrorist/drug-dealing mastermind who worked for Russian President Putin to continue to operate. Yet Waters, who calls for President Donald Trump's impeachment, has said absolutely nothing.How desperate was Obama to negotiate a nuclear deal with Iran?In his zeal not to offend Iran so he could complete the deal, Obama halted a George W. Bush administration investigation of drug and human trafficking by the Iran-funded terror group Hezbollah. According to ""Politico,"" the Obama administration angered investigators by interfering with and shutting down a well-funded and resourced Drug Enforcement Agency probe known as Project Cassandra.No Hidden Agenda: Get News From A Pro-Free Market, Pro-Growth PerspectiveIn ""The Secret Backstory of How Obama Let Hezbollah Off the Hook,"" Politico senior investigator Josh Meyer wrote about the investigation the government called ""Project Cassandra"" and Ali Fayad, a Hezbollah operative suspected of, among other things, using profits from drug-dealing to finance terror operations and to move weapons to Syria.Meyer writes: ""When Project Cassandra leaders sought approval for some significant investigations, prosecutions, arrests and financial sanctions, officials at the Justice and Treasury departments delayed, hindered or rejected their requests.""The Justice Department declined requests by Project Cassandra and other authorities to file criminal charges against major players such as Hezbollah's high-profile envoy to Iran, a Lebanese bank that allegedly laundered billions in alleged drug profits, and a central player in a U.S.-based cell of the Iranian paramilitary Quds force. And the State Department rejected requests to lure high-value targets to countries where they could be arrested. ...""Lebanese arms dealer Ali Fayad, a suspected top Hezbollah operative whom agents believed reported to Russian President Vladimir Putin as a key supplier of weapons to Syria and Iraq, was arrested in Prague in the spring of 2014. But for the nearly two years Fayad was in custody, top Obama administration officials declined to apply serious pressure on the Czech government to extradite him to the United States, even as Putin was lobbying aggressively against it.""Fayad, who had been indicted in U.S. courts on charges of planning the murders of U.S. government employees, attempting to provide material support to a terrorist organization and attempting to acquire, transfer and use anti-aircraft missiles, was ultimately sent to Beirut. He is now believed by U.S. officials to be back in business, and helping to arm militants in Syria and elsewhere with Russian heavy weapons.""Project Cassandra members say administration officials also blocked or undermined their efforts to go after other top Hezbollah operatives including one ... of the world's biggest cocaine traffickers, including to the U.S., as well as a major supplier of conventional and chemical weapons for use by Syrian President Bashar Assad against his people.""Recall that last year, The New York Times reported that Obama's point man on the Iran Deal, deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes, pushed the Iran Deal by peddling a phony narrative that Iran's ""moderate"" ayatollahs were battling the ""hard-liners.""This nuclear deal to supposedly halt Iran's march toward acquiring a nuclear bomb, Rhodes argued, and would strengthen the hand of the alleged moderates.Among those who questioned the logic of this deal was none other than Obama's first secretary of Defense, Robert Gates, who called it a ""hope"" that he considered ""unrealistic.""Gates, who left the administration before the Obama completed the deal, said, ""I think that the pursuit of the agreement is based on the president's hope that over a 10-year period with the sanctions being lifted that ... they will abandon their ideology, their theology, their revolutionary principles, their meddling in various parts of the region. And, frankly, I believe that's very unrealistic.""All of this is jaw-dropping. Equally incredible is the major media indifference to this big story. In the days following Politico's story, Fox News, the Wall Street Journal and the New York Post covered the story — but it was ignored by practically every other cable news and newspaper outlet.

106,ABC,"Media Bias: In the span of a few days, two major news outlets came out with huge Trump/Russia bombshells that blew up in their own faces. In both cases, the error involved getting something as simple as a date wrong.CNN was in a frenzy on Friday over an apparent scoop by reporter Manu Raju, who claimed that an email sent to President Trump, Donald Trump Jr, and others on the campaign — and dated Sept. 4, 2016 — offered Trump access to purloined WikiLeaks documents.The story, posted on CNN's website at 8 a.m. and carried the headline: ""Exclusive: Email shows effort to give Trump campaign WikiLeaks documents,"" claimed that the email had been ""described to CNN by multiple sources and verified by Trump Jr.'s attorney.""No Hidden Agenda: Get News From A Pro-Free Market, Pro-Growth PerspectiveA later update to the story also noted that Sept. 4 was also the day that Trump Jr first tweeted about WikiLeaks and Clinton.Raju noted that the ""timeline is important here,"" because the date on the email was more than a week before WikiLeaks posted these documents on its website.It looked like a genuine smoking gun — showing how Trump was colluding with WikiLeaks to spread documents hacked by Russia — and spread like wildfire across social media and on other news outlets.Except the story was completely bogus.Unlike CNN, the Washington Post obtained an actual copy of the email, and found that it wasn't sent on the Sept. 4th. It was sent on Sept. 14th — after WikiLeaks had posted the documents online and promoted that fact to the world.In other words, there was no story here whatsoever.One week before CNN committed journalistic malpractice, ABC News's Brian Ross announced to the world that ""Michael Flynn promised 'full cooperation to the Mueller team' and is prepared to testify that as a candidate, Donald Trump 'directed him to make contact with the Russians.' ""That story, too, looked like a smoking gun. It would show that Trump was in fact working with Russians prior to the election. In fact, the news was so shocking it sent the stock market reeling.But it, too, was false. The meetings in question all took place after Trump had won the election. In other words, they had nothing whatsoever to do with collusion or election meddling.These aren't the first or by any means the only examples of reporters rushing out some ""bombshell"" story, only to later admit they got key facts wrong. We noted several in this space a few weeks ago.Reuters and Bloomberg also botched a Trump story last week, when they reported that Special Counsel Robert Mueller had subpoenaed Trump's Deutsche Bank records. He hadn't.Even the liberal-leaning Politico noted that CNN's disaster ""extends (the) run of journalistic mishaps.""This sort of blatant journalistic malpractice, which seems to be getting more egregious the longer Trump is in office, is bad enough.Worse has been the reaction of fellow journalists, who instead of demanding higher standards from their peers, are busy making excuses, downplaying the importance of the screw-ups, or using these foul-ups as a way to attack Trump.Consider that in response to Raju's reporting fiasco, CNN said the network had ""followed the editorial standards process. Multiple sources provided him with incorrect info.""X So CNN's ""editorial standards process"" allows reporters to run Trump-bashing stories based entirely on a document it didn't have in hand, but that the Washington Post was able to obtain the same day? How reassuring.After Ross' epic error, ABC News initially issued a mild ""clarification"" to the story, and rather than firing him, it suspended Ross for all of a month.Meanwhile, other reporters, rather than using these failures to take stock of the impact that their raging anti-Trump bias is having on the credibility of their profession, circled the wagons.USA Today commentary editor Jill Lawrence, for example, decided to twist the episodes into an attack on Trump for his ""hypocrisy,"" because Trump has attacked the media for false reporting even though he has said things media have labeled as ""lies.""Lawrence even laughably — and lamentably — claims that Trump's ""attacks, falsehoods and secrecy are inspiring great journalism."" She goes on to say that ""The profession I love is going to emerge from the Trump era stronger than ever.""And they say Trump is delusional?New York magazine's Benjamin Hart suggested that only real problem with CNN's ""incorrect"" report was that it ""provides fuel for pro-Trump media.""It was up to independent journalist Glenn Greenwald to offer the correct analysis of the problem. In an article headlined: ""The U.S. Media Suffered Its Most Humiliating Debacle in Ages and Now Refuses All Transparency Over What Happened,"" Greenwald says that until the mainstream press gets its act together, ""their cries and protests the next time they're attacked as 'Fake News' should fall on deaf ears, since the real author of those attacks — the reason those attacks resonate — is themselves and their own conduct.""Amen to that.RELATED:Do The Media Hate Trump?

107,ABC,"Lucasfilm's ""Star Wars: The Last Jedi"" is ""the most epic, emotionally powerful,"" ""incredibly satisfying"" and ""what might be the best Star Wars movie ever."" And that's just what reporters are saying, as they breathlessly took to Twitter to share their spoiler-free impressions after attending the Walt Disney (DIS) Saturday night premiere in Los Angeles.As the second film in the new ""Star Wars"" trilogy, the latest addition to the franchise is already garnering comparisons to its middle-film predecessor, ""Star Wars: Episode V — Empire Strikes Back.""

108,ABC,"The network news divisions boast about how much they care about the truth and then rage against President Trump when he calls them makers of ""fake news."" But when it comes to the politicians they adore, especially those they wish would run for president, the truth takes a back seat.Exhibit A right now is Elizabeth Warren, who falsely claimed in a professional directory to be descended from Cherokee Indians, so as to be listed as a minority when she was hired as a professor. When Trump makes fun of her by calling her ""Pocahontas,"" the networks get oh so upset and call it a ""racial slur."" But they don't seem to care one iota about how American Indians feel regarding white people who take on a fake minority identity.The story broke during Warren's 2012 campaign against then-Sen. Scott Brown in Massachusetts. That May, liberal writer Garance Franke-Ruta summarized for The Atlantic: ""the progressive consumer advocate has been unable to point to evidence of Native heritage except for an unsubstantiated third-hand report that she might be 1/32 Cherokee. Even if it could be proven, it wouldn't qualify her to be a member of a tribe."" So a Senate candidate committed a race-based fraud. CBS broadcast programs touched the story once.No Hidden Agenda: Get News From A Pro-Free Market, Pro-Growth PerspectiveIn June, Nancy Cordes reported that Warren said her relatives told her of her Cherokee background. Then, Cordes aired this double-lie sound bite from Warren: ""I know my family's heritage. It's also been clear from the very beginning that I never got any special breaks from it."" If she knew her family heritage, why couldn't she document it? Why invent the heritage if not to derive advantages from it?Cordes then neatly bundled and threw away the entire controversy: ""Recent polls show most voters in Massachusetts don't think Warren's heritage is a big deal,"" she said. Those ""truth"" tellers implied that we shouldn't get too disturbed by a little lie to get hired at an Ivy League.NBC also touched it just once that year, on the ""Today"" show on Oct. 2, after David Gregory moderated a Brown-Warren debate. He asked Warren, ""Do you consider yourself a minority?"" She replied: ""I listed myself as Native American. ... It's part of who I am."" Gregory later asked her: ""Are you hiding something?"" Again, Warren lied: ""No, I'm not. I never used it for college, for law school or to get a job.""XOver and out.Just try to put those sentences together: ""I listed myself as Native American in a professional directory ... and I never used it to get a job.""In response, the ""facts first"" media simply walked away. To address this honestly was to call her a liar. PolitiFact has only seven rulings on Warren, four ""Mostly True"" and three ""Half True."" The site has never addressed this lie.By the way, ABC never covered this controversy in 2012.When Trump called her Pocahontas in 2016, the networks brought out the weasel words. ABC's Mary Bruce reported, ""Friday night, Trump hitting hard, attacking her for once claiming she was Native American."" Once claiming? She has claimed it for years. She claimed it throughout the 2012 campaign. She claimed it in five recipes she submitted to a ""Pow Wow Chow"" cookbook.The same routine continued this week when Trump called her Pocahontas while honoring Navajo code talkers from World War II. Nancy Cordes at CBS breezily recounted, ""It's a reference to the Massachusetts senator's past claims of Cherokee ancestry."" But she added: ""Democrats called it a racial slur. Warren called it disturbing.""It's disturbing, all right. It's disturbing that Warren routinely gets a pass on her lies. These are the benefits the liberal media hand out to their favorites.Click here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.

109,ABC,"Scandal: Just as the FBI and Justice Department is telling Congress that they haven't been able to verify anything of importance in the Trump/Russia collusion dossier, Special Counsel Robert Mueller has decided to cast a much wider net in his fishing expedition. Is this a coincidence? Or is it a sign that Mueller also realizes there's no there there?XShortly after it came to light that the Clinton campaign and the DNC had secretly paid Fusion GPS to assemble the so-called Steele Dossier, which Fusion then tried to fob off on reporters before the election, the press dismissed this bombshell by saying that the source of its financing was irrelevant because much of the dossier ""checks out"" or has been ""proven to be accurate.""But according to the Washington Examiner's Byron York, FBI and Justice officials recently told congressional investigators that after spending nearly a year and a half looking into it, ""they have not been able to verify or corroborate the substantive allegations of collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign outlined in the Trump dossier.""In other words, they've failed to verify things like: the alleged meetings of Carter Page with the head of Russia's state-owned oil company and a top official in the Putin government; the alleged meeting between Michael Cohen and ""Kremlin representatives""; or any of the other specific claims in the dossier that weren't already public knowledge when it was written.Mueller's initial indictments suggested that he's had no better luck than the FBI.The charges Mueller filed at the end of October against Trump's short-lived campaign manager, Paul Manafort, had nothing whatsoever to do with election meddling. And low-level campaign volunteer George Papadopoulos pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI not about whether he had contacts with people from Russia — which amounted to nothing — but about when those meetings occurred.As we noted at the time: ""This may be nothing more than a prosecutorial Hail Mary, thrown in desperation that something damning might be revealed.""What does Mueller do now? ABC News reports that he has requested ""a broad array of documents"" from Justice, not about collusion, but about whether the Trump administration did anything to obstruct the investigation that arguably never should have been launched in the first place.Mueller's investigators, according to ABC, want emails related to Trump's firing of FBI Director James Comey and Attorney General Jeff Sessions' decision to recuse himself. That includes emails sent within Justice, and any correspondence with White House officials.""The latest move suggests the Special Counsel is still actively digging into, among other matters, whether Trump or any other administration official improperly tried to influence an ongoing investigation,"" the story says.This could also be read as: Having failed to find any evidence of collusion, Mueller is now fishing around for something, anything, to justify the vast amount of resources being poured into his endless investigations.The mainstream press hasn't uncovered anything nefarious, either, despite spending a solid year looking for it. As we've noted in this space, all the bombshells they have breathlessly reported turned out to be duds, and much of what the press is now saying about the ""scandal"" is either wrong or exaggerated — such as that the dossier has been ""proven to be accurate.""So, let's recap: After nearly 16 months of investigating, the FBI and the Justice Department admit that they haven't been able to verify any of the most damaging Trump/Russia collusion claims in the DNC/Hillary Clinton financed dossier.Neither, apparently, has Mueller after six months of investigating.Nor has an army of investigative reporters who've been trying to prove the charges since November 9, 2016.Yet no one wants to let go of the story.With each passing day, this is looking less and less like a legitimate investigation and more like an attempt by the Washington establishment to stage a palace coup against a duly elected president.RELATED:Three More Trump/Russia 'Bombshells' Turn Out To Be Duds Deep State Run Amok?

110,ABC,"Comcast (CMCSA) and Verizon (VZ) are eyeing some of the assets of 21st Century Fox (FOX) for a possible purchase, it was reported late Thursday.CNBC said Comcast was looking to buy the same Fox assets that Walt Disney (DIS) was considering when it looked at a possible purchase of its crosstown rival's assets.Shares of Fox jumped more than 8% in after-hours trading on the stock market today. Comcast was up more than 1% while Verizon was flat. Dow Jones was reporting that Verizon was eyeing the assets.Disney was looking at most of 21st Century Fox but was expected to run afoul of regulators over owning two broadcast networks at once. Disney owns ABC. But the same would be said of Comcast, which owns NBC.

111,ABC,"The stock market loved reports that 21st Century Fox (FOXA) held (now-inactive) talks to sell its studio, TV and international assets to Walt Disney (DIS). But amid the enthusiasm, there's also some serious skepticism surrounding a possible union of Mouse and Fox — not just from analysts, but from some fans.XThe benefits of a deal are immediately visible: Disney would gain another powerful tentacle in movie studio 20th Century Fox, adding a slew of titles to its already enormous library of content. Disney's studio arm has had the sheen of invincibility in recent years as its hit machine cranks out flick after flick, and enveloping Fox's blockbuster franchises like ""Alien"" and ""Planet of the Apes"" surely wouldn't hurt. (Plus, Wolverine fans would be happy to have Fox's ""X-Men"" reunited with the Marvel family at Disney — fingers crossed for some crossover action.)Disney ""is arguably the best content engine in the world in our view and FOXA potentially offers an opportunity to fill in some key gaps,"" wrote RBC Capital Markets analyst Steven Cahall. ""If acquired, we think the resultant DIS would be the global content king.""And in an age of powerful streaming platforms like Netflix (NFLX) and Amazon (AMZN), Disney is potentially better positioned to compete with its arsenal of intellectual property than its budding stand-alone streaming service, which doesn't even go live until 2019.You'll recall that the Mouse delivered a couple of not-insignificant blows to Netflix's library by deciding to pull its movies off the platform's roster. Netflix, for its part, lured away ""Scandal"" creator Shonda Rhimes from Disney-owned ABC Studios. But even Netflix's planned $7 billion to $8 billion in content spending will have to contend with the deep bench at Pixar, Marvel, Lucasfilm, Walt Disney Animation and ABC Studios.Shares of Disney closed up 1% on the stock market today after rallying 2% Monday. Fox added 1.1% after surging 10% yesterday. Netflix fell 2.1%, and Amazon edged up 0.2%.IBD'S TAKE: On the search for even more stocks with actionable trading opportunities? Check out our Stock Lists page, where you can find stocks near buy zones, stocks hitting new highs, sector leaders, tech leaders, IPO leaders and more. Barclays analysts note that an acquisition of Fox's studio and TV assets would help Disney's streaming efforts down the line, bolstering RBC's recent argument that Disney's studio and theme parks segments are strong enough to continue liking the stock, despite concerns about ESPN's subscriber-growth struggles and the greater media network segment.Some of the eyebrow-raising, then, comes from the idea that Disney should avoid more TV troubles.Cowen's Doug Creutz, not bothering to hide his incredulity, says he ""can't believe this is serious"" and that the reported deal ""makes zero sense."" (Unlike Marvel fans, he sees less use in bringing ""X-Men"" into the fold.)""Investors who are bullish on Disney like it for the non-TV assets,"" he wrote. ""So why would Disney want to increase its exposure to TV? Disney already has plenty of scale, so adding scale isn't that helpful (and it makes the business more difficult to manage for whoever Iger's successor is).""And a Fox company that's left with just broadcast, cable news and sports networks is arguably worth a lot less than it would be in its current state.""In a world where content is getting more valuable, but networks are being devalued, this seems like it would be suicide,"" said Creutz.Movie buffs have their own concerns, in terms of creative output. Movie site Collider notes that Disney's apparent aversion to R-rated films could affect 20th Century Fox, which has released more adult flicks such as ""Logan"" and the Amy Schumer comedy ""Snatched.""""If Disney purchases Fox, what happens to Fox's slate? Do they stop making 'Deadpool' or do they try to make it PG-13 so that it fits with the rest of the Marvel Studios brand?"" asks Collider writer Matt Goldberg.Expect more chatter about this on Fox's and Disney's earnings calls, this Wednesday and Thursday, respectively.RELATED:8 Key Facts: What Disney's Rogue Move Means For Netflix SubscribersStreaming Content May Become King, But Who Will Wear The Crown?

112,ABC,"A Morning Consult poll released on Halloween offers a scary result for establishment Republicans. They tested the approval and disapproval ratings of current members of the U.S. Senate. Guess who was in the cellar. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell ranked dead last.Guess who came in second to last. It was Jeff Flake, the Arizona senator who's retiring because he wouldn't possibly be able to win a Republican primary next year. Guess who came in third to last. Sen. John McCain.Now take a look at who has the highest approval. Sen. Bernie Sanders came in first, with 71% approval. Right behind him, with 67%, was his fellow leftist from Vermont, Patrick Leahy.What lesson can we take from this particular survey? It starts with the media elites. When the media love a leftist, that only helps them with their base. ""The friend of my friend is my friend,"" as it were. It also endears them to independents, since the media portray leftists as feisty populists for the common man, not as the over-regulating, super-taxing socialists they are.On the other hand, when the media love a Republican, that causes great problems with the Republican's conservative base. It's ""The friend of my enemy is my enemy."" It's one obvious reason why McCain, despite (or, more accurately, because of) media valentines, couldn't defeat President George W. Bush in the 2000 primaries.Trump voters cannot stand McCain's personal crusade against Trump. The media desperately want Republicans to attack Trump as viciously as they do, but getting on the wrong side of Trump is a perilous place to be.Sen. Flake's speech on the Senate floor announcing the inevitable — that running for re-election would be fruitless — made him the toast of MSNBC. Joe Scarborough gushed, ""This was our 'Mr. Smith Goes to Washington,' where you had a senator saying on the floor that the president of the United States in his party was a threat to constitutional norms, societal norms and our children."" Predictably, Chris Matthews also dragged out the Jimmy Stewart movie reference, comparing Flake's speech to ""a moment straight from a great novel or movie.""When a Republican is the toast of MSNBC, he's toast with conservatives.Let's stipulate that McConnell isn't a media darling like the two Arizonans. It's easy to recall how the journalists who want Trump impeached/indicted had a conniption when McConnell said out loud in 2010 that his first goal was to deny Obama re-election. They reacted like he'd slapped the pope in the face while kicking Santa Claus in the groin. But to both right and left, McConnell represents Entrenched Washington, and right now, he embodies the disgust conservatives feel for having many of their policy aims sidelined and/or squashed.Not every senator fits the formula. The fourth least popular senator is Robert Menendez, D-N.J., who's now on trial for felony corruption charges. Of note: His rotten approval rating cannot be connected to national media coverage, since he is a Democrat. Forget accusations against Trump, or indictments against former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort. We are talking about a trial in which the defense has now rested. And the evening-news coverage on ABC, CBS and NBC? Zero.Corruption, in the eyes of our partisan media, is solely a Trump problem, just like colluding with Russia to manipulate the election, or hating facts you find inconvenient. When Republicans agreeably proclaim that only Trump is ruining Washington on all of these things, they are trapped in the liberal-media mind meld.

114,ABC,"Let's look at two pictures side by side and see if we can tell how they're different. In one panel, we see a famous TV political analyst who apparently had the charming habit of pressing his erect, if clothed, penis against the bodies of young women who worked with and for him. That was Mark Halperin.In the second panel, we have former President George H.W. Bush, in a wheelchair, age 89, posing for a photo with a number of others, including his wife Barbara, and an actress called Heather Lind. Lind says she felt moved to share her trauma after seeing the benefit concert for Hurricane Harvey relief in which five former presidents participated. It seems that people are unaware of President Bush's criminal record:""When I got the chance to meet George H.W. Bush four years ago to promote a historical television show I was working on, he sexually assaulted me while I was posing for a similar photo.""He didn't shake my hand. He touched me from behind from his wheelchair with his wife Barbara Bush by his side. He told me a dirty joke.""And then, all the while being photographed, touched me again. Barbara rolled her eyes as if to say 'not again.'""Fortunately, Lind immediately related the outrage to her ""fellow cast-mates and producers"": ""(They) helped me that day and continue to support me. I am grateful for the bravery of other women who have spoken up and written about their experiences.""Ah, yes, the brave women who stand up to sweet, 90-something guys with a form of Parkinson's. The brave women who put those completely honorable, polite and respectful guys who were war heroes and served their country in their place.Sorry, Ms. Lind, you're not brave. You're a twit. At the very worst, Bush did something tasteless. As you admit, the cameras were rolling the whole time. How awful can it have been? He's very old. People's judgment declines, especially if they're unwell. But you've made a fool of yourself for equating a pat on the tush from someone who couldn't possibly do you any harm to ""sexual assault."" You are either hysterical or cynical. I'm guessing the latter. You figured you'd jump on today's bandwagon and grab your moment in the spotlight. Instead, you've embarrassed yourself.What must the women Halperin targeted think when they compare their situations with Lind's? A woman who had worked with Halperin in 2004, when he was political director of ABC News, described a meeting in his office:""The first meeting I ever had with him was in his office, and he just came up from behind — I was sitting in a chair from across his desk — and he came up behind me and (while he was clothed) he pressed his body on mine, his penis, on my shoulder. I was obviously completely shocked. I can't even remember how I got out of there — (but) I got out of there and was freaked out by that whole experience. Given I was so young and new I wasn't sure if that was the sort of thing that was expected of you if you wanted something from a male figure in news.""There are several reasons to take the story about Halperin seriously — as MSNBC clearly does in announcing his temporary departure from the network. One is that five women have offered very similar stories. Another is that Halperin, while quibbling over details, does not really deny the allegations.""During this period, I did pursue relationships with women that I worked with, including some junior to me. I now understand from these accounts that my behavior was inappropriate and caused others pain. For that, I am deeply sorry and I apologize. Under the circumstances, I'm going to take a step back from my day-to-day work while I properly deal with this situation.""Sorry, Mr. Halperin. You don't ""pursue relationships"" by grabbing women and pressing yourself on them. As much of a turn-on as it may be for you, it's a violation for them. You ""now understand""? No. You always understood. Of course you did. You know that everyone deserves respect, and that women in particular should never have their dignity compromised in the way you apparently compromised theirs.What Halperin is accused of, if true, is squalid. The story about Bush, though, demonstrates how common sense flies out the window once the pack is in full cry.Click here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

115,ABC,"Russia Collusion: In one of his Thursday evening tweets, President Trump complained once again about the ""Fake Media,"" this time for not covering a fresh scandal involving an Obama-era uranium deal with Russia. Does Trump have a legitimate beef? You be the judge.By any objective measure, the story that The Hill broke on Tuesday was shocking. According to documents unearthed by the news outlet, in 2009 the FBI had uncovered evidence of a sweeping, illegal Russian scheme to boost Vladimir Putin's atomic energy business, which included bribery, kickbacks, extortion and money laundering.The FBI had also obtained an eyewitness account that Russian nuclear officials ""had routed millions of dollars to the U.S. designed to benefit (the Clinton Foundation).""That's eye-opening in and of itself. But the findings are even more alarming when you understand the context.  While the FBI was learning about these illegal Russian activities, Russia's state-owned nuclear company Rosatom was trying to acquire mining rights to 20% of the uranium in the United States through its purchase of Canadian-based Uranium One.XTo do so, however, they needed to get approval from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. Sitting on that committee were Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Attorney General Eric Holder. In 2010, the committee unanimously approved the sale of Uranium One to the Russian nuclear company.In other words, while top Obama administration officials were deciding whether to hand over control of one-fifth of the nation's uranium supplies to Russia, the FBI had piles of evidence that officials at Rosatom were flagrantly violating U.S. laws and possibly compromising national security. The FBI also had evidence that officials had directed millions of dollars to Hillary Clinton's family charity, creating a clear conflict of interest.But as the Hill notes, none of this information was made public before the Obama administration approved the sale.Even more intriguing, key people at the FBI at the time of the Uranium One deal are now spearheading the special counsel probe into allegations that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia to swing the November election.Needless to say, this raises a lot of important questions. Did the FBI keep the Committee on Foreign Investment in the dark about its findings? If so, why? Did Clinton, or Holder, or anyone else involved in the sale's approval know about this investigation? Why did the FBI wait until after Hillary had stepped down from State before taking action on the case? What role did those donations to Hillary's charity — as well as lucrative speaking fees to Bill — play in all this?Keep in mind, too, that neither The Hill, nor the key reporter on this story, John Solomon, can be dismissed as conservatives with an ax to grind. The Hill has a sterling reputation for fairness in Washington. And Solomon's career includes stints as assistant Washington bureau chief for the Associated Press and as a national investigative correspondent for the Washington Post.Yet despite all this, the mainstream press has completely ignored this story.As of Friday, we couldn't find a single mention of it on the websites of ABC News, NBC News, CBS News or CNN or USA Today. MSNBC devoted a few minutes to the story on air on Thursday.The New York Times, the Los Angeles Times and the Washington Post ran a perfunctory AP story that was focused not on The Hill's revelations, but on Trump's tweet about the lack of media coverage. The AP story contained a one paragraph summary of The Hill's new findings.The Washington Post ran a separate piece, but it was aimed at dismissing the significance of what The Hill had uncovered, while complaining that conservatives were ""jumping waaay ahead of the facts.""That complaint is amusing coming from the Washington Post, which has repeatedly jumped waaay ahead of the facts, to the point of repeatedly getting them wrong, on the wafer-thin Trump-Russia ""collusion"" story.But, OK, let's concede that there's still a lot we don't know about this story.How does that explain the utter and complete lack of interest on the part of the mainstream press in getting those facts? It's not as if they don't have the resources and passion to pursue complex scandals that involve top political officials. You'd think some of that talent could be spared to determine whether the Obama administration ignored evidence of criminal activity in order to hand Russia a major strategic asset.Instead, we're reading commentaries about why the press is right not to cover this because there ""is lots of smoke, but not a bit of fire."" That hasn't stopped the press from falling all over itself in pursuit of a puff of smoke — which has yet to materialize — on the Trump-colluding-with-Russia story. Isn't it the job of reporters to dig out the facts, rather than ignore a story until all the facts are in?The reason for the media's silence on this story has nothing to do with its merits, and everything to do with who might be hurt by it.RELATED:Senate Investigates Russia, Hillary Clinton, Obama, Uranium And Bribes — And It's About TimeObama Administration, Hillary Clinton Covered Up Their Deep, Corrupt Ties To RussiaYes, The Russia Scandal Is Real — And It Involves Hillary ClintonComplete coverage of the Clinton Foundation Scandal.Click here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

Here's how Netflix, Disney, Amazon and others match up.Essentially, at some point, Netflix will stop ramping up the amount it spends on content, and find a balance between shows produced in-house and shows acquired from elsewhere.But not anytime soon.

118,ABC,"CNN is airing a bizarre new advertisement with the motto ""Facts First,"" which insists that the network calls an apple an apple, even if critics of its ""news"" reporting argue it's a banana. You see, CNN is interested in objective truth, not opinions. This would be like McDonald's advertising with an apple and saying the company is all about health food.Our ""news"" networks don't deal with facts first. They sell us narratives, and the favorite is the wild speculation about what might happen next to President Trump. For months, they have speculated about how meetings with powerful Russians would be the end of Trump. From Jan. 20 to Oct. 20, the Media Research Center reports, the ABC, CBS and NBC evening-news shows alone gave that story just over 1,000 minutes.But ObamaCare? Budget and taxes? Immigration? A possible nuclear war with North Korea? All are second bananas. It's Trump-Russia, Russia-Trump day in and day out.The Russia narrative they prefer is this: Donald Trump won the presidency due to the help of an autocratic foreign power. But in the last week, a series of investigative reports by The Hill have brought something altogether new to the discussion: facts. And the facts are implicating former President Obama's administration, specifically Hillary Clinton, in some astonishingly unethical, if not illegal, behavior with the Russians. The publication reported:Countless other publications assert that nine investors in Uranium One jointly donated a cool $145 million to the Clinton Foundation.This reads like a fascinating spy novel, but ABC and NBC have offered nothing. Let that sink in. CBS aired one question (and one answer) on ""Face the Nation"" that lasted 69 seconds. CNN, which has spent hour after hour obsessing over Russian collusion with Trump, can hardly be bothered with this narrative.That's ""Facts First"" — media style.Naturally, the usual dishonest Clinton defense emerged: This was ""old news."" When author Peter Schweitzer wrote about this issue in 2015 (without the new developments), he was virtually ignored. And if he was interviewed, hostile treatment is an understatement. Here's how NBC's Savannah Guthrie dealt with ""facts"" back then. She asked Schweitzer: ""Before we get into some of the details, let's put it bluntly: Are you hoping that this book and the issues you raise in it torpedo her candidacy?"" He said no, but she shot back: ""a lot of your critics say, 'Look, you are a conservative and that this is a right-wing hit job.' Are you really claiming to be neutral here?""No one is neutral in the pro-Clinton press corps. Facts never come first.RELATED:Clinton Foundation Scandal Why Is The Press Ignoring The Exploding Clinton-Russia-FBI Scandal? A Crime Or Just 'Baloney'?

119,ABC,"Rich Frank was the newly appointed head of television at Paramount Studios when he attended one of his first table reads. That's where the writers, actors, directors and producers sit around a large table — hence the name — and for the first time collectively read the new script out loud.In this case it was for an episode of ""Laverne & Shirley,"" and when it was over, producer/writer/creator Garry Marshall announced: ""The big boss is here."" He turned to Frank, and asked if he had ""any comments.""Frank said he liked the script, but ""on page eight, I think there's a joke that doesn't work.""No one said anything until Marshall broke the ice: ""Then we're going to sit here until Rich gets a better joke.""It was, Frank recalls, ""an awkward moment.""""Then Garry came up to me privately and said, 'You're welcome here. But don't just criticize.'""That was a great lesson.""It was, in fact, a lesson he continued to use at Paramount Television, where he helped shepherd such hit shows as ""Cheers,"" ""Taxi"" and ""Family Ties"" to success and then a decadelong career at Walt Disney (DIS), where he served as president of Walt Disney Studios and oversaw the development of the Disney Channel.He then went on to a second career as a vintner, building what became known as the Frank Family Vineyards from a 200-case-a-year operation to one that currently sells 100,000 cases annually.All of which is not bad for a guy from Brooklyn who really didn't know what he wanted to do when he grew up. He attended the University of Illinois, starting out in the school of architecture and moving to the school of engineering before, in 1965, getting his B.A. in marketing with a minor in journalism.""I finally found something I could do that everybody else wasn't better at,"" Frank said in one of two telephone interviews with IBD.When he graduated in 1965, he went to work at an ad agency in the media department, planning where to place and buy ads. Then he ""switched sides,"" selling ads for a couple of rep firms (who sell ads for media that don't have their own sales force in a particular area). He became sales manager for a Los Angeles television station and ultimately was hired by Chris-Craft Industries to run its television division.The company — better known for its mahogany-hulled boats — owned several TV stations — and placed Frank in charge. The television landscape was much different then — with no cable and only three major networks. The independent stations that existed were mostly limited to repeating shows that had already run on one of the Big Three networks.Frank contacted Michael Eisner, then president of Paramount Studios, to see if he'd be interested in creating original content for Chris-Craft and presumably other independent outlets.Eisner ""called me and invited me to lunch,"" Frank remembered. ""He said, 'I really don't like your idea, but I want you to come here and help us start a fourth network.' ""Frank joined Paramount, and while the launch of the new network did not work out, he was named president of television at the company, where he was responsible for launching numerous successful shows.After a shake-up at Paramount parent Gulf + Western Industries, Frank followed Eisner to Disney, where he was named head of Walt Disney Studios. There his winning streak continued.Asked what he attributes his success to, and one word pops up regularly in his reply: learn.""I think I understood the television business, having first started buying time at (ad agency) BBDO and then selling time at multiple stations around the country. You learn what works in different markets. And then when I went to be a sales manager at an independent station, I learned how that worked — and again at Paramount. I never stopped learning.""His management philosophy is equally simple: ""I'm responsible for overall strategy; (the people I hire) are responsible for how to get it done. I believe in hiring the right people and allowing them to do their job.""I also believe that they should have the right to make mistakes. The people I protect the most are those who've tried something that didn't work, rather than those that just sit there and are complacent.""Certainly complacent is not an adjective ever applied to Frank, who often took sizable risks in his career. He OK'd ""The Golden Girls"" TV series when the conventional wisdom — and the advice of almost everyone around him — said America wasn't interested in a show about four, uh, mature women living in a Florida retirement community.Similarly, he had an idea for a daily syndicated entertainment news program that everyone said was unfeasible. Remember, that was 37 years ago, when computers had less power than an early iPhone and many if not most television stations didn't have the satellite equipment necessary to receive a daily feed.Undeterred, Frank explained, ""We financed stations to install satellites."" One seemed a bit reluctant, ""so we had a kid every day after we shot the show drive the tape to Bakersfield.""The concept of the show was so new and foreign to the TV playing field that Frank had to negotiate new union rules — so that movie industry regulations concerning the number of lighting and sound people that went out on shoots could be modified.That show, of course, was ""Entertainment Tonight,"" which, he said, ""changed the industry and changed the entire world of TV now.""His willingness to push the boundaries of technology doesn't surprise Bob Gazzale, the president and CEO of the American Film Institute. Frank joined the AFI board in 1991 and serves as its vice chair even today, a volunteer position. Frank was also the longest-serving president of the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences, the organization responsible for the Emmy Awards.Gazzale said that despite Frank's ""extraordinarily busy schedule, if and when I need Rich he's always there.""""Perhaps his greatest contribution,"" Gazzale added, ""aside from the generosity of time, spirit and resources — is his visionary take on the art form that AFI celebrates. ... From movies to television to streaming to gaming to VR ... Rich has always carried the flag for what's next.""Ironically, a portion of his success also can be attributed to Frank's past — that he never strayed far from his Brooklyn Everyman roots.""I think I have the same taste as most Americans,"" he said. ""I think I know what people want to see, who they want to see and what they want to see them in. I'm good at picking talent and have a crazy sense of humor. In a nutshell, I have commercial tastes.""Perhaps the best example of that occurred when he spotted an unknown comedian named Tim Allen at a comedy club doing his grunting male routine. Although Frank concedes that there are ""so many people involved in so many projects,"" it was that sighting that led Disney to produce the show ""Home Improvement,"" starring Allen, which ran eight seasons on ABC.Even shows as successful as that one have shelf lives, and so do jobs. Following the untimely death of Disney corporate president Frank Wells in a 1994 helicopter crash, the vibe at the company changed.So Rich Frank left, content to do some consulting work and spend more time at his weekend vacation property in California's Napa Valley. That home started as a respite from work and included eight acres of grapes, which he allowed a neighbor to harvest in return for a few cases of wine that Frank could share with friends.But Frank got a call from a buddy — winemaker Koerner Rombauer (nephew of ""The Joy of Cooking"" author, Irma Rombauer) — that a nearby vineyard was for sale. Frank and Koerner decided to partner on what was initially known as Frank-Rombauer. (Around 2000, for a number of reasons including estate planning, Rich bought out Rombauer's interest and renamed the winery Frank Family Vineyards.)As Frank recalls, the winery he purchased, Kornell Champagne Cellars, was producing 100,000 cases and losing $3 a bottle. You didn't have to be a genius to realize that was an unsustainable business model. So he and Rombauer, who spent much of his time at his own winery, immediately cut production to 200 barrels a year.Frank understood the old wine industry axiom that the quickest way to make a small fortune in the business is to start with a large one. He quickly — and here's that word again — learned the major ins and outs of the business and realized that he had to use the same principles in the wine business that he used in the entertainment industry that made him sufficiently wealthy to buy a Napa Valley winery in the first place.So he made a point to hire a quality GM and winemaker, Todd Graff, to guide him through the morass. He understood the difficulty of distribution, with 50 states each having its own liquor laws. So he expanded territories very slowly, always keeping the bottom line in mind. And he understood the importance of a good and popular tasting room, the only place he received full value for his wines.Ultimately, though, he understood that more than anything, the bottom line depended on the quality of grapes in the wine. ""I compare a bottle of wine to a movie script: If you don't have a good script, you don't have a chance of success.""So he decided to go beyond the law. According to state regulations, you have to lay a bottle of sparkling wine down a year before it can be sold. He laid his down for three years to enhance the flavor. And his new Lady Edythe brand (named after his mom), he lays down for five years.It delays his return on investment, but ultimately he virtually assures one.After a successful career as a top Hollywood executive, he chucked the limos and private jets to become a vintner.Overcame: The need to apply what he learned in corporate life to life on the farm.Lesson: Sometimes the answer is simple.Quote: ""I wasn't sure we ever would make money, but I was pretty sure I knew how to make money. In its simplest form it was make good wine and sell it for more than it cost you.""MORE ABOUT LEADERS & SUCCESS:Jane 'Dr. Quinn' Seymour Nurtures Her Lifestyle BrandThe Larger-Than-Life Career Of 'King Kong' Producer Merian CooperMichael Landon's Largest Role Was In Fostering Family Values On TVNina Tassler Used Her Outsider's Insight To Succeed At CBSBob Wright Took NBC From Broadcasting To The Modern Media Universe

120,ABC,"SEATTLE — Amazon, which has made this city the epicenter of a retailing revolution, is not the Northwest's only commercial disrupter. In the nearby city of Everett, Liberty Ziska and some other bikini baristas, giving new meaning to coffee as a stimulant, have provoked the City Council to pass, unanimously, ordinances requiring baristas to be less nearly naked when they work. The baristas, in turn, have hired a lawyer and made an argument that is germane to current disputes about freedom of speech. Their argument, they might be surprised to learn, is Aristotelian. Sort of.Everett has not succumbed to Pecksniffian Comstockery: The police chief and city attorney allege that bikini barista stands attract a clientele that sometimes behaves badly, and that some of the baristas do, too. The city reports ""a proliferation of crimes of a sexual nature occurring at bikini barista stands,"" which it primly suggests has something to do with ""the minimalistic nature of the clothing worn by baristas."" Seattle's ABC affiliate reports that ""in 2014, the owner of Java Juggs pleaded guilty to running a brothel out of several stands."" Henceforth the baristas must wear at least shorts and tank tops. The new dress code cannot be faulted for vagueness. Indeed, it has notable specificity (it mentions the ""bottom one-half of the anal cleft"" and is even more detailed about breasts) that has the baristas incensed about the examinations and anatomical measurements that law enforcement might require.What makes this a matter of more than mere ribaldry is that the baristas have unlimbered heavy constitutional artillery. They fire it in ways pertinent to the manner in which freedom of speech is debated and defended — or not — where it is most important and most besieged: on campuses. The baristas say:The ordinances banning bikinis violate the First Amendment because they are ""content-based and viewpoint-based restrictions"" that ""impermissibly burden and chill"" their freedom to ""convey their messages of female empowerment, positive body image"" and other things. Their bikinis are ""a branding message"" communicating ""approachability and friendliness."" The ordinances regulate only speech ""common and fundamental"" at bikini barista stands, targeting them ""because Everett does not agree with their message"" and restricting ""channels of communication."" Ziska says that if clothing covers the tattoos on her legs, arms, wrists, back, neck and hips she cannot have such interesting conversations with customers. Brittany Giazzi and Leah Humphrey argue similarly about their piercings and scars, respectively.Never mind the baristas' further barrage of allegations in their everything-but-the-kitchen-sink complaint — e.g., that the ordinances are ""an equal-protection violation"" because they target women (""a protected class"") and do not burden men. Instead, note how strenuously, even imaginatively, Ziska and her co-workers strain to argue teleologically.In recent lectures at Georgetown and American universities in Washington, Greg Weiner, an Assumption College political philosopher and frequent contributor to the Library of Law & Liberty website, urged participants in the campus arguments to reason as Aristotle did. That is, to be less deontological (rights-based in their advocacy) and more teleological (ends-based). To argue deontologically is to treat speech as an autonomous good, regardless of its moral or social purpose, if it has one. To argue teleologically is to stress why — for what purpose — we should value speech.Aristotle — here he was not the baristas' ally — defined human beings as language-using creatures, which makes the expressive value of tattoos, piercings, body parts, etc., less than fundamental. The Supreme Court's First Amendment jurisprudence, Weiner notes, has generally accorded the most robust protection to speech, and speech that is political, broadly defined — concerned with securing the goods of self-government. The fundamental purpose (telos), although not the only purpose, of the right to free speech is to protect a panoply of other rights.So, the First Amendment rightly protects not just speech but ""expression,"" and a free society should give generous protection even to expressions that serve no public purpose, but just make the expressing persons happy. But speech about the pursuit of truth, justice and other important public matters — the sort of speech central to academic institutions — merits more rigorous protection than the baristas' right to display, among much else, their tattoos, piercings and scars.Everett should have some latitude to balance other public goods against the expressive pleasure and even commercial advantages that Liberty Ziska and her colleagues derive from sartorial minimalism. Universities should protect almost absolute freedom for arguments about politics, classically and properly defined broadly as the subject of how we should live.More Political News and Commentary from Investor's Business DailyLearn how to make more money in stocks at IBD University.

121,ABC,"Shares in Walt Disney (DIS) and cable TV operator Altice USA (ATUS) rose on Monday after the two companies avoided a programming blackout with a tentative deal to carry Disney programming on Altice's cable network.XAltice and Disney didn't disclose terms of the contract renewal, announced Sunday, which involves roughly 3 million homes in the greater New York City area and nearby states.UBS analyst Doug Mitchelson said the outcome appears good for Disney, which he says will likely negotiate next with Verizon Communications (VZ).""We believe that Disney likely accomplished its goals with this renewal and set itself up well for its full renewal cycle,"" Mitchelson said in a report. ""We believe Disney's next meaningful renewal will be with Verizon toward the end of next year.""Shares in Disney rose 1.3% to close at 99.87 on the stock market today. Altice stock climbed 0.9% to 27.56.Netherlands-based Altice Group entered the U.S. market by purchasing New York-based Cablevision Systems in 2016 and Suddenlink in 2015. Its U.S. operations, Altice USA is the fourth-biggest U.S. cable TV company, behind Comcast (CMCSA,) Charter Communications (CHTR) and Atlanta-based Cox Communications.IBD'S TAKE: If you want to understand the state of the market, read IBD's Stock Market Today columns throughout the market day, and the end-of-day The Big Picture (take a free trial) for timely market analysis and highlighted growth stocks breaking out of proper bases.Sports channel ESPN is Disney's biggest moneymaker.

122,ABC,"The fall premieres have begun on prime-time TV, and just when you thought we couldn't sink lower into the cesspool, there are new ""milestones"" for the liberal cultural commissars to honor. The Daily Beast reported with great pride that the Amazon show ""Transparent"" will have TV's first transgender full-frontal nude shot, during a massage scene. They're also cheering NBC's reboot of the LGBT ""ally"" comedy ""Will & Grace,"" with new insults about Republicans for their gay friends, like Newt Gingrich is a ""man, but he's aged into a lesbian.""What the elite television critics will not endorse are three new shows with military themes, offering what Time magazine calls a ""calorie-free take on American patriotism."" They are ""SEAL Team"" on CBS, ""The Brave"" on NBC and ""Valor"" on The CW. Cynics can suggest these shows are aimed at President Trump supporters, but no one can say Hollywood thought Hillary Clinton would be hiking in the woods at this point when they developed these programs.The producers may have trouble selling these shows abroad, The Hollywood Reporter suggested, quoting an executive for a Swedish TV network: ""These shows are all really well-made and the production values are great, but some of it is pretty jingoistic: lots of breast-beating and flag-flying.""Time TV critic Daniel D'Addario declared, ""War provides an innately compelling hook for these shows, but there's something unpleasant and hectoring about how bluntly incurious they are about what it all might mean."" He's using a term — ""bluntly incurious"" — that served as their working definition of George W. Bush.It's apparently too trite, too predictable to portray soldiers as hardworking people, and that terrorism is bad. The Time critic lectured how ""true patriotism means wanting one's homeland to be the best it can, not just repeating three times a week that it already is.""In other words, the storyline's mission should be to find flaws in America.D'Addario recoils at the tough talk. On NBC's show, the deputy director of the Defense Intelligence Agency lectures: ""We are fighting people that want to wipe us off the planet. That means we have to be as ruthless as they are."" Later, another character declares: ""I'm not saying I'm gonna enjoy killing these guys, but you kidnap a woman, you get what you deserve.""So what's wrong with that? Apparently, when bad guys kidnap Americans, you should fix it with hugs and affirmations. ""These shows seem to be trying to provoke a vengeful growl from the audience,"" Time's TV critic complained. ""'Homeland,' in its lesser moments, had similarly nasty paranoid outlines. But that show has been more adept at moral ambiguity.""By ""moral ambiguity,"" he surely means turning the ""nasty paranoid outlines"" back on the U.S. government, the ""national security state."" That's what ""Homeland"" did, and that's what satisfies the left. Or take the ABC series ""Quantico,"" which ended its season in May by exposing a Trumpesque president taking orders on merging the FBI and the CIA from ... Russia.Maybe these military shows will find an audience, and maybe they won't. But critics have underlined they'd rather watch ""milestones"" of transgender nudity than a show that might glamorize and humanize Navy SEALs.

123,ABC,"The National Football League has at least paid attention to the most critically important two-part lesson in the never-ending debate on values. The first part of that lesson being that there is no line — none — many on the far left won't cross in their ""win at any cost"" battles waged against ""traditional"" thought and values. The second part being that Republicans, conservatives and Christians eventually cave.Every single time.With regard to the current ""controversy"" pitting those Americans who rightfully believe NFL players — and the copycats now popping up in other sports and on the floors of Congress — should never ""take a knee"" during the playing of our national anthem in protest over fill-in-blank issue against the leadership of the NFL, the owners know they simply have to wait a few weeks at the most before Republicans, conservatives and Christians roll over and go silent.That's what Republicans, conservatives and Christians do.Precisely because they do believe in the rule of law, decency, morality, respect for authority and a higher calling in life, there are many lines they will not cross in protest against the left or against conduct they feel is disrespectful to our nation, our flag, or their values.They also work harder than any people on earth. Unlike many on the left, they don't have the luxury to wake up in their mommy's basement whenever they feel like it and then go out to protest or deface and destroy that which was built with the blood, sweat and tears of others. They are too busy paying the taxes that are then misappropriated to entitle the entitled.That has always been the secret weapon of the left. They not only know that, but have calculated that hard work and decency into every protest they have waged and every movement they have started over the last few decades.The leadership of the NFL and the owners of the teams also know that liberals and the far left control the media, entertainment and academia and that those three largest megaphones of our nation are now being used 24/7 in support of the ""take a knee"" movement.The most glaring example of that being far-left ""sports"" network ESPN bashing President Trump on all of its programs and various channels.  Apparently, a player taking a knee has a right to his opinion, but not the president of the United States.Even if the leadership of the NFL and the owners did want to side with the majority of Americans offended by these players taking a knee during our national anthem, they know it would be a losing cause simply because ABC, CBS, NBC, CNN, MSBNC, NPR, the New York Times, the Washington Post, USA Today, the Los Angeles Times, and almost every major newspaper and most local TV stations are populated by liberal, politically correct hires who side with the ""courageous"" NFL protesters. Players who don't even know what they are protesting anymore or how long the protest should go on. The only thing they know for sure is that they are ""winning.""They need only look at those protesting against Confederate symbols for inspiration. Every week, the list of monuments that should be torn down because they offend the far left has grown because of each previous success.""No matter how outrageous, ignorant or dangerous our demands,"" the far left thinks, ""Republicans, conservatives and Christians — along with various mayors, city and town councils — simply give in. What can we tell them next that must be eradicated from American history?""The NFL players, their union and the copycats are now using that template to expand the list of that which offends them.If the NFL players truly wanted to be ""courageous,"" they would take a knee in protest over the 4,000 people a year being shot in Chicago — many of them women and children. They would take a knee in protest over the fact that millions of inner-city children are being denied an education and any hope of a life free from poverty. They would take a knee in protest against the public employees and unions which have bankrupted almost every city, county and state in our nation and taken billions of taxpayer dollars that could have been used to help the poor.They could take a knee against those things but they won't. Because that would involve thinking for themselves. Most would rather protest in ignorance than speak out against policies that truly are decimating communities and destroying lives.In the meantime, the ""take a knee"" protests will grow, the fans will come back, and Republicans, conservatives and Christians will lose … again.

124,ABC,"Even though CVS Health (CVS) and Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) have repeatedly thrown cold water on the idea that Amazon.com (AMZN) will take on the $300 billion prescription dispensing industry, the idea just won't die.XOn Thursday, Bernstein analyst Lance Wilkes seemed to up the ante on Amazon's rumored interest in the sector, saying he expects it to happen. According to a write up from TheFly.com, Wilkes sees Amazon either buying or partnering with a pharmacy benefit management company, which would help drive volume and navigate industry regulations.Wilkes has been working in and covering the health care services arena for a quarter century, so his perspective that Amazon is well positioned to disrupt the industry may carry weight with investors. He noted his concern that Amazon's entry could negative effect PBM industry earnings.The report about Amazon is likely a longer run concern for investors, so the pharmacy focus Thursday was on weak sales from Rite Aid (RAD), which cited ""a challenging reimbursement rate environment"" and new generics holding down prescription prices as it reported earnings.Amazon shares added 0.6%, heading back toward its 50-day moving average. Rite Aid shares tumbled 11% to 2.03, hitting a four-year low on the stock market today. CVS, which is both drugstore and PBM, slipped 0.3%, while Walgreens lost 0.8%. Walgreens this month won FTC approval to buy 1,932 Rite Aid stores after a long battle to buy all of its smaller rival fell apart due to regulatory objections.Dow component UnitedHealth Group (UNH), which operates the OptumRx pharmacy benefit management company, rose 0.8% but lagged behind the solid gains seen by other managed care players. Express Scripts (ESRX), the largest pure-play PBM, was 0.2% higher.The health care group suffering the most on Thursday were drug distributors. McKesson (MCK) fell 1.4%, AmerisourceBergen (ABC) 1.75% and Cardinal Health (CAH) 1.7%.If Amazon were to enter the pharmaceutical industry, some industry watchers have speculated that it might cut out distributors and deal directly with drug manufacturers.IBD'S TAKE: IBD premium features are free through Oct. 8.

""In an environment where there's a migration to more value-based care, those clinical capabilities are going to continue to grow in importance.""Merlo said the ""highly regulated"" industry has high barriers to entry, and noted all the work required between pharmacists, payers and physicians. He added that patients put trust in their retail pharmacists, adding that mail-order pharmacy has declined in recent years.Some have speculated that Amazon could use Whole Foods locations as a place for in-store pharmacy pickups.RELATED:This $300 Billion Market Could Be Amazon's Next Casualty — Or NotRite Aid Stock Crashes On Same-Store DeclineStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth Stocks

125,ABC,"A majority of the public backs the key elements of the tax reform plan outlined by President Trump and the Republican leadership in Congress, including a sharp reduction in the corporate income tax rate and the doubling of the standard deduction, according to the latest IBD/TIPP poll.But Trump's approval rating took a tumble this month, dropping to 33% and nearly erasing the gain he made last month.The poll also found that nearly half say athletes should be disciplined by the NFL for protesting during the national anthem, and 33% say they're less likely to watch an NFL game because of the protests by football players.The national poll was conducted from Sept. 29 through Oct. 8, and includes a sample size 887, giving it a margin of error = +/-3.4 percentage points. The October IBD/TIPP poll asked several questions about specific proposals in the GOP tax plan, and found that each one gained majority support.These findings stand in stark contrast to polls that showed limited support when the public was asked about ""Trump's tax plan"" in general. An ABC News poll found that just 44% backed the plan when described that way.A Morning Consult poll also found little support when the public is asked generically about the Trump tax plan (47% approved). But it, too, found strong support for most of the individual pieces: 62% say doubling the standard deduction should be in the tax bill, 61% cutting small business taxes, 60% boosting child tax credit, 52% getting rid of the death tax.Trump's approval rating took another beating, dropping five points to 33%, while 61% disapprove. Last month, 38% approved while 57% disapproved. That drop brings Trump close to where he was in August, when his approval rating stood at a low 32%.""The most significant declines in Trump's approval rating, according to our data, came from southerners, conservatives, millennials and women,"" noted Raghavan Mayur, president of TechnoMetrica Market Intelligence, which conducts the IBD/TIPP poll.Trump's support in the south plunged 14 points, going from 48% in September to 34% in October. Among conservatives, it went from 72% to 63%; millennials, 33% to 22%; women, 34% to 26%.Trump's favorability rating went from -20 points in September (38% favorable to 58% unfavorable) to -26 points in October (33% favorable, 59% unfavorable).More than half (53%), say Trump is providing weak leadership.As a result, the proprietary IBD/TIPP Presidential Leadership Index dropped 9.2% in October to 36.5, the second lowest of Trump's presidency.""Trump's feud with the mayor of San Juan provided his critics with an opportunity to criticize his ability to lead during a crisis. On the national anthem controversy, many Americans disapprove of the president's harsh language in his criticism of professional athletes who kneel during the anthem, though they may agree with his overarching message of patriotism,"" Mayur said.The failure to get ObamaCare repealed and Trump's outreach to Democrats hurt his ratings among conservatives, he noted.""Finally, his public disapproval of cabinet officials like Jeff Sessions and Rex Tillerson, along with the recent revelation of Tillerson's criticism of the president, does not reflect the high expectations many have assigned to Trump's dream cabinet.""The public was fairly evenly split on the question of whether football players should face disciplinary action, such as a fine, for not standing during the national anthem, as allowed for in the Game Operations Manual.Nearly half (49%) said the league should punish those athletes, while 46% said it shouldn't.More than three-quarters of conservatives (79%) favor punishing those athletes, but just 17% of liberals do.Generationally, support for punishing those athletes climbs with age, with only 35% of millennials backing punishment, compared with 46% of Gen-Xers, 56% of young boomers, 58% of old boomers, and 62% of those over age 71.Regionally, enforcing the national anthem guideline gets its strongest support from rural Americans (63% of whom say the athletes should face disciplinary action), and the least support among urban dwellers (41%).By gender, the split is 55% men vs. 44% of women who favor enforcing the policy.Meanwhile, a 33% say they're less likely to watch NFL games because of the protests, nearly three times as many as say they're more likely to watch (12%). Fifty-four percent say it makes no difference.NFL ratings have declined since the controversy erupted last month.In other findings:Methodology: The October IBD/TIPP Poll was conducted Sept. 2-Oct 8. It includes responses from 887 people nationwide, who were asked questions by live interviewers on cell or landline phones. The poll's margin of error is +/-3.4 percentage points.The IBD/TIPP Poll has been credited as being the most accurate poll in the past four presidential elections, and was one of only two that correctly predicted the outcome of the November elections.RELATED:IBD/TIPP Poll: Presidential Job Approval, Direction Of CountryClick here to get more Political Commentary and Analysis from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market.

126,ABC,"Disney (DIS)-ABC Television Group is said to be planning to cut about 10% of its annual budget, a move that could include up to 300 layoffs across several Disney-owned channels by the end of September, according to the Wall Street Journal.ABC, ABC Studios, ABC News and local TV stations will reportedly take the biggest hit, and Disney Channel and Freeform's staff will also be impacted. Variety sources said that no head count has been formally determined yet, and that Disney's aim with the restructuring is to free up more resources for content development.Disney's rivals, both in the traditional entertainment space and burgeoning streaming arena, are pumping resources into original and licensed content.Netflix's (NFLX) content chief Ted Sarandos recently told Variety that the company is likely to up its content spending to $7 billion in 2018 from $6 billion this year. The streaming heavyweight recently lured away ABC's hitmaker, Shonda Rhimes, the creator of ""Scandal"" and ""Grey's Anatomy.""Amazon (AMZN) Studios devoted an estimated $4.5 billion to content. Even Apple (AAPL) has put some money on the table, and is reportedly set to spend $1 billion on originals.IBD'S TAKE: Read IBD's The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.Meanwhile, Disney's premium sports cable network ESPN laid off about 100 of its 1,000 on-air employees in April as the company continues to be dogged by subscriber declines.RELATED:Streaming Content May Become King, But Who Will Wear The Crown?Netflix Plans To Spend $7 Billion On Content In 2018: VarietyCash-Rich Apple Ramps Up Original Content Spend Vs.

127,ABC,"In your search for great stock winners, one of the first things you should look at is a company's current quarterly earnings growth. Let's cut to the chase: Ideally, quarterly earnings per share should be rising a minimum 25% vs. the year-ago quarter.This is the 'C' in IBD's CAN SLIM investment methodology.Top-notch profit growth is one of the most important traits in stock market winners. These companies often build a substantial record of superior quarterly rises in earnings per share before taking off in price and hitting new high after new high. Why?Institutions see earnings as a barometer of a company's corporate health. Strong earnings increases, especially those in the most recent three-month period, mean that a company is not only healthy but also likely generating so much profit that it can use the excess cash to invest for future growth.IBD research of the biggest winners going back to the 1880s also shows this: companies with huge earnings gains are usually the ones that make a true impact in people's lives and the workplace.Sales are just as important. As you search for the best investments, be sure to check if the top line of a company's income statement (often stated as revenue) is growing at a fast pace, ideally 25% or more. For very large companies, double-digit gains may do the job.As noted in ""How To Make Money In Stocks"" by William O'Neil, IBD chairman and founder, Dell's earnings jumped 74% and 108% in the two quarters before its run-up from November 1996. America Online (before its merger with Time Warner) and Cisco Systems (CSCO) each put up triple-digit gains in their quarterly profits before starting their major moves.Dell, AOL and Cisco helped transformed the way we get information, communicate and do business, to say the least. All three grew into giant enterprises. All three produced enormous returns for stockholders.Theoretically, robust profit growth is a key fundamental driver of a company's stock price. The stock of a company that is performing better in its operations should command a higher price. Over the long term, there's no reason for the stock to move up if the company is not delivering higher or strong earnings per share for its shareholders.More recently, BitAuto (BITA), a Chinese online provider of automobile information and ads for consumers in the number two world economy, grew quarterly earnings 29% to 109% in the two quarters before it shot out of a seven-week consolidation in the week ended Oct. 4, 2013. The stock ran up more than five-fold before peaking at 98.28 in the week ended Aug. 29, 2014.The stock peaked and corrected sharply. Earnings hit a wall. But today, BitAuto is a high-growth machine once again and shares are picking up steam as the Chinese economy continues to expand and transform. In the past three quarters, earnings per share rose 18%, 78% and 9%. So, the average EPS growth over the past three quarters: a healthy 35%, meeting the 25% minimum gain as defined by CAN SLIM rules.Sometimes you'll notice that the rate of year-over-year growth may rise from quarter to quarter. Such acceleration is a bullish factor that indicates the company may be hitting full stride.Growth at some top companies will be in the triple digits, telling you that business is really booming.""During bull markets (major market uptrends), I prefer to concentrate on stocks that show powerful earnings gains of 40% to 500% or more,"" IBD chairman and founder William O'Neil wrote in the fourth edition of ""How To Make Money in Stocks."" ""You have thousands of stocks to choose from. Why not buy the very best merchandise available?""Investors can find stocks with fast quarterly earnings growth in Sector Leaders, Stocks Near A Buy Zone, IBD 50 and IBD Big Cap 20. Find all four of these powerful stock screens in the Stock Lists section of Investors.com.The EPS Rating gives you a quick gauge of a company's profit growth, but remember that this is a relative rating. For instance, a stock with a 79 EPS Rating simply means its long- and short-term earnings growth is better than 79% of all companies in the IBD database.So, please look deeper. Go to the Stock Checkup and see what was the exact percentage increase for the latest quarter. The Checkup tool will also show the average EPS gain over the past three quarters.When looking at earnings of top companies, it's not the absolute figure that is important. So don't pass up Company ABC if its latest quarterly earnings was 50 cents a share vs. $1 a share for Company XYZ. It's the percentage increase from the same period a year ago that's key.The earnings figures that companies report should be from their core operations. The numbers shouldn't include the sale of assets or other extraordinary gains. If a software company sells a piece of land, that gain should not be included in its operating earnings.IBD's TAKE: In the current IBD 50, the average EPS increase in the most recent quarter among the top five-ranking firms was 75.8%. See the actual figures and the entire list at the Stock Lists section of Investors.com.

128,ABC,"Netflix (NFLX) is dropping a billion dollars more on content next year, according to content chief Ted Sarandos in Variety's latest cover story.XThe company will spend $7 billion on content, up from this year's budget of $6 billion, and some of that money will no doubt fund the creations of ""Scandal"" and ""Grey's Anatomy"" mastermind Shonda Rhimes  who, it was announced Sunday, Netflix lured away from Walt Disney's (DIS) ABC Television Network.But most of that $7 billion is ""still licensed content,"" Sarandos told the publication. ""We're still a couple years from seeing it go 50-50.""Nevertheless, he sees that (original) content is king.""The more successful we get, the more anxious I get about the willingness of the networks to license their stuff to us,"" he said. ""That's why original content is critical, so subscribers feel like they can't live without Netflix.""That much is clear from Netflix and Disney's latest blows and counterblows over the past week. Disney announced plans to launch its own standalone streaming platform and pull Disney and Pixar movies from Netflix in 2019. And Rhimes' move from Disney's ABC to Netflix was a Hollywood shocker.IBD's TAKE: Will Disney still license its Marvel and ""Star Wars"" flicks to Netflix in the future? How much will Disney's over-the-top service cost? Here's the lowdown.Among other tidbits from the interview, Sarandos said that Netflix isn't headed for China yet, and that he doesn't see Amazon (AMZN) Studios as an apples-to-apples rival. In fact, he can't even wrap his head around Amazon's strategy to, unlike Netflix, release films in theaters first instead of taking them direct to streaming.""I frankly don't understand their strategy,"" he told Variety. ""I don't understand why perpetuating a model that feels more and more disconnected with the population is good.""Netflix shares ended trading down 1.5% to 168.50 on the stock market today.Disney inched up 0.1% to 101.51. Amazon edged down slightly to 982.74.RELATED:Netflix Poaches 'Scandal' Creator Shonda Rhimes From Disney's ABCNetflix Might Hold On To Disney's 'Star Wars' Movies After All8 Key Facts: What Disney's Rogue Move Means For Netflix Subscribers

Alibaba shares rose 10.4% for the week while Tencent gained 4.8%, both hitting new highs.

So what's surprised him the most about the Shark experience?""How many families watch the show together and how proud parents are when their kids are excited about business,"" Cuban told IBD. ""I never expected it to have the impact on them that it has.""Cuban, 59, was born in Pittsburgh's working class suburb of Mount Lebanon. At 12, he caught the entrepreneur bug, going door-to-door to sell plastic garbage bags in order to buy some expensive athletic shoes.He sold stamps and coins in high school and during a strike by Pittsburgh Post-Gazette workers, brought newspapers from the printer in Cleveland to Pittsburgh. He took his high school GED a year early and became a full-time student at the University of Pittsburgh. While there, he worked as a bartender, taught disco dancing and promoted parties to pay his bills. After his first year of college, he transferred to Indiana University in Bloomington because it had the lowest costs of any business school in the top 10. There, he continued to make money as a dance instructor while also operating the most popular bar in town.After graduating with a bachelor's degree in business in 1981, he got a job at a Pittsburgh bank, helping it convert from a manual operation to an automated computer system. In the process, he says, he not only learned about systems, but how big companies operate and middle managers think.His next gig involved trying to convince TV repair shops to join a franchise. And though he only sold one, he says there was a lot of value in learning about cold-calling and franchising.He moved to Dallas in 1982 in search of more fun and sun. He had little money, so became the sixth roommate in an apartment where he had to sleep on the floor or a couch. He got a job as a salesman at the city's first PC software retailer and learned the business by reading manuals every night. He went from living on bar food to making large commissions and doing consulting work outside regular hours, splitting his fees with the owners of the software business. But nine months into this, after asking another employee to open up for him so he could meet a potential client, he was fired for being absent from his job — even though he'd brought back a check from that meeting.In 1982, Cuban started MicroSolutions, a software reseller and system integrator — though he didn't own a computer. One of his first clients was Martin Woodall, who sold multi-user systems, and he offered Cuban office space and to pay him for attracting clients. Two years later, MicroSolutions had $85,000 in the bank — or so Cuban thought: His secretary had cleaned out all but $2,000 before disappearing.""What was done was done,"" Cuban wrote in ""How to Win at the Sport of Business,"" figuring that ""worrying about revenge"" and venting his anger at the bank were just ""a waste of energy.""Instead, his effort went into getting smarter. ""I would continually search for new ideas in books and magazines available to anyone,"" he wrote, ""but most people won't put the time in to get a knowledge advantage.""In 1990, he sold MicroSolutions for $6 million. His next venture, with partners Todd Wagner and Chris Jaeb, was AudioNet, which began with webcasting college basketball games. In 1998, they renamed it Broadcast.com, went public, and the next year sold it to Yahoo for $5.6 billion in stock.Cuban purchased the Mavericks in 2000 from H. Ross Perot Jr. for $285 million. The Mavericks had been longtime losers, but after Cuban revamped its player roster and built the team a new stadium, its fortunes revived. The Mavs qualified for the playoffs in 2001, then made it to their first NBA Finals in 2006. And although they lost to the Miami Heat that year, the Mavs came back to beat the Heat in 2011's finals to become NBA champs.What has Cuban learned from this experience that might apply to other businesses (other than the publicity that comes from being fined $2 million for arguing with officials)?""Good businesses are personal and the best are very personal,"" he said. ""Sports bring out emotions, as a great business should.""In 2001, Cuban joined Philip Garvin to launch HDNet, a high-definition network that eventually became AXS TV. And Todd Wagner has been Cuban's partner in other ventures, including 2929, which produces and distributes movies and TV content, owns Landmark Theatres, and has a stake in Lions Gate Entertainment.""As an investor, he has an intricate portfolio of organizations across a wide range of industries,"" said Michael Parrish DuDell, chief strategy officer of CouponFollow.com, who interviewed Cuban for his book ""Shark Tank: Jump Start Your Business."" ""He learned early on how critical it was to develop a keen eye for talent and empower that talent to share in the responsibility of leadership. It's no surprise he's helped so many people build extraordinary businesses.""Cuban replaced an original member of the ""Shark Tank"" panel in 2011, joining Kevin O'Leary, Barbara Corcoran, Daymond John, Lori Greiner, and Robert Herjavec. Broadcast on Friday nights, the series has had an average audience ranging from 5 million to 9 million in its eight seasons, and it was renewed for a ninth, and moved to Sunday nights, starting Oct. 1. It won the Emmy Award for Outstanding Structured or Competition Reality Program in 2014, 2015, and 2016.The power of ""Shark Tank"" to immediately impact tiny companies can be illustrated by the $100,000 that Cuban invested for 30% of Simple Sugars in season four. Owner Lani Lazzari had created a line of cosmetics as a teen to clear up her eczema and began selling it to others who had problems related to sensitive skin. She arranged to take off her senior year of high school for independent study so she could focus on growing her business. In the year leading up to her appearance on ""Shark Tank,"" she had 1,300 orders; within three days after the broadcast, she received 15,000.Mark Cuban's ""Rules for Startups"" from some of his most popular posts at www.markcuban.com and his real-time engagement platform, Cyber Dust, under +MCuban:Cuban says he used to be preoccupied with work 24/7, but by managing his time smartly, he's now able to put his family first. (He married Tiffany Stewart in 2002 and they have three children).""Mark Cuban has mastered the very thing most entrepreneurs struggle with the most — delegation,"" said DuDell.""Time is the most valuable asset you own,"" Cuban said. ""How you use it is the best indication of where your future is going to take you. Sell in the morning, keep your customers happy the rest of the workday, and push the envelope at night.""I used to be in the middle of everything, but I hire people I can build trust in, then let them take the ball and run with it.""Owner of NBA Dallas Mavericks and one of the investors on the hit TV program ""Shark Tank.""Overcame: Boring, poor-paying jobs with no future; he decided to learn something from each one.Lesson: Be brutally honest with yourself about the quality of your ideas, products, and services and why customers buy and at what price.""Passion for a particular business is overrated.

135,ABC,"The national media remain obsessed over President Trump's tweets, especially when they can be interpreted as racially inflammatory. Liberal sports journalists spent the summer hoping and wondering when the original national anthem kneeler, Colin Kaepernick, was going to get another quarterback job in the NFL. It never happened, so some (predictably) saw Racist America at work, punishing Kaepernick for his courageous stance (or kneel).President Trump apparently lost patience with this nonsense and tweeted: ""If a player wants the privilege of making millions of dollars in the NFL, or other leagues, he or she should not be allowed to disrespect ... our Great American Flag (or Country) and should stand for the National Anthem. If not, you're fired. Find something else to do!""Ka-boom. The left heard echoes of racism and censorship, as well as flag-waving patriotism, actions they always find distasteful and exploitative. The media leapt all over the controversy, which spurred cowardly NFL teams to make even stauncher displays of contempt for the flag. So they knelt, or arrogantly sat, or showboated by not coming out at all.Fans everywhere responded by burning their jerseys in disgust.This is nothing but counterproductive for the NFL. Showy protests during the national anthem dishonor the military and insult this country and all who live here. NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell, who would have disciplined Kaepernick for wearing green cleats, punted, as did the owners. The NFL wouldn't even let Dallas add a helmet sticker to honor police officers after five were shot dead at a Black Lives Matter protest.Kaepernick started this fight, insisting, ""I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color."" He was oppressed to the tune of $39 million over the last three years of his career. Millions of his supposed oppressors were not.But the media made it sound like Trump started this feud. ""Insulter in chief,"" announced ABC's Martha Raddatz on ""This Week."" Trump was ""attacking freedom of speech and star athletes."" Raddatz cited a new ABC News/Washington Post poll showing ""66% of all Americans, including nearly 4 in 10 conservatives think Trump has done more to divide the country than unite it. Instead of bringing the country together, he has proved to be a provocateur.""Black Lives Matter rioters and their athletic supporters are somehow never the provocateurs. Tactics like burning down buildings and throwing rocks and urine-filled bottles at the police aren't questioned. They're dismissed with journalistic weasel words like ""the protests were largely peaceful.""Blame President Trump. It's always President Trump. President Obama was presumed to be a uniter, which is to say the media projected him as one. The polls said he wasn't. Three years ago, the same ABC News/Washington Post poll found 55% found Obama to be divisive, and 38% disagreed. ABC News buried that poll in a dumpster.Instead they spun. They always spin for Obama. Washington Post political reporter Aaron Blake made excuses for the first black president: ""Of course, saying Obama is divisive isn't quite the same as blaming him for failing to unite the country. Some might see Obama as divisive just by the nature of who he is and/or think he didn't stand much of a chance to unite a very polarized country.""The liberal media are shameless hypocrites when they polarize the country and then complain the country is polarized. They have honored Kaepernick as some kind of ""star-spangled"" patriot and pushed his radical racial agenda. They have pressured the NFL and every other televised sports league to take liberal stands on everything from race to gun control to imposing transgender bathrooms.And when those leagues inevitably see their ratings drop, the media will try to claim this loss of popularity has nothing to do with politics ... just as they do about their own ever-declining ""news"" ratings.

136,ABC,"The latest telecast of the Emmy Awards on CBS drew the second-lowest audience ever, just 11.4 million, and that is no surprise. This show could not have been more predictable, quickly devolving into a boorish hourslong festival of Trump bashing and Hillary mourning.Awards shows used to be blockbusters for TV. But in the Age of Trump, they're becoming screaming political spectacles, like the infamous funeral/pep rally for Sen. Paul Wellstone in 2002. The red-state audience knows it's going to be a leftist hootenanny attack on conservatives all night long. Why put up with it? So they don't bother.Naturally, the Hollywood crowd gave out Emmy awards like candy to ""Saturday Night Live"" for its sneering satire of Donald Trump's presidential campaign. And Kate McKinnon thanked Hillary Clinton for her alleged ""grace and grit.""Jane Fonda recalled her film ""9 to 5,"" saying, ""Back in 1980 in that movie, we refused to be controlled by a sexist, egotistical, lying, hypocritical bigot."" Her co-star Lily Tomlin picked up the attack, saying, ""And in 2017, we still refuse to be controlled by a sexist, egotistical, lying, hypocritical bigot.""Got it.Picking up the Emmy for best actor in a comedy series for the FX show ""Atlanta,"" Donald Glover announced: ""I want to thank Trump for making black people No. 1 on the most oppressed list. He's the reason I'm probably up here.""Host Stephen Colbert even compared Trump to Walter White, the murderous drug kingpin at the center of ""Breaking Bad."" He joked: ""I thought you people loved morally compromised antiheroes. You like Walter White. He's just Walter Much Whiter.""Hilarious.There's another obvious reason awards shows have been slipping: who's nominated and who wins. Much like the Oscars, Emmy voters lurch toward excess, the egregiously sexy and violent and progressive/""transgressive"" products. Popular shows are often rejected because, well, they're popular, which must mean they're not smart enough or they're just too formulaic and predictable.Shows on the Big Four networks get slighted for cable networks and streaming services. Here are the top Emmy winners by network in 2017: 29 for HBO, 20 for Netflix, 15 for NBC and 10 for Hulu. By contrast, ABC won seven. Subtract NBC's nine awards for ""Saturday Night Live"" and it won only six. CBS got four.The Emmy for best drama hasn't gone to a broadcast network since 2006, and in that span, voters have given four to ""Mad Men"" (AMC), two to ""Breaking Bad"" (AMC) and two to ""Game of Thrones"" (HBO). A top-rated show like CBS's ""NCIS"" doesn't get nominated for Emmys ... unless you count ""outstanding stunt coordination."" But Logo's drag-queen show ""RuPaul's Drag Race"" won three Emmys in 2017.There's also little suspense when the same liberal favorites win Emmys over and over. Julia Louis-Dreyfus won her sixth Emmy in a row for HBO's ""Veep."" Yawn. It doesn't matter that the ratings are tiny. Jon Stewart's ""Daily Show"" won for 10 years in a row. Why tune in for that? And why don't the over-rewarded liberals have the decency to let someone else get an award? Why don't they redistribute Emmys?Hollywood loves to be ahead of the people, ""educating"" them along the path to progress. But it gets remarkably upset when the people refuse to follow it. The people are supposed to bend their minds agreeably as the entertainment elite sculpts the ""arc of justice."" A few swift kicks at the morons from the eminentoes on the Emmy stage are expected to work their magic.Check out all of IBD's Political coverage, including the award-winning editorial page.IBD can help you make more money in stocks.

She claimed, ""We don't control the media environment the same way the right does.""Call it The Vast Right-Wing Conspiracy 2.0.

But it's simply disingenuous — Clintonian — to state that policy drew 32 minutes of coverage in 11 months.Clinton also complained in her book that many in the media ""can't bear to face their own role in helping elect Trump, from providing him free airtime to giving my emails three times more coverage than all the issues affecting people's lives combined.""The footnote for that howler of a statement is an embarrassingly terrible study from Harvard University's Berkman Klein Center for Internet and Society; it's ""press"" sample included blogs and tweets and was judged by a computer, not actual humans.A Media Research Center study of stories from Jan. 1, 2016, to the day before the election found that the network evening newscasts devoted more than twice as much time to Trump's controversies (1,032 minutes) than to Clinton's (488 minutes). About half of that, 245 minutes, was on her use of a private email server.Nevertheless, CNN ""Reliable Sources"" host Brian Stelter respectfully aired several snippets of Clinton's laughable criticisms on his show.To her credit, reporter Amy Chozick, who traveled with the Clinton campaign for The New York Times, pushed back. ""It was a little bit like it was our job to get Hillary Clinton elected,"" she said. Bingo! She added: ""Don't forget they wanted to run against Donald Trump. They wanted him to get all the legitimate Republicans out of the way.""Chozick also argued that if Clinton had desperately wanted to talk about the issues and not her email practices, she did a terrible job of granting interviews.She stated: ""The Times probably put in 50 interview requests to talk about her jobs plan, economics, national security, foreign policy. I asked to talk about her time at the Children's Defense Fund, her work with women. ... They were very cautious. They said no to all of that.""One reason Trump dominated the airtime is Clinton refused to give a press conference for more than nine months. The press just accepted that. They didn't punish her for it. By contrast, Trump had 15 or 16 in that time span and granted a pile of interviews.All this demonstrates that the media display no self-respect when it's suggested they were all Trump lackeys without a conscience for the country.

140,ABC,"Walt Disney (DIS) might try to play hardball in talks with Netherlands-based Altice Group, a newcomer to the U.S. cable TV industry, analysts said Monday.XAltice entered the U.S. market after purchasing Cablevision Systems in 2016 and Suddenlink in 2015. Its U.S. operations, Altice USA (ATUS), is the fourth-biggest U.S. cable TV company, behind Comcast (CMCSA), Charter Communications (CHTR) and Atlanta-based Cox Communications.""Driven by accelerating subscriber losses we would not be surprised if Disney is being ultra-aggressive in its ongoing negotiations with Altice for renewal of carriage of (broadcaster) ABC, ESPN and the rest of its cable networks,"" said Jeffrey Wlodarczak, analyst at Pivotal Research, said in a note to clients.Neither Altice or Disney has disclosed ongoing negotiations for renewing a programming deal. Altice's U.S. shares fell 2.1% to close at 26.72 while Disney dipped 0.4% to 98.10.Richard Greenfield, analyst at BTIG Research has a similar view. He notes that Disney's sports network ESPN draws the highest fees from pay-TV companies but its viewership has been falling.""Unfortunately for Disney, their legacy practice of strong-arming distributors is no longer going to work,"" Greenfield said in a blog post. ""We believe this is especially true with a distributor that is taking a fresh look at the price/value of all programming as it has just recently entered the U.S. market.

141,ABC,"Would a fair society have exactly the same percentage of men and women, of whites and blacks and Latinos and Asians, in every line of work and occupational category? If your answer is yes, and that any divergence from these percentages must necessarily result from oppression, then you qualify for a job at Google.If not, forget about it.In your own lives you may have observed that few occupational categories — certainly not Google engineers — have such gender and ethnic percentages. You probably guessed that this results in part from people with different characteristics having different interests, talents and goals.But you're not allowed to say that out loud, as Google engineer James Damore did last month in an internally circulated 10-page memorandum entitled ""Google's Ideological Echo Chamber."" He cited the conclusions of neuroscientists and psychologists that measurable differences between male and female brain structure result in different behavior and preferences.""The memo was fair and factually accurate,"" writes Canadian neuroscientist Debra Soh in the Toronto Globe & Mail. ""Scientific studies have confirmed sex differences in the brain that lead to differences in our interests and behavior."" If you believe in evolution, it's easy to see how it could make women more nurturing and interested in working with people and men more aggressive and interested in working with things.Paradoxically, nondiscriminatory societies may see wider differences. ""Research has shown that cultures with greater gender equity have larger sex differences when it comes to job preferences,"" Soh writes, ""because in these societies, people are free to choose their occupations based on what they enjoy.""That's apparent in today's medical profession. Fifty percent of medical students are women: equity. But as psychiatrist/blogger Scott Alexander points out, male and female M.D.s tend to choose different specialties: 75% of pediatrics residents are women; 72% of radiology residents are men. Pediatricians work with people, radiologists with things.Damore's memorandum became public Aug. 6 when Gizmodo labeled it an ""anti-diversity screed."" Similarly inaccurate and slanderous characterizations were published by The Washington Post, CNN, Time, The Atlantic, Forbes, The Huffington Post, Vanity Fair, ABC News, Fox News, BBC, NBC News, Fast Company and Slate. ""I cannot remember the last time so many outlets and observers mischaracterized so many aspects of a text everyone possessed,"" wrote The Atlantic's Conor Friedersdorf.Far from lamenting diversity, Damore called for letting it flower. He criticized Google's diversity programs as counterproductive and suggested alternatives. But he doubted that the trade-offs required to boost Google's engineer employees from the current 20% women to 50% would be worth the cost to the business.In other words, he embraced the heresy of disbelieving the dogma that a fair society must have gender equality and proportionate ethnic representation in every occupational group.The punishment for heresy is, of course, excommunication. Damore was fired Monday.""Part of building an open, inclusive environment,"" said Google's vice president for diversity, integrity and governance, ""means fostering a culture in which those with alternative views, including different political views, feel safe sharing their opinions. But"" — key word — ""that discourse needs to work alongside the principles of equal employment found in our Code of Conduct, policies, and anti-discrimination laws.""Similarly, Google's CEO said Tuesday: ""We strongly support the right of Googlers to express themselves. However"" — key word — ""portions of the memo violate our Code of Conduct and cross the line by advancing harmful gender stereotypes in our workplace.""George Orwell would recognize this doublespeak: We totally support free speech except when we call it heresy. Tolerance requires repression.Ironically, for a company that makes money by transmitting information, Google's position is intellectually incoherent. What its CEO dismisses as ""harmful gender stereotypes"" are the conclusions, after years of painstaking research, of serious neuroscientists.And Google's tacit endorsement of the quasi-religious dogma that a fair society must produce gender balance and proportionate ethnic representation is at war with both experience and logic.Defenders of that dogma fear that rejecting it would justify gender and ethnic discrimination. But that's wrong. Just follow James Damore's advice: ""Treat people as individuals, not just as another member of their group.""The dogma is needed to justify the elaborate apparatus of gender and racial quotas and preferences and the lavish campus and corporate diversity bureaucracies to enforce them and stamp out heresy. As a reliable transmitter of free thought, Google seems headed down the path toward the Spanish Inquisition.

142,ABC,"Media Bias: Journalists rushed to the defense of two reporters after President Trump accused them of being ""reluctant to cover"" the scandalous tarmac meeting between then-Attorney General Loretta Lynch and Bill Clinton. But a review of the entire cache of email exchanges inside the Justice Department at the time shows that Trump has it right.Trump was referring to email exchanges between Justice public affairs officials and reporters from The New York Times and the Washington Post. The emails were among the 400-plus pages of internal emails that flew around at Justice soon after a local Phoenix reporter happened to get wind of the off-the-books Lynch-Clinton meeting on June 27, 2016 — just days before the FBI decided to drop its investigation of Hillary Clinton.In one email, Washington Post reporter Matt Zapotosky writes that ""my editors are still pretty interested in it, and I'm hoping I can put it to rest."" In another, New York Times reporter Mark Landler appears to complain that he's been ""pressed into service"" to cover the story.Reporters have been quick to say that those emails don't mean anything, because both newspapers carried stories about the meeting on their front pages.Scott Wilson, the Post's national editor, dismissed Trump's complaint out of hand by saying that ""Contrary to President Trump's characterization, the email in question shows our reporter committed to the Lynch-Comey story and working to report it as comprehensively as possible. … Our coverage was vigorous and aggressive from the moment we learned Bill Clinton and Loretta Lynch met more than a year ago in the Phoenix airport. Saying otherwise is factually wrong.""It's true what those journalists meant in those two emails is open to interpretation. But a number of other Justice Department emails released in this same batch make it abundantly clear that reporters were profoundly uninterested in this scandal.For example, the emails show that once news of this meeting got out, Justice officials hurriedly prepared talking points and an official statement about it. But Justice never issued the statement. Why?As Justice spokeswoman Melanie Newman put it an email to Lynch on June 28, ""We are holding on the statement for now. Given that there wasn't any follow-up in the press avail."" She was referring to a press event that took place in Phoenix that day, at which Lynch got a single question about her secret meeting with Clinton.Kevin Lewis, who was with Lynch at that event, noted in another email that ""we didn't get any follow up. Our justice reporter didn't follow up either.""When reporters had another chance to grill Lynch in Los Angeles on the 29th, they asked a total of two softball questions: Was it appropriate for you to meet with Clinton?  Was there an ""appearance of any impropriety""? That's it.As for TV coverage, there was almost none. Not even ABC News, whose local affiliate broke the story, bothered to tell its viewers about the secret meeting. CBS News offered only a brief mention.In fact, when the public affairs office collected clips of TV news programs on the 29th, it found that Fox News was the only network that had actually covered it thoroughly. You could almost hear the sigh of relief from the Justice PR shop.Yes, news outlets did cover this story. But can any reporter honestly say that they jumped on it ""aggressively and vigorously""? As aggressively and vigorously as, say, the wall-to-wall, out-for-blood coverage of the flimsy Trump-Russia story?Lynch's meeting did, after all, reek of possible collusion between the Clintons and Justice at a time when presidential candidate Hillary was under the threat of indictment. If it had involved Republicans, you can bet reporters would have unleashed their inner bloodhounds.The fact that we even know these Justice emails exist wasn't because of aggressive or vigorous reporting. We only know about them because the American Center for Law and Justice — not any mainstream news outlet — flushed them out.There are other oddities about the whole affair that came to light in the emails themselves, which the press appear equally uninterested in.For example, why was Justice sending talking points to the FBI? And why did Justice redact every word of all versions of the draft statement and talking points that Justice officials had written. In one email exchange, four pages are nothing but black ink.This makes no sense, given the fact the Justice officials commented in an email that Lynch ""stuck to the talking points"" at the press events, and since the official statement was only not made public at the time because of media disinterest in the story.It's not like we're talking about national security here. Why redact any of it?As the ACLJ's Jordan Sekulow put it, ""As more information comes out, it continues to show just how important this meeting was and just how corrupt it was.""Anyone who follows the news knows that the press is hopelessly biased. Even so, it's dispiriting when it's staring you right in the face.RELATED:The Bizarre Hacking Scandal That Democrats And The Press Are Happy To IgnoreMueller's Russia Probe Is A Political Hit Job: Rein Him In, Or Fire HimIn Abusing NSA Intelligence, Did Obama White House Commit A Crime?

143,ABC,"Disney (DIS) is going rogue with its content, choosing to drop its movie distribution pact with Netflix (NFLX) in favor of launching a Disney-branded stand-alone streaming service, starting in 2019. (The entertainment titan is also launching an ESPN-branded streaming service early next year that will offer supplementary content to the premium sports cable network.)XSo here's what you need to know about Disney's streaming plans — and what this means for your cable/Netflix/Hulu subscriptions.It will include: Disney movies, Pixar movies, previously run Disney-owned movies and television shows (which, yes, covers a lot of ground), and a lot of new content, too.Disney Chief Executive Bob Iger told analysts on the earnings call late Tuesday that the company will ""invest significantly in original movies and television shows exclusively for this subscription service.""Details on the call weren't crystal clear. Edward Jones analyst Robin Diedrich said the service could be more of a family- or kid-oriented product but that at this point, ""it's still just kind of wait and see.""Disney and Pixar movies. New movie releases — including ""Frozen 2,"" ""The Lion King"" and ""Toy Story 4"" — will find a streaming home on Disney's own platform once they go online.""U.S. Netflix members will have access to Disney films on the service through the end of 2019, including all new films that are shown theatrically through the end of 2018,"" Netflix told Reuters.No. Iger said the company was not planning on using the service to encroach on the theatrical window.""We do hope to use this service to give people the ability to buy, to download-to-own or download-to-rent Disney movies in the window prior to pay, which used to be called the home video window,"" he said. ""There is no reason why we shouldn't be doing that.""As far as we can tell, you've still got plenty of time to catch up on ABC's ""Scandal"" and Freeform's ""Pretty Little Liars"" on Netflix and Hulu. Disney's television content, for now, appears to be staying on other platforms. (Disney is a joint owner of Hulu, so it has good reason to want to keep its shows on that service.)Netflix's exclusive Marvel TV series will remain there, and Iger said Netflix has also licensed a number of ABC shows.""We hope they'll continue to do that,"" he said. ""This doesn't represent a change except on the Disney/Pixar side.""Oh, that little-watched movie franchise called ""Star Wars""? Disney hasn't decided what it's going to do about its Lucasfilm — or Marvel — flicks yet.Iger said it's ""possible"" Marvel and ""Star Wars"" films will continue to be licensed to pay services such as Netflix, but it's too early to make any announcements.There's also been ""talk"" about launching stand-alone proprietary Marvel and ""Star Wars"" services, he said, ""but we're mindful of the volume of product that would go into those services, and we want to be careful about that. ... It's all in discussion.""So basically: better watch ""Rogue One"" on Netflix while you still can.IBD'S TAKE: What's going on with Disney's increased stake in BAMTech? And its most recent earnings report? More questions answered here.No clue yet. Iger said that ""getting it right"" in terms of pricing — as well as programming and user interface — is a ""real priority for us as a company.""""What we're going to go for here is significant distribution because we believe one way to be successful in the long run is for both of these services to reach a maximum number of people,"" he said.""That shouldn't suggest a huge discount on what we might be able to charge, but it should suggest at least initially a very reasonable approach to our pricing.""No, at least not for Disney's stand-alone service.""We do not intend on the Disney product to have advertising,"" said Iger. But BAMTech's ""really strong ad technology"" means that potential ESPN streaming subscribers should expect ads of some kind.No. When an analyst asked for a status update on Disney and Netflix's relationship, Iger said ""there is no change from our side,"" adding that the company has had ""a great relationship with them.""(However, in what could perhaps be interpreted as Iger throwing a bit of shade at Netflix in an ""I made you"" sort of way, he added that Disney content ""represented real anchor programming for Netflix before they had an opportunity to ramp up their own original production, which they've obviously done aggressively and quite successfully."")RELATED:Nerd Alert: Disney Could Create Stand-Alone Marvel, 'Star Wars' Streaming Services

144,ABC,"Stocks opened in tightly mixed trade and quickly faded to narrow losses Thursday, despite strong early moves by Wal-Mart (WMT) and Tesla (TSLA).XThe Dow Jones industrial average opened a fraction higher, then fell back to just below its breakeven line, fighting to hold above the 22,000 level that the index topped for the first time on Wednesday. The S&P 500 traded down 0.1% as drug distribution giant AmerisourceBergen (ABC) and CenturyLink (CTL) dropped more than 5% apiece after weak Q2 reports.The Nasdaq Composite notched an incremental decline, as Apple (AAPL) backed off 0.3% after its 5% breakout surge on Wednesday, and as all four FANG stocks posted early losses, led by Netflix's (NFLX) 0.6% slip.On the Dow, Wal-Mart and UnitedHealth (UNH) led the index. Wal-Mart jumped 1.1% at the open. UnitedHealth rose 1%. Caterpillar (CAT) opened up 0.3%, boosted by an upgrade to neutral, from underweight, by Atlantic Equities.Tesla shares racked up a 7% gain as the company's late-Wednesday report showed a smaller-than-forecast loss and above-forecast revenue growth. Tesla shares are consolidating and finding resistance at their 10-week moving average, but tight closes across the past three weeks suggest institutional support as the stock forms a possible floor to its basing effort.Online postage innovator Stamps.com (STMP) was an early hero, up 31% after reporting a solid beat, with second-quarter earnings up 61% and revenue soaring 38%, as management also lifted its full-year earnings and revenue guidance to above consensus views. The gap up gain left the IBD 50 stock extended after its first test of 10-week support since a breakout in late May.Another IBD 50 name, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN), tacked on a 1% gain after reporting late Wednesday its second-quarter earnings swept past analyst targets. Revenue also topped views and management's sales guidance for Regeneron's Eyelea drug was better than expected.  The stock is working on the sixth week of a flat base, offering two buy points: at 526.22 and 543.65.Hotel operator Wyndham Worldwide (WYN) booked an early 3% gain. Single-digit growth in second-quarter revenue and earnings bested analyst estimates, and the company made official plans to split into two publicly traded entities. Wyndham shares were trading just below a 105.75 buy point in a five-week flat base.Aetna (AET) powered up 3% on strong second-quarter results, lifting shares easily to a new high.On the injured list, 3D Systems (DDD) fell 16% and Teva Pharmaceuticals (TEVA) skidded 19% lower after weak second-quarter reports.Early jobs data was positive, with employers announcing the layoffs of 28,307 workers in July, down 9% from June and the smallest count since November, according to the monthly jobs report from consultant Challenger, Gray & Christmas. U.S. employers also announced 88,000 hirings, the best July total on record.First-time unemployment claims eased to 240,000 in the week ended July 29, the Labor Department reported. That was down 2% from the prior week's claims and below consensus views for 244,000 new applications. Claims have remained below 300,000 — generally considered the level showing a healthy jobs market — for 126 weeks.At 9:45 a.m. ET, IHS Markit delivers its service sector estimates for July. June factory orders numbers from the Commerce Department and the July services index from the Institute of Supply Management are due out at 10 a.m. ET.Overseas, markets across Asia booked broad losses Thursday with Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index and the Nikkei 225 in Tokyo each falling 0.3%. In Europe, major indexes remained widely mixed in afternoon trade.

145,ABC,"The federal government will spend over $4 trillion in the current fiscal year. That's more than twice as much as it spent in 2000 and more than three times as much as it spent in 1990. The U.S. population has increased by only about 30% since 1990.With spending having increased nearly eight times faster than population, proposals to reduce spending could be considered quite reasonable. The media headlines say otherwise. However, if you look at the fine print, you'd see that the alleged ""draconian"" cuts don't actually reduce spending at all.Consider President Trump's budget proposal, released earlier this year. Over the last 10 years, total federal spending increased by 49%. The president's proposed budget calls for increasing it by 41% over the next 10 years. That's an additional $1.6 trillion dollars of spending in 2027 alone.Much ado has been made about Trump's large proposed cuts to Medicaid. In fact, he proposed increasing spending by 82%, from $378 billion in 2017 to $688 billion in 2027. Social Security spending would go up by 83%. Medicare spending would more than double (102%).The Washington Post's headline for these huge proposed increases in entitlement programs was ""Trump to propose big cuts to safety net in new budget, slashing Medicaid and opening door to other limits"" (May 21). New York Times: ""Trump's Budget Cuts Deeply Into Medicaid and Anti-Poverty Efforts"" (May 22)Recently, the House Republicans released their budget proposal. Under their plan spending would increase by ""only"" $1.3 trillion, a 32% increase. So, in 10 years, this plan would increase spending by more than population has increased over the last three decades.The House Republicans' plan would increase Social Security by 78% and Medicare by 76%. Medicaid would also increase substantially. Such ""mandatory"" programs, which are essentially on autopilot in the annual budget process, represent nearly two-thirds of federal spending. Any effort to scale back the size of the federal budget cannot include such large entitlement spending increases.One ""bright spot"" in the House Republicans' proposal: discretionary programs, which face a vote every year, would actually see lower spending in 2027. The reduction: $18 billion. That's a mere one-third of one percent of the 2027 budget.What do the headlines say about this budget that increases spending more than four times faster than expected population growth? Washington Post: ""House GOP unveils budget plan that attaches major spending cuts to coming tax overhaul bill"".ABC News: ""House Republicans release 2018 budget blueprint, which would slash social programs""The Atlantic magazine went so far as: ""House GOP Budget Plan Cuts Medicare and Social Security,"" a claim that is demonstrably false given the 76% and 78% increases proposed for those two programs.It may seem like we're in the Twilight Zone, but the explanation for this contradiction between the standard meaning of the term ""cut"" and its alternate usage in Washington budget discussions stems from an obscure feature of the federal budget process, known as ""current services budgeting."" The current services budget establishes a baseline against which future changes are measured. If spending does not grow as fast as the baseline, then it is called a ""cut.""Using that Washington budget language if last year I gained 20 pounds and this year I gain only 10 pounds, then I cut my weight by 10 pounds this year. In reality, I will have gotten 10 pounds fatter.Federal spending has more than doubled since 2000, and more than tripled since 1990. Population has only gone up about 30%. It's time for the budget-producing politicians to actually start losing weight, not just gaining weight at a slower pace.Despite the headlines about massive ""cuts"" in spending, neither the Trump budget nor the latest House GOP budget proposals would result in less spending. Unless politicians are actually willing to reduce spending, the federal government will continue to get fatter.

147,ABC,"When President Donald Trump makes an accusation of ""fake news,"" we could add a number of definitions of the term. Liberal journalists hear ""You write stories you know are fake."" But there are news stories that journalists earnestly put forward as real news that are based on a lot of suspicious methods — like quoting anonymous government officials indicting Trump in a malicious international plot to deny the ""real winner"" of the 2016 presidential election her prize.This is why the media elites will ignore the latest Project Veritas sting video in which CNN producer John Bonifield admits the Trump-colluded-with-Russia scandal is ""mostly bull---- right now."" But CNN keeps hoping it will turn out to be an enormously damaging scandal. Bonifield even volunteered that Trump was ""probably right"" to say it's a witch hunt.If all the leaking and all the speculating end up in a big pile of zero, how is it not ""fake news""?The latest study of ABC, CBS and NBC evening newscasts from the Media Research Center demonstrates that the networks are obsessed with a conspiracy even Democrats like Rep. Maxine Waters admit hasn't really been proved. Analysts watched every broadcast network evening newscast in the five weeks since the appointment of special counsel Robert Mueller on May 17. They found a whopping 353 minutes of airtime devoted to the Russia probe, or 55% of all coverage of the Trump presidency during those five weeks.Nothing else even came close. Far behind in second place was the wailing about Trump pulling out of the Paris climate accord, with 47 minutes of airtime. In fact, liberal reporters mock the president's team for not being able to discuss infrastructure or tax reform ... at the same time they strenuously avoid them.It gets worse. A third of these Russia stories were based on anonymous sources, and too often they've ended up being the most obvious ""fake news."" For example, the night before former FBI Director James Comey testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee, ABC's Jon Karl claimed that a ""source familiar with Comey's thinking"" insisted Comey would contradict Trump under oath about reassuring him he was not under investigation. In reality, Comey confirmed Trump's claims. Karl then reported that, too, but didn't acknowledge his earlier belly-flop.The best argument that liberals can muster about the large chunk of airtime devoted to this story is Trump's own tweets mocking the investigation, or as Time magazine calls them, ""dig-the-hole-deeper tweets."" They could claim that Presidents Bill Clinton or Barack Obama labored to shove scandals to the side of the news road with policy distractions or big meetings or trips or speeches, while Trump doubles down.But that also underlines how the media were eagerly willing to report those Democratic distractions, while they now obsess over anything that surfaces on Trump's Twitter account. The president knows that taunting them promotes another round of anguished news reporting, which perhaps underlines for his supporters that the ""news"" manufacturers prefer to present this president as some kind of hooligan disturbing the peace on the internet.What this study suggests once again is that the same reporters who effortlessly spread the fake news that Obama was ""scandal-free"" are dedicated to cementing the proposition that Trump is hopelessly scandal-plagued. The same journalists who shamelessly whacked away at Kenneth Starr as a modern knockoff of the inquisitor Torquemada are now presenting Robert Mueller as their latest echo of Eliot Ness. The only thing consistent about the press is their partisanship.RELATED:Real Scandals The Trump-Obsessed Media Are IgnoringThe Russia Worm Is Starting To Turn On Trump Conspiracy-MongersDid Obama White House And Loretta Lynch Illegally Meddle In 2016 Election?

148,ABC,"Russia Probe: Whether or not special prosecutor Robert Mueller is even investigating President Trump for obstruction of justice is far from clear. What's becoming increasingly clear, however, is that if Mueller does launch such a probe, he shouldn't be the one to run it.A few days after the ""bombshell"" Washington Post story claimed that Mueller was looking into whether Trump tried to thwart the FBI's Russia-election-meddling investigation, ABC News reported that there isn't such an investigation.""My sources are telling me he's begun some preliminary planning. Plans to talk to some people in the administration,"" said ABC News correspondent Pierre Thomas on Sunday. ""But he's not yet made that momentous decision to go for a full-scale investigation.""This backs up what we noted in this space on Thursday, that just because Mueller is talking to administration officials who might be involved in a possible investigation doesn't mean there is one.But while Mueller mulls over that decision, more and more voices are being raised calling for him to step aside due to a serious conflict of interest that probe would represent. That conflict involves Mueller's long-standing friendship with former FBI head James Comey.Since Comey's firing is one of the main reasons for the talk about obstruction, he would end up as a key figure in such an investigation. It's Comey who claimed that Trump pressured him to ease off his investigation of Mike Flynn, and who, as some said, laid the groundwork for an obstruction charge.Mueller and Comey both worked in the Bush administration and were involved in a dispute over whether Bush Attorney General John Ashcroft should reauthorize a post-9/11 domestic surveillance program.""The two men backed one another in a moment etched into the legend in both the Justice Department and FBI,"" noted George Washington University legal scholar Jonathan Turley.The two have been said to be friends ever since.Turley says that, as a result, ""Mueller could not be viewed as a neutral choice by anyone on Trump's side due to his history with Comey.""Turley isn't the only one making this claim. University of Tennessee law professor Glenn Reynolds, who also publishes the popular Instapundit blog, wrote an op-ed for USA Today on Monday arguing that Mueller ""has a disqualifying conflict of interest"" if he pursues any obstruction investigation against Trump.Reynolds notes that all that's required to disqualify Justice Department conflict of interest rules is just the appearance of a conflict.""Mueller clearly has one here,"" Reynolds writes.Former Department of Justice official John Malcolm told CNBC that ""there is no question that he (Mueller) is close to Jim Comey"" and that he ""must keep an arm's length distance"" from him.The Washington Examiner's Byron York asked nearly half a dozen top Washington lawyers whether Mueller has a disqualifying conflict, and found the responses mixed.Even more troubling, however, is the fact that Mueller himself might have to answer questions in any obstruction investigation.According to the White House, Mueller interviewed with Trump to replace Comey after Trump fired him.""If this conversation occurred,"" Turley notes, ""Trump may have explained why he fired Comey and what he was looking for in his replacement … . That makes Mueller a possible witness.""Given the stakes involved here, there should not even be a hint of a conflict involving Mueller. That's starting to look increasingly like an impossibility.Our suggestion would be that Mueller decide first whether there is even a shred of evidence to back up the Trump-colluding-with-Russia claim — something that looks increasingly unlikely. If there isn't, Mueller should close shop immediately and let everyone get back to business.RELATED:Mueller's 'Obstruction Investigation' Into Trump — Less Than Meets The EyeDemocrats Trot Out Plan C In Their Never-Ending Trump Impeachment CrusadeDid Obama White House And Loretta Lynch Illegally Meddle In 2016 Election?

149,ABC,"The radical leftist fanaticism over Rep. Steve Scalise's alleged shooter has been an integral part of the news coverage, as it should be. James Hodgkinson's ties to the Bernie Sanders campaign have been reported (if sometimes buried) by most news outlets, and the pundits are virtually universal in their belief that the socialist senator should not be held responsible.These journalists were about a quarter of a century late to the dance. Theirs has been a decades-long exercise in hypocrisy. If an act of violence could be blamed on a Republican or, even better, on a conservative, the press would do it, even if they needed to play a Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon-style game.Recall Timothy McVeigh, the Oklahoma City bomber. Some journalists like then-NBC anchor Bryant Gumbel immediately blamed ""right-wing radio jocks,"" naming Rush Limbaugh, Ollie North, Michael Reagan, Gordon Liddy and Bob Grant. He said, ""the extent to which their approach fosters violence is being questioned by many observers.""Think of the bombing of an abortion clinic in Atlanta in 1997. The anti-abortion movement was immediately put on trial and forced to defend itself against the media's charge that it was responsible. Ditto with the shooting of late-term abortion doctor George Tiller in Kansas.Consider the shooting of then-Rep. Gabby Giffords in 2011. Right up to present day, the leftist media has cast blame on former Gov. Sarah Palin and her followers, even though the charge has been proven to be false.What about liberal Democrats? The media covered Ted Kaczynski, the Unabomber, because it was ongoing terror and they couldn't ignore it. But how many blamed the environmental movement for his radicalism, which included an embrace of then-Vice President Al Gore and his book ""Earth in the Balance""?Think of the endless exercises in destructive behavior perpetrated by Greenpeace and so many of the radical environmental organizations. Have the policies of the Democratic Party been blamed?What about the Black Lives Matter movement? The coverage has been intense and sympathetic no matter how much violence is perpetrated, smearing the police and causing a crime wave that has led to dramatic increase in murders. Has any Democrat, from former President Obama on down, been held to account? In recent months, the radical left's violence, and its call to violence by its leaders, has reached a frightening level because of President Donald Trump. But where have the news media been?Where were the news media at the Women's March on Washington when Madonna said ""f--- you"" to her detractors, and then proudly proclaimed, ""I have thought an awful lot about blowing up the White House""? ABC, CBS and NBC gave this large feminist event 129 times more coverage than the 2016 March for Life. ABC touted Madonna's ""A-list"" appearance and shamelessly censored any mention of her profanity or violent fantasies.In New York City, Shakespeare in the Park is running a rendition of ""Julius Caesar"" in which a very Trump-like Caesar is viciously stabbed to death. Where is the liberal media condemnation? ABC and NBC have mostly ignored it, while CBS has defended it for three minutes. CNN host Fareed Zakaria called it brilliant and urged the public to go view it. The New York Times is actually sponsoring Shakespeare in the Park, calling itself ""an institution that believes in free speech for the arts as well as the media.""Snoop Dogg is one of the hippest celebrities on the scene today. In a recent music video, he is depicted shooting a clown dressed as President Trump in the head. Do you recall any coverage? Any condemnation?The very bizarre rock singer Marilyn Manson also has a music video in which a facsimile of Trump is seen decapitated, blood everywhere, soon after Manson tears a Bible apart. Where was the coverage and condemnation?Before he was canceled, ""The Nightly Show"" host Larry Wilmore pledged to suffocate Trump. He said: ""I don't want to give him any more oxygen. That's not a euphemism, by the way. I mean it literally. Somebody get me the pillow they used to kill Scalia and I'll do it — I'll do it!"" He was previously honored by the White House Correspondents' Association to perform a ""roast"" (think toast) of Obama. Where was the coverage and condemnation of this ""joke""?There's been a lot of coverage of Stephen Colbert's gay slur of Trump. But do you recall him showing a depiction of Trump aide Stephen Miller's severed head placed on a spike a la ""Game of Thrones""?There is a legion of examples. The coverage has been virtually nonexistent. The condemnation has been nowhere to be found. It is well to remember this when considering the media's present outrage at the shooting of Republican Rep. Steve Scalise.Maybe, just maybe, they need to do some soul-searching themselves.

150,ABC,"The $13.7 billion Amazon (AMZN) acquisition of natural foods grocer Whole Foods Market (WFM) Friday stunned the market, clobbered grocery stocks, and spurred jokes and jibes in Twitterverse. One wag tweeted ""@jeffbezos this wasn't exactly the wealth redistribution we had in mind when you'd asked yesterday.""Bezos to Alexa: ""I need some groceries.""Alexa: ""I bought you Whole Foods.""🙃😋🍏🍎🍐🍊🍋🍕📈📊— Samppa Lahtinen (@SamppaSOS) June 16, 2017So where could Amazon go next? Here are five potential industries for the e-commerce giant.XAmazon already was said to be considering an entry into the pharmaceuticals market. While speculation had centered on online drug deliveries, Amazon also could conceivably add pharmacies to Whole Foods locations, several analysts noted Friday, creating further synergies between food and drugs and online orders and in-store purchases.If Amazon enters the field, it could send tremors across the pharmaceutical food chain, from drugstore chains such as Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) and CVS Health (CVS) to pharmacy benefit managers such as Express Scripts (ESRX) and distributors such as Amerisource Bergen (ABC).Amazon did have a finger in this pie once. It backed Drugstore.com before that online retail pharmacy was acquired by Walgreens, which then shut it down.Walgreens shares fell 5% and CVS Health 3.8%, though that reflected at least in part the immediate investor concern about the impact on their food sales. Express Scripts and Amerisource Bergen also were lower.Amazon Business, its B2B or business-to-business unit launched in 2015, sold over $1 billion worth of lab equipment, deep fryers and other gear sought by business owners in the first year of operations.If the division continues to grow at such a torrid pace, it could eat the lunch of W.W. Grainger (GWW), HD Supply (HDS) and other firms in the industrial supplies sector. That market is extremely fragmented, with some 5,000 estimated players and a value of about $75 billion per year. Amazon could disrupt it with a streamlined marketplace.While HD Supply fell 1% Friday, Grainger rose 2%.Meanwhile home improvement stores Home Depot (HD), Lowe's (LOW) and Floor & Decor (FND) have been Amazon-proof so far, but that may not always stay true.Amazon has automotive ambitions too. That is, it is rumored to want to move aggressively auto parts, carving out a slice of the $50 billion DIY aftermarket parts market.News that it is eyeing the auto-parts retail sector sent brick-and-mortar retailers such as AutoZone (AZO), O'Reilly Auto Parts (ORLY) and Advance Auto Parts (AAP) sharply lower in January. One report at that time said the online juggernaut already has contracts with Dorman Products (DORM) and other parts makers.Shares of auto-parts retailers are still mired near 52-week lows, with AutoZone 3.1%, O'Reilly Auto 1.1% and Advance Auto Parts 0.75% all falling Friday.Messaging service Slack Technologies targets the corporate chat room. That is said to make the Silicon Valley startup attractive to Amazon, which is a big player in the enterprise services market alongside Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOGL) and others.Having a messaging service could help win corporate business for Amazon Web Services. Microsoft and Google, which have their own cloud-computing businesses, have Slack-like messaging features.AWS has been key to the internet giant's streak of stellar earnings. In fact, Whole Foods could switch allegiance to Amazon Web Services from its current status as a Microsoft cloud customer given Friday's news.Slack is said to have a value of at least $9 billion, so it would be the biggest-ever acquisition for Amazon, surpassing Whole Foods.Amazon issued $1 billion in small loans in the past year to merchants on its online platform, Bloomberg reported June 7. It issues loans to sellers in the United States, United Kingdom and Japan and has plans to expand to key markets such as China.As its lending business gains momentum, Amazon could weigh on online lenders such as Lending Club (LC) as well as payment processors such as PayPal (PYPL) and Square (SQ), who also offer credit to users. Banks that lend heavily to small businesses could also take a hit.The lending program could also keep customers loyal to Amazon, which is seeing rivals such as eBay (EBAY) and Wal-Mart (WMT) step up their e-commerce strategy.Amazon's lending program, launched in 2011, allows it to profit both directly and indirectly — through interest rates and from more transaction fees as merchants grow sales.Shares of Amazon were rising 2.4% to 987.71 on the stock market today. Whole Foods rose 29.1% to 42.68, slightly above Amazon's 42 offer price.RELATED:What Amazon's Whole Foods Deal Means For RetailAmazon-Whole Foods Merger Could Be 'Category Killer' For Food, EateriesNew Flooring Retailer Manages To Sidestep The Amazon Squeeze

151,ABC,"In January, ABC Entertainment president Channing Dungey told a Television Critics Association session in Hollywood that she wanted to retool ABC programming to include more shows for Trump-voting segments of the population: men, rural America and working-class families.""If we're talking about diversity and inclusion, I want to make sure we're inclusive of everyone,"" she declared. ""When you think about the name, we're the American Broadcasting Company.""We've seen this movie before. The commitment to wholesome values is perhaps the emptiest statement in Hollywood.This month, she broke that campaign promise like a politician by canceling the Tim Allen sitcom ""Last Man Standing,"" a show appealing directly to that Trump electorate. A Change.com petition protesting the move has nearly 300,000 signatures. Allen tweeted that he was ""stunned and blindsided"" by the bad news.Why was Allen fired?The show didn't have a ratings problem — it averaged 6.4 million viewers this season, and that should be graded upward on a curve, since the show aired on Friday and the overall Friday audience is typically smaller than other weeknights. Dungey said the job of a programming executive was ""managing failure,"" but this wasn't a failure. ""It was a steady performer,"" she admitted. However, she added, ""Once we made the decision not to continue with comedy on Friday, it was just kind of that's where we landed.""Instead, they're moving in the drama ""Once Upon a Time,"" which averaged 3.2 million viewers this year, or half of Allen's number. In the second hour, ABC is eventually placing its show ""Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,"" which this season averaged 2.3 million viewers.What about Saturday to Thursday? Apparently, there wasn't a slot on ABC prime time for Allen's show.What constitutes a success at ABC? Dungey declared herself ""optimistic and excited"" about a third season of ""Quantico,"" which, according to creator Joshua Safran, is opposed to ""Trumpian instincts."" The series just concluded with a plot that the Trump-like president wanted to merge the FBI and CIA into one giant agency and was exposed as a tool of the Russians. And the ratings? This cartoonish liberal claptrap averaged 2.7 million viewers this season, just over a third of Allen's total. It was renewed.These surviving shows with mediocre ratings are owned by ABC. That means there are business reasons for Allen's show to be dismissed, since it's owned by 20th Century Fox. But it's the second-highest-rated ABC sitcom behind ""Modern Family,"" which is also owned by Fox. (This season, it was ABC's third most watched scripted series behind ""Modern Family"" and ""Grey's Anatomy."") But ABC is keeping Fox-owned ""Fresh Off the Boat,"" which on Tuesday night drew less than 4 million viewers. Pro ""diversity"" ABC wasn't going to cancel an Asian-American sitcom — one with an episode last November during which a character proclaimed, ""This country was founded by illegal immigrants,"" meaning the Pilgrims landing at Plymouth Rock.ABC also claims it is renewing these less-popular shows due to ""critical acclaim,"" and that's one way Hollywood liberals can cite liberal TV critics in defense of their decisions. Tim Allen is not a critic's darling. They dismissed this show as retreading his 1990s ABC smash ""Home Improvement.""So if Tim Allen's hit show is produced by Fox, why can't Fox pick it up? Deadline reported that Fox isn't airing traditional multicamera sitcoms anymore and is leaning toward ""edgy"" comedies to try to attract younger viewers. Fox only had two weeknight sitcoms this season, both of which struggled: the beyond crass ""The Mick"" (2.9 million average viewers) and ""Brooklyn Nine-Nine"" (2.1 million average viewers). Both were renewed.Looking at all this, you can see why Tim Allen is stunned ... and why it's easy to think that a pro-Trump TV star is suddenly out of fashion largely for reasons that have nothing to do with ratings or business.

152,ABC,"Trump And Russia: If there's one thing Congress' Russia hearings have shown, it's that President Trump has driven the Democratic Party and far-left media to near insanity. How else can you explain their unhealthy fixation on all things Trump and nonstop efforts to end his presidency?No, we're not joking. Listening to the hearings on Wednesday and Thursday, when National Intelligence Director Dan Coats, National Security Director Adm. Michael Rogers, Acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe, and former FBI Director James Comey testified, was a revelation.In their questioning, Democrats were plainly not interested in the truth. They merely hoped for something, anything, that would be damning or damaging to Trump. In particular, they hoped for evidence of ""obstruction of justice"" to impeach Trump.But they didn't get it. Under persistent questioning Wednesday, Coats, Rogers and McCabe all emphatically denied that Trump had brought improper pressure to bear on the Russia investigation. None.Again, on Thursday, Comey drove that point home, saying that he did not perceive anything that Trump said to him as an attempt to obstruct ""the broader investigation into Russia or possible links to his campaign.""So in the end, as the current saying goes, it was a big nothing-burger, with cheese. And instead of a grand inquisition, it turned into rather pathetic political theater.Is this how the Democrats hope to regain power?Meanwhile, the left-leaning, Trump-despising media had already established the journalistic narrative that Trump was likely guilty of ""obstruction of justice,"" or possibly of colluding with a foreign power during an election. Their impeachment hopes soared.As Comey's testimony neared, CNN launched near-nonstop coverage. Other media jumped in, wondering what nasty revelations the fired former FBI director might spill. The week started out promising: CNN reported on Tuesday that Comey would ""refute Trump's assertion that Trump was told he was not under investigation."" So did ABC.Unfortunately, Comey made it clear that he told Trump he was not under investigation, multiple times. CNN and ABC were forced to retract their phony reports.They weren't the only media with egg on their faces. Citing four ""current and former"" intelligence officials, the New York Times reported earlier this year that key Trump campaign officials ""had repeated contacts with senior Russian intelligence officials in the year before the election.""It was a blockbuster revelation, one that potentially could have ended Trump's presidency.Care to comment, Mr. Comey? ""In the main, it was not true,"" he said Thursday.The media focused for weeks on these lines of inquiry. Yet, as Sen. Marco Rubio noted Thursday, the only thing from the entire investigation that didn't get leaked by Comey and others to the media was the essential fact that Donald Trump himself was not under investigation at all by the FBI.Even so, don't expect this to end soon. The Democrats now stand on the prow of their party like a mad, enraged Captain Ahab, scanning the horizon for the sign of their hated White Whale – Donald Trump.Just like the fabled captain of literature, they have endangered their whole party in their quest to get Trump. As they do, very quietly, Trump is going about undoing eight years of bad governance by President Obama.Over the past couple of weeks, as the media and congressional Democrats have focused on Comey and the Washington impeachment circus, Trump has been on a roll.He named 12 new well-regarded federal judges to the bench, rolled back one of the EPA's ""most expensive regulations ever,"" put an end to Obama's corrupt policy of using public money to enrich far-left activist groups, pulled the U.S. out of the laughably bad but absurdly costly Paris Climate Change Agreement, and continued a far-reaching reversal of regulations that the American Action Forum called a ""profound"" shift in policy that will have a major impact on the U.S. economy.And on Thursday, while Comey spoke and Democrats fumed, the House passed a bill that would undo some of the most pernicious elements of the Dodd-Frank law — another promise Trump made and is now on the verge of keeping.Not bad for two weeks' work.As for the Trump-haters in the Democratic Party and the media, the June IBD/TIPP Poll, taken from May 30 to June 6, holds some bad news: Some 47% of Americans agree that ""the investigation into possible ties between the Trump campaign and Russia is a political 'witch hunt' aimed at getting the president impeached.""The nonstop efforts to get Trump are failing. Piece by piece, Trump's putting his agenda in place — just in time to watch the Democratic Party's ship go down.RELATED:IBD/TIPP Poll: Americans See Anti-Trump Media, 'Political Witch Hunt,' Pushing Russia InvestigationDemocrats May Come To Regret Mueller Investigation Into Trump-Russia TiesAre Democrats' Claims About Trump Colluding With The Russians Collapsing?Democrats Desperate To Turn Trump Into Nixon

156,ABC,"As I write this, I am on the southwest coast of Florida and the bands of Hurricane Irma are intensifying.XIn my estimation, a perfect time to stress that Rush Limbaugh was well within his rights to question the motivations of some in the media and the various weather services with regard to Irma and Hurricane ""forecasts,"" and Hurricane ""hype.""In the past, I have equated weather ""forecasters"" to political pundits and economists. They all factor a great deal of guesswork into their predictions with the weather forecasters often coming up a poor third in terms of accuracy.A number of years ago, I sat down with the general manager of a major television news station. He told me that in their own survey, viewers tuned in for ""weather first, sports second, and news last.""  Therefore he stressed, weather forecasters were the ""cash cow"" of the station.He further explained that much of television weather forecasting was a ""sham."" He said that decades ago, they would give a ""one-day"" forecast. But then Station B across town went to a ""two-day"" forecast. So then they countered with a ""three-day"" forecast,"" until everyone went to the ""useless seven-day"" forecasts.He emphasized that it was all done for reasons of competition and ratings and that with a ""seven-day"" forecast, the station and the networks were playing viewers for ""fools,"" because they normally ""couldn't even get the forecast for tomorrow correct.""See How IBD Helps You Make Money In StocksNow, going back to Rush Limbaugh, he was also entirely truthful when he stated that many on the left use hurricanes — and any tragedy that might be associated with them — to hype and push their global warming and climate change narratives.Like the mainstream media, the entertainment industry, and academia, discrimination against conservative or even pragmatic and honest thought is in full effect when it comes to hiring meteorologists. For the most part, if you don't worship at the altar of the ""evil of man-made global warming"" and political correctness, you can't get hired at The Weather Channel, CNN, ABC, CBS, NBC or even most local television news stations.Beyond that fact is the reality that the ""forecasters"" with their ""European"" and ""American"" models — as well as every other spaghetti noodle model they could slap on the screen — have been decidedly inaccurate when it came to Irma and Florida.First, they had it going to the east coast of Florida. Then just off the east coast. Then more to the middle of the state. Then the exact middle of Florida. Then more to the west.  Then directly over the west coast of Florida.Are you kidding me? Just admit you don't know what you are talking about and be done with it.Here on the southwest coast of Florida, there was one local forecaster who was so embarrassed by the continually changing predictions, that he did just that. More than that, he admitted that the ""science and our instruments were not quite there yet to accurately predict the direction or force of these hurricanes.""A forecaster for left-leaning CNN next called the models ""horrible.""Good for them because guess what? These ultimately insulting guesswork predictions create real and hazardous consequences. Basically the entire southeast coast of Florida from Miami to Palm Beach were under mandatory evacuation. Millions of people left their homes.An evacuation of these millions of people which caused great hardship for many — especially the elderly and the infirm — and which cost millions of taxpayer dollars to enforce.After all of that, the southeast coast of Florida was no longer even in the projected cone of Irma as it had been moved to the west coast of the state.Ironically — and quite dangerously — many of the people in and around Miami fled to Naples, Fla., or other cities on the west coast because the weather ""experts,"" ""projections,"" ""cones,"" and ""spaghetti models"" told them that side of the state would be much safer.Until it wasn't.Irma did put millions of people at risk on both coasts and should have been taken very seriously. All the more reason not to guess, pretend, or lecture.The laughingly inaccurate ""models"" and ""cones"" becoming the cruelest of jokes played on the residents of Florida desperately trying to figure out which way to run or even survive.Ultimately, the real lessons with Irma are that weather forecasting is far from an exact science and should never be exploited for political reasons or monetary gain.Hopefully, those on the left who control almost everything in the field of meteorology will agree with that.If for no other reason than to put fewer lives at risk.RELATED:With Hurricane Irma, Private Volunteers — Not Gov't — Again Lead Way In ReliefQuestion For Enviros: Did Climate Change Cause Hurricane Irma To Fizzle?'Price Gouging,' For Lack Of A Better Term, Is Good IBD: How To Invest In Stocks

157,ABC,"Disney (DIS) CEO Bob Iger warned Thursday that profit will be weaker than expected this year and seemed to dash hopes that Netflix (NFLX) will retain Star Wars and Marvel content after the media conglomerate launches its own streaming service.XWhile speaking at the Bank of America Merrill Lynch 2017 Media, Communications & Entertainment Conference, Iger put earnings per share this year ""roughly in line"" with Disney's fiscal 2016 EPS, according to CNBC.That fiscal year, which ended in September 2016, saw EPS of $5.72, and the consensus for this year has it rising to $5.87, according to Zacks Investment Research.The weaker fiscal 2017 outlook implies Q4 EPS of $1.09, well below consensus views for $1.25. Iger blamed the expected effects of Hurricane Irma in Disney's Florida resorts, higher costs for NBA broadcast rights, the investment in BAMTech, and the lack of a major Star Wars movie release (""Star Wars: The Last Jedi"" will be released at the start of fiscal 2018).Disney shares closed down 4.4% at 97.06 on the stock market today.

160,ABC,"Does it hurt to accuse someone of being a Nazi or a racist who is neither of those?  How about calling someone those vile terms when he has spent his life supporting Jewish and black causes?Over the weekend, the Democratic Party's Deputy Chair, Keith Ellison, put out an email claiming: ""even with Steve Bannon gone, Donald Trump's inner circle still includes prominent white nationalists and enablers of white supremacy.""  Ellison labeled one senior advisor as ""a member of a Hungarian Nazi organization.""On Saturday, Howard Dean, the former chair of the Democratic Party, said: ""If you want to vote for a racist in the White House, then you better vote for Republicans.""  Other Democrats keep echoing those charges.The venerable Foreign Policy magazine ran an article the end of last week asserting: ""For the first time in our history, a Nazi sympathizer occupies the Oval Office.""  Foreign newspapers like The Independent or The Guardian have headlines: ""Donald Trump's Defense of neo-Nazi"" and ""The president of the United States is now a neo-Nazi sympathizer.""Sunday morning's national television talk shows, such as ""Meet the Press,"" only could find Republicans who were critical of Trump.If you believe what the media are telling you, we now supposedly have the first Nazi sympathizer as president, but who is also the first president to have an orthodox Jewish daughter and grandkids.  A president who pledges unwavering support for Israel and who has been a friend of the current Israeli PM for decades. Nazis are socialists, yet Trump supports less regulation and lower taxes.Before running for the president as a Republican, Democrats had wonderful things to say about Donald Trump regarding race.  In the late 1990s and early 2000s, Jesse Jackson frequently praised Trump for his ""lifetime"" of helping the black community.Days before Democratic Party's Deputy Chair Keith Ellison sent out his weekend email, the experts interviewed by the liberal PolitiFact had already shot down those claims. ""Are any of these four officials white nationalists? When we asked this question of several independent experts, they all agreed that none of the four were white nationalists themselves.""So why do people believe that Trump is a Nazi or white supremacist sympathizer? ABC News' coverage was all too typical: ""Trump quickly blamed both sides for the conflict, adding that there were 'very fine people' among both the protesters — which included white supremacists and white nationalists — and the counter protesters.""But Trump never came close to saying that any white supremacists or neo-Nazis were ""very fine people.""  At his press conference last Tuesday, Trump clearly made this point several times.  For example, ""And you had people, and I'm not talking about the neo-Nazis and the white nationalists, because they should be condemned totally. But you had many people in that group other than neo-Nazis and white nationalists.""When pressed by a reporter if Trump was saying that the press was threatening white nationalists unfairly Trump emphatically said: ""No, no."" And Trump again referred to the ""bad people — neo-Nazis, white nationalists.""People were also angry at Trump's initial statement on Saturday immediately after the news broke. But compare that to the praise for a joint statement that former presidents George W. Bush and George H.W. Bush put out last Wednesday. The Bushes wrote: ""America must always reject racial bigotry, anti-Semitism, and hatred in all forms.""But how is that different from Trump's universally denounced statement four days earlier: ""We condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides, on many sides. ... It has no place in America.""Is the only difference that the Bushes condemned bigotry ""in all forms,"" whereas Trump condemned it ""on many sides""?In fact, Trump was right.  The people on the left, such as Antifa and Black Lives Matter, where not only as racist and hateful, but even the liberal and left-wing media from The Nation to BuzzFeed News to the Los Angeles Times have documented that they also instigated violence in Charlottesville.As one University of Virginia student told the New York Times before the car attack: ""I was on Market Street around 11:30 a.m. when a counter-protester ripped a newspaper stand off the sidewalk and threw it at alt-right protesters. I saw another man from the white supremacist crowd being chased and beaten. People were hitting him with their signs. A much older man, also with the alt-right group, got pushed to the ground in the commotion. Someone raised a stick over his head and beat the man . . . .""The media's false statements are out of control, distorting what President Trump said, and the Democratic Party leaders have pushed these claims even further.Racism is vile and must be condemned.  But lying is also wrong, especially about such serious charges.

161,ABC,"Silicon Valley and Hollywood's convergence continues, amid a growing battle to own and stream television shows and movies — and get people to pay for them in the process.Now that Apple (AAPL) is said to be is spending a cool $1 billion on original entertainment and Walt Disney (DIS) is readying its own stand-alone streaming platform, where does that leave Netflix (NFLX)?If content budgets are an indication of who leads in the online video market, Netflix currently is king. An early mover in the streaming space, it is now a heavyweight with more than 104 million global subscribers. The company's chief content officer, Ted Sarandos, recently told Variety that he sees Netflix plunking down $7 billion on content in 2018, up from $6 billion this year.Indications are, Netflix isn't stopping there.""We've got a long way to go to have more and more content to please more and more members and continue to grow,"" Netflix Chief Executive Reed Hastings said on the company's July earnings call, adding that margins are improving.  ""But we are growing the content budget significantly also because of the opportunity that we see.""Shows like ""House of Cards"" and ""Orange Is The New Black"" helped put Netflix on the map as a player in the original content game, and newer additions such as ""Stranger Things"" and the upcoming Will Smith movie ""Bright,"" which alone cost $90 million, are meant to draw in more paying subscribers.Netflix also apparently isn't afraid to challenge these oncoming rivals. Just days after Disney announced on Aug. 8 it would stream its own in-house films exclusively, Netflix said just days later that it had lured away ""Scandal"" and ""Grey's Anatomy"" creator Shonda Rhimes from her TV home at Disney-owned ABC.How long can Netflix remain the streaming king?Apple so far has ""Planet of the Apps"" and ""Carpool Karaoke"" under its belt, but the iPhone maker could expand its content stable by buying and producing up to 10 television shows, sources told the Wall Street Journal. Apple is apparently looking to recapture some of the ground iTunes has lost over the years.A billion-dollar investment sounds like a lot, but could still be a mere test run for Apple, which has $261.5 billion in cash. Its peers are spending gobs more. Time Warner's (TWX) HBO has allocated twice as much to content, and JPMorgan put Amazon's (AMZN) 2017 video budget at an estimated $4.5 billion.Another issue is that most of Netflix's shows and movies are licensed from traditional studios and networks — content creators that may be increasingly loathe to share, a la Disney.Disney surprised the industry with its plans to take away its in-house studio and Pixar films from Netflix and putting them on its own streaming service in 2019. Discussions are reportedly still ongoing over whether Netflix viewers will get to keep watching Marvel and ""Star Wars"" flicks, or if the massive intellectual properties will get their own Disney-owned streaming home.How successful a Disney-Pixar standalone service would be, and how much it would weigh on Netflix, likely depends on how much it costs and how many subscribers it can convince to purchase a non-bundle streaming service that may not even include all of Disney's properties, such as the ABC networks and ESPN. The latter is getting its own stand-alone service next year.Assuming a $7.99 monthly subscription fee, modest operating costs and a little cannibalization of Disney's home video sales, analysts at Piper Jaffray forecast that a Disney streaming platform would need about 4 million subscribers to break even and make it worth pulling the plug on its licensing pact with Netflix.Analyst Michael Pachter at Wedbush indicates that shouldn't be hard. Pachter said he expects Netflix to lose about 5 million subscribers — 10% of Netflix's U.S. membership — to Disney's new service between mid-2019 and 2020.Calling Disney's movie exit a ""huge loss for Netflix,"" he said finding replacement content could be difficult and likely ""very expensive as well.""Most surveyed people that were interested in subscribing to a paid Disney service, however, said the most they would pay is $5 a month.It isn't easy to predict consumer — and investor — reaction to each swing in the content wars. While word of Apple's billion dollars on content wasn't enough to rattle media stocks, Disney's announcements sent both Disney and Netflix shares falling the next day.Netflix is well aware of its increasingly delicate dance with Hollywood. Talking to Variety, Sarandos described Netflix's relationship with Hollywood as that of a ""frenemy.""That came even as Disney CEO Bob Iger had insisted just a week before on an earnings call that there was ""no change"" to their relationship, at least on Disney's side, touting four joint Netflix-Marvel television series as a ""perfect example"" of a successful team-up.Still, that didn't stop Iger from casually hinting on Disney's earnings call that Netflix owes a debt to the Hollywood heavyweight.Disney's studio content, he said, ""represented real anchor programming for Netflix before they had an opportunity to ramp up their own original production, which they've obviously done aggressively and quite successfully.""

162,ABC,"As changing technologies and preferences make government-funded broadcasting increasingly preposterous, such broadcasting actually becomes useful by illustrating two dismal facts. One is the immortality of entitlements that especially benefit those among society's articulate upper reaches who feel entitled. The other fact is how impervious government programs are to evidence incompatible with their premises.Fifty years and about 500 channels ago, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting was created to nudge Lyndon Johnson's Great Society — it aimed to make America great for the first time — the final inches toward perfection. Today, the CPB, which has received about $12 billion over the years, disperses the government's 15% of public television's budget and 10% of public radio's. Originally, public television increased many viewers' choices by 33% — from three (CBS, NBC, ABC) to four.Twenty-five years ago, Sen. Al Gore, defending another appropriation increase for the CPB, asked what he considered a dispositive question: ""How many senators here have children who have watched 'Sesame Street' and 'Mister Rogers' Neighborhood'? ... This is one thing that works in this country."" So, senators, mostly affluent, should compel taxpayers, mostly much less affluent, to subsidize the senators' children's viewing because it ""works,"" as measured by means that Gore neglected to reveal.Eighteen years ago, some public broadcasting officials, who understood the importance of being earnest — and imaginative — testified to Congress that public television's educational effects on the workforce give the economy a $12 billion boost. Fifteen years ago, however, the then-president of public television said, ""We are dangerously close in our overall prime-time numbers to falling below the relevance quotient."" Relevance? To what?Today, Mick Mulvaney, director of the Office of Management and Budget, thinks we can risk terminating the CPB. This would reduce viewers' approximately 500 choices to approximately 499. Listeners to public radio might have to make do with America's 4,666 AM and 6,754 FM commercial stations, 437 satellite radio channels, perhaps 70,000 podcasts, and other internet and streaming services.America, which is entertaining itself to inanition, has never experienced a scarcity of entertainment. Or a need for government-subsidized journalism that reports on the government. Before newspaper editorial writers inveigh against Mulvaney and in support of government subsidies for television and radio, they should answer this question: Should there be a CPN — a Corporation for Public Newspapers?
"
163,ABC,"The CPB was created ""to encourage public telecommunications services which will be responsive to the interests of people."" Of course: People's interests, not people's desires. The market efficiently responds to the latter. Public broadcasting began as a response to what progressives nowadays call ""market failure."" This usually means the market's failure to supply what the public has not demanded but surely would demand if it understood its real ""interest.""One reason many Americans are becoming ""cord cutters,"" abandoning cable and satellite television, is that they want an a la carte world. One reason ESPN has lost 12 million subscribers in six years is that it is an expensive component of cable and satellite packages and many of those paying for the packages rarely watch ESPN.Compelling taxpayers to finance government-subsidized broadcasting is discordant with today's a la carte impulse and raises a question: If it has a loyal constituency, those viewers and listeners, who are disproportionately financially upscale, can afford voluntary contributions to replace the government money. And advertisers would pay handsomely to address this constituency.Often the last, and sometimes the first, recourse of constituencies whose subsidies are in jeopardy is: ""It's for the children."" Big Bird, however, is more a corporate conglomerate than an endangered species. If ""Sesame Street"" programming were put up for auction, the danger would be of getting trampled by the stampede of potential bidders.The argument for government-subsidized broadcasting is perversely circular: If the public were enlightened, there would be no need for government subsidies. But, by definition, an enlightened public would understand the inherent merits of subsidies by which the government picks more deserving winners than the market does.However, since government-subsidized broadcasting exists, any argument for it would be superfluous, given what governmental inertia usually accomplishes for government enterprises. Long ago — in January — there was bold Republican talk about Congress restoring ""regular order"": There would be 12 appropriations bills and they would be enacted before the 2018 fiscal year begins Oct. 1. Instead, there probably will be another ""swallow this or shutter the government"" omnibus bill in which almost everything survives by sparing almost everyone the torture of choices. This is, of course, a choice.RELATED:Big Bird Is Rich, So Why Does He Need Taxpayer Money?

164,ABC,"Entrepreneur Robert Herjavec has seemed to be everywhere in the news in recent years.Co-starring in the Emmy Award-winning TV series ""Shark Tank.""Mentoring startups like Tipsy Elves, Happy Feet and Drain Strain.Racing cars, running in marathons, and playing in celebrity golf tournaments.Gliding across the small screen in ""Dancing With the Stars.""But what many don't know is that his passion is cybersecurity, with his fast-growing global cybersecurity firm, Herjavec Group, keeping enterprise companies secure with products and services such as its highly-rated ""24x7x365 Managed Security Services"" and ""Identity & Access Management,"" which provide companies with expert IT security capabilities beyond their internal resources.""Online security has become more complicated than ever before,"" Herjavec told IBD from his Los Angeles office headquarters. ""The global cybersecurity industry is expected to exceed $1 trillion this year and increase to $6 trillion by 2021, according to Cybersecurity Ventures.""You have to be diligent. You've got to have a security framework, an incident response playbook, a proactive road map for your products and services. You've also got to educate your team. Security is everyone's responsibility in an organization.""For someone now so focused on security, Herjavec, 54, grew up in an environment that offered little of it.He was born in Varazdin, Croatia, then part of Yugoslavia. His father was a critic of the communist government and was jailed 22 times. The elder Herjavec escaped in 1970, taking his wife and son to Halifax, Nova Scotia, arriving with a single suitcase and $20. They moved to Toronto and lived in the basement of a family friend before getting an apartment. Though still new to speaking English himself, 10-year-old Robert translated the lease agreement for his parents.Kids in Herjavec's school class made fun of him for his uncool clothes and the way he spoke, but when he complained to his dad, he was told never to complain, giving him a fierce determination to better himself.After graduating from the University of Toronto in 1984 with majors in political science and English literature, Herjavec worked at a variety of jobs, including a brief stint as a debt collector.""If you're thinking that being a bad-debt collector was not the best way to launch a business career, you're wrong,"" he wrote in his new book ""You Don't Have to Be a Shark: Creating Your Own Success."" ""Four out of the five Sharks on 'Shark Tank' have worked in the collections business in some capacity. … At some point, I realized that my job wasn't about making threats to people, it was about making sales. If I could sell them on the idea of even paying a portion of their debt, I would make money for the agency. And if I exceeded my quota, I would earn a decent income.""He became very good at selling solutions, persuading the debtors that it was in their interest to make a deal. At every point in his later career, he realized that ""no one achieves success in life without knowing how to sell."" It doesn't matter what their job title is, he wrote: Lawyers negotiate agreements, brokers convince investors to put in money, and programmers present a project to management for approval, for example.Some of Herjavec's keys to successful selling:Another job shortly after graduation was as a field producer for Global TV when it needed someone who spoke Serbo-Croatian to cover the 1984 Winter Olympics in Sarajevo, in Bosnia-Herzegovina.At the end of that year, Herjavec felt that he'd had his fill of the TV business and returned home to hear his roommate complain about not getting a job in a computer startup, LogiQuest, which sold IBM mainframe emulsion boards. Herjavec knew nothing about computers, but was impressed with what he heard about the entrepreneur and landed an interview. The company founder told him he was unqualified, but Herjavec struck a deal: He'd work for free for six months as he soaked up everything about the business; at the end, if he had made a real contribution, then he'd get paid. Meantime, he covered his bills by working as a waiter into the wee hours, getting by on only a few hours sleep, a habit he has continued. He not only got paid by LogiQuest, he rose to general manager, leaving the organization in 1990.Herjavec then started BRAK Systems, an integrator of internet security software, in his basement, selling it to AT&T Canada in 2000 for $30.2 million in 2000. Three years later, he founded Herjavec Group with two partners. Their first-year sales were $400,000, which fell short of their original projection. A nimble and targeted company, it was able to grow over the years both through acquisition and organically, adapting to the needs of the market. The firm expanded its offerings from basic professional services to include consulting, PCI compliance for payment cards, and four global security operations centers (in Toronto, Los Angeles and Reading, England) to provide enterprises with additional IT security expertise. Fourteen years later, it has a projected run rate of $200 million in annual revenue.Competitors include IBM Security, part of IBM (IBM); BT Group (BT), the British telecommunication services giant; and Solutionary, an arm of NTT Group (NTT), the world's largest IT and telecom services provider. But this David has proven ability to slay Goliaths, ranking No. 2 on the Cybersecurity 500, a listing of the world's most innovative cybersecurity players by research firm Cybersecurity Ventures.In 2006, Herjavec was invited to be one of the on-camera investors in a new Canadian reality show, adapted from the Japanese original, ""Dragons' Den,"" appearing in the first seven seasons as it grew in popularity and won awards.This led to his being chosen as one of the regular stars of the U.S. version, ""Shark Tank,"" in 2009, along with fellow-Dragon Kevin O'Leary. The others (Mark Cuban, Daymond John, Lori Greiner, and Barbara Corcoran) have also become household names, as the show became one of Friday night's most popular programs, just renewed by ABC for its ninth season. It has won the Emmy Award for ""Outstanding Prime-Time Structured Reality Show"" three times. Herjavec has also appeared in a spinoff, ""Beyond the Tank,"" which follows the fortunes of startups that the investors decide to back on ""Shark Tank.""Of the 40,000 or more applicants to ""Shark Tank"" each season, only 150 make it onto one of the episodes. A Forbes analysis in November 2016 found that in the first seven seasons, 319 offers were made on camera, but 73% of the deals fell through or were significantly changed afterward. Herjavec has a much better record, with just 13 of 24 deals being changed or not working out, perhaps in part because he's known as ""the nice Shark"" and is more adaptable. He leads the team with the most investments in the auto sector (not surprising for a collector of cars). At www.Robert Herjavec.com he posts interviews with entrepreneurs he's partnered with, where they discuss what they've learned in the process of making their businesses succeed.""Although Robert never set out to start his own company, in many ways he's the perfect example of the modern, self-made entrepreneur,"" said Michael Parrish DuDell, author of ""Shark Tank: Jump Start Your Business."" ""With a fierce determination, uncompromising work ethic, and deep sense of humility, Robert taught himself how to traverse the barriers of building a business and, in the process, has created a powerful and prosperous legacy.""Founder and CEO of leading cybersecurity services firm Herjavec Group and a star of TV""s ""Shark Tank.""Overcame: Childhood poverty to found major tech firms.Lesson: When it comes to cybersecurity, you can't be too paranoid.""A goal without a deadline is just a dream.""MORE ABOUT LEADERS & SUCCESS:'Shark' Daymond John Wrapped His Brand In Hip-Hop MystiquePhil Knight Cleared Hurdles To Make Nike A Merchandising ChampionSupermodel Kathy Ireland Became A Role Model For MogulsFor Former Running Back Eddie George, It's About Forward Progress

165,ABC,"Media Bias: If you aren't up on the humanitarian crisis now gripping Venezuela, don't feel bad. The mainstream media have been largely ignoring the story, despite the fact that it's unfolding right under our noses.Venezuela's capital is closer to Washington, D.C., than is Los Angeles. But it might as well be in another galaxy given the extent of coverage that the country gets from the major news media. Not that there isn't a story to tell.In recent weeks, the country has slid from crisis down to complete chaos. Triple-digit inflation — which the IMF figures will top 700% this year — a 25% unemployment rate, shortages of food and basic necessities, and an increasingly authoritarian president grip the nation.Human Rights Watch described it this way: ""Venezuela is experiencing a profound humanitarian crisis. Severe shortages of medicines and medical supplies make it extremely difficult for many Venezuelans to obtain essential medical care. And severe shortages of food and other goods make it difficult for many people to obtain adequate nutrition and cover their families' basic needs.""Daily protests and riots against the repressive Maduro government have left at least 60 people dead in the past few months. On Saturday, a mob doused a man with gasoline and set him on fire in one of Caracas' main plazas.This week, the Organization of American States failed to reach an agreement on how to deal with the situation, despite what have been described as urgent pleas from the region's other nations.Yet these stories rarely seem to make the evening news, or the front pages of newspapers.The Media Research Center set out to determine exactly how much airtime the major networks devoted to this mounting crisis.The answer is shocking. In a report released this week, the MRC found that since March 2013 — the month Venezuela's socialist president Hugo Chavez died — until earlier this week, the big three networks devoted a grand total of 25 stories to this beleaguered nation. That's 25 stories out of 50,000 stories aired on ABC, NBC and CBS over those years.Even fewer mentioned the fact that the country is being run by a socialist government. The MRC report found that only 7 of the 25 network news stories about Venezuela included the words ""socialist"" or ""socialism.""This is in keeping with the rest of the news media which, when it bothers to cover Venezuela, acts as though the nation's problems somehow fell from the sky instead of being the direct result of socialist policies imposed on its people. Instead, reporters blame low oil prices, the weather and greedy farmers.We'd hate to think that liberal media bias — one that expresses itself in flattering profiles of left-wing dictators like Chavez and Castro, and an unwillingness to reveal socialism's dark side — is behind the news blackout of Venezuela's socialist-induced humanitarian crisis.But what other explanation is there?RELATED:Stephen Moore: Cry For Thee, VenezuelaVenezuelans Now On A Forced Starvation Diet — Thanks, Socialism!What Caused Venezuela's Collapse Is No Mystery — Except To Economically Illiterate Journalists

166,ABC,"DETROIT — If you are a person of a certain age, it's odd to drive down a major artery of a large metropolitan American city and strain to find a newspaper box at any of the crossroads.That's especially true in a city such as Detroit that has a storied history of competitive journalism that dug deep into holding power in check, whether it was city hall, the unions or large corporations.It's not that those papers are gone. The lack of boxes is partly because of contractual delivery systems and partly because of vandalism. But it's mostly because we consume our news differently.That consumption is contributing to a crisis in American journalism that benefits no one.Turn on the television at any given moment of the day and you are likely to hear the anchor say ""breaking news"" at least 12 times in one hour. Go on Twitter and you are likely to see the hashtags #breakingnews #scoop #exclusive filling your timeline from reporters and news organizations in the Washington, D.C., and New York City newsrooms. And go on Facebook and you'll see that half of your friends are posting stories from a left-leaning news organization's take and the other half are posting stories from a right-leaning news organization, and most of them are declaring one or the other ""fake news"" with lots of words in all capital letters.It's exhausting. It's frustrating. And it leaves consumers wary of how they navigate the news.Here is the hard truth: No one is exempt; there is a shared responsibility in this lack of trust between the American people and the press, and unless we find a way to unravel it, that mistrust is only going to get worse.Take my profession.Beginning in the 1980s, Washington, D.C., and New York City newsrooms began to be dominated by people who had the same backgrounds. For the most part, they went to the same Ivy League journalism schools, where they made the right contacts and connections to get their job. And the journalists who came from working-class roots found it in their best interest to adopt the conventional left-of-center views that were filling the halls of newsrooms.In short, after a while you adopt the culture in which you exist either out of survival or acceptance, or a little of both. Or you really just want to shed your working-class roots for a variety of reasons: shame, aspiration, ascension, etc.So, when fewer and fewer reporters shared the same values and habits as many of their consumers, inferences in their stories about people of faith and their struggles squaring gay marriage or abortion with their belief systems were picked up by readers.Same goes for job losses, particularly in coal mines or manufacturing. News reports filled with how those job losses help the environment are not going to sit well with the person losing their job. Also, just because they have a job that faces an environmental challenge does not mean they hate the environment.For 20 years, these news organizations, along with CBS, NBC and ABC, were the only game in town. They served as gatekeepers of information, and as their newsrooms became more and more detached from the center of the country, consumers began to become detached from them.Then, along came the internet. Different sources were now available, and news aggregators such as Drudge made it easy to find things giving everyone access to ""alternative facts.""The universe of information expanded, and it became clear that what Peter Jennings, Dan Rather or The New York Times told consumers was not the whole story. If you were a conservative (and a plurality of Americans self-identify as center-right), you lost all trust in the mainstream media.It took 17 years for that pressure to build not only among conservatives but also among Democrats who came from a family of New Deal ideals and became weary of the constant misrepresentation and belittling of the traditions they held dear: church, family, guns and life.The result was a populist explosion against all things big: big companies, big banks, big institutions and big media. The movement went undetected by the D.C. and New York centralized press not because they are bad people or because they had an ax to grind against the center of the country. It was because they just didn't know them. They did not know anyone like them, or if they did, it reminded them of all the things they despised about their upbringing, and they wanted to correct those impulses.And so, they missed it. They were a little shocked by the support for Sen. Bernie Sanders over Hillary Clinton. They were really shocked by the support candidate Donald J. Trump received in the primaries. And they were really, really shocked by his win.The problem journalists face right now is that they have never really acknowledged his win appropriately, at least not in the eyes of the people who voted for him.Since the day he won, the inference that his win was illegitimate has been everywhere. It set the tone for the relationship between the voters and the press that has only soured since November of last year.The press acknowledging Trump's victory would go a long way to begin winning that trust back with conservatives and his broader coalition of voters.Additionally, the American people need to do a better job of critically consuming their news and not crying victim when something is reported unfairly. Your knee-jerk reaction should not be to run to the conservative or liberal silo that says everything you want to hear and encase yourself in your own bubble.Skepticism is good and important. Rapid mistrust on both sides, not so much.

167,ABC,"X Amazon (AMZN) is reportedly mulling an entry into the pharmacy market, but the e-commerce giant may be less of a threat to established players than Wall Street fears, according to one equity analyst.Amazon's strength amid ongoing retail carnage is linked to innovations, such as its Prime Now home delivery service, that have made shopping either cheaper or more convenient for consumers.However, Amazon is unlikely to garner generic discounts greater than what CVS or Walgreens already offer, and Americans already enjoy mail-order drug delivery through the major pharmacy benefit managers, Mizuho Securities' Ann Hynes said in a note Wednesday.""Amazon certainly has the financial means to make the investment,"" Hynes wrote. ""The question we have is whether or not the investment would garner enough return on invested capital that Amazon typically enjoys and, for that matter, expects.""She added that Amazon would face a daunting task expanding its delivery service stateside to include drug sales. The retail pharmacy industry ""is significantly more regulated in the U.S. than in foreign markets, and we anticipate this would be a significant barrier to entry,"" she said.""We would be buyers of CVS and WBA on today's weakness,"" Hynes wrote.Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA), the largest U.S. drugstore chain, gave up 3.4% in afternoon trade on the stock market today. CVS Health (CVS) lost 3.2%, and Rite Aid (RAD) shed 2.9%. Pharmacy benefit manager Express Scripts (ESRX) dipped 0.2%, and drug distributor AmerisourceBergen (ABC) fell 2.8%. Amazon slid 1.7% amid a broad market retreat as President Trump's string of crises weigh on investors.IBD'S TAKE: Amazon's pharmacy ambitions, like its consumer electronics initiative, show the company continues to innovate. The Leaderboard stock is extended well above an 843.94 buy point.The rise of high-deductible plans, with consumers assuming more of their own health care costs, is seen as a catalyst for the online retail giant's pharmacy ambitions.Amazon has reportedly hired a general manager with the multibillion-dollar pharmacy market in view, but its entry into the business has not been finalized.""I think Amazon would introduce a lot of transparency to what drugs really cost,"" Stephen Buck — co-founder of GoodRx, a service for cost-conscious prescription-drug consumers — told CNBC, which first reported the news.Buck estimated Amazon could get $25 billion to $50 billion of the roughly $300 billion spent on prescription drugs in the U.S. a year.Amazon's Japanese site has expanded the Prime Now service to include drug sales. That could be a prelude to a similar U.S. move, because the retailer often tests new initiatives in foreign markets before rolling them out domestically, CNBC said.Amazon has toyed with the idea of an online retail pharmacy business before. It backed Drugstore.com's bid nearly two decades ago to take on brick-and-mortal rivals. That deal soon fizzled.

168,ABC,"Television stations around the country are running an ad claiming the ObamaCare repeal bill passed in the House will deprive cancer patients and pregnant women of affordable coverage. The ad, paid for by the group Save My Care, is loaded with lies.Yet television giants ABC, CBS, NBC and CNN refuse to air an ad touting President Donald Trump's successful first 100 days. CNN says it's because the Trump ad is ""false.""The media run ads they agree with and censor ads they don't like. And they defend their double standard on the pretext that their standard is ""the truth."" Don't fall for that.Allowing broadcasters to be the truth police, with the sole power to decide what you watch in your living room, puts your freedom is at risk.That's why for 80 years, federal law has compelled broadcasters to offer equal access to all federal political candidates during election season. No playing favorites. When it comes to a candidate's ad, television stations are prohibited from even requesting any edits. In return, broadcasters are shielded from lawsuits for defamation and libel if the ad's claims turn out to be false. Fair enough.But the law needs updating to protect third-party issue advertisers — not just candidates — and all year long, not just at election time. Allowing broadcasters unlimited censorship over issue ads is dangerous to our democracy. Excluding graphic violence or profanity is one thing, but picking which political messages get aired is too much discretion. The way to counter a false ad is not with media censorship. It's with an ad telling the truth.You won't find much truth in the Save My Care ad. It falsely claims that the House bill ""makes coverage completely unaffordable for people with pre-existing conditions."" In fact, the House bill protects people with pre-existing conditions with a $13.8 billion a year fund supplied by taxpayers that will pay the lion's share of their medical costs. That will keep their coverage affordable — contrary to the ad's big lie.Indeed, the House bill is fairer than ObamaCare, which foisted the entire cost of their care on people stuck in the individual market, forcing healthy buyers to pay the same premiums as sick people who use 10 times as much care.The antidote for Save My Care's ad is another ad setting the record straight. That is, if the television stations will air it.And based on how the media is dealing with the pro-Trump ad, I wouldn't count on that happening.CNN claims its refusal is because the ad depicts CNN's Wolf Blitzer, MSNBC's Andrea Mitchell and other media commentators as purveyors of ""fake news."" That's an opinion shared by many conservatives.Yet CNN insists that ""the mainstream media is not fake news, and therefore the ad is false."" CNN demanded the phrase ""fake news"" be edited out.""Apparently the mainstream media are champions of the First Amendment only when it serves their own political views,"" said Lara Trump, the president's daughter-in-law, who consults for his re-election effort.Silencing dissent isn't only a television problem. San Francisco officials have if they contain falsehoods or offensive content. But current law doesn't give city governments the discretion broadcasters have. Washington, D.C.'s, transit ad ban is being challenged in federal court, and last August, a federal appeals court struck down Philadelphia's airport ad ban. The ruling echoed the wisdom of Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis 90 years earlier.Brandeis famously said in a democracy the way to handle ""falsehoods and fallacies"" is ""more speech, not enforced silence.""That's something to keep in mind if you're home and that Save My Care ad comes on. Pick up the remote and change channels.

169,ABC,"XDrug and medical supplies distributor Cardinal Health (CAH) said it would buy the medical supply units of Medtronic (MDT) for $6.1 billion, mostly with debt. Along with weaker earnings guidance, Cardinal shares plunged early Tuesday.Cardinal Health is acquiring Medtronic's patient care, deep vein thrombosis and nutritional insufficiency units, including brands used. Combined, the units generated about $2.4 billion in revenue in the last four reported quarters, Medtronic said. They include 23 product categories across multiple market settings, including brands, such as Curity, Kendall, Dover, Argyle and Kangaroo, which are used in nearly every U.S. hospital.""This well-established product line is complementary to our medical consumables business and fits naturally into our customer offering. For this reason, this product portfolio has been on our radar for many years,"" said Cardinal Health Chairman and CEO George Barrett.IBD'S TAKE: Cardinal Health shares had been rebounding since the presidential election as investors believed Donald Trump would be less aggressive on drug prices than Hillary Clinton, despite some of his statements. But the stock tumbled through its 50-day moving average after finding support there in 2017.But Cardinal now sees fiscal 2017 earnings per share at the low end of earlier guidance of $5.35 to $5.50. It expects the deal to be boost non-GAAP EPS from continuing operations by more than 21 cents in 2018, but still sees EPS that year to be flat to down in the mid-single digits.Cardinal Health will finance the acquisition with cash and $4.5 billion in new debt. Standard & Poor's and Fitch both put Cardinal's credit rating at risk of a downgrade, citing increased ""leverage.""Cardinal Health shares tumbled 11.5% to 72.39 on the stock market today, gapping below its 50-day and 200-day moving averages.Medtronic dipped 3 cents to 80.33. Among Cardinal's fellow drug distributors, McKesson (MCK) sank 4.6% and AmerisourceBergen (ABC) 4.7%.In 2015, Cardinal Health paid about $2 billion for Cordis from Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), adding a portfolio of devices, including catheters, filters and stents.Medtronic said the transaction will reduce 2018 EPS modestly. Medtronic will spend $1 billion of the $5.5 billion in net proceeds from the deal on share buybacks, with the rest going to cut debt.RELATED:Johnson & Johnson Earnings Top, But Drug Sales Are A Drag

170,ABC,"X Walt Disney (DIS), 21st Century Fox (FOXA), CBS (CBS), Viacom (VIAB), Comcast (CMCSA) and other big companies sold off on cable advertising concerns. Meanwhile, Hulu, the streaming platform jointly backed by four major media conglomerates, has officially entered the live-television fray with a more-than-50-channel bundle, priced at $39.99 a month.Time Warner (TWX) said Wednesday that advertising revenue fell 2% in the first quarter vs. a year earlier, with declines continuing the quarter. Comcast said last week that its NBCUniversal ad revenue fell in Q1. Pay-TV operators suffered big subscriber losses in Q1 as well.CBS tumbled 3.35% on the stock market today. Disney lost 2.4%, dropping below a buy point and its 50-day moving average. Viacom reversed sharply to sink 7.5%, below its 200-day line. Fox sold off 5.1%. Comcast sank 2%, closing just below a buy point cleared after reporting earnings. Dish Network (DISH) fell 4.4% and Charter Communications (CHTR) 3.9%, both undercutting their 50-day lines. Time Warner, which is being acquired by AT&T (T), dipped 0.3%. AT&T slid 1.4% to a five-month low.Meanwhile, Hulu CEO Mike Hopkins announced the live-TV service's beta launch at its annual upfronts presentation Wednesday, calling it a ""natural extension of our business.""Disney, Fox, Comcast's NBCUniversal and Time Warner all have a stake in Hulu, which explains its fairly comprehensive channel offerings, such as ABC, NBC, Fox, E!, Bravo, USA, TBS, CNN and CNBC. The service also includes access to the platform's streaming library.Live sports stations are also part of the basket. The live service includes NBC Sports, CBS Sports Network, Fox Sports channels, TNT and a number of different ESPN stations.Like rival products from Sony's (SNE) PlayStation Vue and Dish Network's Sling TV, Hulu's package isn't all-encompassing, although it does include CBS (CBS), which has been building out its own over-the-top streaming presence through CBS All Access.As Vulture points out, the Hulu bundle lacks AMC Networks (AMCX) channels and Viacom-owned MTV, Comedy Central and VH1.For comparison, Vue's comparably priced $39.99-a-month Access tier, the most basic of four levels, offers around 45 channels. (Its high-end $74.99-a-month Ultra level includes 90 channels, including HBO and Showtime.) Sling's $25 monthly Blue-level subscription includes 45 channels but no CBS or ESPN.Hulu's service includes 50 hours of recorded storage, but 200 more hours in ""enhanced cloud DVR"" will run subscribers an extra $14.99 a month. Vue offers unlimited cloud DVR storage for 28 days. YouTube TV, from Alphabet (GOOGL) unit Google, has launched a $35-a-month service in several major cities with no cloud storage limits either.Both CBS and Viacom report quarterly results Thursday.

171,ABC,"Media Malpractice: Are the media biased? Well, despite their routine denunciations of that charge, the data show clearly that they are, as we've reported many, many times. But it's one thing to be biased — quite another to do something about it.A new poll and survey by Politico Magazine gives you an idea of just how biased against President Trump and conservatives the media really are. And the bias appears to be built-in.Politico surveyed 63 members of the White House press corps. Of those, only 5% were Republicans, while 16% were Democrats, 37% independents, and 37% weren't registered to vote at all.Let's admit one thing right off the bat: This year's poll is an improvement on last year's poll of 72 press corps members, in which none — zero, zip, nada — were Republicans. You'd think there would have been at least a token GOP press-member in there, but no.But the numbers are really worse than they look. Among those 37% ""independents"" are reporters who, for reasons of political deniability, call themselves independent rather than affiliating with a party. And some of those are actually farther left than the Democratic Party in their views.So there's just over a 3-1 ratio of Democrats to Republicans, using the poll data, but really much more like 6-to-1 or 7-to-1.What's surprising is that, since they are not being named individually, some are admirably frank about how they feel. Some 45% admitted that the media's coverage is biased against Trump. Just 2% said they are biased in his favor. Another 53% said they were not biased at all, which, if you look at actual coverage of the Trump administration vs. Obama's, is obviously false.Let us repeat that: Nearly half of all White House correspondents admit the media's coverage is biased against Trump.It's not as if average Americans don't get it. They do.A postelection poll conducted by the Media Research Center found that 69% of voters don't believe the news media are ""honest and truthful,"" while 78% felt that coverage of Trump was biased. Some 59% felt the media were biased for Clinton, while just 21% said they were biased for Trump.Perhaps most disappointing for the Big Media, 97% of those answering said they did not let the bias influence their vote.Last October, The Hill took a sample on just one Thursday evening of the main presidential coverage on ABC, CBS and NBC, just weeks before the election. The Big 3 networks ran 23 negative stories on Trump, just 1 on Clinton.For good measure, they looked at the New York Times, the august newspaper of record. It ran 11 negative pieces on Trump that day, including one on the sports page. There were none on Hillary, even though a torrent of new information was emerging around that time from WikiLeaks.The point is, and it bears repeating, the media show extreme bias in their coverage. With few exceptions, they aren't embarrassed about it; in fact, to many, being anti-Trump, anti-Republican and anti-conservative is a badge of honor.We had some hope late last year when several major media outlets — in particular, CBS and the New York Times — engaged in a bit of authentic soul-searching about their obvious bias for Clinton and against Trump in the run-up to the presidential election.But that's all over now, as this latest poll suggests. While some in the media will whine about this latest proof of their bias, facts are facts.RELATED:Trump Owes The Media Nothing — Here's WhyBush Is Wrong — The Media Aren't Doing Their JobThe Real 'Fake News' Comes From The Mainstream Media

Republican politicians like former Gov. Sarah Palin were described as incapable of escaping the ""SNL"" treatment, and voters actually thought Palin uttered Tina Fey's satirical line ""I can see Russia from my house.""And yet, the NBC show couldn't seem to locate a comedic angle on President Barack Obama, as the Times noted after his third year in office.

It reeked of adoration.In 2012, ""SNL"" writer Jim Downey was still declaring Obama mockery impossible. He said: ""Obama doesn't give you much to grab onto. He's like a smooth rock face of perfect obsidian with no ledges or toeholds, and your job is to scale 200 feet of it.""""SNL"" boss Lorne Michaels routinely — and ridiculously — claims the show is nonpartisan. This came even after two cast members quite seriously sang the '60s ballad ""To Sir, With Love"" to a picture of Obama the night after Trump's inauguration. After finishing the song, they broke out a mug reading ""World's Greatest President.""Two weeks later, ""SNL"" lurched in the opposite direction, this time with a dark and very unfunny portrayal of Trump senior advisor Kellyanne Conway as the psychopathic Glenn Close character in ""Fatal Attraction."" Her love interest in the skit is CNN's Jake Tapper. The fake Conway writhed and moaned in a sexual way about forcing Tapper to put her on television. He surrenders after she holds a knife to his throat, but then she accidentally falls out the window to her death, only to peel herself off the sidewalk and pull herself together like a horror movie monster as she says grotesquely: ""I only have three lives left. See you on the news!""Reaction wasn't positive. ""Prediction: the White House will use that sexist skit to dismiss all criticisms of Conway and lying more broadly,"" tweeted liberal Daily Beast writer Olivia Nuzzi. She also said: ""Casting Kellyanne Conway as Glenn Close was a miscalculation on SNL's part. Will be interpreted as unfair and mean to a wife and mother.""Other liberals agreed. NBC's own Andrea Mitchell said it was ""Not Right."" The New York Times found that the skit was unfocused with a ""queasy edge of sexism.""On Monday morning, ABC brought on leftist Muslim comedian Dean Obeidallah to praise the skit as empowering for liberals. He said: ""I think it was actually really well done, and I think in today's day and age, comedy is cathartic. We need to be laughing at the Trump administration. For those people who don't like the Trump administration, it's a release and makes you feel good. I think it's empowering.""ABC reporter Jonathan Karl disagreed. ""I don't think it was funny. It seemed to be incredibly mean-spirited. This is somebody who has young children,"" he said. ""What makes SNL so funny is when they cut a little bit toward the truth. That was just not an accurate portrayal of Conway. I mean, she is somebody who actually is pushed to do more television by the president. ... She has many more requests to go on television than those that she actually accepts. ""For months now, the media have thrown every kind of screwball at Conway, but she keeps hitting everything out of the park. They loathe her, and now they're trying to ruin her.Alec Baldwin and ""SNL"" have been poking fun at Trump mercilessly for months. Hard-hitting? Of course. Funny? You better believe it. Trump's supporters — and President Trump himself — should laugh. But what is being done to Kellyanne Conway is no laughing matter. ""SNL"" needs to cut it out.RELATED:Donald Trump News & TweetsWhy Are Trump's Approval Numbers Low? Ask The HatersIs This Trump's Watergate, Or Revenge Of The Swamp People?

174,ABC,"After failing in its attempt to delegitimize and defeat Donald Trump through persistently negative coverage of the candidate throughout the recent campaign, the establishment news media might have been expected to acknowledge its failures and make some effort toward restoring objectivity to journalism.However, the American public, which has lost confidence in the news media due to its antagonistic approach to President Trump and his supporters, has little hope that the media will cover the Trump presidency in a fair and objective way, according to the findings of a recent Investor's Business Daily/TIPP Poll.For much of our nation's history, the press earned the trust of the American people with a tradition of objective reporting aimed at providing the public with the facts. During the American Revolution, newspapers were instrumental in both keeping colonists engaged in the effort and inspiring many to join the fight.Nearly 200 years later, the Washington Post's coverage of the Watergate scandal also demonstrated how American journalism, when dedicated to the pursuit of the truth, can shake up the power structures and create change.However, the media elite's relentlessly negative and antagonist coverage of Trump, both before and after the election, has damaged trust in the news media, giving rise to a significant credibility gap between the establishment news media and the American people.The public's growing distrust of the establishment news media has been captured by a number of recent polls.According to an IBD/TIPP Poll conducted in December, more than half of Americans (55%) report they have less trust in the news media as a result of its coverage of the 2016 election. While Republicans hold the highest share of Americans (71%) who are losing faith in the news media, a majority of independents (56%) also say that they trust the media less in the wake of the recent election.In addition, a Media Research Center/YouGov Poll conducted between Nov. 9 and 10 found that nearly 7 in 10 voters (69%) do not feel that the news media are honest and truthful. Further, according to a Gallup Poll conducted in September, only 32% of respondents report having a great deal or fair amount of trust in the media's ability ""to report the news fully, accurately and fairly,"" the lowest level in the poll's history of gauging confidence in the media.The American people's waning confidence in the news media is largely due to its overwhelmingly negative coverage of Donald Trump throughout the presidential campaign. While enclosed in their bubble of cosmopolitan elitism, the media ran story after story that promoted the narrative that Trump was a racist demagogue bent on destroying American democracy. In doing so, the media sought to cast Donald Trump as unfit for the presidency, and to discourage his supporters from voting.The establishment media's credibility was further marred by most pundits' and pollsters' pre-election prognostications of a stinging defeat for Trump. Pointing to numerous polls that gave Hillary Clinton a comfortable lead, many journalists and media pundits called the race for the Democrat days before the election.As one example, Washington Post columnist George F. Will echoed many of his media peers as he predicted a landslide victory for Clinton, in an article titled, ""Donald Trump may find a place in history — by losing just that badly.""Further, nearly all the election models published by media organizations had Hillary Clinton as the odds-on favorite to win the presidency. Heading into Election Day, the New York Times' The Upshot put the Democrat's chance of winning at 85%, while giving Trump a mere 15% chance to prevail. The Huffington Post's forecast was even more favorable to Clinton, assigning her a 98% chance of becoming president, and predicting a landslide 323 electoral-vote victory for the Democrat.Thus, as Election Day showed, the media elite's attempts to sway the election by painting Trump as a dangerous and unhinged candidate were not only unsuccessful, but also self-defeating. By the end of the campaign, most Americans perceived the media's anti-Trump bias.For instance, an Associated Press-GfK Poll released at the end of October 2016 revealed that 56% of likely voters believed the media are biased against Trump, with a mere 5% saying that they were biased in his favor. Further, nearly 9 in 10 Trump supporters (87%) felt that the media were biased against their candidate.Americans' awareness of the establishment media's opposition to Trump was also uncovered in an IBD/TIPP Poll in September. According to the poll, the share of registered voters who perceived the media's coverage of Donald Trump as being ""too tough"" (33%) was twice what it was for Hillary Clinton (16%).Accordingly, in opposing Donald Trump through a constant barrage of negative news stories, the news media unwittingly set itself against a large segment of the population that felt Trump gave a voice to their discontent. During a campaign that witnessed a surge in populist sentiment, many of Trump's supporters, particularly working class Americans, perceived that their values were being derided by the media elite. They rallied behind the candidate who also faced the media's disdain — and who was successfully fighting back.This was explained brilliantly by Fox News media reporter Howard Kurtz during an appearance on America's Newsroom the day after the election: ""A lot of the people who support him (Trump) or are inclined to support him despise the media, see us, collectively part of the establishment, and he was fighting against us. He was fighting for them.""Thus, in electing Donald Trump as the 45th president of the United States, the American people have dealt the establishment media — which strongly opposed Trump throughout the campaign and expected him to lose handily — a striking repudiation, putting its credibility on life support.Despite being handed what amounts to a vote of no confidence from American voters, the news media do not appear to be ready to return to objectivity any time soon. In fact, the media's coverage of Trump has only become more negative and hostile since Election Day, as Democratic-leaning pundits and journalists attempt to delegitimize the Trump presidency.The news media have devoted much coverage to reports of Russia's alleged hacking into the Democratic National Committee and the Clinton campaign in order to promote the narrative that Trump was illegitimately elected. Although there is no credible evidence to suggest that Russian interference had swayed the outcome of the election, the media has used the story to insinuate that Trump may have been elected with help from the foreign power.Hence, New York Times columnist Paul Krugman, in a piece published on Dec. 12, claimed that the 2016 presidential election was a ""tainted election,"" which Trump won ""only thanks to foreign intervention and grotesquely inappropriate, partisan behavior on the part of domestic law enforcement.""Various television news programs also used reports of alleged Russian election meddling to cast doubt on the legitimacy of a Trump presidency.For instance, on the Dec. 11 installment of ""Face the Nation,"" host John Dickerson and Slate correspondent Jamelle Bouie discussed ""new"" information gathered by the intelligence community which, says Dickerson, indicated that Russian interference was ""targeted to help Donald Trump.""During the segment, Bouie explained how this ""news"" could call into question the legitimacy of the recent election: ""If it is true, if we have further verification of this, then what it suggests potentially is that the election was in some sense illegitimate.""Further, appearing on ""Good Morning America"" last month, ABC Chief White House Correspondent Jonathan Karl related to anchor George Stephanopoulos how it was unlikely that Trump would retaliate against Russia for alleged hacking activity since it ""arguably helped him get elected president.""Some in the media went beyond insinuation, unabashedly declaring that Vladimir Putin and Russia were directly responsible for the election of Donald Trump.On MSNBC's ""Hardball"" at the end of December, Jason Johnson, politics editor for the Root, referred to the election as an ""amazing coup"" by Putin, who ""took over the United States and got himself a Manchurian candidate.""Not to be outdone, Keith Olbermann, host of the webshow ""The Resistance"" for GQ.com, has referred to Trump as a ""puppet of Putin"" and lamented that, as a result of Russian interference in the recent election, ""we are no longer a democracy, we are no longer a free people, we are the victims of a bloodless coup.""It is not surprising, therefore, that some have even considered the possibility of holding another presidential election, a ""redo"" of sorts, over alleged Russian interference. For instance, in an appearance on ""CNN Newsroom"" the day after the Washington Post published its story on the CIA's assessment of Russian meddling, Robert Baer, an intelligence and security analyst for CNN, stated that, if Russia interfered in the election, ""I don't see any other way than to vote again.""The media elite's eagerness to delegitimize the Trump presidency was most evident when CNN and BuzzFeed reported on a suspect intelligence report that claims Russia holds compromising information on Trump which could be used for blackmail. Buzzfeed's publication of the unverified dossier, which contained salacious allegations against Trump, was roundly criticized, even by some in the establishment media, such as the Atlantic and Vox.In a recent interview on ""Fox News Sunday,"" Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Bob Woodward of Watergate fame referred to the dossier as a ""garbage document"" that should never have been published.However, Trump may actually benefit from this blatant attempt by the media to undermine his presidency. CNN and Buzzfeed's reporting on the unsubstantiated document, which contains bizarre allegations that are obviously fictitious, gave credence to Trump's claims of media bias. It also demonstrates why the media have lost so much credibility in the eyes of the American people.Besides attempting to delegitimize the Trump presidency, the media elite have also tried to cast doubt on Trump's fitness to serve, both morally and mentally. For example, a number of media pundits and columnists have claimed that racism played a significant role in Trump's victory, and have stoked fears that his presidency would resemble an authoritarian regime.Soon after Trump won, CNN's Van Jones declared on air that the election ""was a white-lash against a changing country, it was a white-lash against a black president.""In a Dec. 7 article for the New York Times, columnist Andrew Rosenthal also suggested that Trump ran a racist campaign, claiming that it offered ""a platform to white supremacists."" He chastised Trump supporters who, wittingly or not, voted for ""a candidate who espoused racism and xenophobia and told lie after lie without remorse.""Some in the media portrayed Trump as an authoritarian, even before he officially took office. On ""Meet the Press"" in late December, MSNBC correspondent Joy Reid expressed concern that, by electing Trump, America could ""slip casually into authoritarianism,"" as his approach to government already contains, in her words, ""some real elements of authoritarianism.""Daily Beast contributor Dean Obeidallah echoed these fears, but with more specificity. On the Dec. 9 edition of CNN's ""New Day,"" Obeidallah accused Trump of creating a cabinet that amounted to a ""dream team of anti-Muslim hate.""Some in the media elite have even questioned the state of Trump's mental health. In an article titled ""Is Donald Trump Mentally Ill? 3 Professors Of Psychiatry Ask President Obama To Conduct 'A Full Medical And Neuropsychiatric Evaluation,' "" Richard Greene of the Huffington Post claimed that Trump satisfies the criteria of a ""narcissistic personality disorder,"" and thus represents a ""serious danger to the country and the world.""Questioning a president's moral and mental fitness could be dismissed as partisan attacks or as talking points aimed at boosting support. However, as the Washington Post's Richard Cohen demonstrates in his Jan. 9 piece, ""How to Remove Trump From Office,"" some may be questioning Trump's fitness to have him impeached. Cohen writes that Trump should be subject to ""impeachment by the House and conviction by the Senate,"" using the 25th Amendment, which he says provides a way to remove a president from office if he or she is ""unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office.""As grounds for this, Cohen cites Trump's alleged bullying, lying and demagoguery: ""Donald Trump is a one-man basket of deplorables. He is a braggart and a liar. He is a bully and a demagogue. He is an ignoramus and a deadbeat, a chiseler and either a sincere racist or an insincere one, and his love for himself is matched only by my loathing of him. He is about to be president of the United States. A constitutional coup may be in the offing.""However, as was the case before the election, Americans recognize the news media's anti-Trump frenzy and have little hope the media elite will cover Trump's presidency in an objective way. In our latest IBD/TIPP Poll, nearly half of respondents (45%) believe that the news media are rooting for President Trump's failure, compared with 10% who say that the media want him to succeed. Meanwhile, only 38% of Americans report that the media are indifferent to Trump's success or failure.It is not surprising, therefore, that the public is highly skeptical that the media will fairly cover Trump. According to our poll, 49% of Americans feel that the news media will be ""too tough"" in their coverage, while just 24% say the coverage will be fair and balanced. Digging deeper, nearly 9 in 10 Republicans (85%) and close to half of independents (48%) expect the media's coverage of President Trump to be ""too tough.""Thus, if the establishment media maintains its negative coverage of Trump, in which nearly every move he makes is subjected to excessive outrage from pundits and columnists, they risk widening their credibility gap with the American people, and will continue to lose to a president who knows how to take on the media and win.The media's antagonistic coverage of Trump insults the intelligence of Americans, who are beginning to tune out. Will they abandon the establishment media for good?RELATED:IBD/TIPP Presidential Leadership PollIBD/TIPP Poll Main PageIBD/TIPP Election 2016 Tracking Poll

175,ABC,"It shouldn't be considered remarkable that all three major broadcast networks offered a news story on the tens of thousands who came for the 2017 March for Life. But it is. Between the morning and evening shows, the networks gave it almost 22 minutes of airtime altogether. To illustrate how shocking that number is, consider that last year, ABC gave the march 35 seconds of coverage. NBC ignored it altogether. Ditto for CBS.There are two obvious reasons for this change. First, unlike the Reagan administration or the two Bush administrations, the Trump administration made modern history by sending speakers — two top-shelf speakers — Vice President Pence and top White House advisor Kellyanne Conway. Both were eloquent additions who made it an obvious news event.The second was the media's massive coverage of the Women's March on Washington, which came one day after President Trump's inauguration, and the demand that some sort of balance be shown. But it wasn't. The networks gave that march more than 75 minutes of coverage, about 3.4 times as much as the pro-life rally. In fact, they gave the leftist protest 23 minutes of promotion before it even happened.For liberal journalists, the inauguration was depressing, and the Saturday march was the happy news. As Time's Karl Vick wrote in a 10-page spread about the liberal protesters, ""Many said it was the best they've felt since Election Day."" Left out of that narrative was the way leftists behave when they feel good: Some went to the march dressed as vaginas. At least one held a 3-foot-tall penis sign. Speakers hurled obscenities across the National Mall. Madonna expressed her thoughts of bombing the White House.Now let's reverse the equation and take you back to 2009. The March for Life took place two days after President Obama's first inauguration, and tens of thousands of protesters were present. It surely gave many social conservatives their best feeling since Election Day, bonding them in common cause as Obama and Democratic majorities in Congress were arrayed against them. And guess what happened. ABC, CBS, NBC and PBS aired nothing. Time and Newsweek reported nothing. The New York Times printed nothing — for the second year in a row.So if the perceived futility of these conservative protesters made the event less than newsworthy eight years ago, that logic should have held for the Women's March in 2017. But neither logic nor balance are at play here. All that matters for the press is how does it make me feel? And how does it help us win?Let's face it. The left thinks it owns the act of protesting. And to the left, the idea of conservative protests is an oxymoron. It can't possibly be sincere or representative of a movement.Back in 2009, these liberal networks tried to ignore tea party rallies across America, and when they couldn't ignore them, they dismissed the crowds as undemocratic tools of capitalist puppet masters. ABC's Dan Harris relayed, ""Critics on the left say this is not a real grassroots phenomenon at all, that it's largely orchestrated by people fronting for corporate interests."" On NBC, Chuck Todd said: ""There's been some grassroots conservatives who have organized so-called tea parties around the country. ... But I tell you, the idea hasn't really caught on.""Now, hopeful liberal journalists are suggesting that the Women's March could be the tea party movement that will elect a Democratic wave in the 2018 midterm elections. Just remember that these same networks suggested that Sen. Wendy Davis was going to ride a blue wave through Texas a few years back after her ""epic filibuster"" against an abortion bill in 2013. She ran for governor in 2014 and lost by more than 20 points. As President Trump just proved again, the liberal media are so closely tied to the far left that they've lost touch with America.

Time Warner (TWX), which has agreed to be acquired by AT&T, owns a 10% stake in Hulu, which plans to launch a live TV service in early 2017. Hulu will also offer video-on-demand and DVR.CBS (CBS) recently signed a deal with Hulu, giving it all four broadcast networks, including ABC, NBC and Fox. Local channels on DirecTV Now are available in select markets from ABC, NBC, Fox, where the broadcasters have owned-and-operated stations.AT&T, however, lacks CBS. Still, that's not the main consumer complaint about the service. Users instead have reported problems with reduced video quality, loading content and frequent buffering, as well as error messages.AT&T isn't alone in early technical hiccups. Dish Networks' Sling OTT (over-the-top) service encountered streaming issues during college basketball's March Madness tournament in 2015. Dish's Sling now has about 1 million subscribers, analysts estimate.Sling service starts at $20 a month but doesn't provide programming from the four major broadcast networks. It includes sports channel ESPN, though.AT&T stock edged up 0.34% to 41.10 in the stock market today. Apple stock rose 0.81% to 120, staying in a buy zone from a breakout at 118.12, first touched Jan. 6.RELATED:AT&T CEO Says Company Won't Spin Off CNN To Get Time Warner OK$35 DirecTV Now Live Streaming Deals Lives On After Promotion Ends

177,ABC,"Michelle Obama made her last public speech as first lady. The networks lined up with a 21-handkerchief salute. Nothing will ever be the same.NBC's Andrea Mitchell proclaimed that the speech was ""one of hope and empowerment for the young people she has championed for eight years ... her unique voice rejecting the racial overtones of 2016."" Obama is a ""once-reluctant political wife, fighting an early caricature as an angry black woman."" Now, Mitchell says, she is ""a political orator in a class of her own."" (How quickly they forget that she proclaimed herself to be proud to be an American only when her husband, who has stoked racial tensions for eight years, started racking up primary victories in 2008.)CBS' Julianna Goldman touted how Obama ""used her celebrity to inspire physical fitness"" and ""turned into the Democrats' not so secret weapon"" in 2016. (Donald Trump won the election. How much of a weapon was she?)But these two networks dug deeper. NBC devoted a whole hour of ""The Tonight Show"" to honoring her. Host Jimmy Fallon oozed: ""Thank you, Mrs. Obama, for being a strong, smart, independent woman; an activist; a style icon; and a great dancer; and showing us all what it would look like if Beyonce married a much nerdier Jay Z."" The next morning, the ""Today"" show aired that clip along with a tweet that proclaimed: ""I'm so speechless. I cried, I laughed, I got chills, and I most definitely grieved. Michelle is truly iconic.""CBS was even worse. It went directly to Oprah Winfrey — who endorsed President Obama in 2008 — for a one-hour prime-time special in December. She uncorked the superlatives, saying, ""Mrs. Obama is not only a woman to watch in American politics but also considered the coolest first lady in U.S. history.""Coolness is measured by ideology, not personality. They consider all Republicans to be doormats, yet they gush over Hillary Clinton, the flattest doormat in recent White House history.The gush continued. Winfrey said: ""With every song, every laugh and daring style choice, the power of Michelle Obama's personality and authenticity has made her a pop culture icon. ... Her fresh approach shined a light on the initiatives she felt most passionate about."" She even cheered ""the Obamas' openly affectionate and romantic marriage"" as being ""a dramatic and welcome change for the first couple living in the White House."" That juxtaposition refers only to the Clintons, and that's something the left will never acknowledge.In case anyone forgot, this is not how the networks treated Laura Bush. After a few polite first lady questions, she would often get George W. Bush-bashing hardballs. In 2005, ABC reporter Jessica Yellin exploited a segment that was supposedly about White House Christmas cards to ask, ""Have you ever met with a mother whose own loss has made you question, even for a moment, whether the U.S. should be in Iraq?""In 2007, while interviewing Laura Bush, ABC's Robin Roberts cited columnist Thomas Friedman as saying ""we should export hope instead of fear."" She added, ""Desmond Tutu went even farther, saying the generosity of Americans — that's what we should export instead of our bombs.""Even after the Bushes left Washington, D.C., it continued. In 2010, NBC's Matt Lauer asked Laura Bush about New Orleans: ""Is it ever painful for you to come back to this region because in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, it seems so much of the blame for what happened or didn't happen here was laid at the feet of your husband?""There was no hourlong Winfrey special or Fallon flattery. Laura Bush didn't have a media cult to praise her every ""iconic"" utterance and dance move. That's what Republicans have expected — and quietly tolerated — for decades. But Michelle Obama coverage sounds like what a state-run media in an authoritarian backwater would broadcast about the Great Leader's spouse.

178,ABC,"For weeks, the liberal media have celebrated all that President Barack Obama means ... to them. CNN produced a two-hour documentary on the Obama legacy that never mentioned things like annual trillion-dollar deficits. Fareed Zakaria wrapped up the show saying, ""He ran an administration that was largely scandal-free and did it all the while under a microscope because he looked different.""This kind of fake news will continue through Obama's farewell address and President-elect Trump's inauguration.But let's dig in to media history to recall how differently the media treated President Ronald Reagan as he delivered his farewell address to the American people in 1989. The night before the speech, CBS reporter Lesley Stahl spoke for the media elites on NBC's ""Later"" with Bob Costas. ""I predict historians are going to be totally baffled by how the American people fell in love with this man and followed him the way we did,"" she said.That was a confession. No matter how diligently Stahl and her liberal colleagues had tried, their attacks on Reagan could not weaken his hold on the public.Just moments after the speech, ABC brought in Sam Donaldson to kvetch. He said: ""It was a very self-congratulatory speech. The president talked about his accomplishments in very glowing terms. He talked about the deficit once. But he didn't mention a lot of things that historians will look and say 'No, it didn't happen just that way, and it didn't turn out that well.'""It was common to bring up what Reagan wouldn't mention. The morning after the speech, ABC anchor Lark McCarthy announced: ""The speech did not mention the Iran-Contra scandal, the hostages or Panama. And there was no mention of ethics or the continuing nightmare of terrorism."" Correspondent Jeanne Meserve did the same, saying, ""The president barely mentioned the federal deficit and didn't talk at all about some of the other failures of his presidency: Central American policy, the Iran-Contra affair and the American hostages in Lebanon.""On ""CBS This Morning"" that day, co-host Harry Smith pressed Reagan's daughter Maureen Reagan about poverty: ""He talked about being proud of what's happened with the economy, about the millions of new jobs that have been created. And as I listened to that, I also thought one out of five babies born in the United States are born into poverty. There are hundreds of thousands of people in this country now that are homeless, have no place to live. I wonder, how does your father reconcile that in his mind? How does he reconcile those two things?""That evening, CBS reporter Richard Threlkeld gave Reagan credit for one achievement: ""peace abroad."" As for the recovery, he argued, ""Things are not nearly as prosperous as the president makes them sound,"" ludicrously claiming that Jimmy Carter was a better president. ""On average, more new jobs were created every year under Jimmy Carter than Ronald Reagan,"" he said.Appearing on the CBS late-night news show ""Nightwatch"" with Charlie Rose that same evening, Laurence Barrett of Time magazine noted that Reagan didn't say much about then-president-elect George H.W. Bush: ""That would have prompted all of us to say, 'Hey, why didn't he mention the horrendous problems he's leaving George Bush?' Reagan pumped a lot of electricity into the American system when it needed it. He's leaving it to George to pay the electricity bill."" Barrett slammed Reagan as ""the perpetrator of the great free-lunch illusion: that we could have all of these goodies and not pay the bill.""That was then. This is now. Joe Klein of Time magazine summarized Obama's tenure by saying: ""There would be little melodrama and absolutely no hint of scandal during his time in office. The conservative fever swamps would be no less pustulent than they were during the Clinton presidency — indeed, the level of race-based hatemongering was frightening — but somehow the Obamas never let it get to them.""

179,ABC,"Politics: We've been arguing for some time that if you want to find intolerance, extremism, hate and bigotry in this country, it's thriving on the left. The past week provides several bits of fresh evidence of this.First, there's the ABC News/Washington Post poll published last week that found just 28% think the Democratic Party is ""in touch with the concerns of most people in the United States today."" Even among Democrats, only slightly more than half (52%) think the party is in touch with people in the country.It's not as if President Trump or the Republicans do that much better. The poll found that 38% say Trump is in touch, and 32% say Republicans are in touch with the people.Nevertheless, it's a shocking finding, given that Democrats have spent decades portraying Republicans as out-of-touch extremists who only care about the rich. Or, as newly appointed DNC chairman Tom Perez put it, Republicans ""don't give a sh-- about people.""The New York Times fretted in an editorial that ""for the first time in memory, Democrats are seen as more out of touch with ordinary Americans than the party's political opponents.""Tim Ryan, D-Ohio, called it a huge wake-up call. ""Having two-thirds of the country think that your party is in la-la-land, that's a bombshell.""In fact, IBD has for years been pointing out the Democrats' drift to the fringe, using data from the IBD/TIPP poll and voting records in Congress.As for the ABC poll being a wake-up call, the party's leadership has given no indication that it's even heard the phone ringing. Last we checked, the same people who drove the party to the fringes are still in charge.Next we have a lengthy article in the left-of-center Daily Beast on Sunday by respected demographer Joel Kotkin, titled ""The Arrogance of Blue America,"" in which he details how liberals have grown increasingly isolated from and intolerant of those who don't live in deep blue urban centers."" Many in the deepest blue cores"" are, he writes, ""developing oikophobia — an irrational fear of their fellow citizens"" and are ""abandoning the toiling masses.""""The argument made by the blue bourgeoisie is simple,"" he says, ""Dense core cities, and what goes on there, is infinitely more important, and consequential, than the activities centered in the dumber suburbs and small towns.""Kotkin concludes his biting article by saying that progressives need to ""leave their bastions and bubbles, and understand the country that they are determined to rule.""Despite such entreaties, the left appears to be retreating deeper into its bubble.When CNN's Jake Tapper asked smug liberal comedian/political commentator Samantha Bee this weekend whether there is a ""smug liberal problem,"" her response was: ""I don't think there is.""Meanwhile, a survey of Dartmouth students published last week found that not only are liberals smug, they are far less tolerant of other viewpoints than Republicans on campus.More than two-thirds of Republican students at Dartmouth (69%) say they'd be comfortable with a roommate who had opposing political views. But only 39% of Democrats said that. Nearly half of Democrats said they'd be uncomfortable with a roommate of a different political persuasion; just 12% of Republicans said that.""It's unfortunate — I wish we had more political diversity,"" Dartmouth College Democrats President Charlie Blatt said. ""I think the dialogue is good."" Even if Blatt believes this, many of her fellow liberals on campuses around the country clearly would rather shout down and assault people who'd provide that diversity.This intolerance is not just limited to ""free thinking"" college campuses, it shows up everywhere these days on the supposedly tolerant left. When The New York Times hired Pulitzer Prize-winning commentator Bret Stephens as a columnist, liberals went ballistic.After Stephen's first column ran, which focused on global warming and in which he argued that ""treating skeptics as imbeciles and deplorables wins few converts,"" liberals started canceling subscriptions and the Times was forced to defend itself for publishing such environmental blasphemy.Times' executive editor Dean Baquet said on Sunday: ""Didn't we learn from this past election that our goal should be to understand different views?""Apparently not.RELATED:Disagreeing With Democrats Is Now Considered Un-AmericanLeft-Wing Bigotry And Hatred Is On Full Display After Trump WinYour Tax Dollars At Work: Subsidizing Elite Colleges That Produce Intolerant Bigots

180,ABC,"Leftist protesters around the country used the tax deadline on April 18 as an occasion to hold rallies demanding the release of President Trump's tax returns. They could use large inflatable chickens and signs with hammers and sickles saying ""Show us your rubles"" and no journalist would be offended.Knowing the president, this will have all the effectiveness of national rallies that demand we get transcripts of Hillary Clinton's six-figure speeches. It's unlikely.But the Saturday network newscasts promoted the anti-Trump ""resistance"" without really noting that it's a bit strange for left-wingers to be protesting on taxes, unless they think rates are dangerously low. CBS correspondent Errol Barnett announced, ""As nationwide Tax Day protests reached the sunny streets of West Palm Beach, Florida, today, President Trump spent time at his International Golf Club and Mar-a-Lago resort nearby.""On ABC, they acknowledged ""violent clashes"" among protesters in California, and anchor Tom Llamas promoted the wave, saying, ""There were about 150 Tax Day protests demanding to see the president's tax returns, even at the president's Mar-a-Lago resort."" NBC led the whole newscast on the protests, including the violence that erupted in Berkeley.Something was missing in all of this protest publicity: the notion that the protesters weren't a real grass-roots movement. Liberal journalists are always happy to see liberal protesters boosting any mob that matches their ideals. Because they are liberal, they are always presented as authentic, diverse and representative of the public, regardless of the last election's results. It can be rigidly organized by MoveOn and other leftist groups, but it will be painted as spontaneous.But rewind to eight years ago: While the networks covered conservative Tax Day protests against then-President Obama, the emphasis was on how phony they were.ABC reporter Dan Harris suggested the protesters were AstroTurf ""cheered on by Fox News and talk radio."" As opposed to ""authentic"" organizers cheered by ABC, CBS and NBC? Harris added: ""Critics on the left say this is not a real grassroots phenomenon at all, that it's actually largely orchestrated by people fronting for corporate interests. ... While the Boston Tea Party in 1773 was about taxation without representation, critics point out that today's protesters did get to vote — they just lost.""CBS reporter Dean Reynolds announced that while ""a fistful of rightward-leaning websites and commentators embraced the cause. ... fresh polling indicates there is not all that much passion about high taxes in the country at large right now. Gallup this week found 61% of Americans see their federal income taxes as fair.""On NBC, Lee Cowan reported that ""organizers insist today's tea parties were organic uprisings of like-minded taxpayers from both parties,"" but ""some observers suggest not all of it was as homegrown as it may seem."" His ""observer"" was colleague Chuck Todd, who didn't exactly have his finger on the 2010 pulse. Earlier that day, Todd insisted that the idea of these ""so-called tea parties ... hasn't really caught on.""Oops. Wishful thinking trumped reporting.The networks also spent the Obama years ignoring how the tea party was motivated by historically enormous trillion-dollar deficits. Facts like those were stubborn things. Journalists felt it was best to navigate around them as the ""news"" consisted of congratulating Obama for his ability to sing Al Green songs and his rib-tickling ObamaCare-promoting interviews with supportive comedians.It's ironic that the liberal media now accuse President Trump of lacking any principles and being indifferent to public policy matters. Perhaps after their performance in the last eight years, the anchormen should be looking in the mirror.RELATED:Now We Know, Trump Paid More Than His Fair Share Of Taxes In 2005Why Does It Cost $409 Billion To Figure Out What We Owe In Taxes?Trump Needs A Big Win On The Board, Here's How To Get One

181,ABC,"Media Bias: By now, it should be no surprise at all that the big media lean left and, at times, behave as if they were an arm of the Democratic Party, not a fair dispenser of news and commentary. But a new report shows that, under President Trump, the problem has grown even worse.The conservative-leaning Media Research Center did a lot of TV watching earlier this year, looking at all of the mainstream evening news coverage — from ABC, CBS and NBC — of Trump and his new administration from Jan. 20 through April 9.During that time, they counted 869 stories about the Trump White House, with 737 of those being full reports and 132 being briefer items. An added 140 reports dealt with other things but also discussed Trump.What it found was, in a word, disappointing but not surprising: ""As President Trump approaches the end of his first 100 days in office, he has received by far the most hostile press treatment of any incoming American president, with the broadcast networks punishing him with coverage that has been 89% negative.""Well, at least they didn't ignore him. Reporting on Trump — whether about his executive orders banning immigration from seven Muslim countries where terrorism is a problem or Russia's supposed role in influencing the 2016 presidential election or the battle over ObamaCare — was overwhelmingly negative in nature.That 89% figure wasn't just made up. The MRC's analysts looked at 1,687 statements used to evaluate the Trump administration, looking for those that ""imparted a clear positive or negative tone to the story,"" whether they came from so-called ""nonpartisan"" experts or the three big networks' own reporters.The result: 1,501 of the comments used to evaluate the Trump administration were classified as negative, while just 186 were positive. As far as we could tell, there really wasn't a single topic on which the media gave the new  president a break.Compare this with the copious love heaped on the new administration of President Obama to get a real idea of just how bad the coverage has been.Back then, Obama had what was beyond doubt the most radical set of incoming policies for any president since FDR, policies that in retrospect didn't perform as promised.Nonetheless, his slate of radical policies won heavily positive coverage. For his $1 trillion stimulus, which failed to ""stimulate"" anything, he won 58% positive coverage; for getting the government even further involved in the housing market, 59% positive; and for more government regulations and taxes to fight global warming, 78% positive.As an example, they cite Brian Williams' embarrassing gush over Obama's first month and a half on NBC's Nightly News: ""The president's first seven weeks have been a whirlwind, with often dramatic movement in all directions, on all fronts: the economy, health care, two wars and today education reform.""Yes, and we know how all that turned out. The economy has experienced its slowest growth since the Great Depression; ObamaCare is collapsing from its own intentionally poor design; major parts of the Mideast, Africa, Latin America and parts of Asia are beset with civil strife, armed turmoil and outright war; and education is just as bad today as it was when Obama entered office.But, hey, ""dramatic movement in all directions""!It's depressing, really, that the media have become so awful, beyond parody even. The idea of fulfilling their role as defenders of truth, discoverers of facts, and independent editorial voices in the highly politicized world we live in today seems alien to our friends in the big media.No, in the great battle over the direction of our nation, they've taken sides. That may be a big reason why, despite their prominent place in the American media landscape for decades, ABC, NBC and CBS are losing viewers and shrinking in relevance.RELATED:Sorry, Bush Is Wrong — The Media Aren't Doing Their JobThe Real 'Fake News' Comes From The Mainstream Media Trump Owes The Media Nothing — Here's Why

182,ABC,"As a writers' strike looms, negotiations between the Writers Guild of America and the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers are off for a week while Hollywood's scribes convene to vote on whether to authorize a work stoppage.If reports of Tuesday night's WGA meeting in Los Angeles are any indication, writers are in solidarity that they are prepared to hit the picket lines.The consequences of a strike — which would start on May 2, if a deal can't be reached — could potentially be more devastating for the entertainment industry than that of the 2007-2008 walkout, Barclays analysts have said.When that 100-day strike began, Netflix's (NFLX) streaming service had only been around for a few months and the Apple (AAPL) iPhone was but a new gadget, they point out. Now, if the lights go out on new shows, viewers have more options than watching reruns on TV — which could lead to ""lasting changes in viewership patterns.""""If networks are unable to air new seasons due to the strike, this could result in a much greater shift towards (over-the-top) platforms than would be the case otherwise,"" wrote Barclays analysts Ross Sandler and Kannan Venkateshwar in an April 12 note.""In this environment, what would be needed are platforms that carry originals since YouTube TV, DirecTV Now, etc. still rely largely on legacy television.""That means Netflix, Amazon (AMZN) — and Facebook (FB), even.""While Netflix and Amazon's pipelines are also likely to be affected by the writers' strike, their library of original content could realize much wider viewership in the absence of competition from legacy TV,"" they wrote. ""These companies also have the ability to source content globally, as evidenced by the number of British shows on Netflix.""And if viewers are binge-watching ""The Great British Bake Off"" or the entire season of ""13 Reasons Why,"" they might not miss the fare on CBS (CBS), ABC or Fox.Netflix's chief of content, Ted Sarandos, essentially confirmed in the company's earnings call late Monday that the platform's operations would be less hard hit by a work stoppage.""Look, we're keeping an eye on it like everybody else and like everybody else our productions would be impacted if it happens,"" he told analysts. ""We may be impacted a little bit less, because we're not on such a rigid production schedule, where we're not producing for the fall in the summer, we're in year-round production. But some of our productions would be held up in the event of a strike, which our fingers are crossed that, that won't happen.""Alongside pension and health plan concerns, the boom of streaming services and their short seasons are part of the reason why writers are lobbying for updated terms. As episodic seasons have gotten shorter, writers — who are paid per episode and are contractually bound by seasons — say they are being made to work for less money over the same period of time.A recent analysis from The Hollywood Reporter reveals that ""growth in the labor supply has outstripped growth in demand, while shorter series orders mean writers, who are held under option from season to season, may be working yet making less than before.""The number of TV series on the air has doubled in the last six years to 455, but the number of episodes per series has dropped dramatically, said the outlet, which means only modest growth in overall produced episodes.Besides turning away viewers, a strike could also result in lost ad dollars at a time when the disparity between digital ad growth and TV ad growth is already widening.Barclays notes that a strike in May would disrupt the upfront season, when media buyers make key TV advertising purchases, and potentially divert more ad dollars toward digital platforms.""The timing of the strike with the upfronts bodes well for Facebook's push into premium video content and mid-roll video ads, as we expect to see a bunch of announcements next week at F8 on this theme,"" said Sandler and Venkateshwar.Facebook hasn't yet made any announcements about scripted content at F8, but Day 2 of the developer conference is just getting underway Wednesday.Shares of Netflix fell 2.5% to 139.76 on the stock market today after sinking 2.6% on Tuesday following its weaker-than-expected Q1 subscriber growth figures. Amazon fell 0.5%, and Facebook rallied 0.9%. Walt Disney (DIS) dipped 0.4% and CBS ticked up 0.3%.

183,ABC,"XDelta Air Lines (DAL) on Wednesday said that more legislation to regulate the overbooking of flights wasn't necessary and called the practice a ""valid business process,"" and it emphasized that it handled involuntary boarding denials better than rivals.The remarks from the carrier, on a conference call to discuss first-quarter earnings, came after New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie on Tuesday called for a halt to the rule that enables airlines to overbook flights after a passenger was dragged from a sold-out United Express flight on Sunday.Delta, however, would not comment on whether it was concerned that more regulations on overbooking were coming. The airline said that managing overbooked flights before boarding was crucial and that the process wasn't a ""significant challenge"" for them.Delta on Wednesday said it had 1,200 involuntary boarding denials last year. That was five times better than other major carriers, it said.Government data, as reported elsewhere, has shown that Delta had the lowest rate of involuntary removals last year and from 2008 through 2016 among major U.S. airlines. United, the data shows, has reduced the rate at which it bumps passengers against their will.Delta sees passenger unit revenue, the metric that Wall Street zeros in on to gauge an airline's efficiency, rising 1%-3% in Q2. That was in line with Wall Street forecasts for a 2% gain. Second-quarter capacity was seen as flat to up 1%. Full-year capacity growth will be capped at 1%.Delta earned 77 cents per share in the first quarter, above estimates for 75 cents. Revenue of $9.148 billion was shy of expectations for $9.184 billion. Total passenger unit revenue edged down 0.5% but was positive in March for the first time since November 2015.""We expect the entirety of our 2017 margin pressure to have occurred in the March quarter from higher fuel prices,"" said CFO Paul Jacobson in a statement. ""With an improving revenue profile and further improvement as our cost growth moderates in the second half, we are on track to expand margins for the balance of the year.""Delta fell 0.5% to 45.05 on the stock market today, reversing from morning highs of 47.17 as broader averages retreated. American Airlines (AAL) clung to a 0.1% gain. United Airlines (UAL), which reports Monday, briefly erased its weekly losses and peeked above its 50-day line, but retreated for a 1.1% decline.Delta's outlook comes after the carrier this month canceled around 4,000 flights following heavy thunderstorms around Atlanta. Management said the storm will reduce its Q2 pretax income by $125 million.Delta, during the earnings call, said the carrier was not understaffed, but that a combination of severe storms around Atlanta during the spring-break travel season limited what it could do to accommodate passengers. The carrier said it was investing in technology to help better track crews to minimize disruption.The carrier said it had completed its expansion of its basic economy fare option in the U.S. and Canada. It described its recent joint-venture agreement with Korean Air as a ""game-changer"" and said alliances in the trans-Pacific region were ""crucial.""IBD'S TAKE: U.S. airlines have paid more attention to Asia, where a massive upswing in travel demand is expected in the years to come. Meanwhile, they also face more competition from low-cost carriers in Europe. But Delta's flight cancellations and United's difficulties have brought more scrutiny over the way airlines manage bookings — and the dignity that carriers afford passengers.The industry has used higher-end fares and business travel to drive unit revenue while testing the boundaries for ""economy"" seating amid ultra-low-cost competition. Wall Street has pressed for fuller flights and limited availability — moves that can squeeze airfares and profits higher and boost airline stocks. Airlines also regularly overbook flights as a hedge against people who don't end up aboard the plane.United has drawn sweeping condemnation after video posted on social media showed police wrestling a passenger, David Dao, from his seat and dragging him by his wrists down the aisle of a sold-out United Express flight heading to Louisville, Ky., from Chicago.The situation arose after the carrier said it needed four passengers to give up their seats to accommodate crew members needed for another flight. After a voucher offer didn't work, the carrier selected passengers to leave. Dao refused; authorities dragged him away.In an interview with ABC News' ""Good Morning America"" broadcast Wednesday, United CEO Oscar Munoz said he felt ""shame"" watching the incident. He said that in the future the carrier would not use a law enforcement official to remove ""a booked, paid, seating passenger. We can't do that.""United Airlines later said it would reimburse tickets for everyone on the flight.Since the incident occurred, United has appeared to try to balance defending its reputation while standing by its employees. Munoz said language used in prior remarks — including an apology for ""having to reaccommodate"" passengers, which drew ridicule given what video footage showed — ""fell short"" of what he and the company were feeling.He called the incident a ""system failure"" and said United needed to look at the way it offers incentives to passengers once they board planes.""We have not provided our front-line supervisors and managers and individuals with the proper tools, policies, procedures that allow them to use their common sense,"" Munoz said. ""They all have an incredible amount of common sense, and this issue could have been solved by that. That's on me. I have to fix that.""He said he hasn't spoken to Dao and that the company's attempts to reach him have been unsuccessful. Munoz told ABC he had not considered resigning.On Tuesday, Munoz said the carrier would conduct a review of its relationships with airport and local authorities and the way it handles oversold flights and present the findings in some form by April 30.RELATED:What The New Travel Ban Means For Airlines, Travel Demand

184,ABC,"Comcast (CMCSA) is again stepping outside its cable comfort zone with plans to introduce an online video service offering hit shows from its NBCUniversal TV networks in the next 12 to 18 months, as part of an effort to compete with rivals Netflix (NFLX) and CBS (CBS), according to people familiar with the matter.The new service will include programs from the NBC broadcast network, and could include shows from Comcast cable channels Bravo, Syfy and USA, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing private plans. Comcast is still determining many of the particulars of the service, including whether it will have a live feed of the broadcast network and whether it will include sports, the people said.The service could help Comcast continue to adapt to a TV industry that has transformed before its eyes since the cable provider acquired a majority stake in NBCUniversal in 2011. Tens of millions of customers signed up for services from Netflix and Amazon.com (AMZN) to get access to vast libraries of shows on-demand and over the internet, while viewership of live TV dropped among all but the oldest of viewers.Several of NBC's peers have responded to the shifting landscape by introducing online TV services of their own to satisfy viewers who don't pay for cable or satellite packages. CBS sells All Access, an online-only version of the CBS broadcast network that includes a live feed, and created a new streaming service for premium cable network Showtime. Time Warner (TWX) did the same for its premium cable network HBO.None of these services have attracted customers at the same rate as Netflix, Amazon or Hulu. CBS said in February its services each have more than 1.5 million subscribers, while HBO Now has surpassed 2 million.Comcast's new service may take a while because the cable provider is still hamstrung by restrictions imposed by regulators in the deal for NBCUniversal. The rules make it difficult for Comcast to sell services entirely comprised of its own content. The last of the prohibitions expire in September 2018.IBD'S TAKE: Comcast shares are hovering near an all-time high, but its stock has yet to crack the 39 level. Still, the cable operator is trying to break the mold in the industry by offering wireless services with unlimited access. With a Composite Rating of 80 from Investor's Business Daily, Comcast ranks second in the Telecom Services-Cable/Satellite Group, just behind J2 Global (JCOM).Comcast added video subscribers last year for the first time since 2007 after weathering the loss of hundreds of thousands of customers fleeing for cheaper online video services. The largest U.S. cable operator has struck recent deals to accommodate changing viewing habits, incorporating Netflix into set-top boxes and making Comcast's Xfinity TV service available on devices from privately held Roku.Comcast has acquired rights from cable network owners to offer their channels nationwide, according to people familiar with the negotiations, giving the cable giant a backup plan if rival online-TV services catch on with consumers. The company also has a comedy streaming service with original programming, called Seeso, and a sports package with cycling and rugby, called NBC Sports Gold.While rivals CBS and Walt Disney's (DIS) ABC suffer steep viewer losses, NBC is riding high this season. It is the most-watched network among viewers 18 to 49, the demographic most important to advertisers, thanks to stalwarts ""Sunday Night Football"" and ""The Voice"" as well as the biggest new hit of this TV season, ""This Is Us."" NBCUniversal's cable networks haven't fared as well.RELATED:Comcast Edges Closer To Wireless War, Armed With Unlimited Deals

185,ABC,"In the closing days of the 2016 election cycle, much of the elite media created and promoted the illusion that then-candidate Donald Trump had little hope of winning the presidency, and would likely, in the words of GQ's Jim Nelson, ""lose this election badly.""The media based this narrative on the consensus of nearly every national poll which showed Hillary Clinton with a comfortable lead throughout the campaign and into Election Day. However, as one of the two polls that which correctly predicted a win for now President-Elect Trump, the Investor's Business Daily/TIPP Poll was able to poke holes in the media's narrative on a daily basis by consistently showing a close race, and conveying with unimpeachable data Mr. Trump's winning momentum.While most major polls displayed head-scratching fluidity in the election's final weeks, the IBD/TIPP Daily Tracking Poll, from its initial release on October 19th to its final installment on Election Day, persistently showed a stable and tight contest between now President-Elect Trump and his Democratic opponent.In 13 of IBD/TIPP's 21 days of tracking, the race was either tied or separated by a mere point.Comparing our performance over time to the output of most other surveys during the same period demonstrates how misleading and self-defeating much of the polling industry was in propping up Mrs. Clinton's standing in the polls. For instance, in the first three installments of our poll, Mr. Trump held a one-point lead over Mrs. Clinton. As the days went by, the Democrat slowly gained ground on her challenger, peaking at a four-point advantage over Mr. Trump on October 29th.However, momentum for Trump in the last week, an element that was mistakenly dismissed by much of the elite media and polling organizations, proved to be a real force as our final installment showed Mr. Trump with a 45.0% to 43.4% lead.IBD/TIPP's assessment of the presidential race during its closing weeks stood in sharp contrast with the narrative championed by nearly every other major poll.For example, released just days after the first installment of the IBD/TIPP Daily Tracking Poll, which showed Mr. Trump with a slight one-point advantage, the October 23rd edition of the reputable ABC News/Washington Post Poll had Mrs. Clinton ahead of her opponent by an astounding 12 points.Around the same time, a poll conducted by the Associated Press gave Clinton a 14 point lead. Further, on the day of our first release, the RealClearPolitics average of polls yielded an advantage of 6.2 points in favor of Mrs. Clinton.While these stunning leads provided the news media with an opportunity to crown Mrs. Clinton America's next president weeks before Election Day, polls giving the former secretary of state such a commanding advantage at this point in the race actually hurt her chances of winning the White House. In subsequent ABC News/Washington Post Polls, for instance, Mrs. Clinton's seemingly insurmountable 12-point lead quickly deteriorated, dropping at first to a nine point lead and then, in the next release, falling  to a margin of six points.In the next installment, released on October 28th, the Democrat's advantage declined again, to four points, followed by another two-point drop in the proceeding release. By the start of November, the race was basically a dead heat, with Mr. Trump taking a slight one-point lead in the poll.Thus, the establishment media's premature coronation of Hillary Clinton and discussion over her potential cabinet picks suddenly gave way to alarm over the Democratic candidate's dramatic loss of support.However, as our poll consistently confirmed, the presidential race was always close. In fact, in our 21 days of tracking the contest, neither candidate enjoyed a lead of more than four points. Hence, polls that greatly exaggerated Mrs. Clinton's advantage over then-candidate Trump actually backfired against the Democrat as they showed an equally unrealistic steep decline in her support.In the closing days of the election, however, the media elite's fluid polls restored Mrs. Clinton to her position as the presumed winner, as they again showed her solidifying a comfortable lead over Mr. Trump.Coincidentally, by Election Day, six polls tracking a four-way presidential race, including the ABC News/Washington Post Poll, all converged at predicting a Clinton victory by a margin of four points. The final Monmouth University Poll gave Mrs. Clinton a six point advantage over Mr. Trump, while the overall RealClearPolitics average of polls placed the Democrat 3.3 points ahead of her opponent. Moreover, nearly every final poll showed the Democrat winning by margins that were to the right of her current lead in the popular vote.At the same time, the IBD/TIPP Poll, which had been labeled an ""outlier"" by the Washington Post for showing a stable and close race in October, proved to be the only poll to call now-President-Elect Donald J. Trump the winner in a four-way race.Thus, the accurate performance of our poll sheds light on the fundamental reason why every other indicator misread the election: the elite media's bias in favor of the Democratic Party.Throughout the campaign, many in the news media abandoned all pretense of objectivity, and set out to delegitimize Donald Trump's candidacy and portray him as a demagogue. In an article written back in August, New York Times columnist Jim Rutenberg seemed to acknowledge the unprecedented opposition directed towards Mr. Trump from members of the press: ""If you view a Trump presidency as something that's potentially dangerous, then your reporting is going to reflect that. You would move closer than you've ever been to being oppositional.""Accordingly, with the news media being so antagonistic in their coverage of Mr. Trump, it should not be surprising that their own polls would be more favorable to his opponent. In order to create a feeling of malaise among Trump supporters, and to discourage them from voting, the media used their polls to promote the narrative that Mr. Trump could not and would not win the presidency.However, the media and polling powers, enclosed in a bubble of cosmopolitan elitism, failed to comprehend the high level of enthusiasm that was clearly evident among Trump supporters.Many in the news media belittled and dismissed Mr. Trump's ardent supporters as ""deplorable,"" when in fact they represented the forgotten working-class in Middle America struggling in an economic system that had failed them. While large crowd sizes at Trump's rallies, often numbering in the tens of thousands, should have been an indicator of high turnout for the Republican candidate, most in the mainstream media continuously claimed that there was little correlation between the size of campaign rallies and voter turnout on Election Day.It's not surprising, therefore, that most media pundits and pollsters assumed that turnout would closely resemble the previous two elections. Leading up to Election Day, many in the media highlighted Mrs. Clinton's lead in the polls, as well as her significant ground game advantage over Mr. Trump, as evidence that high turnout among Democrats, especially within certain demographic groups like Hispanics, would ultimately deliver the White House to Mrs. Clinton.In our polling, however, we experienced firsthand the surge in enthusiasm among Republicans for Mr. Trump, which was impossible to dismiss. Up until our last day of tracking the race, we consistently had more Republicans than Democrats willing to take part in surveys. In our twenty years in the public opinion research industry, we had never before experienced such a phenomenon. Hence, we correctly inferred that turnout among Republicans would more likely resemble turnout levels displayed in 2004 than the previous two elections.In the end, Democrats failed to turnout at the high levels that most media pundits and pollsters had anticipated, while Republican turnout outperformed expectations.Ironically, the media and polling elite's confident presumption of a Clinton victory may have played a role in the lower turnout among Democrats. Expecting Mrs. Clinton to easily win the presidency, a significant number of Democrats may not have felt compelled to vote, and so stayed home on Election Day. Further, some have claimed that the Clinton campaign was undone by its confidence in the favorable polling numbers championed by the news media. In the final days of the campaign, Mrs. Clinton, expecting her famous ""blue wall"" to hold firm, and failing to take Mr. Trump's outreach to the Rust Belt states seriously, devoted little effort to states such as Michigan and Wisconsin, which would end up breaking for Mr. Trump.Radio talk-show host Rush Limbaugh discussed such claims on the November 17th edition of his program, noting how the Clinton campaign ""thought they had it in the bag, didn't even go to Wisconsin, didn't even take Trump seriously. They thought they were gonna win five or six points."" The campaign, relying on the majority of polls that were giving Mrs. Clinton a comfortable lead, neglected states that they felt were already won. Hence, Mr. Limbaugh makes a great point in his ironic suggestion that ""if I were Hillary, I might think of suing the media and their polling units.""Thus, in our determination to present the presidential race as it really was, without regard to political bias, the IBD/TIPP Poll acted as a much needed ""truth serum"" in the 2016 election, exposing the liberal leanings of many in the elite news media and polling organizations who were so certain that now President-Elect Donald J. Trump would lose the election.As a result of Mr. Trump's upset win, the rest of the polling industry will be assessing why they gauged the election so incorrectly. Though a number of polling organizations may point to such issues as a failure in modeling or the ""silent voter"" theory to explain their poor performances, they risk future setbacks if they fail to recognize the systematic Democratic bias in their polling.RELATED:IBD/TIPP Election 2016 Presidential Tracking Poll

186,ABC,"Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg is under enormous pressure from the left to crack down on the ""fake news"" circulating on the social-media giant. He is well-advised to run as far as he can from the News Police.In a recent note on Facebook, Zuckerberg claimed he wanted to err ""on the side of letting people share what they want whenever possible. ... We do not want to be arbiters of truth ourselves, but instead rely on our community and trusted third parties."" The hard left, beginning with President Obama, wants to be that community, that supposedly disinterested third party. It is another step in the long march toward silencing conservative thought in America.Make no mistake about it: Fake news does exist. Everyone is used to false click-bait, like the recent ""Megyn Kelly leaving Fox?"" story floating around the internet, which claims she's leaving to promote some blah-blah-blah skin care product. Then there are the offshore fake news factories churning out ""shocking"" reports about Pope Francis backing Donald Trump.Are these annoyances? Yes. Are they threats to Western civilization? Hardly.The left saw an opening with talk of fake news and pounced. On the campaign trail, Obama said: ""If they just repeat attacks enough, and outright lies over and over again, as long as it's on Facebook and people can see it, as long as it's on social media, people start believing it. And it creates this dust cloud of nonsense."" It was an obvious slam of the Trump team.If what Trump states is false, then to give it endless oxygen by writing story after story on it is to engage in fake news.Fox News is mocked as Faux News by this camp. Obama told Rolling Stone that part of the problem is seeing ""Fox News in every bar and restaurant in big chunks of the country,"" which is as inappropriate a complaint as it was exaggerated. He doubled down and praised the hippie hoaxmeisters of campus rape, saying: ""Good journalism continues to this day. There's great work done in Rolling Stone.""Are the red flags for fake news only going to target stories that upset liberals? The leftist group Media Matters for America is claiming it will de-emphasize its Fox News obsession to focus instead on websites like Breitbart and the ""alt-right"" platforms in an effort to be that ""trusted third party"" to help run Facebook's algorithms.Do you think they would ever call out leftist fake news outlets like, oh, themselves?The networks have labored mightily to avoid videotapes demonstrating Planned Parenthood allegedly sold dead baby parts to fetal-tissue researchers. The left said those taped admissions are somehow faked, even after all the footage, which shows no such thing, was made available. Then there's hidden camera footage of Democratic operatives who discussed sending thugs in ""Trump is a Nazi"" T-shirts to agitate Trump supporters and ""draw them out to punch (them)"" in front of the cameras. Clearly that is fake news. Where are Obama and Media Matters when we need them?If messing up and publishing or broadcasting false news ruins an entire outlet as fake news, then goodbye, mainstream media. ABC faked the sales of rancid meat at Food Lion. CBS offered unverified Texas Air National Guard memos against former President George W. Bush. NBC faked a pickup truck explosion. The Washington Post had Janet Cooke. The New York Times had Jayson Blair. CNN had Peter Arnett ... and Brian Williams, Brian Williams and Brian Williams.Mark Zuckerberg really doesn't want to mess with this mess. It is censorship at its ugliest.

187,ABC,"Walt Disney (DIS) said late Wednesday that its flagship sports network, ESPN, lost roughly 2 million customers in fiscal 2016 to 90 million, the fewest since 2005, as Americans continue to cut the cord.Disney disclosed in an SEC filing that ESPN subscriptions fell by 2.2% in the latest year. But that's better than 2015's 3.2% fall to 92 million and 2014's 4% retreat to 95 million. ESPN subscriptions peaked at 99 million in 2013.Disney CEO Bob Iger earlier this month, on the fiscal Q4 conference call, said ESPN sub losses ""have abated.""ESPN2 customers sank 3.3% to 89 million, down from a 2013 peak of 99 million. ESPNU had 71 million subscriptions, down 1.4%.NFL ratings have fallen sharply this season. Football had been relatively immune to the cut-the-cord phenomenon, so the early season drop has triggered huge concerns throughout the sports and media circles. Some cite the election season, others blame sub-par games. But others point to the sluggish pace of play and heavy ad loads.Both Disney's Iger and CBS (CB)S CEO Les Moonves have taken a wait-and-see approach about what's to blame for NFL ratings.Meanwhile, Disney Channel lost 2 million subs to 93 million. Freeform, formerly ABC Family, sank 2.2% to 91 million in domestic customers.RELATED:Disney's 'Rogue One' Is No Womp Rat: Up To $150 Million Opening SeenDisney Holds Off On Blaming Election For Ratings Slump; Tax Deal Seen

188,ABC,"The stock indexes were near session lows in afternoon trading Wednesday as the latest policy statement from the Federal Reserve loomed.The Fed will announce its stance on interest rates at 2 p.m. ET. No change is expected, but the Fed announcement can cause volatility in the stock and bond markets, making it an event to watch for investors.The Nasdaq was down 0.8% as Alphabet (GOOGL), the parent of Google, fell below the 50-day moving average. The stock, however, has not triggered any sell signals. The S&P 500 was 0ff 0.6% as both indexes tried to hold above Tuesday's session lows. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 0.4%.Volume was running higher on the Nasdaq but nearly flat on the NYSE compared with the same time Tuesday. Losers led winners by roughly 3-to-1 across the board.Earnings accounting for much of the movement in the trading today. The health care sector was up, partly due to earnings reports.WellCare Health Plans (WCG) leapt nearly 4% as it continued to rally from Tuesday's earnings report, which showed a 57% surge in earnings per share. The stock has reclaimed a 117.61 buy point but is now extended as it approaches an all-time high of 128.42, recorded nine years ago.Drug distributors, which were routed last week on fears of pricing pressures, led the market Wednesday. AmerisourceBergen (ABC) provided a spark, after it beat profit estimates. Adjusted EPS rose 12% to $1.30 and sales rose 6% to $37.6 billion. AmerisourceBergen also said it is launching a new $1 billion share repurchase program. CEO Steven H. Collis said the company has ""great confidence"" in its relationships with customers and portfolio of services.Medical supply, outpatient and home care providers and managed care industry groups were others up 1% to 3%.Generic drugs were also leaders, but mainly because of a single stock. Eagle Pharmaceuticals (EGRX) jumped 22% to a nine-month high after the company got a more-favorable reimbursement treatment for a cancer drug from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.In other sectors, Advanced Energy Industries (AEIS) climbed above the 48.69 buy point of an ascending base. Shares of the power-conversion technology company topped the entry Tuesday, but erased nearly all gains and closed below the buy point. Advanced Energy beat earnings expectations Monday, but there was no news today.Match Group (MTCH) plunged 8%, falling below its 50-day moving average in big volume and below the 17.10 buy point of a breakout Sept. 22.

189,ABC,"Eli Lake at Bloomberg News reported on April 3 that President Trump's lawyers discovered it was former President Obama's national security adviser Susan Rice who allegedly ""requested the identities of U.S. persons in raw intelligence reports on dozens of occasions that connect to the Donald Trump transition and campaign.""Susan Rice at the center of another scandal? Yes, and she's lying about it on TV again. On ""PBS NewsHour"" on March 22, anchor Judy Woodruff introduced the interview by telling viewers she asked Rice about whether Trump and his transition officials ""may have been swept up in surveillance of foreigners at the end of the Obama administration.""Rice protested: ""I know nothing about this. I was surprised to see reports from Chairman Nunes on that count today."" The Obama appointees were supposed to be smart, and yet they always say they didn't know anything.The PBS interview came about because the Washington Post allowed Rice to make a transparently hypocritical argument about truth twisting on its op-ed page that day. A preposterous promotional email headline read: ""Susan Rice: When the White House twists the truth, we are all less safe. The actions of America's allies — and enemies — depend on our perceived credibility.""On Sept. 16, 2012 — five days after radical Islamic terrorists killed four Americans in Benghazi, Libya — Susan Rice lied through her teeth on five Sunday news programs that this preplanned attack with rocket launchers was somehow a ""spontaneous reaction"" to a ""hateful and offensive video"" on YouTube. Then, like many liars, she had the audacity in 2014 to declare on ""Meet the Press,"" ""What I said to you that morning, and what I did every day since, was to share the best information that we had at the time.""Everyone knows that is patently false. Evidence flowed in that she and the president and then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton knew it was a terrorist attack. But everyone claimed otherwise for more than a week. They had an election to win. The media gently helped them lie.Journalists now declare in self-righteous tones that they care dearly about the facts and will never spread delusions. But Judy Woodruff threw a softball, asking Rice to explain the ""serious charge"" against Trump in her Post article. She never made the obvious point that Rice was the least qualified bureaucrat to lecture anyone about telling the truth on national security issues.Eli Lake's story on Rice wasn't evaluated for truth or falsehood. It was dismissed as a pro-Trump story designed to change the subject (or the target). ABC and NBC skipped any mention of it on their evening newscasts. CBS mentioned it in passing.CNN anchor Don Lemon spoke for many journalists as he hissed: ""There is no evidence that backs up the president's original claim. And on this program tonight, we will not insult your intelligence by pretending otherwise, nor will we aid and abet the people who are trying to misinform you, the American people, by creating a diversion.""""Aid and abet."" The ""objective"" anchors at CNN treat the president as a criminal in their metaphors. The media don't care first about facts. They care first about liberal victory. Their hope now is to remove Trump from office. Keep that in mind when they speak.

190,ABC,"We are witnesses to an abuse of power by government that represents a test of our democracy. Anyone who fails to rally to the cause of the Americans victimized in this case should be discredited.Though I have not been shy about criticizing President Donald Trump when I think he deserves it, he is not involved.I refer to the Kafkaesque malfeasance by Xavier Becerra, attorney general of California. Becerra, for many years a Democratic congressman, is using his office to hound two citizen journalists. They came into his sights because their videos exposed the sickening reality behind the euphemistic surface of Planned Parenthood. Becerra and other abortion-rights absolutists found this embarrassing. Why do I call it Kafkaesque? Because David Daleiden and Sandra Merritt, who went undercover to reveal the law breaking of Planned Parenthood, now find themselves, not Planned Parenthood, accused of 15 felony counts by the state of California.Their crimes? Recording people without their consent. The editorial board of the Los Angeles Times, to its credit, has called this a ""disturbing overreach."" And Kevin Drum of Mother Jones, while condemning Daleiden's politics, has defended his rights, saying, ""This was a legitimate investigation, and no level of government should be in the business of chilling it.""Xavier Becerra is no stickler about secret recordings. In 2012, he relished the release of Mitt Romney's surreptitiously recorded comments to donors in which Romney mentioned the ""47%."" Romney had joked that if he were Hispanic, he'd win the election. Becerra didn't seem concerned about Romney's privacy rights when he rushed to the press to denounce the Republican: ""The insult of all insults, Mitt Romney says if he was Latino he would win the presidential election, as if being Latino would have given him any advantage to win the White House.""Could there have been a political motive? Consider that the prosecution began under Becerra's predecessor, Kamala Harris (now California's junior senator), whose website urged Californians to ""support Planned Parenthood"" (recusal anyone?) and who was not above sending police to raid not just Daleiden's office but also his home, in search of video footage.Let's review. When the Daleiden videos were first released in 2015, they were so damning that Planned Parenthood president Cecile Richards felt the need to release a video apologizing for the ""tone and statements"" of a Planned Parenthood executive. That was Dr. Deborah Nucatola, who said this about the techniques she uses to preserve body parts for donation (and sale): ""We've been very good at getting heart, lung, liver, because we know that, so I'm not gonna crush that part, I'm gonna basically crush below, I'm gonna crush above, and I'm gonna see if I can get it all intact.""Daleiden's group recorded dozens of hours of video at several abortion clinics. It's a disgrace that no prosecutor followed up with charges against Planned Parenthood based on the evidence Daleiden obtained. The explicit haggling over the price of body parts should have been enough to at least get started.And it is a scandal that most of what Daleiden documented is legal. I personally will never forget the images of those tiny baby parts being picked over with a tweezer on a light table. How atrophied does your human sympathy have to become to push human remains (excuse me, ""tissue"") about as if they were frog cadavers? And the callous insouciance of the Planned Parenthood doctors and other employees who spoke of getting ""intact calvariums"" (heads) and other specimens was enough to nauseate a neutral observer.That's why Planned Parenthood has circulated the false story that the videos were ""deceptively edited."" Alexandra DeSanctis debunked that fiction. Planned Parenthood has resorted to lies about its grisly trade for many years. Recall that in 1995, Ron Fitzsimmons acknowledged that the entire abortion industry, of which he was a part, had ""lied through (our) teeth"" about partial birth abortion.The lying is a civic hygiene problem. But what is happening to David Daleiden goes beyond that. This is a political vendetta and thus a malicious prosecution. Yes, California law forbids recording a person without his consent. But there are exceptions, as the LA Times editorial noted, in cases of public interest. Thus, ABC News, among others, has done covert investigations of various entities without risking retaliation from the attorney general. Animal welfare activists who have gone undercover to reveal the mistreatment of chickens have not been prosecuted. But then, baby chicks are defenseless.

191,ABC,"On March 16, a 14-year-old girl was allegedly pushed into a boys bathroom at Rockville High School in Maryland and raped by two other students during school hours. Police arrested two freshmen who recently arrived from Central America, 18-year-old Henry Sanchez and 17-year-old Jose Montano. Sanchez, a Guatemalan, has a pending ""alien removal"" case against him. Montano, from El Salvador, is a minor, so his immigration status was not released.The Washington Post reported, ""The two took turns holding the girl down and sexually assaulting her as she cried out, fought back and repeatedly told them to stop, according to police affidavits filed in court.""Montano and Sanchez were charged with first-degree rape and two counts of first-degree sexual offense. This inflammatory story about immigrants was seen as Trump-reinforcing news, so ABC, CBS, NBC, PBS and MSNBC aerobically avoided it. CNN mentioned it once in passing for about 100 words.A reporter for WTTG, the Fox News station in the nation's capital, asked White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer on March 21 whether the reported crime would change government policy that insists public schools can't discriminate in admitting students based on their immigration status. Spicer replied: ""It is horrendous and horrible and disgusting what this young woman in Rockville went through. ... I think part of the reason that the president has made illegal immigration and crackdown such a big deal is because of tragedies like this.""But none of these networks could be shamed into caring.CNN ""Reliable Sources"" host Brian Stelter actually criticized Fox for making the Rockville alleged rape a national story. He said: ""Rapes and assaults and murders are local news stories on a daily basis. But when do they break through to become national news, and when do they not?"" According to him, Fox pumped up the story to help President Trump.Stelter then cited the story of an alleged white supremacist from Baltimore who drove to New York City and stabbed and killed a 66-year-old black man, saying, ""But this story received almost no coverage on Fox or CNN or anywhere else, for that matter — another example of a crime, but not a crime that fit the political agenda of those pro-Trump hosts on Fox.""He was wrong. ABC gave that crime three stories over a 24-hour period, and NBC reported it briefly. One reason for its low profile may not be political. The New York Times first reported that murder in a local ""About New York"" column by Jim Dwyer on page A-19.But CNN's Brian Lowry underlined Stelter's point, saying: ""It really dovetailed with the theme Fox wanted to push: Fox's immigration agenda. ... And I also think the fact that they could use it to buttress their point that this is the kind of coverage you won't get on other media, that's just a win-win for them.""This is the liberal blindness that the ""news"" czars demonstrate. An immigrant convicted of raping or killing someone is an inconvenient fact if you're a liberal, but it's a fact. Somehow, the girl allegedly raped in Rockville is not a fact, just as Kate Steinle being murdered in San Francisco by an illegal immigrant was not a fact. The left must always define what the relevant ""facts"" are, and its supposedly overflowing compassion will never reach the victims of inconvenient crimes.

195,ABC,"Shares of drug-distribution giant McKesson (MCK) went into free fall Friday morning, dragging its two main rivals with it, after it reported fiscal second-quarter earnings that were well short of analyst estimates and drastically lowered its full-year forecast.McKesson stock tumbled by nearly 29% at one point, and ended the day down 22.7% to end the session at 124.11. Its chief rivals in the drug distribution business, Cardinal Health (CAH) and AmerisourceBergen (ABC) both were down by double digits. Cardinal finished the day down 9.8% to 67.50 a share and AmerisourceBergen plunged 13% to 69.14.A note from Citi Research analyst Garen Sarafian said McKesson was blaming AmerisourceBergen for much of its troubles, saying AmerisourceBergen had made a move to shore up more business from independent pharmacies.""While we have no reason to refute (McKesson) management we respect, we find it extremely odd that peer raised through the ranks of the company's conservative culture for nearly a quarter-century would choose to compete so aggressively as to create such a large impact on (McKesson),"" Sarafian wrote.San Francisco-based McKesson said adjusted net income was $2.94 per share, while the average estimate of 10 analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research was for earnings of $3.05 per share. The prescription drug distributor posted revenue of $49.96 billion in the period, which also did not meet Street forecasts. Six analysts surveyed by Zacks expected $51.43 billion.IBD'S TAKE: McKesson stock had long been reliable, climbing steadily to an intraday peak of 243.61 in May 2015, but has plunged since then. Friday's stock plummet puts it at half of its peak value. It now ranks third in IBD's medical and wholesale drug supplier group, with AmerisourceBergen now at the top.McKesson lowered its full-year earnings forecast to a range of $12.35 to $12.85 per share. Estimates from Thomson Reuters had called for earnings of $13.59 a share.With Friday's tumble McKesson shares have fallen nearly 40% since the beginning of the year, while the Standard & Poor's 500 index has increased slightly more than 4%.McKesson, Cardinal Health and AmerisourceBergen have a virtual stranglehold on the drug distribution market, collectively controlling well over 90%. McKesson is the biggest of the three, with annual revenue of more than $180 billion, putting it in the fifth spot on the Fortune 500 list. AmerisourceBergen is 12th with more than $135 billion and Cardinal is 21st at more than $102 billion.All three, however, exist on razor-thin margins that often are 1% or less. McKesson's $307 million in net income is 0.6% of its nearly $50 billion in revenue for the quarter.

196,ABC,"Media baron John Malone says Walt Disney (DIS) would be more attractive to Apple (AAPL) as an acquisition if Disney spun off sports channel ESPN.In an interview with CNBC, Malone praised AT&T's (T) move to acquire media giant Time Warner (TWX), saying it gives the telecom conglomerate much-needed diversification. AT&T announced a deal to buy Time Warner for $85.4 billion in cash and stock on Oct. 24.Apple reportedly has passed on making a counter bid for Time Warner, despite the urging of Goldman Sachs bankers.Malone says Apple could be interested in Disney, if it shed ESPN along with billions of dollars in contracts for sports-programming rights. Disney reports earnings late Thursday. Apple stock fell 2.8% while Disney stock rose a fraction in the stock market today.IBD'S TAKE: Disney stock has been a laggard and has a Composite Rating, a metric in CANSLIM investing, of only 62 out of a possible 99. Disney stock has edged up since the AT&T-Time Warner deal was announced but is still down about 9% in 2016. Learn more at IBD Stock Checkup.""If I had to guess what you will see is a split of Disney, with ESPN spun off,"" Malone told CNBC. ""And probably ESPN could be owned and protected by a distributor in the U.S. And Apple would be more interested in (the rest of Disney — movie studio, broadcaster ABC, theme parks).""They would have a lot more in common in terms of international branding, because fundamentally (Apple CEO) Tim Cook's a global player.""Disney's CEO Bob Iger sits on Apple's board. Unlike 21st Century Fox (FOXA) or Viacom (VIA), Disney is not family-controlled.Malone could himself have an angle, depending on what Disney does. In addition to his voting control of Liberty Media (LMCA), Liberty Global and other parts of the Liberty empire, Malone is the biggest shareholder in Discovery (DISCA) and owns stakes in Starz, QVC Group and Lions Gate Entertainment (LGF).Malone's Liberty Broadband owns about 18% of Charter Communications (CHTR). Charter is the No. 2 cable firm behind Comcast (CMCSA).""If somebody went after Disney, my guess is Apple would have to finally make a decision,"" Malone said. ""Somehow or another there's going to be some solution, because, you know, otherwise Disney should be trading at a substantially higher multiple. … They went long (sports-rights contract renewals) and at the moment that looks adverse.""RELATED:Walt Disney Reports Q4 Earnings Late: What To WatchAT&T, Time Warner Fall After Trump Victory; Is Merger In Doubt?

197,ABC,"Donald Trump's improving odds in the U.S. presidential race are causing jitters in the market, prompting investors to seek safety in gold.Bullion surged above $1,300 an ounce for the first time in almost a month after polls showed Trump gaining ground in next week's elections, spurring a sell-off in world equities and industrial metals and weakening the dollar. Trump led Hillary Clinton by one point in an ABC News/Washington Post tracking poll on Tuesday, while a Bloomberg survey of independents gave Clinton a slim advantage.Gold has rebounded from a four-month low in October as political and economic uncertainty outweighed expectations of a Federal Reserve interest rate increase. In advance of an announcement from Fed policymakers Wednesday afternoon, traders were pricing in a 67% chance that U.S. borrowing costs will go up next month. Higher borrowing costs curb the appeal of non-interest bearing gold.""There's nervousness in the market over a Trump win and that's driving gold higher,"" James Cordier, the founder of Optionsellers.com in Tampa, Fla., said in a telephone interview. ""What usually happens is the candidate with the most momentum at the end is the one who wins and Trump definitely has momentum right now. It's not what the market has been factoring in for the last 60 days.""Gold futures for December delivery gained 1.6% to settle at $1,308.20 an ounce at 1:41 p.m. on the Comex in New York, the highest close since Oct. 3. Silver futures advanced 1.5% on the Comex.Bullion's rise has been boosted by Friday's news that FBI Director James Comey had alerted members of Congress that agents had discovered a new batch of emails that could be part of an earlier investigation into Clinton's use of a private email system while she was secretary of state.Investors boosted their holdings of exchange traded funds backed by gold for a fourth straight session Tuesday to 2,042.9 metric tons, near the highest since 2013, data compiled by Bloomberg show.The Bloomberg Industrial Metals Subindex fell after seven straight sessions of gains that was the longest streak since March.""What we're seeing today is very much a safe haven trade with commodities getting hit hard,"" said Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Think Markets U.K. in London. ""We had good numbers from China yesterday but that's now been overshadowed by the risk of a Trump presidency, which hadn't been priced in.""A group of 370 economists including several Nobel Prize winners released a letter Tuesday saying Trump is a ""destructive choice for the country"" as he ""promotes magical thinking and conspiracy theories over sober assessments of feasible economic policy options."" Peter Navarro, Trump's economic advisor and a University of California at Irvine economist, said the letter was ""an embarrassment to the corporate offshoring wing of the economist profession"" and added that Trump's economic plan would boost growth.Zinc and aluminum had the biggest percentage decline on the London Metal Exchange, while copper, nickel, lead and tin also fell.

198,ABC,"Treasuries erased losses Tuesday, after benchmark yields reached the highest since May, as investors sought safer assets before the Federal Reserve's interest-rate decision on Wednesday and the U.S. elections next week.Benchmark yields fluctuated as U.S. equities declined. The market-based probability of a Fed rate hike by its December meeting fell below 70%, from as high as 75% earlier Tuesday. Government bonds tumbled last month as investors reconsidered how much longer central banks in advanced economies will maintain exceptional monetary policy amid signs global inflation is accelerating.With just one week until the U.S. presidential election, investors across markets are watching for surprises after they were caught off-guard by the U.K. vote to leave the European Union in June. An ABC News/Washington Post tracking poll showed Republican Donald Trump with 46% support vs. Democrat Hillary Clinton's 45%, leading to gains in havens such as Treasuries, gold and the Swiss franc.""The latest information has put the election into question — before that, it looked like Mrs. Clinton would win,"" said Charles Comiskey, head of Treasury trading in New York at Bank of Nova Scotia, one of the Fed's 23 primary dealers. While he still doubts Trump will win, ""there are a lot of question marks out there, and as it becomes more unclear as we go into next Tuesday, the market is going to be less liquid and it's going to be more volatile.""Treasury 10-year-note yields were little changed at 1.83% at 5 p.m. ET, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader data. They touched 1.88% earlier, the highest since May 31. The price of the 1.5% security due in August 2026 was 97-2/32.Treasuries had joined a slump in sovereign debt across the developed world as a report showing an unexpected pickup in Chinese manufacturing fueled optimism about the outlook for the global economy. In the U.S., the Institute for Supply Management's survey of U.S. factory production released Tuesday rose to 51.9 in October from 51.5 the previous month. The median forecast in a Bloomberg survey called for 51.7. A reading above 50 signals expansion.At the same time, inflation expectations are ramping up. The yield spread between 10-year U.S. Treasury bonds and similar-maturity Treasury Inflation Protected Securities, or TIPS, is 1.74 percentage points, the highest since July 2015 on a closing basis.U.S. 10-year-note yields climbed 23 basis points in October, the most since June 2015.""Market participants have reversed the very pessimistic view about the global economy,"" said Birgit Figge, a fixed-income strategist at DZ Bank AG in Frankfurt. Positive growth numbers from the U.S. and the U.K. last week along with rising inflation rates globally underpinned that view, she said.
"
199,ABC," When I was a child, there was a Saturday morning radio program called ""Let's Pretend."" It used words and sounds to encourage young children to paint pictures in their heads of make-believe worlds.So in that spirit, let's pretend that history will show Donald Trump as being elected president Nov. 8. That result is hard to imagine for anyone who has been watching closely since the first presidential debate, which was Sept. 26. Since then, nearly all indications have been that Hillary Clinton is certain to win.So, as a thought exercise before the results are in, let's try to imagine how we could move from that seemingly real world to the ""let's pretend"" world of President Donald Trump.One set of clues would come from the ABC News tracking poll. On Sept. 22, before the first debate, the poll showed Clinton leading Trump by a narrow 46% to 44% -- virtually the same as the RealClearPolitics average of recent polls at the time. By Oct. 22, after the three presidential debates and one vice presidential debate, that lead had widened to 50% to 38%.Since then, ABC News has shown Clinton's lead narrowing, to 48% to 44% Oct. 26. Clinton's 12-point advantage among likely voters had been cut down all the way to 2 points (47% to 45%) in the same tracking poll as of Saturday.Clinton's support level basically stayed the same (within the margin of error, anyway), while Trump's perceptibly grew, cutting Clinton's lead toward statistical insignificance. The ABC News numbers are an exaggerated version of what's happened to Clinton's average poll lead, which was cut from 7.1% Oct. 18 to 4.6% Oct. 28.ABC News pollster Gary Langer explains the changes as movement by Republican-leaning voters back toward Trump. Like those elected officials who recoiled from supporting him after release of the ""Access Hollywood"" tape, these voters are gravitating back to their preferred party's candidate.Focusing on a single poll's results is rightly criticized as cherry-picking by smart polling analysts. But in our ""let's pretend Trump won"" world, this particular poll sets out with particular clarity a trend that explains what happened.For one thing, it's a world where voters were given time to ponder, read and perhaps reread some of the Clinton campaign's emails revealed by WikiLeaks. They heard a Clinton spokesman try to discredit the leaks as Russian disinformation, possibly altered. But they may also have noticed the Clinton folks saying they had no time to check on their authenticity.Over the past week, the emails started getting coverage in mainstream media. The coverage has not been so vivid as the coverage of Trump's denunciations of Miss Universe 1996, but it has been coverage nonetheless. And the stories have been unsettling.Consider this message from Neera Tanden, head of the pro-Democratic Center for American Progress, to her predecessor John Podesta, chief of staff in the Bill Clinton White House and counselor in Barack Obama's (two smart people who have operated at high levels for a long time):  ""Do we actually know who told Hillary she could use a private email? And has that person been drawn and quartered?""It was in July 2015, a month after Trump entered the race. Tanden went on: ""Like whole thing is f---ing insane."" This suggests a certain tension with Clinton's omnipresent, sycophantic aides, Huma Abedin and Cheryl Mills.And it's unnerving to read Abedin in 2015, years after Clinton's concussion, emailing spokeswoman Jennifer Palmieri, ""She's going to stick to notes a little closer this am, still not perfect in her head."" There could be an untroubling explanation, but it doesn't suggest the kind of confidence you'd like people to have in a president.And then we have the revelations of Bill Clinton aide Doug Band on how much money he was raising from various sources for the Clintons personally, for the Clinton Foundation and for Hillary's Clinton's campaign. The Wall Street Journal's conservative columnist Kimberley Strassel is surely not the only one to call the Clintons ""grifters-in-chief.""Much embarrassing information about the Clintons has come out on Friday afternoons, so it's perhaps fitting that early last Friday afternoon, FBI Director James Comey announced that the FBI is reopening its investigation into Hillary Clinton's private email servers because of the discovery of additional emails during an investigation of Abedin's estranged husband, Anthony Weiner, in an unrelated case.Comey's July 5 statement that Clinton, though ""extremely careless,"" would not be criminally prosecuted hurt her in polls; this Oct. 28 announcement won't help. Whether it will send us hurtling into the ""let's pretend"" world of President Trump is unclear, but it may get us closer.Do I think we'll get there? No. But I'm less certain than I was last week.
"
200,ABC,"After FBI Director James Comey announced last Friday in a letter to Congress that he had revived his investigation into Hillary Clinton's email server, Democrats went on the attack. Since then, Americans have witnessed one of the great displays of political hypocrisy in modern history.Comey told lawmakers that ""emails that appear to be pertinent"" to the investigation of Clinton's personal email server were discovered while separately investigating former Congressman Anthony Weiner for reportedly exchanging sexually explicit photos with an underage girl.For those who don't know, Weiner happens to be the now-estranged husband of top Hillary Clinton aide and confidante Huma Abedin. The New York Times has reported that the FBI is combing through tens of thousands of emails found on private devices in the Weiner household.So why are the Democrats so angry? They don't like that Comey made the announcement just 11 days before the election. Fair enough.But they sang a different song in July when Comey closed down the investigation by prematurely declaring he would not bring charges in the case. It took away a major campaign issue for Clinton, clearing the way for her current lead over Donald Trump in most polls.The Democrats' anger now is more than just a bit hypocritical.To start with, as has been noted elsewhere, Hillary Clinton and n-presidential candidate Bill Clinton openly gloated back in 1992 when Iran-Contra prosecutor Lawrence Walsh indicted President Reagan's Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger.Walsh had become obsessed with the idea that then-President George H.W. Bush, while serving as Reagan's vice president, had known about the Iran-Contra arms deal. But he couldn't prove it.So he indicted  Weinberger no doubt to get him to finger Bush. He didn't. The indictment was eventually thrown out. But some believe the last-minute indictment cost Bush, who had been gaining in the polls, the election.So how did Bill and Hillary Clinton respond to Walsh's obvious political move?As PowerLine blogger Paul Mirengoff wrote: ""The Clintons seized on the new indictment, howling about a 'culture of corruption' that supposedly pervaded the administration. Bush's poll numbers declined and Bill Clinton won the election.""Hypocrisy? Nah.Now, as the scandal unravels,  we've learned that Hillary Clinton, her top aides, campaign officials and even Barack Obama lied about Clinton's illicit unsecured email server -- and may have taken part in a cover-up that included the destruction of evidence material to the federal investigation.Yet, here's what Hillary's campaign had to say about Comey back in July, when he announced that he would not recommend charges in the case.""Throughout his long career in law enforcement, the independence of FBI chief James Comey has rarely been questioned,"" the Clinton campaign said in a statement.""Comey is a well-respected Republican who served as George W. Bush's Deputy Attorney General. And when President Obama tapped him to serve as Director of the FBI, he was confirmed by a 93-1 vote.""Quite a difference from just last weekend, when Democratic operatives and Hillary's Big Media allies were calling Comey a ""threat to democracy"" and saying the election was ""rigged.""Also last July, Clinton Press Secretary Brian Fallon ripped into Republicans for daring to criticize Comey's decision not to press criminal charges against Hillary in the middle of an election.In an interview on CNN's ""Situation Room,"" Fallon said: ""I think it is a bad look for House Republicans to be second-guessing a prosecutor who is a registered Republican, No. 2 official at the Justice Department under George Bush and was even deputy council on the committee investigating the Clintons in the 1990s.""OK. But on Sunday, Fallon had changed his tune, calling Comey's move last week ""an undisputed violation of protocol.""But perhaps worst hypocrites of all were Attorney General Loretta Lynch and former Attorney General Eric Holder.ABC News, citing sources in the FBI, said that Lynch and other Department of Justice officials made it ""abundantly clear"" to Comey that they didn't want him to inform Congress that he had restarted his investigation, citing Justice protocols for not interfering with an election.But Lynch herself had ""interfered"" by pushing Comey to shut down his investigation last summer, before it was finished. In doing so, she inserted Justice directly into the middle of a presidential campaign.""No trial level attorney agreed, no agent working the case agreed, with the decision not to prosecute -- it was a top-down decision,"" an FBI source told Fox News, speaking on condition of anonymity. Clearly, Lynch wants to keep her job.Then there's Holder, who in a letter to the Washington Post, said Justice officials need to ""exercise heightened restraint near the time of a primary or general election.""This is laughable. He's actually right -- officials shouldn't interfere in elections.But under Holder the Justice Department became more politicized than it has ever been before, and used his department's enormous resources to push a leftist, class-warfare legal agenda -- and not during elections, but all the time.The point is, the Democrats' hypocrisy on this is never-ending. But they could have avoided all this by nominating someone less ethically-challenged than Hillary Clinton to be the next president.RELATED:Clinton Vs.

201,ABC,"The latest poll by USA Today and Suffolk University carried some eye-opening numbers about public disapproval of the media's aggressive attempts to run the country. It found that President Trump has a 47% approval rating and that 44% disapprove of him.That's not surprising. The media talk about his unpopularity all the time.But here's what they don't talk about: their own numbers. Only 37% of Americans have a favorable opinion of their job performance. A whopping 50% have an unfavorable opinion.Look at the numbers by party identification. Republican unfavorable opinion of the media? It's 78%. Only 10% have a favorable opinion. The Democrats are the opposite: Sixty-nine percent hold a favorable view, and 19% hold an unfavorable view.The pollsters offered other media questions, asking: ""President Trump has said journalists and the media are the enemy of the American people. Do you agree or disagree?"" That's an exaggerated question. Trump's actual tweet accused only ABC, CBS, CNN, NBC and the ""failing"" New York Times of being ""fake news"" and the ""enemy of the American people.""Many conservatives would steer clear of saying that journalists (liberal media and conservative media) are the enemy of the people and stick with chief White House strategist Steve Bannon's take that the media are the ""opposition party"" to Trump. But even so, 64% of Republicans in the poll agreed with Trump, and only 29% disagreed. Democrats sided with their liberal-media buddies, 88% disagreeing and 9% agreeing.These pollsters also asked the public which statement they agreed with, ""President Trump is right when he says the news media is unfair and biased against him"" or ""The news media is right when they say they are appropriately holding the White House accountable.""This result clearly demonstrates how divided the country is on the media under President Trump. Seventy-nine percent of Republicans agree with Trump, and 12% disagree. Democrats align with the media's sudden rush to ""accountability,"" 86% disagreeing and 7% in agreement.Both sides know the media are liberal.These results were submerged in USA Today. The front-page story on the overall poll was headlined ""Temperament and tweets tripping up president."" Reporter Susan Page began saying, ""President Trump gets high marks for leadership amid growing economic optimism, a new USA TODAY/Suffolk University Poll finds, but questions about his temperament and his tweets have cost him the political boost that a president traditionally gets from that good news.""Page also underlined that his 47% approval rating makes him ""the first president in modern times not to score majority approval at this early point in his tenure."" Fifty-nine percent would like Trump to turn down the tweeting, but even we've made that recommendation.The poll questions about the media finally make a brief appearance 23 paragraphs deep in the story but without the partisan breakdown. Page says: ""Meanwhile, Trump's attacks on reporters divide Americans: 42% say he is right when he says the news media are unfair and biased against him; 48% say the news media are right when they say they are appropriately holding the White House accountable. Are the news media 'the enemy of the American people' as the president has asserted? One-third of Americans, 34%, agree with him. Fifty-nine percent disagree.""The media's rating of 37% favorable and 50% unfavorable was left out.The newspaper industry is declining, as USA Today surely knows: Gannett split into two companies in 2015, one for broadcasting and one for the less profitable print business. It is interesting to watch elite newspapers in the Trump era doubling down on the liberal-activist course. There's a reason half the country no longer cares to read them.RELATED:IBD/TIPP Poll: Public Turned Off By Media's Relentlessly Negative Coverage Of TrumpTrump News & Tweets
"
202,ABC,"White House Deputy Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders exposed a notable bit of hypocrisy on ABC's ""This Week."" As the liberal media boiled over President Trump accusing former President Obama of wiretapping him, ABC host Martha Raddatz spat at Sanders about a conservative blog's reporting, saying: ""And Heat Street, they have two sources with links to the counterintelligence community. That's it. Anonymous sources.""Sanders shot back: ""I love how anonymous sources don't count when it's something that's positive in this administration and against the former one. You guys use anonymous sources every single day. ... But now that there are new anonymous sources, it doesn't matter.""Bravo! We couldn't have said it better ourselves. We don't see evidence yet that Obama ordered a wiretap on Trump or his aides, but we know this: Arrogant Old Media outlets think their sources are automatically impeccable, eternally credible and nonpartisan. Indeed, Raddatz bit down on that notion, replying to Sanders: ""Yes, we do. ... The Washington Post says this morning that 'senior U.S. officials with knowledge of the wide-ranging federal investigation into Russian interference into the election said there had been no wiretap.'""So why are we all supposed to genuflect to the Washington Post and The New York Times when they publish breathless stories taking on the White House relying on their favored ""senior U.S. officials""? After all, in August, the Times put a columnist on its front page declaring that the press needed to be ""oppositional"" and defeat Trump since he is a ""demagogue playing to the nation's worst racist and nationalistic tendencies"" who ""cozies up to anti-American dictators and ... would be dangerous with control of the United States nuclear codes.""The Post imagines itself as forever taking down the latest Nixons. One anti-Trump column was headlined ""In the angry face of Trumpism, media must speak truth to glower.""It's beyond ironic that the press that champions transparency also advocates relying on completely opaque sources on a daily basis. In political combat over allegations that the Obama administration holdovers in the intelligence community tried to take down Trump, wouldn't it help to know whether these liberal newspapers are relying on the holdovers and granting them all the benefits of anonymity? Isn't it possible that ""senior officials"" are offering talking points authored by Barack Obama himself? We'll never know. But we know we can't trust liberal newspapers given their political tilt.The Post openly knocked Trump for decrying anonymous sources even as his own officials demanded anonymity. ""Two of those officials spoke on the condition of anonymity — a practice President Trump has condemned,"" wrote Greg Miller and Adam Entous. But they don't note their own daily hypocrisy.These media outlets can even fail to disclose biographical facts when an official is named. The Post ran an Op-Ed (and a three-minute video, or negative ad) by Edward Price headlined ""I didn't think I'd ever leave the CIA. But because of Trump, I quit."" Price presented himself as an intelligence pro who worked for administrations of both parties, saying, ""To be clear, my decision had nothing to do with politics, and I would have been proud to again work under a Republican administration open to intelligence analysis.""But he was quickly exposed. He's registered to vote in Washington, D.C., as a Democrat, and last August, he gave a total of $5,000 in donations to the Clinton campaign and the Democratic Party. The Post added a line to Price's column online saying that the donations should have been disclosed.But we never know the donation records of ""senior U.S. officials"" placed anonymously on the front page, do we? The liberal media merely insists, ""Trust us.""RELATED:Trump News & Tweets

203,ABC,"A Republican-led FCC may give AT&T (T), Comcast (CMCSA), Verizon Communications (VZ) and other pay TV providers more tools to counter the threat from Google TV, Hulu and other nascent internet video services, says a Cowen & Co. analyst.Ajit Pai, named chairman of the Federal Communications Commission by President Trump in January, has signaled that he'll scale back net neutrality rules that bar internet service providers from throttling, blocking or prioritizing web traffic. Under the Obama administration, the FCC sought more authority under utility-type regulations.Paul Gallant, an analyst at Cowen & Co., says ""MVPDs"" a regulatory term for pay TV incumbents, could seek interconnection fees from YouTube TV or Hulu. Gallant warned that MVPDs like AT&T, Comcast and Verizon might tap other tools to counter the threat from internet video services, also called over-the-top, or OTT, services. Broadband caps on data usage are another possibility, Gallant says.Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL) on Tuesday announced YouTube TV, a $35 monthly paid subscription service. YouTube TV will offer access to all four major broadcast networks (CBS, ABC, NBC and Fox), and the cable channel offerings owned by their parent companies, such as sports channel ESPN.IBD'S TAKE: Quanta Services, Primerica and Nucor are on IBD's Leaderboard, which follows top stocks from their work on forming bases, through their breakouts, to their post-breakout action, up to the point where they start topping.Google aims to set itself apart with unlimited cloud storage for users to record content. Google will seek advertising revenue from YouTube TV, say analysts, who contend that $35 monthly fees might not be enough to make the service profitable.Hulu — a joint venture of Walt Disney (DIS), Fox-parent 21st Century Fox Entertainment (FOXA) and Comcast's NBCUniversal — is set to launch yet another live TV streaming service in the spring.""With the rising OTT threat and a newly Republican Washington, MVPDs may now have greater incentive and ability to employ tactics to manage the threat from OTT,"" Gallant said in a research report. ""Whether they take these steps — and whether it draws influential companies like Google, Facebook (FB), Walt Disney, Fox and others into the net neutrality debate — could be important for the longer-term balance of power within the internet ecosystem.""""We suspect the new FCC will be much more open to ISPs charging interconnection fees to high bandwidth services, mainly video providers,"" Gallant added.He says Google could respond by imposing a ""Cable Company X Tax"" on its subscribers.YouTube TV will compete with other internet video services, such as AT&T's DirecTV Now and Dish Network's (DISH) Sling.

205,ABC," Hillary Clinton's lead over Donald Trump has all but disappeared since the email scandal exploded on the scene Friday. She currently holds a 1-point lead — 45% to 44% — in a four-way race, according to the latest IBD/TIPP presidential tracking poll. Just two days ago, Clinton's lead over Trump had reached 4 points.Support for Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson continues to ebb as the election nears, with his support dropping to just 4%. Green Party candidate Jill Stein is at 2%.In a two-way matchup that excludes Johnson and Stein, Clinton's lead over Trump is now less than 2 points — 45.1% to 43.4%. (The unrounded numbers for the four-way race have Clinton at 44.7%, Trump at 43.7%, Johnson at 4.2%, and Stein at 2.3%.)The FBI's bombshell announcement on Friday is clearly driving a shift in voter sentiment. The IBD/TIPP poll, for example, has consistently shown that regardless of whom they intended to vote for, more than half thought Clinton would win the election. The latest results, however, show that just 49% now say that. And Trump's share of the independent vote jumped from 41% on Saturday to 48% today.The IBD/TIPP results comes as other national polls show the race tightening significantly. Clinton's lead in the ABC News/Washington Post tracking poll plunged from 12 points to 1 point in just five days.As of Monday morning, the Real Clear Politics average had Clinton ahead by 2.8 points in a four-way matchup, and 2.9 points in a two-way race.The latest IBD/TIPP poll included 993 likely voters, giving it a margin of error of +/- 3.2 percentage points. The results are based on a weighted sample of 390 Democrats, 319 Republicans and 268 Independent or ""other"" voters.The Clinton email scandal dominated the news all weekend, a sharp departure from the previous week, when the mainstream press focused almost exclusively on negative stories about Trump.Clinton and her campaign tried to deflect attention away from the emails with furious attacks on FBI director James Comey. Trump seized on the latest revelation to attack Clinton's honesty and character.On Sunday, the FBI obtained a warrant to search what are reportedly 650,000 emails found on Anthony Weiner's computer. Weiner is the estranged husband of top Clinton aide Huma Abedin and is under federal investigation for sexting a 15-year-old girl. How many of these emails are relevant to the Clinton case isn't known.Democrats are demanding that Comey release more information about its latest findings. But given the huge number of emails, it's unlikely the FBI will have anything definitive to say before Election Day.Ironically, Democrats were lauding Comey just a few months ago for how he handled the Clinton email investigation — after Comey announced that the probe was effectively over and declared that no further legal action should be taken.Sen. Harry Reid, for example, said shortly after Comey's July announcement that: ""It's over. It's time to move on. Republican attempts to continue their political hit job are just that: They're political.""Now Reid is accusing Comey of ""partisan actions"" and claiming that he ""may have broken the law.""What impact any of this will have on the election outcome, which is now just eight days away, is far from clear. One mitigating factor is the fact that more than 21 million people — close to a quarter of the electorate — had already voted by the time the latest scandal erupted, according to The New York Times.RELATED:Hillary Clinton Email Scandal ExplainedIBD/TIPP Presidential Election Tracking Poll: Latest ResultsIBD/TIPP Tracking Poll: The Most Accurate Presidential Poll In America

208,ABC,"Google's pricing and content lineup for YouTube TV — its planned live-TV subscription-streaming service — has Wall Street analysts abuzz over implications for the likes of AT&T, Time Warner, Comcast, and Hulu parents Walt Disney and Fox, as well as second-tier media companies excluded from new online packages.YouTube is already a big moneymaker for Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL). One big question is how much Google-owned YouTube's advertising revenue will grow as it adds live TV and original content for paid subscription services.Google on Tuesday took the wraps off YouTube TV, which will be ""available soon in the largest U.S. markets and will quickly expand to cover more cities across the country,"" the company said in a blog.YouTube TV will compete with other internet video services, such as AT&T's (T) DirecTV Now and Dish Network's (DISH) Sling.

209,ABC,"Less than two months into the presidency of Donald J. Trump, the welfare and domestic security of our nation and the very legitimacy of the executive branch is quite literally being deliberately and systematically targeted by a growing number of media outlets.If left unchecked and unchallenged, anarchy in a number of different and destructive forms, will surely grow and spread across the country.While ""anarchy"" is in-fact the ultimate stated goal of many on the far-left and the hope of many within the media, entertainment, and academia, they should fear the beast they have born, are feeding and now unleashing upon the land.For should it escape its chains and shackles, it will spare none in its cataclysmic rampage.If ever there was a time for ""adult leadership"" in the media to step forward and be held accountable, it is now.Based entirely upon the exponentially growing evidence, there can be no doubt that major media outlets such as CNN, ABC News, CBS News, NBC News (with its cable-partner MSNBC) the New York Times, the Washington Post, USA Today, the Los Angeles Times, the Associated Press and others have either openly declared ""War"" on the administration of President Trump, or are actively aiding and abetting those who have.Every single day, these liberal ""news"" outlets feed the beast of anarchy with highly inflammatory rhetoric comparing President Trump to ""Hitler,"" ""A Nazi,"" ""Satan,"" ""A Dictator,"" ""A Fascist,"" ""A Racist,"" and more.Through and blessed by their ""leadership,"" these media outlets feature articles and pieces calling for ""Resistance,"" ""Revolution,"" ""Taking to the streets,"" and ""targeted, confrontational protests.""When I Googled, ""Resist Trump,"" over 81,000,000 results came up in 0.54 seconds.  Of those, the New York Times, the Washington Post, NBC News, countless other liberal media outlets and a growing list of previous and newly created far-left sites oozed to the surface. NBC News went so far as to feature an App that will ""harness the energy created on the left to oppose President Donald Trump's actions and policies.""While real pressure cookers have become a weapon of choice for radicalized homegrown terrorists in the United States, these media organizations are creating rhetorical pressure cookers all over the U.S. that, if and when they explode or boil over, will have long-lasting toxic results.Knowing that undeniable truth, it is well-past the time for the ownership of these now blatantly biased and unprofessional media organizations to step to the forefront and exercise their civic and moral authority.If they choose not to do so out of fear of the far-left turning on them, because they approve of the tactics now being employed by those who run the ""news"" organizations they own, or because they are honestly ignorant of what is being orchestrated under their noses, then President Trump should call them out by name and invite them to the White House for a summit to be held in the Cabinet room. A summit which should be held live and televised for the world to witness.There, President Trump should read some of the most dangerous and inflammatory language aired on or reported in these ""news"" outlets and then ask the likes of Brian Roberts, the CEO of Comcast and owner of NBC, Robert Iger, the CEO of Disney and owner of ABC, Jeff Bezos, the CEO of Amazon and owner of the Washington Post, Carlos Slim Helu, the largest stockholder of the New York Times, Michael Bloomberg, the CEO of the news organization which bears his name, and Warren Buffett, who owns multiple newspapers across the country, if they are aware of these incendiary stories, approve of them, and have given any real thought to the long-term results of such stories?In one way or another, each of these CEOs and billionaires are very good people who have honestly done great good for their countries, the community, charity and their employees. Each is truly known to be intelligent, responsible and a highly effective leader.That said, there is no way they won't be able to recognize that the ""resistance"" to President Trump and the ""call to revolution"" being filtered through their media outlets is torching the very fabric of our democracy.These flames of anarchy may have been lit by far-left organizations, but are now being almost entirely fanned by ideologues in the mainstream media determined to destroy the administration of President Trump at any cost.The ownership of these outlets need to take charge and douse these flames before they morph into an uncontrollable wildfire.
"
210,ABC,"Media Bias: President George W. Bush has issued a full-throated defense of the media's role in modern society. He's being way too generous.""I consider the media to be indispensable to democracy. … Power can be very addictive,"" Bush said in remarks on NBC's ""Today.""""We need an independent media to hold people like me to account,"" he said.Yes, we agree wholeheartedly. But he seemed to imply today's media were fulfilling that role. They aren't. And there's no better example than Bush's own two terms in office.While we deeply admire the former president for not holding a grudge, the media spent much of Bush's eight years in office actively lying about what he was doing and what he was trying to do.It's one thing to disagree with Bush on Iraq; even some conservative media outlets loudly criticized Bush's strategy, down to the very presence of U.S. troops in Iraq.But the media consistently mischaracterized Bush's actions, and served as a willing mouthpiece for the ""Bush lied, people died"" mantra of the left that served to undermine the effort to end the Iraq War.Likewise, the media outright lied about what happened during Hurricane Katrina, painting a picture of an out-of-touch, racist chief executive who didn't really care about the deaths of African Americans from the ravaging floodwaters.They virtually ignored the massive rescue and aid effort that followed, while making up stories of savagery on the ground and rape and murder in the temporary storm shelter set up in Houston's Astrodome. Anything to make Bush look bad.Then in 2008, during the election campaign, came the ""Bush did it"" finger pointing about the financial crisis.The Bush administration was on record as early as 2001 warning about the excesses of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, but Democrats in Congress would have none of it, lambasting Bush and other Republicans as heartless tools of Wall Street.The truth is, the financial crisis had been baked in the cake during the Clinton years. Rules pushed by Democrats in the 1990s requiring that banks make mortgage loans to unqualified minority borrowers virtually ensured that a crisis would happen.Instead, the liberal media blamed Wall Street ""greed,"" along with Bush and the Republican Party. And instead of meaningful bank reform, Democrats shoved Dodd-Frank down America's collective throat, leading to a weaker banking industry, the expansion of ""too-big-to-fail"", and eight years of substandard economic and jobs growth.Even today, the media persist in misreporting the financial crisis.What about the brave, independent media during the Obama years? Oh, right. It didn't exist. It was the most pathetic display of overt media bias in modern history.The Obama administration had scandal after scandal — Operation Fast and Furious, the IRS going after conservative groups, wire tapping of media, outright lies about what transpired at Benghazi, the Department of Justice seizing media emails and phone records, the National Security Agency's apparent illegal spying on Americans, the list goes on.But the ""independent"" media stayed mum. Instead, they behaved more like bought-and-paid-for courtiers or sycophantic lickspittles, despite Obama's open contempt for them.At times, the media didn't even pretend. Two classic Newsweek covers from the 2012 election battle between Obama and Mitt Romney tell the tale:""Why Are Obama's Critics So Dumb?"" snarked one cover.""Romney: The Wimp Factor"" said another. Fair and balanced!The media showed no curiosity about Obama's lifetime of close friendships with such questionable characters as communist Frank Marshall Davis, radical-left America-hating Pastor Jeremiah Wright and terrorists Bill Ayers and Bernadine Dohrn.Now along comes Donald Trump, a man the media truly hate. Everything about Trump is fair game, business, taxes, friendships, family, everything.Simply put, the American media have gone completely off the rails when it comes to President Trump. Not surprising, since surveys of the media over the years show they are far left of the population they say they serve.Indeed, they no longer even pretend to be unbiased. After a year in which media representatives were repeatedly found to be colluding with Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton, the media couldn't with a straight face claim to be ""objective"" or ""fair"" in any real meaning of those words.As an example, on just one Thursday in mid-October, The Hill reported, ABC, NBC and CBS ran 23 negative stories on Trump, just 1 on Hillary Clinton.Print was no better. The New York Times, the so-called paper of record, ran 11 negative stories on Trump in one day, including one on the sports page. There were none on Hillary, despite an ongoing spate of alarming revelations from WikiLeaks.Fast forward to last Friday. Media outlets were outraged when Trump's Press Secretary Sean Spicer press representatives froze some out of a Q&A session.That was topped off by Trump speaking at CPAC, the annual conservative gathering:""I called the fake news the enemy of the people,"" Trump said. ""They are the enemy of the people, because they have no sources. They just make them up when there are none.""Trump has dared to stand up to the media — his most unforgivable sin.The media need to take a long look in the mirror and address their extreme ideological bias. If not, the media have no one to blame but themselves for being treated as what they are — political partisans with an ideological agenda.RELATED:After Ignoring Scandals For 8 Years Under Obama, The Media Are Now Making Them Up Under TrumpThe Real 'Fake News' Comes From The Mainstream MediaTrump Owes The Media Nothing — Here's Why
"
211,ABC,"It was riveting. In his first solo news conference, President Donald Trump spent much of the hour berating the media for what Trump called anti-Republican bias and its relentlessly negative ""tone.""It's about time. The liberal media has long been sticking it to Republicans.In October 1992, during the presidential race between President George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton, Investor's Business Daily found that over 90% of the economic news in newspapers was negative. At the time, the economy was well into a recovery, on its 19th consecutive month of growth. Yet much of the business news was sour.The next month, November 1992, Bill Clinton won. Investor's Business Daily found that suddenly only 14% of the newspapers' economic news was negative, a dramatic decline in negativity and upswing in positive economic news.ABC News' Peter Jennings, NBC's Tom Brokaw and CBS' Dan Rather anchored the nightly news for the then-""Big Three"" networks on the first day in office of both Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush. On Clinton's first day in office, he reversed a President Ronald Reagan policy forbidding the use of federal money for abortions. President Bush reversed Bill Clinton's reversal.So how did networks cover each president's first day on their evening news broadcasts?Peter Jennings, ABC News, 1993: ""President Clinton kept a promise (emphasis added) today on the 20th anniversary of the Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion. Mr. Clinton signed presidential memoranda rolling back many of the restrictions imposed by his predecessors.""Peter Jennings and Terry Moran, ABC News, 2001: ""President Bush begins by taking a tough line on abortion,"" said Jennings in a teaser for the story. Moran then reported: ""One of the president's first actions was designed to appeal to anti-abortion conservatives (emphasis added). The president signed an order reinstating a Reagan-era policy that prohibited federal funding of family planning groups that provided abortion counseling services overseas.""Tom Brokaw, ""NBC Nightly News,"" 1993: ""Today, President Clinton kept a campaign promise (emphasis added), and it came on the 20th anniversary of Roe v. Wade legalizing abortion.""Tom Brokaw, ""NBC Nightly News,"" 2001: ""We'll begin with the new president's very active day, which started on a controversial note  (emphasis added).""Dan Rather, CBS News, 1993: ""Today, with the stroke of a pen, President Clinton delivered on his campaign promise (emphasis added) to cancel several anti-abortion regulations of the Reagan-Bush years.""Dan Rather, CBS News, 2001: ""This was President Bush's first day at the office, and he did something to quickly please the right flank (emphasis added) in his party: He reinstituted an anti-abortion policy.""Here's another example.The media routinely refers to the recession President Obama inherited as the ""Great Recession."" But during the recession President Reagan dealt with, unemployment hit 10.8%, versus Obama's peak of 10.0%. During Reagan's presidency, prime interest rates hit 20.5%, and inflation, which was modest under Obama, averaged 13.5% under Reagan in the early '80s.Reagan lowered taxes, continued deregulation and slowed down the rate of domestic spending. Obama, of course, did the opposite.The left thinks that, as with Obama, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt's active intervention in the economy ""rescued"" it from the Great Depression. Many economists strongly disagree. William H. Peterson of the Heritage Foundation says, ""The Great Depression sprang from three fatal mistakes — the Fed's jacking up of money-supply growth in the 1920s, which fueled the stock market boom; the Smoot-Hawley Tariff of 1930, hiking import duties to their highest level in U.S. history and inviting deadly foreign retaliation against U.S. exports; and the Revenue Act of 1932, hiking the top income-tax rate from 24% to 63%.""In ""Out of Work,"" a book about unemployment in 20th century America, economists Richard Vedder and Lowell Gallaway say, ""The common interpretation is that this Depression, this misery, this inequality, reflected rigidities and imperfections in the markets for goods and resources. Yet the evidence we have presented is more consistent with a far different story. The market, particularly the critical market for labor, was prevented from operating in a normal fashion by the interventions of government. These intrusions turned a severe shock that started a recession into a major depression. Government failure, not market failure, was the problem.""Consider what Roosevelt's secretary of treasury, Henry Morgenthau Jr., wrote in his diary: ""We have tried spending money. We are spending more than we have ever spent before and it does not work. ... I want to see this country prosperous. I want to see people get a job. I want to see people get enough to eat. We have never made good on our promises. ... I say after eight years of this Administration we have just as much unemployment as when we started and an enormous debt to boot!"" Yet high school text books teach us that government spending, what the left today calls government ""investments,"" pulled the economy for the abyss.To reverse media bias, President Trump has his work cut out for him. But his news conference was a good start.RELATED:Defeated Media Elite Alienate Many With Anti-Trump CoveragePresident Trump Vs. The Media 'Opposition Party'Trump News & Tweets

212,ABC,"Internet television network Netflix (NFLX) on Monday undercut its 50-day moving average, a key technical support level, before barely finishing above it as investors mulled a host of competitive concerns.Netflix shares seesawed in intraday trading, rising as much as 1.5%, then falling by 1.4%. When the closing bell struck, Netflix had inched up 0.1% to 166.76 on the stock market today, just above the 50-day.Netflix stock hit an all-time high of 191.50 on July 21, four days after posting better-than-expected second-quarter results. But its stock was rocked by news two weeks ago that Walt Disney (DIS) plans to pull Disney and Pixar studio movies from Netflix in about two years and start its own subscription video-on-demand service in 2019.Disney's moves highlight the shift traditional media companies are making to capture the growing online video audience. Disney's actions follow similar efforts by CBS (CBS) and Time Warner (TWX). Other major players investing in online video content include Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL) and even Facebook (FB).""Disney's recent announcement to build a Disney-branded direct-to-consumer OTT (over-the-top internet TV) product has proven to be a Rorschach test for the investment community,"" MoffettNathanson analysts said in a report Monday. ""Those bearish on media and bullish on Netflix see this idea as a 'Hail Mary,' as in too little, too late. Others, ourselves included, see the power of the Disney brand, the millions and millions of Disney consumer touchpoints and the proprietary Pixar and Disney content as reasons for success.""IBD'S TAKE: Netflix is one of four closely watched internet giants in the FANG group, with the others being Facebook, Amazon.com and Google-parent Alphabet. For the latest news on the group, visit IBD's page on FANG stocks.The loss of Disney content won't derail Netflix's subscriber growth and business plans, but if more of the leading content owners follow suit, it could spell trouble for Netflix, MoffettNathanson said.Netflix anticipated the shift by the major media companies and has ramped up its original content production in recent years. It recently bought comic-book content creator Millarworld and signed a deal with high-profile TV series producer Shonda Rhimes, luring her away from Disney's ABC Television Network.Bernstein analyst Todd Juenger thinks investors have overreacted to Disney's plans.""Netflix has two years to prepare for the loss of two to three movies per year in the U.S.,"" Juenger said in a report Wednesday. ""We don't think the existence of these movies on the Netflix service is a make-or-break decision for a meaningful number of U.S. subscribers (this doesn't affect international at all, anyway) as they contemplate whether to sign up and remain Netflix subscribers.""Juenger also doesn't believe that Disney's actions are the start of a big trend by content producers.RELATED:Streaming Content May Become King, But Who Will Wear The Crown?Apple, Studios May Upend The Way We Watch Movies: ReportCash-Rich Apple Ramps Up Original Content Spend Vs.

213,ABC,"Even amid continued subscription declines, Walt Disney (DIS) CEO Bob Iger continued to sound bullish on ESPN during the company's earnings call late Tuesday, and a Wall Street Journal report may point to one reason why.Iger said that his confidence stemmed from several factors, including deals with new platforms, which have spurred ""nice gains"" in subscriptions.In addition to a deal with Hulu, he noted a deal with ""another entity that has not been announced, and we're in discussions with others.""That yet-to-be-announced deal is reportedly with Google's YouTube, owned by Alphabet (GOOGL).The Wall Street Journal, which first noted last week that ESPN videos had begun to reappear on the site, said the deal is for a bundle that includes ESPN, ABC and other Disney channels, citing sources. The networks will be bundled into a service that is expected to debut later in 2017.Shares of Disney ended the trading day unchanged at 109 on the stock market today, still in buy range after an early-January breakout. Alphabet edged up less than 0.1% to 829.88.YouTube has reportedly been working on its own online TV service for a while now. It has so far signed up CBS (CBS) and has been in talks with other major networks, including Comcast's (CMCSA) NBCUniversal, according to earlier Journal reports.In the call, Iger said he liked the mobile-first or mobile-friendly nature of new multichannel entrants, in addition to the lower pricing.""And that obviously, we think, gives us a chance to both attract consumers that may not sign up for multichannel service or hold consumers into multichannel subscriptions,"" he said.

216,ABC,"Stocks were mixed Friday morning as investors digested the Commerce Department's positive read on third-quarter GDP growth and several big earnings reportsDow industrials remained slightly higher while the S&P 500 fell fractionally and the Nasdaq lost 0.1%.Big-boned earnings reports powered early action on the stock market today. One exception was Baker Hughes (BHI). The oilfield equipment and services heavyweight spiked 5.5% after news reports that General Electric (GE) was discussing a possible takeover of the Houston company. GE clarified that it was only discussing potential partnerships, not a takeover. GE shares ticked up more than 1%.Amazon.com (AMZN) dropped more than 4% after a 206% surge in third-quarter earnings stopped well short of views for a 359% gain.

217,ABC,"The roll out of women accusers against Donald Trump continues.  Last Thursday,  Accuser No. 10 Karena Virginia charged  that Trump took hold of her right arm in a crowd at the 1998 U.S. Open.  When he did, his hand also made contact with the side of her breast.Attorney Gloria Allred, a two-time Hillary Clinton convention delegate and Democratic Party grenade thrower, flanked Virginia as she told her story to reporters.Then Saturday, Allred staged another press conference to unveil accuser No. 11, Jessica Drake, an adult film performer who also operates a website ""Guide to Wicked Sex.""  Drake claims she met Trump ten years ago at a golf outing and he invited her to his hotel room. When she got there, he hugged her tightly and kissed her on the lips.Sexual assault is a serious issue. But these accusations raise another grave issue: Is it fair for the media to rush to publicize damaging claims against Trump -- or anyone else -- without  witnesses or back up evidence.Consider accuser No. 1: Jessica Leeds. She told the New York Times that almost forty years ago, Donald Trump sexually groped her on a flight to New York, while a man across the aisle looked on, his eyes ""bugging out of his head.""Less than 48 hours after interviewing Leeds, and despite Trump's protests that the charge was false, the Times ran the allegation on the front page.  The reporters couldn't confirm the date or even the year the incident supposedly occurred, or on what flight. They didn't find even one witness. No facts.Two days after the Times article, Anthony Gilberthorpe came forward, saying  he was the man across the aisle: ""I was there,"" and what Leeds is claiming is ""wrong, wrong, wrong."" Gilberthorpe said Leeds was all over the mogul, and when Trump got up to the bathroom, she confessed she wanted to marry him.  Gilberthorpe also had no facts to prove his statements.So, who's telling the truth? Impossible to say.  That isn't stopping the media from repeating the Times' account, despite all the holes.And despite the controversy over an earlier Trump hit piece by the same reporters.  They argued that Trump treated women in his Miss Universe contests like objects, inspecting them up and down on stage.  Imagine that at a beauty contest.Two women quoted in that article -- Miss California USA Carrie Prejean and Rowanne Brewer Lane -- said  the Times reporters had twisted their words.Is accuser No. 11 the last? Probably not. Natasha Rickley, a former Miss Nebraska Teen, says ABC News is trying to reach every beauty contestant who ever had contact with Trump.Allred appears heavily involved. Democrats have called on her to smear  Republican  candidates in the past,  including presidential hopeful  Herman Cain and California gubernatorial candidate  Meg Whitman.On October 15, Allred led accuser Summer Zervos into a press conference like a pony on a rope to accuse Trump of forceful kissing and touching.These accusations are rushed into print without facts. The Washington Post blazoned Kristin Anderson's accusation that Trump put his hand up her mini skirt at a night club, even though she couldn't remember  what year it happened or the friends with her that night. Pretty thin.What about ""innocent until proven guilty.""  The media often forget that, like  when  a student at the University of Virginia concocted a tale of gang rape. The sensationalist coverage smeared innocent people.  But it didn't influence a presidential election.A Reuters poll released Friday shows 63% of Americans now believe Trump committed sexual assault.Maybe he did, and maybe not. Trump and the public deserve fair, balanced coverage of the accusations until the facts are known. Sadly, it's not happening. Times media reporter Jim Rutenberg suggests that ""normal standards"" of journalistic fairness do not apply because in the media's view, Trump is a  ""demagogue"" who must be brought down.  Voters beware.

218,ABC,"With the presidential election set to enter its final two weeks, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump find themselves in a near dead heat at 41% each in a four-way race, the latest IBD/TIPP presidential tracking poll shows.Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson edged up to 8% from 7%, while the Green Party's Jill Stein rebounded to 4% from 3%.Without rounding, Trump stands at 41.1%, 0.1 percentage point behind Clinton's 41.2%. Johnson stands at 7.7%, unrounded, while Stein is at 3.7%.In a two-way faceoff without the other two candidates excluded, Trump and Clinton are knotted at 42%. On the unrounded data, Trump slightly edges Clinton, 42.3% to 42%.The poll of 815 likely voters has a margin of error of plus-or-minus 3.6 percentage points. It had a weighted response of 291 Democrats, 235 Republicans and 271 people who called themselves either ""independents"" or ""other.""The latest IBD/TIPP daily tracking poll finds Clinton taking 1-point lead as Trump admits he's behindUnlike many other polls, the IBD/TIPP Poll continues to show a tightening race, as the candidates and their surrogates slug it out in public in the waning days until the Nov. 8 polling date.In the latest Real Clear Politics average of recent polls, Clinton stands at 45.0% to Trump's 39.4%, a 5.6% advantage in the four-way contest. In a head-to-head matchup, Clinton takes 47.9% to Trump's 42.0%, a 5.9% difference.Among major polls, only Rasmussen, L.A. Times/USC, Reuters/Ipsos and IBD/TIPP Poll consistently show it close. Most other polls show a gap of 4 points or more, with some as high as 12 points in recent polling.With the race tightening and time running out, Trump on Saturday delivered a symbolic speech at Gettysburg, where he unveiled a sweeping, mostly conservative agenda for his first 100 days — one of the few attempts by the candidate to put forward an actual plan for governing.Promising to ""drain the swamp"" in the nation's capital and ""replace it with a new government by and for the people,"" Trump vowed to initiate a series of reforms including congressional term limits, a hiring freeze on federal workers (excepting military, safety and health workers) and a major regulatory change: ""For every new federal regulation, two existing regulations must be eliminated.""""It's a contract between Donald J. Trump and the American voter, and it begins with bringing honesty, accountability and change to Washington, D.C.,"" Trump said during his Gettysburg speech.Meanwhile, he also vowed to ""totally renegotiate Nafta,"" and to take the U.S. out of the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership, which hasn't yet been approved by Senate.Also in the first 100 days, he promised, among other things, to ""label China a currency manipulator"" as well as end ""billions in payments"" to U.N. climate change programs.He pledged to begin looking for someone to replace the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia. This follows the third and final debate, in which Trump promised to fill Scalia's spot — and any others that open up — with conservative jurists who ""will interpret the Constitution the way the founders wanted it interpreted, and I believe that's very, very important.""With President Obama now actively on the hustings campaigning for Hillary Clinton, Trump threw a dart his way, saying he would ""cancel every unconstitutional executive action, memorandum and order issued by President Obama.""That was only the beginning: Trump said he'll unveil, in lightening succession, a ""Middle Class Tax Relief and Simplification Act,"" an ""American Infrastructure Act,"" a ""Restoring Community Safety Act,"" an ""End the Offshoring Act,"" and, for good measure, a ""Repeal and Replace ObamaCare Act.""And, finally, he promised to deport criminal illegal immigrants such as ""drug dealers, gang heads, killers,"" while temporarily halting immigration from areas where terrorism is common. And, he says, he'll build the wall through the ""End Illegal Immigration Act."".Hillary Clinton has already laid out an extensive agenda of tax hikes, higher government spending and increased regulation as a way to break the U.S. out of its growth slump. Convinced by the plethora of polls showing her with a big and perhaps insurmountable lead, she seems to be coasting to the finish line.But even her closest advisors warn she has a problem connecting with the voters, perhaps in part due to ongoing revelations of unethical and possibly illegal behavior with her home-brew email server, her failures during her tenure as secretary of state, and concerns over the improperly cozy ties between the Clinton Foundation and the State Department.""Honest and trustworthy has become our most talked about metric because it's not great,"" Clinton's communications director Jennifer Palmieri told ABC/News.She appeared over the weekend at rallies in heavily Democratic parts of Pennsylvania, another sign that Clinton thinks the race has been won. She again lambasted Trump for saying he might not respect the outcome of the election if it appears fraudulent.""Make no mistake about this, my friends: he is threatening our democracy,"" she said.A recent Washington Post/ABC News poll shows that just 36% of voters call Clinton honest and trustworthy, even though 60% said they believe she is qualified to be president.Still, Hillary continues to have strong support from union members (54% for Clinton, 25% for Trump), single women (50% to 30%) and Blacks and Hispanics (68% to 13%).Meanwhile, some of Trump's strongest support comes from white men (56% for Trump, 27% for Hillary), rural dwellers (57% to 23%), independents (41% to 32%), and, perhaps surprisingly, among non-investors (46% to 33%).RELATED:Once Again, Critics Of The IBD/TIPP Poll Get Their Facts WrongTrump's Contract With Voters — Is It Too Late To Make A Difference?What Explains The Wide Range Of Poll Results Between IBD/TIPP And Others?Could Trump Pull A Brexit-Style Surprise In November?IBD/TIPP Presidential Election Tracking Poll: Latest ResultsIBD/TIPP Tracking Poll: The Most Accurate Presidential Poll In America

219,ABC,"Netflix's (NFLX) whopping $6 billion content budget for 2017 may resemble a young tech company's strategy for growth before profit.But its Hollywood spending spree — like a reported $120 million budget for ""The Get Down"" and a $40 million price tag for two Chris Rock specials — has trained a glaring soundstage Klieg light on what could be Netflix's emerging identity crisis.""This is just idiotic,"" Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter told Investor's Business Daily. ""What's the replay-ability of Chris Rock? I mean, he's funny, but come on. I think Netflix's spending is out of control. I think they're doing really dumb things, like a four-picture deal with Adam Sandler.""Netflix's stock is nearing its record high, but concerns over costs — and plans for 1,000 hours of original content next fiscal year — are prompting a new question: Should investors still view the company as a tech disrupter shaking up Big Media, or has its seduction by Hollywood left it unable to still act like a nimble tech startup?The distinction between being considered a tech vs. a media stock isn't just a philosophical one. As the media and tech sectors converge, it may affect any takeover price for Netflix, and there's been chatter it could become a target for Walt Disney (DIS). While the pairing has been seen as unlikely, reports that AT&T (T) and Time Warner (TWX) are near a megamerger lifted shares of Netflix (3.3%), 21st Century Fox (FOXA) (2.2%), CBS (CBS) (2.1%) and Viacom (VIAB) (2.7%) as well as Time Warner's (7.8%) on the stock market today.Categorizing Netflix as a media stock vs. a tech stock would also prompt Wall Street to view its financials with a different lens.Tech hotshots can shell out big bucks, and investors hardly blink. Facebook's (FB) $2 billion acquisition of Oculus in 2014 knocked down shares for a bit, but even then analysts appeared to go easy on the Mark Zuckerberg-helmed Silicon Valley darling as they looked far into the future.Netflix has gotten ""a lot of free passes"" over the last few years, said Tim Nollen, a Macquarie media analyst.""I think internet companies are given a lot of credit for just growing viewership figures, or in this case subscriber numbers, without much regards to the cost,"" he said, adding that ""the cost is viewed as the driver of those subscriber figures, and 'We'll worry about earnings later on,' seems to be the attitude.""Not so with media companies, whose near-term and longer-term earnings figures get more scrutiny.""Costs are a major, major element here,"" said Nollen.Netflix's budget is already bigger than comparable ones at most entertainment conglomerates. The streaming company is expected to spend $4.93 billion on content this year, outdoing nonsports cable and broadcast programming expenses at Time Warner ($4.89 billion), Disney ($4.5 billion) and Viacom ($3.7 billion), according to MoffettNathanson's estimates.Indeed, Netflix's free-spending ways have caused friction with the incumbent companies by outbidding them for coveted new shows and films or often pushing up the price tags on deals they do secure.But rather than a tech company like Apple (AAPL), whose iTunes store helped transform the music industry, Silicon Valley-based Netflix has pointed to a media superstar when signaling its aspirations: Content Chief Ted Sarandos memorably told GQ three years ago that the company's goal was to ""become HBO faster than HBO can become us.""Wedbush's Pachter points out that HBO owns its originals, unlike Netflix, which could only count summer hit ""Stranger Things"" as a completely in-house effort during its conference call. And to label Netflix a media company like Disney, he said, would be ""unflattering to Disney.""But it was licensed shows like ""Orange Is The New Black"" and ""House of Cards"" that put Netflix on Hollywood's map, figuratively and literally. The company is leasing the 14-story, 323,000-square-foot Icon tower and several stages at Sunset Bronson Studios in Los Angeles.Now, like an actor-turned-director, Netflix appears to be yearning for more creative control, and is increasing investments in original programming.The step up from licensing other people's content to creating its own is a ""natural progression"" from its early days of being a content-licensing pure-play, said BTIG Research analyst Rich Greenfield.In his view, however, Netflix ""doesn't want just to be HBO; it wants to be HBO, FX, Nickelodeon, ABC, CBS."" (Time Warner owns HBO, 21st Century Fox owns FX, Viacom owns Nickelodeon and Disney owns ABC).But that evolution arguably nudges Netflix into the more traditional territory of being a hit-driven business, which is a risky business.""That helps when it's good,"" said Nollen. ""But all studios go through winning and losing streaks. And they could have high expectations for a show that maybe doesn't work so well and doesn't attract subscribers, and they're definitely exposing themselves to more of that.""In the near term, Netflix's growth-first strategy could be tested as Amazon (AMZN), the original tech disrupter that keeps disrupting new sectors, ramps up its video offerings and threatens to do to Netflix what it has done to Big Media.Like Netflix, Amazon spends aggressively to grow in new markets. Unlike Netflix, Amazon has pockets that are even deeper than those of the media conglomerates that dominate Hollywood. Netflix's projected 2016 revenue is $8.8 billion, while Amazon's is $136.8 billion.And Amazon CFO Brian Olsavsky said in July that the company is ""nearly doubling"" its content spend in the second half of 2016 vs. the latter half of last year. (It spent $1.3 billion on content in 2014.)Netflix's current share price ""fails to address the potential for meaningful competition from Amazon"" and its paid Amazon Prime Video-only offering, even if Netflix currently has the stronger brand as a subscription video-on-demand service, said Pachter in a recent note.""(W)e are confident that with its new stand-alone service, Amazon declared war on Netflix,"" he wrote.Meanwhile, investors largely overlooked Netflix's ""unacceptably high"" negative $1.5 billion in projected 2016 free cash flow, he added.For now, Netflix's stock looks to continue taking investors on a wild ride, especially around earnings season. The last three quarterly reports sent the stock soaring 19%, diving 13% and plunging 13% the following day.""I think we can all see that it's time for me to apologize for the volatility again,"" said Netflix CEO Reed Hastings in response to an analyst question during the earnings call. ""This time it's in a good direction. But I think more and more investors are able to look at the multiyear picture and they see the patterns emerging, and so then it will be less and less about our guidance.""That doesn't bother BTIG's Greenfield: ""The reality is, as the world shifts to (internet protocol) television, the legacy TV industry isn't equipped to meet the changing landscape and Netflix is taking advantage of that.""RELATED: Is Netflix Back On The Road To Prosperity, Or A Trail Of Tears?

220,ABC,"Revenue: Hillary Clinton says she can pay for her ambitious spending program by only taxing those making more than $250,000. What she isn't saying is that every time Washington raises taxes on the ""rich,"" the middle class take a hit, too.Anyone who thinks Hillary will live up to her promise should look at what her husband was saying 24 years ago. Like Hillary today, Bill said he'd ""make the rich pay their fair share,"" meaning those making more than $200,000 a year. Middle class families would get a tax cut.Just weeks after setting foot in the White House, Bill abandoned that pledge. In a Feb. 15, 1992, Oval Office address, Clinton said: ""We just have to face the fact that to make the changes our country needs, more Americans must contribute today so that all Americans can do better tomorrow.""President Obama made the same promise in 2008. ""I can make a firm pledge,"" he said shortly before the election, ""under my plan, no family making less than $250,000 a year will see any form of tax increase. Not your income tax, not your payroll tax, not your capital gains taxes, not any of your taxes.""Obama's pledge turned out to be just as reliable as Bill's.For daily updates on the presidential race, including the latest tracking poll information and demographic breakdowns of results, follow the IBD/TIPP Presidential Tracking Poll.Within three months Obama signed a law that hiked the notoriously regressive tobacco tax by 150%, prompting the AP to declare ""Obama tax pledge up in smoke.""Less than a year later, he signed ObamaCare into law, which hit the middle class with several new taxes — including the individual mandate tax, limits on various medical tax deductions, a fee on every health plan, and others.What's more, Hillary's pledge isn't a pledge at all, just a ""goal.""When ABC News' George Stephanopoulos asked her last December, ""Is that a rock-solid promise?"" Clinton said, ""Well, it certainly is my goal."" Given her massive spending plans, that's a goal she'll quickly abandon.The broader history of tax hikes makes it clear, too, that whenever politicians talk up tax hikes on the rich, the middle class get burned.The original income tax passed in 1913 imposed a 1% tax on incomes below $463,000 (in inflation-adjusted terms), according to the Tax Foundation. The top rate, which applied to incomes over $11 million, was 7%.Within five years, the top rate for these multimillionaires was 77%. But families making as little as $60,000 (in today's dollars) faced a 6% income tax.By 1944, the rich were really getting soaked, with income above $2.6 million facing a 94% tax rate. But the tax burden on the middle class leapt upward as well, with families making as little as $26,000 paying 23%.History shows that the opposite is also true. When taxes get cut for the rich, the middle class sees its taxes go down as well. That's what happened under the JFK, Reagan and Bush tax cuts, and would happen under a Trump tax cut.So next time Hillary says she'll spare the middle class, consider the fact that ""going where the money is"" by definition means going after the middle class families. Because that's where most of the money actually is.RELATED:Hillary Clinton's Economic Plan: Tax-And-Spend With A VengeanceIf You Liked Obamanomics, You'll Love HillarynomicsHillary Clinton Vs.

221,ABC,"In the election cycle dominated by Donald Trump, it should not be much of a shock that the first October Surprise came from ""Access Hollywood."" In a 2005 outtake, Trump told then-""Access"" co-host Billy Bush how he could rudely grab women's genitals and get away with it because ""when you're a star, they let you do it. You can do anything.""They say it was a recent discovery. No media October Surprise there. No, siree.Smelling Trump's blood in the water, the Clinton-enabling press sprung into action. None of them seemed to reflect for 5 seconds about how Trump could be describing Bill Clinton's modus operandi. Trump talked as Clinton did. The press' moral outrage was as phony as Hillary Clinton's. ""This is horrific,"" Clinton shamelessly tweeted. ""We cannot allow this man to become president.""The women who were actually harassed by Bill Clinton were never offered any support from Hillary Clinton, or her feminist army in the press. In February of 1994, Paula Jones held a press conference to accuse Bill Clinton of exposing himself and requesting oral sex in a hotel room in Little Rock, Arkansas. Other than 16 seconds on ABC, the media decided that wasn't news ... until Jones filed a lawsuit and the Clintons hired a lawyer three months later.But the Jones case vanished from the press and played no significant role in the 1996 presidential campaign. There were 11 network stories during the entire election year. Half of them were perfunctory notices of legal claims, and the other half focused on the Republican National Committee making an ad mocking Bill Clinton for claiming that he couldn't be sued because he was on ""active duty"" as commander-in-chief. Once Clinton was safely re-elected, a few establishment media outlets decided that maybe there was something to this Jones thing.The lawsuit eventually led to the deposition of former Clinton intern Monica Lewinsky, so the story became a huge, national nightmare -- in part because both Bill and Hillary Clinton claimed for months that Lewinsky was lying. When the story broke, Hillary Clinton even said on ABC that Lewinsky misunderstood that Bill Clinton is just ""a happy, friendly, loving, kind, good person."" He ""reaches out to all kinds of people.""ABC enabled that. No laugh track. No skepticism. It was gullible to a fault.The emergence of Lewinsky led to other women who said that Clinton assaulted them. In March of 1998, Ed Bradley interviewed Kathleen Willey on CBS ""60 Minutes."" Willey said the president fondled her breast and put her hand on his crotch during a 1993 Oval Office visit. Willey had been begging for a job. The Clinton team quickly put out letters Willey had written Clinton to erase the idea that she was assaulted, and the story vanished. A federal judge ruled in 2000 that the Clinton White House violated the Privacy Act with that disclosure. The Big Three TV networks gave that ruling 66 seconds combined.This pattern was even repeated with Juanita Broaddrick, who declared in a ""Dateline NBC"" interview in 1999 that Clinton raped her in a Little Rock hotel room in 1978 (""You better get some ice for that,"" he told her after). On the evening newscasts, CBS aired one story, and ABC and NBC did nothing -- even though NBC secured the interview!When Trump invited these women to the second presidential debate, guess what the networks did. They attacked Trump for going ""personal.""So ask yourself this question: How many times since 1994 have TV interviewers asked Hillary Clinton what she did or didn't do to smear these women? Try and find  one  occasion.As repugnant as it was, Trump's offense was words. The Clintons' offenses were actions.The cynicism boggles the mind.

222,ABC,"Walt Disney (DIS) is reportedly not going to put in an offer for Twitter (TWTR), but comments from Disney CEO Bob Iger at a Wednesday event in Boston signal that the entertainment conglomerate is doing some serious thinking about its distribution strategy.""The biggest thing that we're trying to do now is figure out what technology's role is in distributing the great content that we have,"" said Iger, according to the Boston Business Journal, which attended the Boston College Chief Executives Club event.""It's one thing to be as fortunate as we are to have Disney, ABC, ESPN, Pixar, Marvel, 'Star Wars' and Lucasfilm, but in today's world, it's almost not enough to have all that stuff unless you have access to your consumer,"" he said.The media and entertainment conglomerate has been the subject of rumors that it is interested in perhaps acquiring Netflix (NFLX), the streaming heavyweight that already licenses a great deal of Disney-owned programming. Four made-for-Netflix shows are in Disney's Marvel pipeline, including ""Jessica Jones"" and this fall's ""Luke Cage.""Iger said during the event that he wouldn't comment on potential buys, but that ""shouldn't mean that we are doing anything or not doing anything,"" according to Bloomberg.""When you mention Netflix and Twitter and Facebook (FB) and a variety of other -- Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL) -- new entrants into the marketplace you see companies that are not only technology companies and distributing content, they are starting to invest more and more in making content,"" he said, highlighting Twitter's licensing deal to live-stream NFL games as an example.Disney shares rose 0.4% to 92.83 on the stock market today, continuing to cruise near the bottom of a flat base with a 106.85 buy point. Netflix dipped 1.1% to 105.07, but is still up nearly 7% for the week.IBD's TAKE: Get caught up on the latest Twitter acquisition drama. The latest news is that Alphabet's Google, Apple and Disney all aren't interested -- but Salesforce.com still might be.Media stocks underwent a beating in 2015 over Iger's comments that ESPN subscribers were dropping off slightly, so much focus and concern remains on the health of pay-TV and cable shedders.Disney recently bought a one-third stake in streaming platform BAMTech, which powers both HBONow and Twitter's NFL streams. Ratings for NFL games have dropped this season, with ESPN seeing the biggest decline.Meanwhile, on Thursday RBC Capital Markets analyst Steven Cahall cut his price target on the company to 98 from 103, reiterating his sector perform rating and citing a medley of factors that includes an unclear successor to Iger and ""potentially transformative M&A.""""This complexity is a reminder that the devil is in the details with Disney so we think the stock could remain depressed around current levels for some time, with the 'look through' to FY18 taking longer than some anticipate,"" he wrote.RELATED:Netflix Stock Gets Superhero Boost From Disney Takeover Talk Disney Already Looking At 'Star Wars' Films For Next DecadeSnapchat Has 60 Million Daily Users In U.S., Canada, Underscoring Twitter's Woes

223,ABC," Let's describe the relationship of the media and their Democratic cohorts to taxes and those who ""don't pay them"" as, well, complicated.In 2012, ABC News' Jonathan Karl claimed on television that an auto mechanic making $75,000 a year paid a higher federal income tax rate than that paid by then-Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney.But, as I later told Karl in a radio interview, that would only be true if Mr. Auto Mechanic had no children, owned no home and therefore did not take the same deductions as those taken by Romney. In an apples-to-apples comparison, I informed him, Romney, at a 14% rate, pays twice the rate paid by Mr. Mechanic.Karl said he would look into that, and get back to me. He must've used Hillary Clinton's email server, because I never heard back.Democrat's 2004 presidential nominee, John Kerry, through marriage, is also a wealthy man. A few years ago, he bought a 76-foot yacht, but docked it in nearby Rhode Island, rather than Massachusetts where he lived and presumably used the yacht. It turns out by doing so he could avoid $500,000 in sales and excise taxes. Embarrassed by a media expose, he later paid up.In 2001, Kerry's state of Massachusetts lowered its income tax rate. If, however, the guilty Bay State liberals wanted to pay the higher rate -- so as not to deprive schools, hospitals and all -- they could check a box and do so. Out of over 3 million tax filers, only a fraction of 1% (930 taxpayers) voluntarily agreed to pay the old, higher rate.Not among that fraction of 1% was then-Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., who once said, ""There are a lot of very rich people out there whom we can tax."" When asked about the apparent contradiction, Frank said, ""I don't trust the (Republican-led state) government to spend the money properly.""The late Sen. Ted Kennedy, D-Mass., cast many votes opposing decreases in the estate tax. But his father, Joe Kennedy, placed his family's fortune in trusts to avoid paying the very estate tax that his son later advocated during his Senate career.The late Democratic tax-the-rich Ohio Sen. Howard Metzenbaum relocated to Florida upon retirement, a move reportedly made so that upon death he would avoid state estate taxes. Based on where he was when he died, mission accomplished.Then there are the tax-the-rich hosts at cable news channels, with the list led by MSNBC's Rev. Al Sharpton, whose endorsement was vigorously pursued by Hillary Clinton, even though she criticizes Donald Trump for having ""paid nothing in federal taxes."" Sharpton, according to The New York Times in 2014, owes ""more than $4.5 million in current state and federal tax.""It was The New York Times that dropped the ""bombshell"" that for years Donald Trump ""paid no federal income taxes."" This would be the same New York Times that, in 2014 -- and who knows what other years -- paid zero federal income taxes.Donald Trump is a rich businessman. Business people typically do not become rich by willingly paying more in taxes than they believe they owe. He took legal deductions, apparently using losses and his casino businesses to offset his income taxes. Perfectly legal, nothing to see here.Trump  does  pay taxes -- a lot of them. He pays payroll taxes, property taxes, excise taxes, sales taxes, local taxes and whatever fees imposed by the various states in which he does business.And as for his claim that he's undergoing an audit and therefore does not want to release returns? The explanation is simple, if not clear to people who don't run a complicated business.Trump and the IRS are very likely in disagreement over how much he owes and how the tax code should be interpreted to come up with the correct amount. Trump, who says he gets audited every year, probably has these disagreements every year.If he were to disclose his returns, and the public became aware of the amount the IRS says he owes versus the amount he thinks he does, the IRS will be publicly shamed into digging in its heels, refusing to negotiate lest they be perceived as caving in to a rich guy. In short, Trump would lose his leverage and very likely millions of dollars in taxes. What sane person does that?Warren Buffett, who claimed he paid a lower tax rate then did his secretary, disputed what the IRS claimed one of his companies owed. Given that Buffett famously wants income taxes raised, why doesn't he simply accede to the IRS' request, pay the money voluntarily and increase the federal treasury?By the way, while we're at it, has anybody seen Buffett's returns and those of his secretary to confirm his assertion that he pays a lower tax rate than she does?But then, neither Buffett, nor, we presume, his secretary, is a Republican. Different strokes for different folks.Related:Trump Is Right — Corporate Taxes Should Be Slashed Or EliminatedHillary's Red Army March Of Tax-Hike Destruction
"
224,ABC,"In a year when public anxiety is high and respect for the political establishment is low, populist ideas have taken hold of both major political parties. On trade, drug prices, Wall Street and many other issues, both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump are playing to anger and resentment, with both saying the system is rigged in one way or another and promising to ""take on"" powerful forces they say are behind the struggles of American families.Unfortunately, their solutions, while they do well in public polls, almost certainly would hamper economic growth, would hurt investors and those saving for retirement, and could wind up doing more harm than good to the very people they are trying to help, according to a wide range of experts who study these issues.After a deep recession followed by an anemic recovery and expansion, the public mood is ripe for the kind of populist rhetoric that is now standard fare in the Democratic and Republican presidential campaigns.The September IBD/TIPP Poll Economic Optimism Index stands at 46.7 — well in the sub-50 territory that signals pessimism. That's barely above the index's average during the entire Great Recession. The poll also shows that just 33% of Americans think the country is headed in right direction, which is lower than in January 2009.A Gallup survey finds that only 38% of the public thinks the economy is getting better, while a distressingly high 57% say it's getting worse.Meanwhile, a survey by MarketWatch finds that 71% think the economic system is ""rigged"" in favor of certain groups.Against this backdrop, both Clinton and Trump vow to use the power of government to unrig the economy.Trump is typically described as a populist, and rightly so. He talks endlessly about how China and Mexico and illegal immigrants are stealing jobs. He complains about everything, including elections, being rigged. He rails against the establishment, political correctness, corrupt politicians and special interests that finance them.But Clinton — in part to fend off the Bernie Sanders populist uprising in the Democratic Party — is also advocating populist policies.In her economic speech in Michigan in August, Clinton warned about ""powerful special interests"" and how ""China and other countries have gamed the system for too long."" She said ""Wall Street, corporations and the super-rich should finally pay their fair share of taxes.""When asked, large majorities of the public like these ideas. A Gallup poll finds that 61% say upper-income Americans ""pay too little in taxes."" An Associated Press poll found that 72% support mandatory paid family leave. The IBD/TIPP Poll has found broad support for a higher federal minimum wage. An ABC/Washington Post poll found that 67% say the next president should back tougher Wall Street reforms. Polls also show that a majority of Americans think trade deals cost jobs.But just because an idea is popular doesn't mean it will work. Most of the populist proposals offered by Trump and Clinton would have serious downside costs.A centerpiece of Clinton's economic plan is raising taxes on businesses and the wealthy. According to a Moody's analysis, Clinton would hike corporate income taxes by $470 billion and individual income taxes by nearly $1 trillion. Among her proposals is a plan to add a 4% surcharge on incomes above $5 million and impose the so-called Buffett rule to raise taxes on higher income filers.While taxing the rich polls well — 52% in one poll say government should impose ""heavy"" taxes on the rich — the idea that they don't pay their ""fair share"" is based on a myth. The top 1% account for 19% of income, but 38% of income taxes paid, according to IRS data.And Clinton's proposal would make a tax code with already mind-boggling complexity — which the IRS itself says costs some $168 billion to comply with today — even more unmanageable.""Clinton's proposals would make the tax code more complex, especially for higher-income tax filers,"" according to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center.That might be good news for companies like H&R Block and Intuit, but the net impact of her tax plan would be to dampen economic growth.Indeed, an analysis of Clinton's tax plan by the Tax Foundation concluded that it would cut long-term GDP growth by 1%.Even Moody's, which is generally supportive of Clinton's economic plan, admits that it would ""raise marginal tax rates on saving and investment and labor of high-income households, thus reducing their incentive to save, invest and work.""Both Trump and Clinton have complained about high drug prices, and both back a proposal that would let the federal government negotiate drug prices for Medicare. A Kaiser Family Foundation found enormous support for this idea, with more than 80% backing it.Proponents say this would save taxpayers as much as $16 billion a year. But even if that were true — and there are disputes about the potential savings — the plan would prove harmful to the pharmaceutical industry and to new drug development.Medicare Part D drug prices are already negotiated and often heavily discounted because Part D relies on competing private insurers to provide the benefit to seniors. In fact, this competition resulted in the cost of the program coming in at about half the original forecast. Forcing drug prices still lower for seniors would, industry analysts explain, amount to government price controls on drugs.""That has its own set of negative effects, including reducing incentives for developing new drugs and creating a new pricing bureaucracy subject to lobbying by patient advocacy groups and manufacturers,"" explained Geoffrey Joyce, director of health policy at the Leonard D. Schaeffer Center for Health Policy & Economics.Indeed, a Congressional Budget Office report notes that such price controls would reduce the industry's investment in R&D.Punishing Companies That Leave U.S.Clinton also proposes to reduce ""corporate inversions"" to a minimum through what she calls an ""exit tax."" Under this plan, Clinton would tax the accumulated untaxed earnings of foreign subsidiaries of any U.S. company that voluntarily leaves the U.S. or is acquired by a foreign company.""If they want to go, they're going to have to pay to go,"" Clinton said in her economic speech.While this plan could discourage corporate inversions, critics say that inversions themselves are just a symptom of a deeper problem, namely, a skewed U.S. corporate income tax code, which imposes higher rates than other industrialized nations, and effectively double-taxes profits earned abroad.""Companies engage in a corporate inversion as a best response to the anti-growth U.S. corporate tax code,"" said Wayne Winegarden of the Pacific Research Institute, a free-market think tank based in San Francisco. ""Penalizing companies seeking to restructure through a corporate inversion makes it more difficult for U.S. companies to obtain a level playing field with international competitors when competing in the global marketplace.""Currently, U.S. multinationals are holding about $2 trillion in profits overseas because bringing that money back to the U.S. would expose them to enormous taxes. Many economists argue that reforming the corporate tax code would do more to reduce inversions than adding another tax on the pile.While Clinton wants to tax companies that leave, Trump wants to tax domestic companies bringing goods in from factories located outside U.S. borders.""When a company moves and wants to move, as an example, to Mexico, we're going to wish them luck. But when they want to sell their product in this country, we're going to say, 'Sorry, but you have a 35% tax to pay to get your product back in,' "" Trump said at a rally in early August. ""If they do move, we're going to make a fortune, OK?""It's a line that gets a huge response from his audiences.What Trump doesn't tell his audience is that it's the government that will make that fortune, and that Trump's supporters, along with everyone else, will be paying the tax.A study by the National Foundation for American Policy concluded that Trump's import tax would cost the average household $2,200. That because the tax would not just raise the price of imports. It also would give domestic manufacturers more leeway to raise their own prices.""All of the benefits for producers would be extracted from consumers,"" said David Tuerck, a co-author of the study.Both Trump and Clinton delight in attacking the current boogeyman of the populist movement — Wall Street.Trump has blasted Clinton by saying that she is ""totally owned"" by Wall Street. He cites, among other things, lucrative speeches she gave to Goldman Sachs. He has accused hedge funds of ""getting away with murder"" when it comes to paying taxes.But aside from his rhetoric — and a plan to tax carried interest — Trump's specific proposals would actually loosen the federal government's stranglehold on the financial sector. Among other things, Trump has promised to dismantle Dodd-Frank.Clinton, on the other hand, wants to go ""well beyond"" Dodd-Frank with what she brags are the ""toughest"" set of reforms, with a goal of making ""our financial system fairer and more accountable.""Her plan includes a new ""risk fee,"" a tax on high-frequency trading, increased regulatory control of the ""shadow banking"" sector and much more.The problem is that Dodd-Frank itself is causing problems in the financial sector by, among other things, further consolidating the banking industry. Critics of Dodd-Frank don't believe that more regulation will improve this picture.One Non-Populist IdeaIronically, one of the least populist ideas offered by a presidential candidate this year could have the biggest impact on economic growth and increased household income — cutting corporate taxes.Nearly two-thirds of Americans say corporations don't pay their fair share and 63% support raising corporate taxes, according to two separate polls.Trump proposes, however, to slash the current corporate income tax rate of 35% down to 15%, while closing loopholes that let many companies escape taxes altogether.The Dallas-based Goodman Institute asked Boston University economist Laurence Kotlikoff to run Trump's corporate tax plan through an economic model that Kotlikoff built. He is decidedly not a Trump supporter, and he is critical of other Trump tax proposals.What he found was that Trump's corporate tax plan would produce a huge increase in investment capital, much of it coming from abroad.""More capital means higher productivity and higher wages,"" Kotlikoff said. Trump's corporate tax plan ""has the potential to raise the income of the typical worker by as much as $4,000 per year within the next four years.""

225,ABC,"In 2009, 50 of fashion's leading designers created the hottest ticket of New York City's Fashion Week. The show celebrated a beloved muse on her 50th birthday: The Barbie doll. Barbie debuted in 1959 and ""perseveres today as a cultural icon ... her enchanting essence has allowed generations of women to enter a world of make-believe that knows no boundaries,"" said Vera Wang in InStyle magazine.Barbie is the product of the make-believe and boundless marketing acumen of Ruth Handler, who co-founded Mattel (MAT) with her husband Elliot Handler and Harold Matson in a Los Angeles garage in 1945. Today, Mattel is the world's largest toy manufacturer with sales in 150 countries and annual revenues of over $6 billion. Elliot Handler created many of Mattel's early successes, and Ruth's marketing genius brought them to the masses.Handler was born in Denver in 1916, the tenth child of Jewish immigrants who fled anti-Semitism in Poland. After her mother became ill, infant Ruth went to live with her eldest sister, Sarah, and her husband, Louie Greenwald, hardworking small-business owners who owned a pharmacy, lunch stand and one of Denver's first post-prohibition liquor stores.Handler had a more affluent upbringing than her siblings, whose home was plagued by their father's gambling debts. But hers wasn't a life of leisure; Ruth began working in the Greenwald businesses as soon as she could.In addition to her job at the lunch stand and classes at the University of Denver, 18-year-old Ruth was occupied with Elliot Handler, a young artist she met at a dance. Wanting to see the world, however, she accepted a girlfriend's offer to explore Los Angeles.  Elliot saved up money to attend Los Angeles' Art Center College of Design and soon joined Ruth, who worked in the stenography pool at Paramount Studios. They married in 1938.While Ruth continued at Paramount, Elliot began making a name for himself as a designer of costume jewelry. She often made sales calls for him on her lunch hour. In 1941, she gave birth to a daughter named — you guessed it — Barbara. While a reluctant homemaker, she then had a son — yes, Kenneth — in 1944.In 1945, Elliot and colleague Harold Matson founded Mattel. Ruth, itching to get back in business, suggested they make picture frames, convinced that she could get a local photo studio to place a large order. She was right. Mattel soon outgrew the garage.Mattel had its first hit toy in 1947 with the Uke-A-Doodle, a miniature ukulele, and the Handlers bought out Matson. They had their next hit in 1950 with a hand-cranked low-cost music box inserted into several toys, including the jack-in-the-box.By 1951, Mattel had 600 employees. Ruth, as executive vice president, handled marketing and operations.  ""(Ruth) was very hands-on. She was on the floor doing quality control. She and Elliot had an open hiring policy. She hired for talent,"" Robin Gerber, author of ""Barbie and Ruth,"" told IBD. Their factories employed far more women and people of color than the norms of the day, and in 1951 Mattel earned the Urban League Award for nondiscriminatory hiring practices.In 1955, ABC announced the ""Mickey Mouse Club"" series. Ruth knew instinctively that kids watching other kids play with Mattel toys would be a game-changer. She bet the farm, paying $500,000 for a sponsorship, nearly all of Mattel's net worth. The gamble paid off, and sales of the featured Burp Gun broke records. Mattel's investment in television ads changed the key toy consumer from parent to child and created a year-round demand for toys, a business which had always been seasonal.On a trip to Switzerland in 1956, Ruth spotted the popular ""Lilli"" doll, based on a racy cartoon character in a German newspaper, which had adult features and fashionable outfits, and was marketed to adults as a gag gift. Since the early 1950s, when she observed young Barbara rejecting the child paper dolls in favor of adult ones, Handler had been trying to convince her team that a doll with adult features would be a hit. They nixed it, saying it would be too expensive to manufacture. But in her autobiography ""Dream Doll,"" Ruth wrote that the reluctance ""stemmed mostly from the fact that the doll would have breasts.""Seeing Lilli changed the team's tune. Handler hired marketing psychologist Ernst Dichter to explore whether Barbie's breasts would turn off parents. His advice, after conducting interviews with girls and their mothers? Make them bigger.Barbie debuted in 1959. Handler marketed Barbie as a ""teenage fashion model"" and created a commercial displaying her many different looks. Sales started slow, but once school got out, Barbie flew off the shelves. It took Mattel three years to catch up with consumer demand.In 1960, Mattel went public. In the following years it introduced other iconic toys including Chatty Cathy and Hot Wheels cars. By 1966, Mattel had reached $100 million in sales and was listed on the Fortune 500.By the late 1960s, Mattel's annual sales were over $200 million and its stock offered a 16% return. Mattel implemented a growth strategy of acquiring other companies aimed at youngsters and made a splash by purchasing Ringling Brothers Circus. But sales sagged in the economic recession — compounded by a fire in a Mexican factory that destroyed inventory and a dock workers' strike that halted deliveries. Handler had other battles to fight, though, as she was diagnosed with breast cancer in 1970.Upon returning to work after her mastectomy, she discovered that Mattel was implementing ""bill-and-hold,"" a practice of recording sales to be shipped later, in order to maintain its stock price. Bill-and-hold was legal. However, the extent to which Mattel used it meant that it submitted false and misleading information in its financial reports. Handler claimed that she didn't know the full extent of the practice, but many were skeptical that her eye for detail could miss the discrepancies.In 1972, shareholders sued Mattel. In 1974, the SEC began investigating, and she and Elliot left the company. What had led to her recklessness? In an interview with Robin Gerber, Elliot said that with her preternatural drive, Ruth ""couldn't turn it off.""Fortunately for many breast cancer survivors, she didn't turn it off. Unhappy with her awkward prosthetic breast, a friend suggested that she visit sculptor Peyton Massey. With her input, he designed one superior to those she'd worn before. They created Nearly Me, a reasonably-priced, natural-feeling line of prosthetics fitted to women's bra sizes. Nearly Me launched in 1976 in high-end department stores. Letters of gratitude poured in, including one from Betty Ford.But on Feb. 17, 1978, Handler was indicted on 10 counts of mail fraud and making false statements to the SEC and federally insured banks. Convicted, Judge Robert Takasugi fined her $57,000 and gave her a sentence of 500 hours of community service for five years. Handler's probation officer assigned her to help create Foundation for People, which helped young disadvantaged young men with job training.Nearly Me continued its success in the 1980s. In 1989, she and Elliot were inducted into the Toy Industry Hall of Fame. The same year, her poor health convinced her to sell Nearly Me to Spenco Medical.Handler faced her greatest loss, however, in 1994, when her son Kenneth died of AIDS. But Barbie would help bring her out of her grief and return her to the spotlight. When Kenneth told Elliot and Ruth of his disease two years earlier, the Handlers sprang into action. helping with research and care, but his decline was rapid.A surprise visit from her past creation — Barbie — brought Handler unexpected attention and satisfaction in the midst of her mourning. Mattel Executive Jill Barad had created the ""We Girls Can Do Anything"" campaign that capitalized on Barbie's professional achievements. ""Barbie was able to step into the shoes of so many women's careers before they could. There was astronaut Barbie long before there was a real (female astronaut). That's something Ruth should be proud of,"" Tanya Lee Stone, author of ""The Good, the Bad, and the Barbie"" told IBD. In 1994, Barad asked Handler to travel with her, publicizing Barbie's role as a working woman.After years of failing health, Ruth died on April 27, 2002. She spent her final years advocating for breast cancer survivors and examining the ups and downs of her extraordinary career. In the closing lines of ""Dream Doll"" she wrote, ""Even now, at 77, I can say that whatever has driven me for all these years is driving me still, even if at a slower pace. There's still a lot of fight in me, and perhaps the fight's the thing.""Marketing genius and self-confidence propelled Handler to help create Mattel, the Barbie doll and Nearly Me breast prosthetics.Overcame: Lack of college education and few female business role models to start industry-leading Fortune 500 company.Lesson: Find your customers' needs and devise a better way to meet them.Quote: ""I've come full cycle from the first doll with a real breast to answering a real woman's need for a breast.""RELATED:Barbie Vs.

226,ABC,"Millennials (and others) face a big choice in this year's presidential election and it's not who to vote for: Should they watch live streaming of Donald Trump-Hillary Clinton debates on Facebook (FB) or Twitter (TWTR).Their decision may depend on which social networking platform works best for commentary to friends or a wider audience. The first presidential debate is slated for Monday, Sept. 26.Twitter on Wednesday said it will stream Bloomberg's live broadcast of the 2016 U.S. presidential and vice-presidential debates, under an exclusive agreement. Twitter and Bloomberg Media have partnered for other content.Twitter last week won kudos for the debut of its live streaming of National Football League Thursday night games.

227,ABC,"The stock market pared gains in afternoon trading, as the Nasdaq went through its most critical test in weeks.The composite led with a 0.4% rise -- less than half its intraday peak -- as biotechs, telecoms and some other technology shares were among the market leaders today. The Nasdaq is rising tentatively from its 50-day moving average. If it can continue bouncing from that level, it would give investors a sense of relief. The market, though, has other obstacles, not the least of which is a pile-up of distribution days, i.e., losses in higher volume.The S&P 500 fell fractionally while the Dow Jones industrial average dipped about 1%. Apple (AAPL) climbed 3.8%, which gave all major indexes a boost. In fact, it was the highest increase within the 30 components of the Dow industrials at midday.Volume was tracking lower across the board. Winners led losers by 5-to-4 on the major exchanges.In the telecom sector, Finisar (FNSR) hit a new high, adding more than 4% in big volume. The stock gapped up after a strong Sept. 8 earnings report and has not given back any ground. Fiber optics company Acacia Communications (ACIA) reversed to trade down nearly 1%.In other technology stocks, Broadcom (AVGO) climbed back above its 50-day moving average and rose more than 2%. The diversified chip firm also climbed back above a 163.87 cup-with-handle buy point; it broke out past that proper entry initially on July 27.A Pacific Crest analyst praised Broadcom and other chipmakers, saying that inventories are low heading into the sales launch of Apple's iPhone 7 on Friday, according to media reports. Also, Pacific Crest sees little impact to Samsung Electronics due to its recall of the Galaxy Note 7 because of battery hazards.But some medical stocks came under pressure, notably the major drug distributors McKesson (MCK), AmerisourceBergen (ABC) and Cardinal Health (CAH). All three were down 1.5% to 3.5% in heavy volume as they sank deeper into corrections.Oil prices fell more than 2%. The Energy Department reported a surprise drop in crude stockpiles in the prior week and an increase in domestic production.

228,ABC,"The Clinton Foundation has become a serious problem for the Hillary Clinton campaign. Everyone knows the Clintons made a mockery of the promises they made to Team Obama. Even the left-wing site PolitiFact says that it's ""Mostly False"" that they obeyed the rules.
"
229,ABC,"Like her husband, Bill Clinton, who infamously claimed, ""I did not have sexual relations with that woman,"" Monica Lewinsky, Hillary Clinton is going around claiming, ""My work as secretary of state was not influenced by outside sources.""On Jan. 5, 2009, Clinton sent a letter to State Department Designated Agency Ethics Official James Thessin promising, ""I will not participate personally and substantially in any particular matter that has a direct and predictable effect on my financial interests or those of any person whose interests are imputed to me,"" including her husband.Who didn't anticipate that this would end up in an ethical mess? What genius hasn't observed over the last 25 years how the Clintons break their promises? Some people saw this as a potential scandal, but they didn't stand a chance with the Clinton-loving press.In Oct. 2007, liberal pundit Matthew Yglesias asked in the Los Angeles Times, ""Who's giving money to Bill Clinton?"" He complained that the Clintons should release a list of their foundation donors before Hillary Clinton could become president in 2009, saying: ""Disclosing who's contributing to Bill Clinton's foundation after his wife wins the election would be about four years too late. The voters ought to have this information before the election, when it could still make a difference.""Surprise, surprise: Clinton didn't win, and the Clintons didn't release a donor list until Dec. 2008, when she was asked to become secretary of state. The blather on the TV networks was all about how President Obama's cabinet was a team of geniuses. ""We have not seen this kind of combination of star power, brain power and political muscle this early in a cabinet in our lifetimes,"" gushed George Stephanopoulos on ABC. The fix was in.As Clinton's four years wound down, the pundits celebrated the wonderful work of the Clinton Foundation. On ""The Chris Matthews Show"" on July 16, 2012, journalist Howard Fineman said that Bill Clinton had modeled his foundation on President Jimmy Carter, but that ""he's Jimmy Carter with a better touch."" Chris Matthews replied: ""And much bigger in terms of the amplification of what he's been able to do. The Clinton Global Initiative is huge. And by the way it's done a lot to build his role in history...beyond anything he was able to do as president.""On Aug. 23, the Associated Press underlined the degree to which Hillary Clinton's promises were vaporized. More than half the people outside the government (at least 85 of 154 people) who met or had phone conversations scheduled with Clinton during the first half of her ""public service"" at the State Department donated to the family foundation. At least 40 donated more than $100,000, and 20 contributed more than $1 million.The AP based these investigations off half of Clinton's office calendars from her State Department tenure, which it only received after filing a Freedom of Information Act request to acquire them. The other half of the calendars won't be released until after the election.Once again, the Clintons are making promises to downsize their involvement with the foundation if Hillary Clinton wins the presidency. At this point, that sounds as believable as former Rep. Anthony Weiner's promise to stop texting. But the Clinton-enabling reflex in the media is dangerously strong, and the Clintons are threatening to take advantage of it for the rest of this campaign.

230,ABC,"Nike (NKE) and Under Armour (UA) may be the dominant names in the sports apparel industry, but Lululemon Athletica (LULU) is seen finally engineering a turnaround as activewear remains trendy.Credit Suisse's research ""suggests Lululemon's long-awaited earnings turnaround is likely underway, driven by a best-in-class pricing strategy, normalized inventory levels and supply-chain-driven margin expansion,"" wrote analyst Christian Buss on Tuesday, adding that ""the likelihood of a multiyear merchandise margin expansion phase now seems well-embedded in expectations,"" so long as the retailer maintains momentum.The retail space has been volatile and prone to heavy discounting, but Buss noted that the ongoing activewear trends and ""recent product refreshes"" have kept Lululemon prices intact. The company's current, multi-pronged growth strategy includes product innovation, building out its North American and e-commerce presences and expanding abroad.When the athletic-wear retailer reports Thursday, Wall Street expects second-quarter earnings to rise 12% to 38 cents on 14% sales growth to $515.5 million. Lululemon reported a 12% EPS decline in Q1.Lululemon shares are hitting three-year highs, not far from their all-time intraday high of 82.50 on June 10, 2013. (On that same day three years ago, the company announced the resignation of then-CEO Christine Day, ultimately sending the stock tumbling almost 19% that week.)Lululemon fell 1.8% to 76.85 at the close on the stock market today, closing just above its 50-day moving average after undercutting that key support line intraday for the first time in three months. Lululemon shares may be falling in sympathy with apparel retailer Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF) and clothing maker G-III Apparel (GIII), which both suffered huge stock losses on their earnings reports Tuesday morning.IBD'S TAKE: Lululemon has earned an IBD Composite Rating of 91 out of a possible 99, and is climbing into new-high territory. To see what that means, read: ""Lululemon Pushes To New Highs After Short Consolidation.""Wedbush analyst Morry Brown said he expects ""positive"" results, though those expectations are likely priced into the stock already. He also highlighted that since the beginning of May, Lululemon had outperformed the S&P 500 by 14% vs. its retail peers that Brown covers, which have underperformed the index by 7%.""In our view, the outperformance reflects expectations for strong comps, an inflection in gross margin, inventory realignment and upside to 2Q EPS,"" he wrote, raising his price target on Lululemon to 82 from 80 on Monday.The seemingly endless ""athleisure"" trend plays into Lululemon's strengths as a yogawear and activewear maker, and the brand is moving to grab market share in men's apparel amid Nike's ubiquity and Under Armour's assertive growth. In its previously recorded quarter, Lululemon said its men's category grew 21%, its sixth straight 15%+ quarter.One somewhat quirky innovation is finding success with male shoppers.CEO Laurent Potdevin said during the June earnings call that the company was integrating its ""ABC"" -- i.e. ""anti-ball-crushing"" -- technology into more men's styles ""to keep our male gear destruction-free throughout the day.""Nike shares fell 1.1% to 58. Under Armour lost 1.3% to 41.56.Meanwhile, Abercrombie & Fitch plummeted 20.3% to 18.29. G-III also plunged, losing 20.7% to 33.14, hitting a two-and-a-half year low intraday.RELATED:Abercrombie & Fitch Stock Falls As Tourism Decline Hits Earnings, Sales.

231,ABC,"On Jan. 13, a judge in Houston, Texas, sentenced Alexandria Vera to 10 years in prison. Her crime? The 25-year-old teacher at Stovall Middle School struck up a sexual relationship with a 13-year-old student — having sex almost every day, she said, for nine months — but with the parents' approval. She could be eligible for parole in five years.Prosecutors alleged Vera groomed the child and his family, moving the teen and his father into her home and pretending she was dating the father. She also bought groceries for the boy's family and paid the phone bills. She even became pregnant by the boy. When child-protection workers closed in, she got an abortion. Unsurprisingly, the boy is now in foster care.One would assume this story of a sexual predator would be plastered all over the national news. Isn't this the kind of crusading story full of human interest and melodrama? Apparently not. ABC, CBS, and NBC couldn't be bothered. Fox had a segment on ""The Kelly File"" when it broke open last year. CNN's Headline News shows — Drew Pinsky's last year, and Ashleigh Banfield's last week — gave it a single spin.One could guess that reverse sexism plays a role: An adult woman abusing a boy seems more acceptable than a grown man molesting a young girl. One could also guess that adding an abortion to the sinister plot made it less interesting to liberal journalists.These are the same networks that will not stop covering and lecturing about the child sexual abuse — real and alleged and untrue — by Catholic priests, even after the church created new systems to vet not only priests but also even church volunteers who deal with children in parish life.How about newspapers? The New York Times never loses interest in advocating against the Catholic Church on this issue. But on Alexandria Vera in Houston? Nothing. The Washington Post, whose editor Marty Baron was painted as a crusading captain of the church-busting team at The Boston Globe in the Oscar-winning movie ""Spotlight""? It never made the actual paper but drew two blog posts over the last six months that barely surpassed 1,000 words between them.Many people might see this story and recall the case of Mary Kay Letourneau, a 34-year-old teacher who sexually abused an infatuated 12-year-old boy named Vili Fualaau, which became a big tabloid story in 1997.But ultimately, how bothered are some in the liberal community? It's easy to forget that abuse ended up being rewarded. In 2005, after getting out of jail, Letourneau agreed to marry the boy, now an adult. Hollywood then allowed them to cash in.Paramount — the producers of ""Entertainment Tonight"" and ""The Insider"" — announced they had obtained the rights to wallow in the pedophile wedding of the century. What did Paramount do? The two shows spent days panting after the ""lucky couple."" Inside the rehearsal dinner. Inside the wedding. Inside the reception. Paramount interviewers even asked Letourneau for relationship advice!Their rivals at ""Access Hollywood"" played the moralist. Co-host Billy Bush insisted Paramount paid big money for the privilege, ""close to $1 million — a figure they deny,"" Bush said. ""Go to prison; get on TV; get rich,"" he lamented.The disease spread to network TV. In a piece for ABC's ""Good Morning America,"" ""Entertainment Tonight"" reporter Jann Carl hyped the wedding as ""the icing on the cake of a notorious soap opera that still sparks admiration and outrage around the world."" Hold on. Just who ""admires"" the rape of a 12-year-old boy?Child sexual abuse in secular schools doesn't seem to inspire liberal journalists, which underlines that on this absorbing subject, as on many others, what's ""news"" depends on perspective, and in the American media, it is both liberal and libertine.

232,ABC,"The mainstream press loves to tell readers that it can be trusted because it employs professional journalists backed by layers of editors. Oh, and they're all unbiased.So how to explain a recent Washington Post headline, which manages both to misrepresent its own poll and expose the ridiculous extent to which its reporters and editors will go to bash President-elect Donald Trump?The story is about a Washington Post/ABC News poll that asks, among other things, whether Trump should sell his business to avoid any possible conflicts of interest while president.Trump has taken steps to avoid these conflicts, although not to the satisfaction of some in the media — many of whom probably wouldn't be satisfied no matter what Trump did.What did the poll find? It found that most (52%) think the steps Trump has taken are enough to ""separate Trump's business interests from his obligations as president."" On the other hand, only 42% said that Trump should sell his business.It would seem that the news here is that most people think Trump has done enough to avoid conflicts of interest involving his company. The Post's poll is in keeping with others that found little public support for the notion that Trump should sell his business to be president.So what's the Washington Post's headline about its own poll?""More than 4 in 10 say Trump should sell his businesses — but even more say he shouldn't, poll finds""Say what? That incredibly awkward and lengthy headline seems designed to put the most negative spin possible on the results.""More than 4 in 10""! That sounds bad. How many readers stopped there, before trying to understand what exactly the rest of the headline, which comes after the dash, meant?What's more, the length of the headline means that only the first part is likely to get picked up by those who want to direct traffic to the story, or in search results, as you can see nearby.The story itself, at least, is more fair. ""The poll finds 52% of those surveyed say Trump's decision to hand over control of his businesses to his adult sons and another executive 'is enough' to separate his business interests from his obligations as president.""But even here, the writer puts a negative spin on the results, saying ""a somewhat smaller share, 42%, say Trump should sell his business outright."" A 10-point spread is not ""somewhat smaller."" And this spread is even bigger if you count those who had opinion on the matter, since it means that 58% either say he shouldn't sell his business or don't care one way or another.What's more, the Post doesn't point out to readers that 66% of Democrats surveyed say Trump should sell his business. In contrast, just 81% of Republicans and 56% of independents said Trump shouldn't.In other words, Democrats are far out of the mainstream on this question, which is just another way of saying that Democrats deeply loathe and distrust Trump. But you'd never know that reading the Post story, since you have to dig down into the poll itself to discover the partisan breakdown.The Daily Caller, a conservative news site, wrote the proper headline for this story: ""Majority Of Voters Support Trump's Business Decision, Poll Finds.""Simple, direct, and as it turns out, unbiased.If readers can't count on a major newspaper to fairly represent the results of its own Trump poll, why should they trust them to report anything else about Trump in an unbiased way? RELATED:Trump Owes The Media Nothing — Here's WhyMedia Misreport Gallup Poll Results About Trump's AbilitiesGot Fake News?

233,ABC,"Rumors that Apple (AAPL) is developing an augmented-reality headset have gained credence with a report that the company is working with German lens and optics manufacturer Carl Zeiss on AR smartglasses.Tech blogger Robert Scoble said Monday that a Zeiss employee at CES confirmed rumors that Apple and Zeiss are working on a light pair of augmented reality or mixed reality glasses that could be announced later this year.Zeiss had an exhibit in the augmented reality marketplace at the Las Vegas Convention Center during the CES trade show, which ended Sunday, but curiously didn't have any AR products on display.Scoble speculates that Apple wouldn't let Zeiss show any AR products at the show as part of its business arrangement.IBD'S TAKE: Apple stock broke out of a cup-with-handle chart pattern on Monday, clearing a buy point of 118.12. It had been building the pattern over the past 11 weeks. Apple stock is trading at its highest level since Dec. 7, 2015.Apple stock rose a fraction to 119.11 on the stock market today. It was the stock's fourth straight day of appreciation.Apple CEO Tim Cook has hinted about the company's interest in augmented reality over the past year and Apple has made several acquisitions of companies that could play a role in AR products.On a July 26 conference call with analysts, Cook said he was bullish about augmented reality.""AR can be really great, and we have been and continue to invest a lot in this,"" Cook said. ""We are high on AR for the long run. We think there are great things for customers and a great commercial opportunity.""In September, Cook told ABC News that augmented reality presented a bigger business opportunity than virtual reality.""There's virtual reality and there's augmented reality — both of these are incredibly interesting,"" Cook said. ""But my own view is that augmented reality is the larger of the two, probably by far.""Augmented reality superimposes digital images in a person's field of vision. It provides the user with information for navigation, to complete tasks and other purposes.By contrast, virtual reality is an immersive media that places the wearer of special headsets into a completely digital world, mostly for entertainment purposes.In November, Bloomberg reported that Apple had already ordered ""small quantities of near-eye displays from one supplier for testing."" It said Apple was in the exploration phase of wearable computing. The device being tested would connect wirelessly to the iPhone.Also in November, KGI analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said Apple is looking to leapfrog the competition in AR by three to five years with its offering. But Kuo said it could take Apple one to two years to come out with an AR product, according to AppleInsider.Other companies working on augmented-reality glasses include Microsoft (MSFT), Vuzix (VUZI) and Osterhout Design Group.RELATED:Apple Stock Breaks Out After Morgan Stanley Calls It A 'Top Pick'Winners And Losers From CES 2017: Nvidia, Amazon, Apple, Qualcomm

234,ABC,"At one point in President Obama's interview with ABC News that aired over the weekend, George Stephanopoulos noted that ""the Democratic Party got pretty hollowed out on your watch, about 1,000 seats lost in the Congress, Senate, governors, state houses."" Then he asked: ""Is that on you?""It was a good question. Since Obama took office, Democrats' fortunes have plummeted. The party lost 900 seats in state legislatures, 12 governorships, 69 House seats and 13 Senate seats.Clearly, whatever leadership Obama provided, it wasn't helping Democrats connect with voters across the country.So what was Obama's response?At first, he tried — and we're not making this up — to blame President Bush.""I came in the middle of worst financial crisis since the Great Depression,"" he said. And since ""in 2010 there were a lot of folks who were still out of work,"" whoever was president was ""gonna get hit.""That's a lot of historical revisionism right there. The 2010 election was largely a repudiation of ObamaCare, which Obama had signed into law in early 2010 despite fierce public opposition, and the view that he and Democrats in Congress had taken their eye off the ball on the economy to push ObamaCare.Plus, his massively expensive ""stimulus"" wasn't producing any of the benefits he'd promised. (Anyone remember ""Recovery Summer"" in 2010?)But even Obama couldn't bring himself to blame the Great Recession for the Democrats' losses at every level of government since 2010.Instead, Obama said — and again, we are not making this up — that he was just too darn busy being president to help his fellow Democrats.""My docket was really full here,"" Obama said, ""so I can't be both chief organizer of the Democratic Party and function as commander in chief and president of the United States.""Stephanopoulos was either too polite or too partisan to not laugh out loud at this statement.This is a president, after all, who despite a supposedly full docket managed to squeeze in more than 300 rounds of golf, take 217 days of vacation, and attend more than 450 fundraisers, which was more than twice as many fundraisers as Ronald Reagan attended during his two terms in office. Obama's light schedule prompted critics to refer to him as our semiretired president.Even the Benghazi attack and the murder of a U.S. ambassador wasn't ""commander in chiefy"" enough to stop Obama from jetting off to Las Vegas the very next day, while skipping an intelligence briefing (one of many he blew off) to hit a fundraiser.Also, by the way, the Democrats' loss of the Senate in 2014 wasn't because poor Obama was stuck in the White House. In fact, they generally didn't want him out on the campaign trail in battleground states for fear that it would hurt their chances.Oh, and Obama broke tradition by actively, fervently campaigning for his successor, telling voters that his entire legacy was on the line.What Obama refuses to admit is that it was his failed policies, and his party's sharp turn to the left, that alienated voters across the country and prompted them to hand the reins of government to Republicans.These weren't the only keen insights offered up by Obama in his umpteenth exit interview. Some others:After all, he made a point of it saying it to Stephanopoulos ... twice.""Everybody likes to talk about how cool I was,"" he said at the start of the interview, referring to his White House senior staff.Then he expanded it at the end of the interview. ""People,"" he said, referring to everyone, ""always talk about how cool I am.""And here we thought people talked about things like making ends meet, keeping their families safe, getting a good education, terrorism and other mundane topics.""The American people are,"" he said, ""anxious for change.""Still? Wasn't that what he was supposed to deliver? His entire first campaign was built on ""hope and change.""He also admitted that he wasn't the transformative president — like Reagan — that he'd hoped to be. Instead, all he could say what that he'd energized a ""new generation"" of activists, who ""came out to vote for me"" but who weren't energized enough to vote for anyone else.Stephanopoulos asked Obama about the fact that ""most African Americans think we've gone backwards on race relations.""Obama's answer is that — thanks to riots, protests, cop shootings and the rest — ""we have greater awareness of where we're falling short than we used to.""In the context of Russia's alleged meddling in the U.S. election, Stephanopoulos asked Obama point blank: ""Did you underestimate Vladimir Putin?""Obama's answer was: ""I don't think I underestimated him.""Then he went on to say that ""What is true is that the Russians intended to meddle, and they meddled."" In other words, Obama underestimated Putin's desire and ability to meddle in the election.After eight years, Obama's ability to believe anything that comes out his own mouth appears undiminished.RELATED:Obama Is Still Living In His BubbleObama Leaves A Terrible Legacy To His SuccessorOn His Way Out, Obama Makes Another Promise He's Sure To Break

235,ABC,"CBS (CBS) and Hulu have officially made an agreement to offer CBS sports and entertainment programming on Hulu's yet-to-debut live-TV service, according to a statement from Hulu.The new service will be priced under $40 and include its on-demand library and cloud DVR capability, said Hulu CEO Mike Hopkins separately at the Citi Internet, Media & Telecoms conference. It will also include a ""brand new, easy to use, more personalized user experience across both its live TV and SVOD services.""CBS has its own streaming service, CBS All Access, and was until now a notable entertainment heavyweight that had not yet joined Hulu's new package. Walt Disney (DIS), 21st Century Fox (FOXA) and Time Warner (TWX) — which all have a stake in Hulu, along with Comcast (CMCSA) unit NBCUniversal — have struck deals to live-stream shows on Hulu.Hopkins said in the release that CBS is ""vital"" to a successful live-TV offering.""With 21st Century Fox, Disney, Turner and now CBS on board, our new live service will offer one of the most valuable sports, news and entertainment lineups anywhere – from ESPN, Fox Sports, CBS Sports and TNT to ABC, CBS, FOX and The Disney Channel,"" he said in the statement.Getting all the major broadcasters on board with a single streaming TV option has proved to be a challenge.The major players have each adopted different approaches to a modern entertainment field that includes younger viewers who avoid traditional cable bundles and online pure-plays Netflix (NFLX) and Amazon (AMZN).CBS reportedly plans to keep some of its popular content for itself, according to an earlier Wall Street Journal story Wednesday.The network will not offer full seasons of current shows such as ""NCIS"" to Hulu live-streaming subscribers, and will instead only provide ""a few recent episodes of such shows"" on demand, said the Journal. Much of Hulu's early appeal was in its offering of current-season shows, the day after they aired.CBS will also offer up programming from CBS Sports Network and cable channel Pop. The deal is said to give Hulu the option to include the Smithsonian Channel and teen-focused CW Network down the road, as well as offer Showtime as an add-on, according to the Journal. CBS will make more than $3 per monthly subscription, said Journal sources, with ""increases over the multiyear deal that could get to more than $4.""CBS shares finished trading up 2.1% to 65.74 on the stock market today. Netflix added 1.5% to 129.41, while Walt Disney climbed 1.3% to 107.44. Comcast tacked on 1.2% to 69.87. Fox and Amazon were up fractionally to 28.25 and 757.18, respectively.

236,ABC,"Just what we all need to ring in the Christmas season: Un-merry millionaire Michelle Obama belly-aching about the burdens and sacrifices of public life with billionaire Oprah Winfrey.""There's nowhere in the world I can go and sit and have a cup of coffee,"" Obama lamented. It's a frequent grievance. In September, she told InStyle magazine: ""My hopes are to recapture some of the everydayness, some anonymity. ... (I)t will be nice to open up the paper, look at the front page, and know that you're not responsible for every headline.""And back in June, again with Oprah, the first lady griped that living in the spotlight was like ""living in a cave.""Complain, complain, complain. What a way to make the most of your last six months in the grand and glorious White House.For the past eight years, Obama has traveled to every corner of the planet on the taxpayers' dime. She has splurged in Spain, traversed the Great Wall of China, tangoed in Buenos Aires, skied in Aspen, lolled in Martha's Vineyard and feasted in Marrakesh. Thanks to her public position and celebrity, she has been bestowed ""fashion icon"" status — donning a $12,000 custom-made Atelier Versace gown at her final State Dinner last month after enjoying two terms clad in Givenchy, Gucci, Jason Wu, Vera Wang, Caroline Herrera and other haute couture stars whose designs are unattainable to ordinary women in America.Count your blessings much, Mrs. Grinch? Nope. All Barack Obama's bitter half really wants to do, she told Winfrey, is ""drop into Target. I want to go to Target again.""Funny that. The last time Obama shopped at Target, she turned the outing into a fake news narrative to stoke racial division in America. It is worth reminding the public about the noxious lie one last time before the grumbling FLOTUS leaves office because I consider her exploitation of the incident a perfect metaphor for the Obama years — faux populism bolstered by elitist Hollywood enablers, and then cynically transformed into a phony social justice crusade for crass political gain.Back in 2012, you may remember, Obama sat down with David Letterman in one of her endless, popularity-enhancing pop culture appearances. She bragged about her ability to shop incognito at Target (does she get a secret commission every time she mentions the store?) and told a warm and fuzzy story about helping a fellow customer who didn't recognize her. The shopper innocently asked Obama to retrieve laundry detergent from a high shelf.""I reached up, 'cause she was short, and I reached up, pulled it down,"" the first lady recounted, and the shopper joked, ""Well, you didn't have to make it look so easy."" Obama beamed as she told Letterman: ""I felt so good"" doing an everyday good deed. Letterman's audience cheered at the ""first ladies, they're just like us!"" theater.Just a few years later, however, the encounter morphed into a tall tale of rampant racism, which she cunningly reshaped for People Magazine in 2014 during the aftermath of the Ferguson, Missouri riots and Black Lives Matter protests.""Even as the first lady,"" she moaned, ""not highly disguised, the only person who came up to me"" at a Target store ""was a woman who asked me to help her take something off a shelf."" The headline of the article? ""The Obamas: How We Deal With Our Own Racist Experiences."" ABC News added that Michelle Obama claimed such ""incidents are 'the regular course of life' for African Americans and a 'challenge' for the country to overcome.""Last year, Obama persisted in plying and fine-tuning her false narrative at Tuskegee University's commencement ceremony — decrying the ""sting"" of ""daily slights"" she blamed on racism, including unnamed ""clerks who kept a close eye on us in all those department stores.""Now, as she walks away with sky-high poll ratings, a glittering Rolodex, and government benefits for life, this incredibly blessed and privileged woman has the audacity to claim that ""we"" are ""feeling what not having hope feels like,"" as she whined to her well-heeled gal pal, Oprah Winfrey.So put upon. So downtrodden. So oppressed. To borrow one of Mrs. Woe-Is-Me's own favorite phrases:Bye, Felicia!You and your manufactured miseries won't be missed.

237,ABC,"Media Bias: The losers in the 2016 election have now discovered there's yet another reason for their rejection at the polls: ""fake news."" Funny, but fake news has been with us all along. It's called the mainstream media, and it's been engaged in faking news for decades.Led by Facebook social-media titan Mark Zuckerberg, progressive activists and their allies in the left-leaning online world want to crack down on what they call ""fake news"" — which essentially amounts to anything they disagree with or that doesn't comport with their progressive world view. Zuckerberg has promised to work with several fact-checking groups to find bogus stories.""We've focused our efforts on the worst of the worst,"" he said, ""on the clear hoaxes spread by spammers for their own gain, and on engaging both our community and third-party organizations.""Those ""third-party organizations"" are of clear concern, however. They include Factcheck, the Associated Press, PolitiFact, the Washington Post, ABC News and Snopes. If you look among that group for a conservative or even centrist outlet, you won't find one. In fact, Snopes, as the Daily Caller reports, ""almost exclusively employs leftists."" From what we know of the others, who are mostly what now passes as ""mainstream,"" the same is true.So you will have mostly left-wing gatekeepers deciding what's a ""hoax"" and what's true. Our guess is you will find that any story that comes from a right-of-center site will be vetted carefully, even extremely, while the usual lies spewed by the mainstream media will get little or no vetting. A clear sign that this is an attempt to shut down conservative opinion is the fact that the American Civil Liberties Union, a far-left group that purports to support First Amendment rights, enthusiastically supports it.Not only does this not remove ""fake news"" from the web, it will deeply imperil First Amendment rights and have a chilling effect on communications over the internet.We're glad to see that even the New York Times has weighed in, saying it's bad idea in an editorial.As many others have said, who decides what's ""real"" and what's ""fake""? And by what criteria? Their own subjective views of the world? Sorry, but we're not willing to hand our rights to free expression to a bunch of people who aren't entirely sure we should have those rights.It's not likely to go away. In his very last press conference, President Obama ripped into what he called ""domestic propagandists"" that passed on fake news and helped Donald Trump defeat Hillary Clinton.Speaking one day after Facebook announced its efforts to stop ""fake news,"" Obama said: ""If fake news that's being released by some foreign government is almost identical to reports that are being issued through partisan news venues, then it's not surprising that foreign propaganda will have a greater effect.""Get the big picture here? He's basically accusing those who politically disagree with him of colluding with foreign governments. Will treason accusations be next?Moreover, what he didn't say is that he, his party and the left in general benefit tremendously from the overwhelmingly leftward slant of the mainstream media — and have for decades.Since Nov. 8, the whole liberal media complex has gone into a spasm of recrimination, lashing out at those they hate most and at their lost influence. Once upon a time, they controlled nearly everything, with the exception of a small handful of conservative publications. Now the internet teems with conservative voices, and the inherent democracy of that has served as a much-needed counterbalance to the nonstop liberal rhetoric featured in the Big Media. The loss of its monopoly on the news is a big problem for the left.No, we're not for printing ""fake news"" — or lies. But we're a little concerned that many of those who will now be checking for fake news mostly passed on reporting the president's lies about ObamaCare, or on Hillary Clinton's clear negligence and falsehoods about Benghazi after four Americans died, or her 2008 campaign claim to ""landing under sniper fire"" in Bosnia in 1996, or who showed respectful reverence for mass murderer and political sociopath Fidel Castro upon his death, or any number of other false narratives and outright lies the Big Media have either propagated or let stand.Yet, suddenly, after Donald Trump shocks the world by winning an election he wasn't supposed to win, the conservative, right-leaning media on the web and elsewhere are to blame. The left has taken it a step further, suggesting that Trump and the right-wing media in some sinister way worked with Russian President Vladimir Putin to defeat Hillary. The goal is to delegitimize Trump as president, as we've noted before. It's an old Democratic trick.Well, for the record, we're all for investigating Russian meddling in our election. But the record shows that that didn't decide the outcome. And this ""fake news"" panic has nothing to do with policing the truth, but everything to do with trying to shut down balanced political debate in this country.RELATED:Clinton Email Scandal: Hillary's Hypocrisy And Media's Bias RevealedWhy Did The Polls Get It Wrong?

239,ABC,"Media Bias: The media dropped the ball during the last campaign with its overwhelmingly negative coverage of the major candidates, especially Donald Trump. That's not the conclusion of some disgruntled conservative media watchdog, but of a new report from Harvard University's impeccably liberal Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy.You know when left-of-center media watchdogs see media bias against a conservative candidate it must be really egregious. And the respected Shorenstein Center's report found that both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton took their share of hard hits by the media. But Trump came in for especially vicious treatment.""His coverage was negative from the start and never came close to entering positive territory,"" said Thomas E. Patterson, a professor of government and the press at Harvard. ""During his best weeks, the coverage ran 2-to-1 negative over positive. In his worst weeks, the ratio was more than 10-to-1. If there was a silver lining for Trump, it was that his best weeks were the ones just preceding the November balloting.""As the Washington Post noted, ""CBS had the most negative coverage and Fox News Channel the least negative, but the differences between the two were not vast.""In other words, Trump was treated with scarcely concealed contempt by nearly everyone in the media. Not only were his chances of winning the presidency ridiculed, but the very idea that the businessman-TV huckster-billionaire could add anything to the public debate over our government's many failures struck many as absurd.Average Americans picked up on the bias. A Quinnipiac University poll in late October found that 55% of likely voters said the press was biased against Trump. ""These findings suggest most voters are aware of the media shenanigans — whether journalists offer blatantly negative coverage, package their opinion and agenda as news, or conveniently overlook positive facts about Mr. Trump,"" wrote the Washington Times.In the Quinnipiac poll, only one group disagreed — Democrats. Just 20% of Democrats felt the media were biased against Trump.But the fact is, Democrats aside, even some in the media noticed how bad it was.As The Hill's Joe Concha noted on Oct. 17: ""The broadcast evening news programs on ABC, NBC and CBS covered allegations against Trump by several women who claim he sexually assaulted them for more than 23 minutes combined on Thursday night.""But, he went on, ""revelations in the WikiLeaks email dump of Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta — which included derogatory comments by senior campaign officials about Catholics, Latinos and the NAACP, sympathy for Wall Street, advocation for open borders and blatant examples of media collusion with said campaign — got a whole 1 minute and 7 seconds combined.""Ratio of negative coverage of Trump vs. Clinton: 23:1.""In print on Thursday, it was no better. The New York Times — known as the paper of record — had 11 negative stories on Trump, including one in the sports section. But zero on Clinton/WikiLeaks.""Ratio: 11:0.""Yes, it was that one-sided.But, ironically, it seems to have worked in Trump's favor. The media, who seem so savvy about communication, are all but tone-deaf about their own abysmal standing with the public.As recently as 2003, 54% of all Americans said they had a ""great deal"" or ""fair amount"" of trust in the media, according to Gallup polling data. Today it's at 32%, its lowest level ever, and falling.When the New York Times and other major news organizations admit that they have done their best to sabotage a presidential candidate, it can only add to his appeal with the general rabble. The public took the media's vitriol and hate directed at Trump as the highest recommendations he could possibly get. That's why the media, the pundits, the celebrities and even the polls were all in mass denial about Trump's chances until the very night of the election.""For many Republicans who weren't enthusiastic Trump supporters but wanted something to like about him, his refusal to give the media a free pass on their combative bias was a big thing,"" wrote Stephen Kruiser at the PJMedia website. That, by the way, is why Trump spent so much less than Hillary Clinton on his campaign. The media covered him heavy and hard, thinking it would take him down. The over-the-top, saturation coverage did just the opposite.In the coming weeks and months, you will hear much wailing, keening, moaning and gnashing of teeth from the Big Media about Trump's poor treatment of them — and how voters don't appreciate what they do. When they do, please remember: They've earned the contempt.RELATED:The Real Reason Why The Media Got This Election WrongMedia's Trump Derangement Syndrome Incites ViolenceMedia Malpractice?

240,ABC,"As President-elect Donald Trump uses Twitter (TWTR) and online video to bypass the major media, perhaps this is the next logical step: Even the media are bypassing the media.Amazon.com (AMZN) and top execs from the big four networks will join Netflix (NFLX) in skipping the Television Critics Association's semiannual press event in January, the Hollywood Reporter said Tuesday, citing sources.Amazon will join web-streaming rival Netflix, which had previously said it would not attend the event in any capacity, according to the Reporter. Meanwhile, executives from Walt Disney (DIS)-owned ABC, Comcast (CMCSA)-owned NBC, CBS (CBS) and 21st Century Fox (FOXA) will not take part in panels. CW execs will take part.Several shows will participate, though the exec events have tended to make the bigger headlines over the years.The networks reportedly are worried about the time and effort involved in taking part, especially for shows in production. Executives may not want to face a grilling from industry experts that can make or break their careers.And in an age of constant media coverage, with actors, producers and others on TV and social media frequently, content providers may feel they don't need the TCA as much to promote their shows.

241,ABC,"Dear Mr. President-elect,Everyone else is giving you advice, so why can't we? (Then again, the last time you asked for our advice, we told you over lunch that winning was not in the cards, so you might be hitting the delete button before this sentence is complete.)But here it comes. Five thoughts.1. Relax. This campaign's over. It was brutal, with haymakers start to finish (and yes, we'll say it: a few sucker punches, too). But it's over; you won against all odds. And what odds they were.The entire establishment was arrayed against you and did everything to vilify you. It was the establishment Republican Party. You were a direct threat to their fiefdoms, so they tried to destroy you. When they failed, most headed for the tall grass rather than to support you -- now, of course, while they were with you all along. Let 'em squirm.Establishment Democrats? Even better. When the swamp is drained, they're headed down the commode with the rest of the sewage, and they know it. Enjoy the scene. It will be something out of ""Night of the Living Dead,"" except in this case the zombies that have been feasting on America will be headed over a cliff.Hollywood? Academia? They won't be able to build safe spaces fast enough for this crowd. In fact, they'll probably come to you for infrastructure funding. Resist. Suggest they work out their aggressions with therapeutic wall-building.2. Laugh. Nothing infuriates the left more than to see someone who not only is not intimidated by them but also bursts out laughing at them when attacked. (See Rush Limbaugh.) Watch your popularity soar. It won't be just that supposedly ""angry"" base that will chuckle along. This will transcend your base. Your political enemies in Washington will attack you viciously and personally. Don't take the bait. Go Reagan and laugh. You will bring millions to your side. The enemy of my enemy is my friend, especially when my friend is ridiculing my enemy.3. Pick and choose your TV spots. President Obama could safely navigate TV at will because the entertainment industry unanimously slobbered over him, unlike any president in modern history. That ain't gonna happen with you. The Stephen Colberts and Bill Mahers despise you and will low-blow you at every opportunity. Refuse their invitations for appearances. More importantly, demand that no one in your administration give these leftists the time of day.That said, there are those in that industry who will poke fun at you without the ugly edge -- Jimmy Fallon, Jimmy Kimmel, etc. You've shown a thick skin with them. Keep it up. Take a page from President George H. W. Bush. No one laughed harder at Dana Carvey's devastating impersonation of him -- and that was at the White House with Carvey as his guest.4. Stop tweeting! @realDonaldTrump #itisgettingreallyold. You were right to say that tweeting is a terrific way to communicate directly with the American people. You showed your marketing brilliance by employing this weapon before anyone. It worked beautifully for you.But enough. You're the president-elect now. It's so beneath the office! It's sad! The public expects leadership and gravitas. It could be embarrassing! You don't need to use this medium. It's unnecessary! When you need to say something formally, let your staff release a statement. Want to personalize that statement? Conduct an interview. You'll never disappoint.5. Pay attention to the experts -- not. The editors at The New York Times and the Washington Post have serious thoughts on the direction your administration should take. There are profound ideas coming from seasoned political observers at PBS and NPR. I know it doesn't appear this way, but the anchors (and producers and reporters and executives) at NBC, ABC and CBS do want to help.By all means, have them in for a chat. Hear them out. Then laugh out loud while you throw them out. Watch as they pull out their cellphones on the sidewalk to furiously tweet their feelings to the world:""@realDonaldTrump hurt our feelings! #needasafespace! #whereismygriefcounselor? Sad!"" RELATED:Media Malpractice? Media Bias And The 2016 ElectionThe Real Reason the Media Got This Election All WrongGot Fake News? Biased Press Continues To Misinform Public About Trump

242,ABC,"Cardinal Health (CAH) on Monday lowered its full-year forecast due to smaller margins in its key pharmaceutical sector, but reported fiscal first-quarter profit that came in ahead of analyst estimates and restored some order to the drug wholesale sector.Shares of the Dublin, Ohio-based company rose 1.8% to 68.69 in the wake of a near double-digit sell-off on Friday, wrought by lower-than-expected earnings from rival McKesson (MCK). McKesson ended Friday's carnage down nearly 23%, and tried to mount a comeback Monday, rising 2.5% to 127.17.The third company in the drug-distribution power triumvirate, AmerisourceBergen (ABC), also got caught up in the sell-off swirl and lost more than 13% on Friday. On Monday, shares climbed 1.7% to 70.32. AmerisourceBergen plans to release earnings on Wednesday.""On the heels of McKesson's challenging 2Q last week, Cardinal's results were downright boring (thankfully),"" EvercoreISI analyst Ross Muken said in a note to clients, adding the parenthetical phrase. ""While pharma distribution missed our EBIT forecast and is expected to be weaker than originally anticipated in 2Q and for the FY, the magnitude of the cut is not as 'frightening.' ""Cardinal Health said quarterly income was $309 million. Adjusted earnings were $1.24 per share, surpassing Wall Street expectations. The average estimate of 12 analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research was for earnings of $1.21 per share.The prescription drug distributor posted revenue of $32.04 billion in the period, ahead of seven analysts surveyed by Zacks who expected $31.22 billion.IBD'S TAKE: Cardinal Health shares took a severe drubbing on Friday, gapping down drastically on competitive concerns expressed by rival drug distributor McKesson. Further, shares had been trending down since reaching an intraday high of 91.91 in April 2015. The bright side? Of the three major drug wholesalers, Cardinal's drop on Friday was the least drastic: just under 10%.Cardinal, however, lowered its full-year earnings outlook to a range of $5.40 to $5.60 per share, down from its previous guidance of $5.48 to $5.73. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected full-year EPS of $5.59, near the top end of Cardinal's new range.""The company states the segment is impacted by generic pharma pricing as the more significant factor unfavorably impacting the segment followed by reduced levels of branded price inflation, but is unclear on the competitive environment,"" Citi analyst Garen Sarafian said in a note to clients.The Associated Press contributed to this report.

243,ABC,"The coming presidency of Donald Trump and the near-certain prospect he will try to unravel President Obama's Affordable Care Act sent shares of hospital stocks into cardiac arrest in Wednesday trading, while major insurers were mixed and drug wholesalers enjoyed a revival.Most of the nation's biggest hospital operators plunged by double digits, led by the likes of Tenet Healthcare (THC) and troubled Community Health Systems (CYH). Tenet stock lost a quarter of its value, dropping to 15.21. Community plummeted by 21.6% to 4.66.The nation's biggest hospital company, HCA Holdings (HCA), fell nearly 11% to 72.16, while LifePoint Health (LPNT) plunged 13.5% to 52.80. Universal Health Services' (UHS) drop was paltry by comparison, 6.9%, but still that gouged nearly $9 out of its shares, bringing it to 119.26.Hospitals are expected to take the brunt of an expected drop in federal health care funding. The demise of the ACA, commonly known as ObamaCare, could leave millions of Americans uninsured and unable to pay for hospitalization, thus cutting into the profits of major health care facilities' operators.Mizuho Securities analysts Sheryl Skolnick and Ann Hynes said in a note to clients that Trump's victory, along with Republicans managing to retain control of the House and Senate, does not bode well for health care companies.""(A) GOP Triple Play, the worst possible outcome for (health care) stocks, is a reality,"" the analysts said in a note to clients. ""We see extreme risk of ACA repeal-replace, loss of the Medicaid expansion, a primary driver of results for both hospitals and health plans, and reversal of the many value-based regulations that promote home health care.""Insurers, however, were beginning to cut ties with the ambitious health-coverage plan even before Trump's surprise victory in Tuesday's election, so the effect on them was mixed. UnitedHealth Group (UNH) shares were down fractionally to 141.90 while Aetna (AET) jumped 4.7% to 118.02. Anthem (ANTM) was down early but swung to a gain of 1.5% to close at 128.75. Cigna (CI) shares jumped 5.5% to 135.80.Humana (HUM) surged nearly 4% to 186 as it seems the carrier's Medicare-heavy business would be largely shielded from any ObamaCare repercussions.Drug wholesalers reveled in Trump's election as it appeared they — along with pharmaceutical companies — would bask in a more pressure-free environment now that Democrat Hillary Clinton has been dispatched. Clinton had vowed to combat exorbitant drug pricing.McKesson (MCK), which fell sharply late last month on a disappointing earnings report, recovered some of that in Wednesday trading. Shares surged 8.6% to close at 141.68. The rapture extended to its main rivals, as AmerisourceBergen (ABC) also jumped more than 9.5% to 75.61 and Cardinal Health (CAH) climbed nearly 6% tp 69.25.

244,ABC,"Teva Pharmaceuticals (TEVA), Mylan (MYL), Endo Pharmaceuticals (ENDP), Lannett (LCI) and other generic-drug makers tumbled Thursday afternoon after Bloomberg reported that the Justice Department is investigating possible price collusion, with charges likely by year-end.The DOJ is probing more than a dozen generic-drug makers over whether they colluded on pricing, according to Bloomberg.Mylan issued the following statement: ""Mylan is and has always been committed to cooperating with the Antitrust Division's investigation.  To date,  we know of no evidence that Mylan participated in price fixing.""Teva Pharmaceuticals has disclosed subpoenas and is cooperating, Bloomberg added. Lannett also has received a subpoena, the Wall Street Journal said.The antitrust probe is about two years old and covers some two dozen drugs, Bloomberg said, citing sources. A grand jury is examining if executives agreed to raise prices.Teva shares plunged 9.6% to 39.17 on the stock market today, falling to its lowest levels since November 2013. Mylan lost 6.7%. Lannett crashed 26.6%, Endo Pharmaceuticals 19.5% and Akorn (AKRX) 18.1%. Taro Pharmaceutical (TARO) fell 7.3%.The DOJ collusion probe news is the latest sign that the drug industry face increasing regulatory and political pressure over prices. Hillary Clinton has vowed to crack down on drug prices, while her former Democratic rival Bernie Sanders has hit specific drug stocks with negative tweets.And the latest report hit more than just drugmakers. CVS Health (CVS), drug store giant and pharmacy benefit manager, lost 2.8%. Pure-play PBM Express Scripts (ESRX) sank 3.7%.Drug distributors AmerisourceBergen (ABC), McKesson (MCK) and Cardinal Health (CAH) all fell nearly 5%. And that followed huge losses for all three on Oct. 28, when McKesson missed and warned, citing competitive pressure on prices. McKesson lost nearly 23% that day, with Cardinal down nearly 10% and AmerisourceBergen 13%.Diplomat Pharmacy (DPLO) crashed 42% after a huge Q3 miss late Wednesday amid price concessions and lower demand for hepatitis C drugs.

245,ABC,"Federal Reserve chief Janet Yellen said the case for a rate hike is stronger now, but investors weren't sure what to make of that. Pfizer (PFE) paid $14 billion for a one-drug biotech, but shares of drugs and pharma supply chain companies sold off as Mylan's (MYL) EpiPen price hikes drew outrage. Best Buy (BBY) earnings surprised investors, while dollar stores came under pressure.For the week, the Nasdaq fell 0.4%, the S&P 500 0.7% and the Dow 0.8%. The major averages are still in sideways action. Drug stocks were big movers on Pfizer's Medivation (MDVN) deal and Mylan's EpiPen furor. Dollar stores suffered heavy losses as competition from Wal-Mart (WMT) was heating up.Fed Chair Janet Yellen said at Friday's long-awaited speech that the case for an interest rate hike has ""strengthened in recent months."" That followed other modestly hawkish statements from fellow Fed policymakers. However, Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer said Yellen's comments were consistent with a September rate increase. He saw the possibility of two rate hikes this year. Markets had already priced a Fed move, perhaps in December, but they don't expect any quick follow-upNew-home sales soared to a 654,000 annual rate in July, by far the highest since October 2007, the Commerce Department reported. The 12% rise from June surprised economists looking for a slight dip to 580,000. Luxury homebuilder Toll Bros. (TOL) confirmed that the high end of the market is prospering, reporting a 69% jump in third-quarter earnings per share, a 23.5% rise in revenue and a strong backlog of orders. Existing-home sales fell more than expected in July, though that was from June's cycle high. But applications for loans to buy a home fell to a six-month low. Toll shares soared to a seven-month high, moving above their 200-day moving average.The generic drugmaker Mylan sold off 11.55% for the week as members of the Senate and other politicians started inquiring into its price increases on its emergency allergy drug/device EpiPen. That fueled selling in drug and biotech stocks. Mylan CEO Heather Bresch, daughter of Sen. Joe Machin, D-W.V., said only a fraction of the $608 list price makes it back to Mylan, due to all the middlemen, leading shares of Express Scripts (ESRX), CVS Health (CVS) and AmerisourceBergen (ABC) to fall as well.Big pharma Pfizer agreed to buy Medivation for $14 billion in cash, snatching the cancer-drug specialist from Sanofi (SNY), which had been trying for months to acquire Medivation. Biotechs rallied Monday on the news, with BioMarin Pharmaceutical (BMRN) jumping on rumors that it was Sanofi's second choice of target. On Wednesday, Pfizer agreed to buy the antibiotics business of AstraZeneca (AZN) for $725 million plus possible future milestone and sales payments and royalties that could amount to $850 million.Oil prices may be settling into a trading range in the mid to high $40 range. OPEC members gave conflicting signals over whether they might support a production freeze, while Goldman Sachs said such a move would not ""be sufficient to support prices much further."" Meanwhile, the Energy Information Administration said U.S. crude inventories rose by 2.5 million barrels vs. expectations for a small drop. Domestic production fell slightly.The road to self-driving cars got a little more crowded as Mobileye (MBLY) announced it will partner with General Motors (GM) supplier Delphi Automotive (DLPH) to jointly develop off-the-shelf autonomous driving technology for automakers. The two companies will co-develop ""the market's first turnkey Level 4/5 automated driving solution."" Mobileye already has deal with BMW (BMWYY) and Intel (INTC) to bring an autonomous vehicle to market by 2021.Mobileye shares spiked Tuesday on the Delphi news, briefly topping a buy point. Shares rose 2.3% for the week.Tesla Motors (TSLA), which is ending its business relationship with Mobileye, introduced new versions of its Model S and X that boosts speeds and driving range, powered by an updated battery technology. Tesla said its upgraded Model S is now the fastest-accelerating car in commercial production. Tesla shares fell 2.2%, closing below the 50-day line and just above the 200-day line.Tesla partner Nvidia (NVDA) unveiled a new processor for autonomous driving, saying it's 50%-100% more powerful than other mobile processors.The beauty products retailer reported better-than-expected earnings and sales, with yet another quarter of double-digit same-stores growth. Ulta Beauty (ULTA) also raised full-year EPS guidance. But its Q3 profit range was a little cautious. Ulta shares have been on a strong run-up, so it may have been priced for perfection. Ulta shares tumbled 6% on Friday, undercutting its 50-day moving average.Workday (WDAY) reported a wider-than-expected Q2 adjusted loss. But it topped on some key metrics, including revenue, which rose 34% to $377.7 million. But shares of the cloud-based human resources software maker rose 2.5%, hitting a 2016 high on Thursday.July IPO Talend (TLND) lost an adjusted $1.84 a share, according to its late Thursday release, but the French Big Data firm later clarified that the bottom line actually met estimates for a loss of 31 cents a share after adjusting for the share count following its initial offering. Revenue rose 38% to $25.4 million, just beating. Talend sees Q3 losses in line with views, but it guided revenue slightly higher. Shares fell 4% after much bigger intraday losses.Best Buy (BBY) stock jumped 21% for the week to a 17-month high on better-than-expected sales and earnings for its fiscal second quarter, including a surprise increase in same-store sales. The consumer electronics retailer credited rising demand for wearable technology, appliances and home-theater systems for the increase. Video game and electronics retailer GameStop (GME) disappointed investors with in-line EPS and below-forecast sales.Discount retailers Dollar General (DG) and Dollar Tree (DLTR) suffered double-digit share price losses, as both reported second-quarter results that came up short of Wall Street expectations, with falling grocery prices and tougher competition hurting sales. Those results came as Wal-Mart is waging its own campaign to cut prices, a move that could draw more customers who have become more cautious with their spending.Meanwhile, the jeweler Tiffany (TIF) held to its full-year outlook, while its Q2 EPS beat views, helping to boost shares. However, Signet Jewelers (SIG), the parent of mall jewelers Kay, Jared and Zales, slashed its fiscal-year outlook, partly due to difficulties ""in the energy-dependent regions."" Those regions' economies have been hurt by cheap oil and other commodities.HP Inc. (HPQ) reported that its fiscal Q3 earnings per share minus one-time items jumped 37% in fiscal Q3 to 48 cents on a 4% decline in sales to $11.89 billion, both better than views. For the current quarter, the printer and PC maker sees non-GAAP EPS of 34-37 cents, vs. consensus for 41 cents. HP is reducing its printing supplies inventory and is deeply discounting printers to expand its installed base. Shares closed little changed after a brief Thursday morning sell-off.

Learn more about identifying bases and when to buy at IBD University.Meanwhile, Cardinal Health said that it is projecting a year-over-year profit decline in its current quarter, fiscal Q1 2017, ""in the high-single- to low-double-digit-percent range,"" due to less incremental generics program contribution and a ""large customer loss"" in its pharmaceutical distribution segment. Analyst had expected a 1% rise to $1.40 a share.In Q4, Cardinal's per-share earnings and revenue each rose 14% to $1.14 and $31.38 billion, respectively. That slightly topped views for EPS of $1.13 on sales of $31.19 billion.Pharmaceutical segment sales rose 14%, and medical segment sales grew 12%.For fiscal 2016, it expects pharmaceutical segment profit to be ""essentially flat.""

249,ABC,"Walt Disney (DIS) Chief Executive Bob Iger said Tuesday that the House of Mouse is ""aggressively investing for change,"" led by its one-third stake in streaming company BAMTech and newly announced plans to launch an over-the-top ESPN service, ""probably"" by the end of 2016.Despite more ESPN subscriber losses, Wall Street seemed happy with both the streaming news and the better-than-projected third quarter, as shares were up Wednesday afternoon, looking to close above their 50-day line.But before cable subscribers get scissors-happy and cut the cord, let's take a look at what that new service might actually include, and what it means for Disney's place in this brave new digital world.Iger stated plainly that the ESPN-branded service will be a ""complementary service to what ESPN is already providing,"" making clear that Disney wasn't planning on nicking current ESPN content.""The goal is not to take product off ESPN's current channels, but to use sports and product that ESPN has already licensed that's not appearing on the channels,"" he said during the call.If that's the case, don't expect to watch the Wimbledon championship or NBA conference finals via an over-the-top ESPN platform. Sports enthusiasts will still need a regular cable subscription (or Sling TV or Vue) for that. What the new digital sports-network service will feature, according to Iger, is licensed content from BAMTech's stable of MLB and NHL programming, plus ""college sports, football and basketball, tennis, rugby, cricket, etc.""For investors, the bright spot of this deal comes not from what sports cord-cutters might be able to access, but what the Mouse has in store for this technology down the road.""We think Disney has bought its way into a commanding position on future content viewership,"" said Macquarie analyst Tim Nollen, who upgraded Disney to outperform from neutral on Wednesday. ""BAM Tech is a premier (over-the-top) streaming technology in its own right, and Disney now has the means to connect directly with consumers.""IBD'S TAKE: Media conglomerates are searching for new ways to reel in young viewers, and virtual reality is an appealing medium. Read IBD's recent cover story for more: Disney, Comcast Pour Cash In Virtual Reality As The 'Netflix Of VR' Looms.The entertainment giant is spreading its tendrils across the digital universe, most recently adding AT&T's (T) DirecTV service as a streaming partner that will have access to Disney content.So that means that in addition to those two MVPDs (multichannel video programming distributors), Disney has streaming content on Sony's (SNE) PlayStation Vue and Dish Network's (DISH) Sling TV. And let's not forget Hulu -- Disney is a part owner -- which has its own live-streaming service launching in 2017 that will reportedly include ESPN, ABC and Disney Channel, according to the Wall Street Journal.The question now becomes: Is the Mouse spreading its digital content too thin?Anticipating that, Iger tackled the concern during Tuesday's call with analysts: ""What will be interesting is, long term, to what extent do we hold back product to put on services that are ours that we're selling direct to consumer vs. third-party distributors, but it's really premature to get into all of that because, right now, we've got kind of a best of all worlds in the sense that we're monetizing really well on multiple platforms from multiple parties.""Disney shares rose 1.2% to 97.86 in the stock market today.

250,ABC,"It may just be a sign of how freaked out the Republican Party's conservative wing is by Donald Trump: They've just named a third-party conservative challenger to The Donald, even though he won't be able to run in as many as 35 states. Why are they doing it?The candidate they found was Evan McMullin, a former CIA man and chief policy director of the House Republican Conference, which represents all Republicans in the House.Adding to the questions over McMullin's candidacy -- he'll run as an Independent -- is his employer, the House Republican Conference, which for its part says it had ""zero knowledge"" of McMullin's run, according to a statement by spokesperson Nate Hodson. The conference also said McMullin no longer works there.No doubt this was prompted by Trump's falling popularity following run-ins with the Gold Star families in recent weeks, when he should have been putting the wood to Hillary Clinton and her dismal record as secretary of state and as New York senator. As his poll ratings plunged, some conservatives obviously wanted to say ""enough!"" -- even if running a third-party candidate at this late date is quixotic, to say the least.""In a year where Americans have lost faith in the candidates of both major parties, it's time for a generation of new leadership  to step up,"" McMullin said in a statement to ABC News. ""It's never too late to do the right thing, and America deserves much better than either Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton can offer us.""At least McMullin seems to want the job. A former Mormon missionary in Brazil and refugee worker for the U.N. in Jordan, ABC reports he worked for the CIA ""in the Middle East, North Africa and South Asia, spearheading counterterrorism and intelligence operations in some of the most dangerous nations."" After working for Goldman Sachs for two years, McMullin made his way to the House, where he was a senior national security advisor to the House Committee on Foreign Affairs.But McMullin isn't the first person put forward as a replacement for Trump. Neoconservatives, angry at the insular foreign-policy stances of both major party candidates, already floated the idea of a conservative replacement for Trump, but their proposed candidate -- talented National Review writer David French -- didn't seem to want any part of it.The group backing McMullin's run is Better for America, which includes Christine Todd Whitman on its advisory board. The conservative group was founded by John Kingston, a longtime Republican conservative activist, donor and bundler with strong ties to Mitt Romney. On its website, the group claims: ""We're doing the hard work of organizing in all 50 states -- building the infrastructure for a national campaign from scratch.""But it still faces a steep, uphill electoral battle that looks, at least on the surface, impossible. Ballot Access News says that Better for America has so far only petitioned to have McMullin on the ballot in two states: ""If Better for America has the resources to complete petition drives very quickly, it could still petition for McMullin in approximately one-third of the states.""But that would still leave dozens of states out of reach. In short, it looks pretty much impossible.So, as we asked above, why are they doing it? Well, it might be that disgruntled GOP members fear a tainted legacy from Trump should he be beaten badly at the polls by one of the most vulnerable Democratic candidates in decades, Hillary Clinton. They can then be the ""I told you so"" wing of the party -- and be in a position to strongly influence the next election in 2020.Will it work? It's impossible to say. But it does underscore that Trump has a long way to go in bringing the wayward party he represents back together.

251,ABC,"It's an ironclad principle. Media coverage of the quadrennial Republican and Democratic conventions is a laboratory exercise to demonstrate how shamelessly partisan our political reporters truly are.In this topsy-turvy year, it would be obvious for the media to proclaim that the Democratic convention went much more smoothly, was professionally organized and had a greater star-power presence. As usual, the Democrats squeezed a lot more free time out of the networks. Their celebrities spoke far into the 11 o'clock news hour.Trump, on the other hand, closed with a fizzle the first two nights, featuring a (boring) general and a former soap opera star.Trump did not deliver the promised hoopla, but it really made no difference. The press was just not going to project a successful convention for the GOP. It never does.It is a metaphysical truth: The networks engage in a partisan double standard. They've done it for decades.The easiest measurement is tone. Media ""analysts"" always find the Republican convention to be overflowing with acrimony -- even hatred. This year was true to form. They can't stomach the idea that someone would say mean things about Hillary Clinton.The retired anchormen came out to carp. CBS's Bob Schieffer complained Clinton had been accused of everything, including ""the diphtheria epidemic."" On NBC, Tom Brokaw lamented the GOP was trying to ""work up a big hate for Hillary."" Over on MSNBC, Chris Matthews despised Gov. Chris Christie's speech so much he called the convention a ""brewing up of almost a witch-like ritual,"" a ""festival of hating Hillary,"" tossing in adjectives like ""bloodthirsty"" and ""blood-curdling"" to describe the delegates' cheers and applause.But say something insulting about Trump and not only is the statement not negative -- it's acceptable truth-telling. During the first two days of the DNC speakers called Trump a con man: He ""cheats students, cheats investors (and) cheats workers."" He ""rejects science"" and would take America ""back to the dark days when women died in back alleys."" He promotes ""racial hatred"" and is ""making America hate again.""Hatred, anyone?Media Research Center analysts studied ABC, CBS, CNN, MSNBC and NBC coverage from 9 p.m. till midnight on the first two nights of each convention. During the GOP convention, journalists scolded the Republicans for negativity 63 times. During the same time slot at the DNC, viewers heard only five such comments from reporters, a more than 12-to-1 advantage.The networks also betrayed their rooting interest by deciding the Republican-produced videos were untrustworthy propaganda that shouldn't be aired, while the Democrat-produced videos were fascinating entertainment. During the Republican convention, CNN only showed three Republican-made videos, none of which attacked Democrats.The Republicans' Monday-night videos attacking Democrats over the 2012 Benghazi fiasco and the Fast and Furious scandal were major presentations. CNN skipped them. But during the Democratic convention, CNN chose to air 18 of the party's scheduled videos, six times more than the GOP. The minute-to-minute count was 62 minutes for the Democrats to just 14 for the Republicans. CNN routinely showed the party-produced videos promoting star speakers, including both Obamas and both Clintons.The networks pine to invite Democrats to trash Republicans during their convention, which is just fine, except it's never the reverse. CBS aired four minutes of Hillary Clinton trashing Trump in its prime-time coverage, but it never balanced that with a Republican taking her to task in Philadelphia. MSNBC's Brian Williams promised they would balance their interviews. What was his idea of balance? They interviewed five Democrats in prime time during the GOP convention, but offered zero Republican interviews when the shoe was on the other foot.Two weeks of network coverage with this dramatic tilt underlines why the media's credibility is in the toilet. They're not even trying to be fair. They are vested entirely in the success of the Democrats.

252,ABC,"You're sitting courtside, close enough to that glossy NBA hardwood floor to high-five your favorite player. Look left, look right at the roaring crowd, and bask in the knowledge that your seat should normally cost thousands of dollars.But you're not in a maxed-out arena. Instead, the experience is taking place in the sun-bathed lobby of NextVR's Laguna Beach, Calif., office, where you feel like you're watching a basketball game from inside your television.This is the new wave of virtual reality. Not the clunky, pixelated virtual reality of yore, but one of live-streamed sports events, 360-degree news segments and interactive movie trailers in high definition that industry insiders say will deliver dazzling moments. So you can bet that old-school media heavies -- already beset by cord-cutting woes and the rise of streaming-entertainment leaders Netflix (NFLX) and Amazon (AMZN) -- want in on the action, which Digi-Capital estimates could be a $30 billion market by 2020.And despite no guarantees that virtual reality will have staying power as a new medium, the threat of losing more tech-savvy millennial viewers seems very real, giving Walt Disney (DIS), Comcast (CMCSA), Time Warner (TWX) and others a serious case of FOMO -- a Fear Of Missing Out.""It's kind of the perfect storm for VR to be rising at the time it is, because as you know, the media companies are all scrambling to figure out how do you get the millennials, the younger generation,"" NextVR Executive Chairman Brad Allen told IBD in an interview.Virtual reality has already gained traction in video games, with players heartily embracing goggle-based interactive gaming. Hardware is on sale now. Facebook (FB)-owned Oculus and Sony's (SNE) PlayStation were among those showing off their wares at the VR-dominated E3 conference in June. But aside from video games, there is still little to watch with all that fancy VR gear. Enter big media.Comcast Ventures and Time Warner Investments were among those that contributed to last year's $30.5 million funding round for NextVR. The live VR broadcaster also recently inked deals with 21st Century Fox's (FOXA) Fox Sports and Live Nation Entertainment (LYV) as it looks to bring Daytona 500 races and A-list concerts to viewers who can't make it to those venues in person.In addition to NextVR, Comcast has plunked down millions of dollars in VR startups, such as cinematic content creator Felix & Paul Studios, communication platform AltspaceVR, and VR/mixed-reality company Spaces. Come August, Comcast-owned NBC will offer viewers 85 hours of immersive, Zika-free Olympics coverage via the Samsung Gear VR headset.If the scramble to throw money at VR is any indication, big media is taking it seriously. And while other new formats like 3D TV have come and gone, VR looks less like a passing fad and should stick around, according to Piper Jaffray analyst Stan Meyers.""It's not just going from HDTV to 4K TV,"" he said in an interview. ""It's not an incremental change. It's more a transformational change, so I think (big media is) trying to be at the forefront of innovation.""Watching TV in virtual reality is indeed light years away from a regular flat-screen experience. For one thing, it doesn't necessitate a TV, but a headset like Google Cardboard plus a smartphone app like Within or Jaunt. And the potential for nabbing a viewer's full attention is appealing, particularly at a time when young people are inclined to consume content on more than one screen at a time.Strap on a headset and disappear into VR segments from Disney's ABC News in which users can, say, wander through isolationist North Korea or watch a family of elephants lumber through the grasslands in Africa.In one video, ABC News reporter Bob Woodruff plays tour guide outside a replica Eiffel Tower on the outskirts of Shanghai. Glance to the sky, and there's the so-called Eiffel, one-third the size of the real thing and enshrouded in a mix of fog and pollution. To the immediate right is a pile of black sooty stuff, beyond which lies grass and the hazy outline of a few buildings.The video is technically a 360-degree experience and not what some would call ""true VR,"" in which users are able to move freely through the virtual space. Panoramic videos, such as ABC's, keep viewers rooted to the ground. In fact, much of what is termed cinematic virtual reality doesn't allow for mobility. You also can't talk to Woodruff or pet an elephant through some VR version of yourself, but that's not to say that such a capability won't exist somewhere in the future.Regardless, the technology is impressive, and the hardware projections alone are encouraging for those hoping the market will grow. Market tracker IDC projects sales of 9.6 million VR units and $2.3 billion in hardware revenue for the year, thanks to headsets from HTC, Oculus, Samsung and Sony, with sales ballooning to 64.8 million units and $15 billion by 2020.To be sure, the U.S. pay-TV market, which Deloitte estimates will hit $170 billion this year, dwarfs VR. But alarm over the subscription TV environment, spurred by flagging subscriber figures at Disney's ESPN, sent media stocks into a downward spiral last August and made the need to adapt to a digital-first entertainment landscape ever more pressing.Not long after the summer panic, it was announced that Disney had led a $65 million round of funding in Jaunt, a maker of cinematic VR recording equipment that also has an interest in content distribution. The startup's goal is to deliver VR to paying customers.""What we like to say is ... we're trying to be the Netflix of VR,"" Jaunt Chief Business Officer David Anderman told IBD.His aim is for viewers to shell out for ""premium, professionally produced content"" in much the same way that viewers subscribe to over-the-top streaming services.Like Next VR, Jaunt is focusing on sports, music and travel, plus news and documentaries. And Anderman said even gamers, who are among the early adopters in VR, are more interested in travel and adventure cinematic content than they are in games.""People try it, they have the ... 'holy crap' moment,"" he said. ""They can't believe the content they're seeing.""And in April, Nokia said it had forged an agreement with Walt Disney Studios to provide the company with VR cameras and software.The current array of content available is still somewhat spotty, though, and less often a standalone product than a marketing supplement for another show or movie.For example, embedded in Disney's ""Star Wars"" app is ""Jakku Spy,"" a string of VR transmissions to the sandy planet from the Resistance, designed to pump up enthusiasm last year for its long-awaited seventh installment of the hallowed Lucasfilm franchise.Meanwhile, shows like ABC's ""Quantico"" and USA Network's ""Mr. Robot"" have shot scenes in VR, and Syfy International is producing five exclusively VR episodes of ""Halycon"" that can be viewed through the Oculus Rift, in addition to 10 episodes for the linear TV network. (Both USA and Syfy are owned by Comcast's NBCUniversal.)Like media peers Discovery Communications (DISCA) and Lions Gate (LGF), Time Warner has also used a taste of VR to lure moviegoers back to theaters, such as Warner Brothers' VR trailer for its summer horror flick ""The Conjuring 2.""But some viewers, while enthusiastic about VR, are not always sure what to make of big media's efforts so far. Available on gaming platform Steam is Disney Movies VR, a collection of immersive experiences available to HTC Vive users. The hodgepodge includes VR scenes from ""The Jungle Book,"" as well as a 360-degree, red-carpet movie premiere that user reviews deemed ""underwhelming"" and ""painfully boring.""""Generally, all the studios are experimenting with the medium,"" said Piper Jaffray's Meyers. ""I think they're looking forward to VR being sort of the next medium to tell stories. However, I still think we're very early on. The filmmaking process, the storytelling process using VR is very limited at this point, so it becomes more of an experience.""It will be a while -- at least five to seven years away, says Meyers -- before audiences will be able to plop down into a theater seat and watch a full 90-minute to two-hour movie in VR. But exhibitors are already prepping themselves for VR-happy moviegoers anyway.Imax (IMAX) has struck deals with Alphabet (GOOGL) unit Google to develop a cinema-grade VR camera, and through a partnership with VR content creator Starbreeze, plans to offer a ""premium VR experience"" in malls and multiplexes.""A lot of Hollywood is waking up to the reality that VR is gonna be huge, "" says Hrish Lotlikar, co-founder and chief business development officer of The Rogue Initiative.The VR entertainment company, which boasts alums from Disney, Pixar, DreamWorks Animation (DWA) and elsewhere, recently struck a deal with Michael Bay of ""Transformers"" fame to create VR content in the director's signature action-heavy style.Content aside, there are several technical kinks that still need to be worked out.Capturing a moving, immersive environment while guiding viewers through a static narrative can be a difficult thing, and the entertainment industry is still in an ""experimental phase"" with the technology, said Meyers.Then there's the sheer cost of the hardware, not to mention the physical limitations of essentially being blinded to the real world by a bulky headset, which could turn off people who prefer the relative ease of augmented reality experiences like ""Pokemon Go.""But assuming that the industry can get it right, potential money grabs lay waiting. And as Hollywood works its way up the VR learning curve for feature-length content, other VR opportunities beckon. Hungry audiences abroad, for instance, might be willing to shell out for tickets for a Steph Curry virtual reality experience.""I don't think (VR is) ever going to replace going to an event ... but a lot of times people can't get there,"" said NextVR's Allen. ""The NBA has 300 million fans in China. ... Now all of a sudden, you have a virtual ticket, and there's a courtside seat that a million people could be sitting in, virtually.""

253,ABC,"Internet television network Netflix (NFLX) scored 54 Emmy Award nominations on Thursday, an increase of 59% from last year's tally. Still, it trailed Time Warner's (TWX) HBO and 21st Century Fox's (FOXA) FX in total nominations.Premium cable channel HBO dominated the nominations on a network basis with 94 nods, but that was down from its record of 126 nominations at last year's awards. FX came in second with 56 nominations, up from 38 last year.Netflix's third-place ranking in nominations was led by 13 nominations for political drama ""House of Cards"" and six each for documentary ""What Happened, Miss Simone?"" and true-crime show ""Making A Murderer."" Comedy series ""Master of None"" and ""Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt"" earned four nominations each.Last year, Netflix received 34 nominations and won four Emmy Awards.

254,ABC,"If Hillary Clinton and her supporters figured that the email scandal had finally been put to rest when the FBI recommended that no charges be filed, they got several bits of unwelcome news this week. Not least of which is a new poll showing Hillary's support sagging in the wake of the FBI's decision.The latest New York Times/CBS poll, released on Thursday, finds that the share of people who think Clinton is not honest and trustworthy jumped 5 percentage points in the wake of the FBI's findings that she'd been ""extremely careless"" in her handling of highly confidential information while secretary of state.The poll found that Trump and Clinton were tied at 40% each, with Clinton dropping 3 points while Trump gained 3 over the past month.This isn't an outlier. Clinton's average support in all the polls taken since the FBI decision is just 40.8%. She averaged 44.9% in polls taken the month before, according to polling data from Real Clear Politics. The latest IBD/TIPP poll, conducted before the FBI's decision, showed Clinton over Trump 44-40%.Meanwhile, state polling by Quinnipiac shows Clinton now trailing Trump in key battleground states of Florida and Pennsylvania. (Clinton had led in both the month before). Two new polls show Clinton and Trump tied in Ohio.How much of this is the result of the email scandal? Potentially a lot of it. A Washington Post/ABC News poll  that found 56% disapproved of FBI Director James Comey's recommendation that no charges be brought against Clinton. Only 35% approved. Even among Democrats, nearly a third thought Comey was wrong.That poll also found that 57% said the email issue made them ""worry about how Clinton might handle her responsibilities if she's elected president.""And the email story itself isn't over. The State Department announced that it will release emails that Clinton had failed to turn over, despite her repeated claims that she turned over all her work emails. Given the troubling facts uncovered in the email that Clinton didn't try to hide, one can only imagine what's in the ones she tried to bury.Clinton's legal troubles might not be over, either. As CNN's Jake Tapper notes, Clinton could find herself in trouble for lying to Congress when she testified last October that ""there was nothing marked classified on my emails.""When asked at a House hearing about that statement, Comey said simply: ""That's not true.""We have argued in this space that the issue isn't whether Clinton broke the law (which she clearly did), but what her use of a private email server said about her fitness to serve in the White House. Our view is and has been that her unbelievably reckless handling of national security secrets, and her constant lying about it, disqualified her from the presidency.These latest poll findings show that this view might finally -- and thankfully -- be catching on with the public at large.

255,ABC,"ESPN parent company Walt Disney (DIS) has agreed to purchase one-third of Major League Baseball's digital business and take a four-year option to increase its stake to two-thirds, sources told Bloomberg.The reported deal would provide the media giant with access to an online streaming platform at a time when Netflix (NFLX), Hulu and other web-based programming have eroded its subscriber base.MLB Advanced Media, which handles online services from digital ticketing to sponsorships to live streams, says on its website that it distributes ""25,000 live events annually and 10 million streams daily,"" and that it has the resources to support ""millions of multi-platform subscribers and processes."" Paid streaming subscription services like MLB.tv and the WWE Network are MLB Advanced Media partners.The transaction with Disney is said to value the MLB company at $3.5 billion or so.Disney CEO Bob Iger has frequently been put on the defensive in recent quarterly earnings calls since last year's media market maelstrom, spurred by concern over the health of the pay-TV environment.But Disney, which also owns Marvel, Lucasfilm and the TV network ABC, appears to be exploring its online options.In the company's May earnings call, Iger told listeners that streaming service Hulu -- which it jointly owns with 21st Century Fox (FOXA) and Comcast's (CMCSA) NBCUniversal -- was an ""important investment"" and that Hulu's newly announced live-TV package was a ""best of cable approach"" between a skinny bundle and mega-cable package.ESPN has been bleeding subscribers, but its inclusion in streaming bundles -- such as Dish Network's (DISH) Sling TV and others -- could be linked to some ""very encouraging sign-ups,"" Iger said in May. Prior to that, he alluded in February to partnering ESPN with ""new platform providers.""Disney shares were up 0.2% on the stock market today. Netflix shares surged 5.7% on bullish analyst comments.

258,ABC,"War On Terror: America is in for a rough time in its War on Terror, based on what we've seen after the Orlando, Fla., terrorist attack that killed 49 people. How can you even hope to stop something like radical Islamic terrorism if you won't even call it by its right name?President Obama's response after the attacks was not only disappointing in its failure to recognize the ongoing threat from radical Islam, but likely endangered future American lives with its obtuseness. He couldn't even bring himself to use the most obvious words of all to describe what happened: ""Radical Islamic terrorism.""""I think we don't yet know the motivations"" of the murder, Obama said. Except, as Britain's Daily Mail points out, the terrorist ""pledged his loyalty to ISIS in a 911 call as he carried out the attack."" The loyalty wasn't one way: Islamic State radio called the terrorist, Omar Mateen, a ""soldier of the Caliphate.""Yet, our president, who is charged under the Constitution with protecting the nation from all enemies, foreign and domestic, seems to think that we're talking about a simple case of homophobia here. ""The fact that it took place at a club frequented by the LGBT community I think is also relevant,"" Obama said.Relevant? Well yes, given that Shariah law punishes homosexuality with death. So Mateen, the ""soldier,"" killed 49 and injured 53 others merely to fulfill this mandate by his religion. Why couldn't Obama mention that? Is he so steeped in the twisted ideology of multiculturalism that he is unable to face reality? Even Hillary Clinton was moved to use the word ""radical Islam"" in response to this sick attack. Obama wouldn't.Unfortunately, this multi-culti sickness — a form of mass delusion on the left — extends well beyond the White House.The left went into a bizarre frenzy of blaming the horrible deaths of those murdered at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando on anyone but Islamist terrorism. As our friends at the Media Research Center noted in a to-the-point headline: ""Anything But Islam: Media Attack Guns, Men, Christians, GOP Instead of Ideology in Terror Attack.""In case you're wondering, that was followed by seven printed pages of examples. So they weren't cherry-picking.Sadly, denial is everywhere in our society these days.Likely Republican nominee Donald Trump has called for a halt to immigration from Muslim lands, which has been falsely portrayed as ""racism.""He has made clear he would only keep a ban in effect until we find out just who we're letting into our country. Remember, by our government's own startling admission, we don't know if the recent refugee stream from North Africa and the Middle East contains dozens of Islamic State or al-Qaida operatives. So why wouldn't we halt the flow until we can better tell who's coming into our country?Aha, the left says, but Omar Mateen is a native-born American, born in New York. How do you keep him out? Well, you can't. But his father — an Afghani who has delivered pro-Taliban propaganda on U.S. cable television — clearly should never have been allowed in. Radical mosques that inculcate hate into young, impressionable minds should be investigated, at a minimum. Those that continue to abet terrorism overseas in the name of Islam should be closed.In April, an imam speaking at an Orlando mosque said that killing gays under Islamic law would be done ""out of compassion.""We should add that FBI Special Agent in Charge Ronald Hopper told ABC News that the FBI had twice looked into Mateen: In 2013, after he made what Hopper called ""inflammatory"" comments to co-workers, and again in 2014, after he was linked to Moner Mohammad Abu-Salha, another American who became a radicalized Muslim, who became a suicide bomber in Syria.Given that Mateen worked for G4S, a Department of Homeland Security contractor, shouldn't this have raised significant questions?One of Mateen's co-workers at G4S, Daniel Gilroy, told the Tampa Bay Times: “He talked about killing people all the time.”Yet, Mateen was interviewed by investigators three times in relation to those probes, but the FBI determined Mateen was no threat, Hopper said.Finally, on Monday, FBI Director James Comey said Mateen showed ""strong indications of radicalization"" and was likely inspired by foreign terrorist organizations.In short, he was a ""known wolf,"" not a ""lone wolf."" This is a disturbing pattern with terrorist mass murders, whether in Boston, San Bernardino or Ft. Hood, Texas. A pattern of behavior emerges, and is ignored. Ties to extremists are viewed as harmless. Then people are slaughtered.This problem will not go away. Indeed, the world has been repeatedly drenched with the blood of radical Islam's victims since 9/11 and before. As the observant Roger L. Simon noted, ""Total deadly terror attacks in the name of Allah since 9/11 stand at 28,576 with who-knows-how-many corpses.""But we're told over and over by far left that ""Islam means peace."" Until we have a president and national security officials who take the threat of radical Islam seriously, we will all be endangered.RELATEDUnder Obama: 8 Islamic Terror Attacks That Could Have Been PreventedFollow IBD Editorials on Twitter: @IBDeditorials.

259,ABC,"Stocks opened modestly higher Thursday, as the market geared up for an earnings-heavy session.Dow Jones industrial average rose 0.3% while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq climbed 0.2%.The day's light economic calendar opened with the monthly Job Cut report from Challenger, Gray & Christmas.

260,ABC,"Internet TV service Hulu announced Wednesday that it will reach 12 million subscribers in the U.S. this month, up 30% from a year ago. It also confirmed media reports that it plans to offer a live-TV service in 2017 to complement its on-demand video service.Hulu CEO Mike Hopkins made the announcements at an upfront event in New York City for advertisers.Hopkins said the live-TV service will offer news, sports and entertainment from broadcast and cable TV, but it did not detail content and pricing, TechCrunch reported.“We’re going to fuse the best of linear television and on-demand in a deeply personalized experience optimized for the contemporary, always-connected television fan,” Hopkins said.Hulu's live-TV service is targeted at cord cutters and cord nevers -- those consumers who don't subscribe to traditional pay-TV services but might be interested in a lower-cost, ""skinny bundle"" of TV channels. Hulu is looking to charge about $40 a month for the live TV package, the Wall Street Journal reported Sunday. It would compete with other live-TV streaming services, such as Dish Network's (DISH) Sling TV and Sony's (SNE) PlayStation Vue.Dish stock fell 2.9% to 46.04 and Sony's U.S.-listed shares dropped 1.1% to 23.85 on the stock market today.Hulu is co-owned by Walt Disney (DIS), Comcast’s (CMCSA) NBCUniversal and 21st Century Fox (FOXA). Disney also owns ABC, ESPN and Disney Channel; Comcast owns NBC, MSNBC, CNBC, Syfy and USA; and 21st Century Fox owns Fox, Fox News, FX and Fox’s sports channels.Hulu competes with Netflix (NFLX) and Amazon.com (AMZN) in the subscription video-on-demand sector. Like its rivals, Hulu has been increasing its original programming, most recently with shows such as ""11.22.63"" and ""The Path.""
"
261,ABC,"Netflix (NFLX) and Amazon (AMZN) video typically dominate the conversation about subscription video-on-demand, or SVOD services, but a new service from Hulu could be a game-changer that poses a threat not just to SVODs but to traditional pay-TV providers.The conglomerate-owned online streamer is developing a new subscription service that would include feeds of both broadcast and cable programs, according to the Wall Street Journal, citing unnamed sources. The service, which appears to be akin to a skinny bundle, is looking to debut in the first quarter of 2017 and would cost around $40 a month, the Journal said.The new Hulu service would include channels such as ESPN, ABC and Disney Channel, as well as Fox's sports channels, Fox News and FX, said the Journal. It also may offer cloud-based digital recording and an archive of on-demand shows.The move comes as traditional media conglomerates and pay-TV providers have been looking for new ways to appeal to viewers inclined to get their entertainment online. Dish Network (DISH) and Sony's (SNE) PlayStation each offer streaming bundles that include cable channels such as ESPN, TBS and CNN.Walt Disney (DIS), Comcast's (CMCSA) NBCUniversal and 21st Century Fox (FOXA) jointly own Hulu, and offer many of their popular shows on the platform, including ""Scandal,"" ""Empire"" and others.Following concern -- and an ensuing media-stock kerfuffle last summer -- over cord-cutters and the strength of Disney's ESPN subscriber base, Disney Chief Executive Bob Iger said in February that the company was exploring new platform providers for the sports-cable network.As the major entertainment names begin reporting quarterly results this week, investors might expect more chatter about the SVOD environment and the performance of over-the-top services such as HBO Now and CBS All-Access.CBS (CBS) reports Tuesday, while Time Warner and Fox both report Wednesday. Disney reports next week.Netflix shares closed up 3.4%. Amazon shares climbed 3.7% while Disney shares added 1.1% and Fox gained 0.3%.

262,ABC,"Get ready to grab your popcorn -- we’re now less than a week away from Netflix’s (NFLX) Q1 earnings report next Monday, April 18.In Tuesday's session, the stock was able to retake a critical level -- the 200-day line -- that it has been struggling to recapture. Can it hold above that level Wednesday?The video-streaming powerhouse’s bottom line is projected to drop 73% to three cents a share as amid rising costs for its global rollout. Netflix hasn’t seen that large an earnings decline since Q4 2012.Analysts expect revenue for the quarter to jump 25% to $1.97 billion, which would be Netflix’s fastest growth in the last four quarters.And maybe even more so than those figures, Wall Street will be looking closely at subscriber growth -- a key metric for Netflix.In Q4, Netflix's earnings and revenue beat estimates. So did its overall subscriber additions of 5.6 million, boosted by international markets. But its U.S. subscriber additions of 1.56 million missed expectations for 1.65 million new subscribers. The miss represented a slowdown in U.S. growth and sent shares tumbling over the next several weeks.Netflix may be able to redeem itself. A Baird survey out late last month points to “solid” U.S. additions in Q1, fueled by the recent launches of new seasons of original shows like “House of Cards” and “Daredevil.”Netflix itself has projected 6.1 million net additions for Q1 vs. 4.9 million a year earlier.Look for positive results to be a catalyst for the stock, which is currently trading 20% below its all-time high, reached in early December. Netflix has struggled to retake the 200-day line but finally climbed above that level Tuesday as it rallied 4.2%. Shares have risen more than 30% from their February low, hit in the wake of Netflix’s last quarterly report. (Netflix stock rose 1.5% in afternoon trade Wednesday after bigger gains in the morning.)In May, “grandfathered-in” subscribers will see a $2 price increase to $9.99 a month. One analyst sees the price increase creating a churn of just 3% to 4%, which is relatively low.One big reason why cord cutters may be unlikely to cut their Netflix subscriptions is the content. Morgan Stanley says that Netflix’s original content is now No. 1, putting it above Time Warner (TWX)-owned HBO for the first time in the six years that Morgan Stanley has been tracking the video services.Still, the company faces stiff competition from a growing list of competitors besides HBO, including Hulu -- co-owned by Walt Disney (DIS), 21st Century Fox (FOXA) and Comcast (CMCSA) -- and Amazon (AMZN) Video.Netflix’s leadership in video streaming could make it a good acquisition target for Disney -- or so said BTIG analyst Rich Greenfield in a report last week. He says that the buy would help the House of Mouse with succession planning and the erosion of its ABC and ESPN broadcast businesses.But whether or not Disney is actually interested in the move remains to be seen.Image provided by Shutterstock.

263,ABC,"Donald Trump's angry quest for the Republican presidential nomination, once considered inevitable, took a serious hit Tuesday.Ted Cruz won the Wisconsin primary. Or, more accurately, Trump lost the state vote.Cruz captured 48% of the vote and 86% of the state's 42 delegates to the July convention. Trump got only three delegates and 35%. The Ohio guy, who's won only Ohio, got no delegates for his 14%.In fact, John Kasich, who slogs on with no mathematical chance of winning the party nod, still has fewer delegates (143) than Marco Rubio (171), who gave up what seems like months ago. Trump has about 740; Cruz slightly more than 500.The Wisconsin balloting came after the worst week of the campaign for the New Yorker. It's likely a major turning point for several reasons.Most importantly, it showed the real estate mogul, who once seemed impervious to his own chronic gaffes, is indeed subject to the same rules of political gravity as non-gazillionaires, at least in the Heartland. Remember, Trump lost Ohio, too. And Minnesota. And Kansas. And Iowa. And Oklahoma.The upcoming schedule including New York would seem to favor Trump. But then not that long ago Wisconsin was a gimme for him. Now, Trump's got to win bigger to reach a convention majority.Even when Trump wins, he can still lose. Trump took the Louisiana primary vote. But because Cruz' crew is smarter on party rules and better organized -- Oh, look! -- Cruz emerged from those swamps with more delegates than the 18 Trump got for victory. The billionaire blames others. Sound familiar after seven years?Cruz supporters will argue their guy won Wisconsin himself. Cruz too, of course. It was not close, by any means. And it was a crucial step in stalling Trump's march to the required 1,237 delegate majority.Cruz retailed the state hard, as he did to win the Iowa caucus vote. Anti-Trump forces spent millions attacking him and the state's influential conservative radio hosts were near-unanimously opposed to New York values.However, exit polls reveal a different narrative. Although Wisconsin Republicans gave Cruz the statewide victory, only 65% told NBC News they'd vote for him come November. About the same abysmal general election support as Trump's 61%.While Trump's support among various GOP groups held fairly steady, an ABC News analysis found Cruz in one day far surpassed his numbers from previous contests. It seems unlikely that conservative cheeseheads suddenly realized they adored the Texan with the studied speaking style that reeks more of recitation than sincere spontaneity.Cruz' professed support soared 35 points with voters seeking experience, 25 points among those seeking shared values and 24 points with strong conservatives and those with economic concerns.Among GOP members seeking change, a Trump strong suit since the beginning last June, Trump did well again. But Cruz doubled his support with them to tie Trump at 42%, a strong suggestion that Trump support has a defined ceiling.While 60% of Trump voters professed excitement about his possible presidency, more than half of Cruz voters expressed fear of what a President Trump might do.Ominously for the Texas senator, only 25% of his voters expressed excitement over a Cruz White House, a suggestion they were expressing less support for him than opposition to Trump.Ominously for Trump, only four of ten non-Trump voters vowed to vote for him come November if he's the nominee. The rest would go third-party, support Hillary Clinton or opt out this year.Also, is this the end of Trumpmentum and the start of a Cruz wave? Late-deciders in the last month went overwhelmingly for Cruz, 54% to 25% Trump and 18% Kasich.On the Democratic side, Bernie Sanders cruised to an easy win over Clinton, taking 63% of male voters and -- Wait for it! -- splitting women evenly with Mrs. Clinton. Sanders has now won six of the last seven Democrat contests. Anyone smell smoke?RELATED:

It's time to take a break and decide my next adventure,” said Gould in a statement sent to IBD on Friday. “I have had an amazing experience working for Yahoo.

271,ABC,"President Obama nominated Merrick Garland, chief judge of the federal appeals court in Washington and one of the most respected jurists in the country, to the U.S. Supreme Court in a bid to overcome Senate Republicans’ vow to block any appointment.Garland is “widely recognized not only as one of America’s sharpest legal minds, but someone who brings to his work a spirit of decency, modesty, integrity, even-handedness and excellence,” Obama said in the White House Rose Garden on Wednesday with the judge, 63, by his side.The president emphasized that Garland, who oversaw the Justice Department’s investigation of the Oklahoma City bombing and successful prosecution of Timothy McVeigh, was strongly supported by Republican Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah when he was nominated to the federal appeals court.Republicans have said they won’t even hold hearings for Obama’s choice to fill the seat opened by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia.""I simply ask Republicans in the Senate to give him a fair hearing and then an up or down vote,” Obama said. “If you don’t, it will not only be an abdication of the Senate’s constitutional duty, it will indicate a process of nominating and approving judges that is beyond repair.""Garland choked up as he thanked the president for choosing him.“For me, there could be no higher public service than serving as a member of the United States Supreme Court,” he said, crediting his parents with instilling a sense of public service in him and his siblings.“People must be confident that a judge’s decisions are determined by the law and only the law,” Garland said. ""He or she must put aside personal preferences and follow the law, not make it.""Garland is an ideologically moderate nominee who in other contexts would have broad bipartisan appeal. When Obama considered Garland for a high court vacancy in 2010, Hatch called the judge ""terrific"" and said he could be confirmed to the Supreme Court ""virtually unanimously.""The unprecedented dispute between the White House and Senate Republicans will dominate the final 10 months of Obama’s presidency. Republican leaders say the seat, with the potential to swing the court’s ideological majority, should be filled by Obama’s successor.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, and Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, an Iowa Republican, have said they would neither hold hearings on a nominee nor schedule a vote before the presidential election in November.""A majority of the Senate has decided to fulfill its constitutional role of advice and consent by withholding support for the nomination during a presidential election year, with millions of votes having been cast in highly charged contests,"" Grassley said in a statement after Obama’s announcement.The White House has cast Republicans’ position as unprecedented brinkmanship that defies the Constitution. In the choice of Garland, Obama seeks to apply maximum political pressure on Republicans by sending to the Senate an ideologically moderate nominee with broad bipartisan appeal.The president’s overtures to Senate Republicans -- including rounds of telephone calls and a meeting in the Oval Office -- have largely been rebuffed, as Grassley has not budged on his pledge to block the Obama’s nominee.The vetting process, which began shortly after Scalia died on Feb. 13, was immediately shrouded in a partisan politics, as Democrats and Republicans weighed the impact on the presidential election. Potential candidates including Attorney General Loretta Lynch and Republican Nevada Governor Brian Sandoval asked to be taken out of consideration as Obama and Senate Republicans bickered over whether the nomination process should move forward.Obama also passed over younger justices with more potential to swing the court’s majority decidedly leftward, such as Sri Srinivasan, 49, a judge on Garland’s court, who was viewed as the favorite for the nomination in some Washington legal circles.Garland’s resume bears similarities to that of Chief Justice John Roberts. Like Roberts, Garland is a Harvard Law School graduate who clerked for federal appeals court judge Henry Friendly and later took a seat on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. Garland also clerked for Justice William Brennan and worked in the Clinton administration’s Justice Department, when he oversaw the Oklahoma City bombing case.Garland would be the oldest Supreme Court nominee since President Richard Nixon selected 64-year-old Lewis Powell in 1971.A Chicago native, Garland graduated from Harvard College. Between stints in the government, he was a partner at Arnold & Porter LLP in Washington.President Bill Clinton first nominated Garland to the D.C. Circuit in 1995. That year, Garland told the Senate Judiciary Committee that the Supreme Court members he most admired were Chief Justice John Marshall and Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes. Garland promised to try to be “as brief and pithy” as Holmes.After the Republican-controlled Senate didn’t bring the nomination up for a vote, Clinton renominated Garland in 1997. He then won confirmation on a 76-23 vote, overcoming Republican contentions that the appeals court didn’t need an additional judge. Seven Republicans still in the Senate voted for his confirmation then.Several important issues hang in the balance for the court, where Scalia served as an outspoken defender of conservative causes for three decades. With eight justices currently on the court, cases on abortion, immigration and unions could end up in a 4-4 split. In that case, lower court decisions stand but don’t set national precedents.Republicans have cast Obama’s effort to name a justice as a pivotal battle, the outcome of which would tip the balance of the court for decades to come. Grassley has said that Democrats seek only to score political points for the November elections by demanding hearings and votes on a nominee who has no hope of confirmation. He said he would not hold a hearing even if the nominee was Jane Kelly, a federal appeals court judge from his home state of Iowa.“Why all this ‘outrage’ about a hearing?” he said on March 10. “Why the ‘demands’ for a hearing that everyone knows would never result in a confirmation? It’s because the other side is committed to using this process to score as many political points as possible.”Senator John Cornyn, a Texas Republican, said the president’s choice would probably be treated like “a pinata” by the Senate.Obama considered several appellate court judges who received bipartisan backing in the past. Bipartisan support for a lower level judicial appointment doesn’t necessarily mean a smooth confirmation for a Supreme Court position.Robert Bork, who was unanimously confirmed for a circuit court position in 1982, was rejected by the Senate 42-58 for a Supreme Court position in 1987. The vacancy was eventually filled in 1988 by Justice Anthony Kennedy, a confirmation the White House has pointed to as precedent for an election-year Supreme Court appointment.If confirmed, Garland would be the third justice Obama has appointed to the bench, and the only white male. Obama also appointed justices Elena Kagan and Sonya Sotomayor, and Garland made his short list before those nominations as well. Garland’s judicial record suggests he is the most moderate judge, ideologically, that Obama considered for Scalia’s seat.On the D.C. Circuit, Garland wrote for the court in 2015 when it unanimously upheld a 75-year-old ban on federal contractors making federal campaign contributions. “The concerns that spurred the original bar remain as important today as when the statute was enacted,” he wrote.In 2014, Garland led a three-judge panel that upheld the conviction of a former U.S. House committee staff member for illegally taking World Series tickets and a visit to a strip club from Jack Abramoff’s lobbying group in return for his influence on a federal highway bill.He wrote a 3-0 decision in 2008 rejecting the government’s “enemy combatant” designation of a Chinese man being held at Guantanamo Bay, the U.S. naval base in Cuba.Garland led three-judge panels that backed the National Labor Relations Board when it ordered an Indianapolis company to reinstate workers who were fired after holding a strike to protest actions taken against a co-worker, and when the board ruled against a California lumber supply company that withdrew recognition of a union.On transparency of government actions, Garland was part of a panel that said the government could withhold pictures of Osama bin Laden’s corpse and burial at sea from public release. He wrote an opinion that ordered the Secret Service to disclose some White House visitor logs to the public.He also wrote for a three-judge panel that ruled in 2013 that the Central Intelligence Agency couldn’t decline to “confirm or deny” whether it had documents related to the government’s use of drone strikes for targeted killing. The American Civil Liberties Union was seeking the documents in a Freedom of Information Act case. Garland said Obama and other high-ranking officials had acknowledged the use of drone strikes, so an agency with the word “intelligence” in its name couldn’t claim not to know about it.“As it is now clear that the agency does have an interest in drone strikes, it beggars belief that it does not also have documents relating to the subject,” Garland wrote. “It is implausible that the CIA does not possess a single document on the subject of drone strikes.""The nomination battle has already impacted the 2016 presidential campaign, with all Republican candidates saying a new president should be sworn in before a new justice takes the bench for a lifetime appointment.Democratic candidates Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton have each accused Republicans of trying to de-legitimize Obama by blocking his Supreme Court nominee.“Some are even saying he doesn’t have the right to nominate anyone, as if somehow he’s not the real president,” Clinton said last month at the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture in Harlem.About 63% of Americans believe the Senate should hold hearings on Obama’s nominee, according to a Washington Post-ABC News poll that was released March 10, before the nomination was announced. About 32% said the Senate shouldn’t hold hearings.

Here's the cunning woman not trusted by two-thirds of her own supporters, a woman facing possible federal indictment over national security and financial tricks, and she still defeats the Donald-come-lately-Republican in hypothetical match-ups.Don't expect Trumpsters to acknowledge any of this. They go deaf to facts undermining their celebrity infatuation. And their default response is name-calling.In fact, Clinton has topped Trump in 43 of the last 50 such polls going back almost one year.In the latest ABC News/Washington Post Poll, Clinton handles Trump 50% to 41% among registered voters and 48% to 39% among those crucial independent voters. There don't seem to be quite as many disaffected Democrats as the real estate baron boasts either; she beats him among D's 86% to 9%.Asked who would win in a head-to-head, 36% say Trump, while Clinton draws 59% support, up five points just since January.Here's how lopsided the data is. Trump wins male voters by five points; she captures women by 21 points. Trump gets barely one-in-five minority votes.He owns the ""poorly educated"" without college degrees, 57% to 33%. Clinton wins voters with diplomas 52% to 37%. And she walks away with the under-40 vote nearly two-to-one.Trump even captures a smaller percentage of white voters than did the man from 2012 he calls ""a loser,"" Mitt Romney.Almost two weeks ago, Romney finally echoed Marco Rubio, calling Trump an empty con man and a disaster for the Republican Party in this fall's election and beyond. But the former party nominee didn't back up that concern by campaigning with any Trump alternative until yesterday, the last possible day, with John Kasich of Ohio.It's understandable early in a nomination process for congressional and party elders like Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan to stay out of intra-party competitions. Former president George W. Bush campaigned briefly for his brother.But now? Now, with a few exceptions like Nebraska's Ben Sasse and with the future of the GOP brand   imperiled by a faux conservative stalking horse for Clinton, they go strangely silent.Also at stake: All those crucial down-ticket races in November that could cost the GOP control of the Senate and even the House if Americans figure out that ""Make America Great Again"" is just a hat.Excuse us if after seven years of the wily Obama and out-foxed GOP Hill leadership, we've moved beyond skepticism to cynicism on this.That's actually the sort of 'leading' from behind that got their party into this feckless mess.It resembles Obama's hasty troop withdrawal from Iraq that left a tempting vacuum for ISIS. So too, emerged a vacuum from the lack of principled, stiff-spined opposition to Obama's agenda by congressional Republicans who failed to deliver on their policy promises after voters did deliver their requested majorities.Guess what? A plurality of those once-loyal voters appear to be settling now for a standard-bearer on a bozo billionaire who can't utter a complete coherent sentence, but can voice their red-faced anger with promises of more change to believe in.This presidential cycle should have been a gimme for Republicans. A field of young, diverse, accomplished conservatives going against two Democrats averaging 71-years-old, advocating even more of the lame, dishonest Obama policies that chased record numbers from the workforce and produced the worst economic recovery since World War II.Then, there's Americans' proclivity to deny the same party three straight White House terms. No wonder the GOP began with 17 candidates, now down to four, maybe fewer tomorrow.Things look so dire nowadays that experts at the University of Virginia's Center for Politics are asking an excellent, if scary question:Is the Grand Old Party headed down the same road to political extinction as the 19th century Whig Party, whose mid-century collapse into disagreeable disunity produced the new Republican Party and its first president Abe Lincoln?RELATED:

275,ABC,"It's part a lack of resources overseas and part simple disinterest at home, but the American news media seemingly are out of the business of covering international news. For example, one of the most neglected international stories is the attempt by ISIS to exterminate and persecute Christians.Instead, our media obsess over the faintest hint of domestic ""Islamophobia."" A few weeks ago, The New York Times filed a national story from Arizona with this incident: ""Rania Kanawati, a Syrian immigrant, was walking to her car after Friday prayer last month at the Islamic Center of Tucson when a beer can landed right behind her, then another one fell by her side."" The headline was ""University of Arizona Students Hurl Insults, and Litter, at Mosque in Tucson."" No one was physically hurt.At about the same time, some Christian in the Middle East was probably being crucified or set on fire.On March 4, the Associated Press reported, ""Gunmen in southern Yemen on Friday stormed a retirement home run by a charity established by Mother Teresa, killing 16 people, including four Catholic nuns."" Network coverage? Zero on ABC, CBS, NBC, PBS, NPR, CNN, MSNBC and Fox. At least The New York Times and The Washington Post offered stories, although the Post offered only 94 words.Pope Francis was right when he stated, ""They were killed by their attackers but also by the globalization of indifference.""Pressure is now mounting on the Obama administration to declare Christians as genocide victims of ISIS, an amazing thought given that there is no question but that it is underway. Just ask any Christian denomination represented there. All will speak to it. Yet this administration hasn't yet decided it is. What else might it be? More ""workplace violence""?On March 2, the House Foreign Affairs Committee unanimously passed a genocide resolution, becoming the latest body to call for a formal recognition of ISIS actions as genocide. Under the omnibus spending bill passed in December, the State Department has until March 17 to speak on a declaration of genocide. But this isn't a news story, either.If the U.S. government officially declared that genocide was taking place against these minorities, it would put further pressure on the United Nations Security Council to issue a similar declaration. That could lead to trying perpetrators in the International Criminal Court.Presidential candidates Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio and Hillary Clinton have joined this effort, but Team Obama must need to be dragged, kicking and screaming. White House press secretary Josh Earnest sounds like a defense lawyer when asked. ""My understanding is that the use of that word involves a very specific legal determination that has, at this point, not been reached,"" he explained. Two days earlier, testifying before the House, Secretary of State John Kerry also insisted ""additional evaluation"" would be needed before calling ISIS persecution a ""genocide.""In 2014, Kerry said, ""ISIL's campaign of terror against the innocent, including Yazidi and Christian minorities, and its grotesque and targeted acts of violence bear all the warning signs and hallmarks of genocide."" Somehow, against all the evidence, Kerry is backsliding.Last November, the glossy magazine of ISIS bluntly announced that its ""takfir"" against unbelievers would continue. ""It will continue to wage war against the apostates until they repent from apostasy."" They declare war against the pagans, against the Jews and against the Christians. The goal is plain: Everyone will be Muslim, and the apostates will be slaughtered.How can it be that our media are so quick to condemn America's pluralism and freedom of religion as shamefully inadequate, while they hold ISIS and other Muslim persecutors to no standard at all?

276,ABC,"Amazon.com (AMZN) is debuting a live television show that focuses on the latest trends in fashion and beauty -- and viewers will be able to shop on Amazon.com as they watch. Separately, there are hints that Amazon also has virtual reality video in the works.Named ""Style Code Live,"" the 30-minute show will debut online Tuesday at 9 P.M. ET and then repeat every day at the same time.The free offering is the first Amazon foray into live television and potentially takes aim at the likes of CBS (CBS), NBC owner Comcast (CMCSA) and ABC owner Walt Disney (DIS).Time Warner (TWX)-owned HBO offers shows on its streaming platform at the same time as it first airs them on its cable network, but it does not have live streaming offerings at the moment.The new live show adds to Amazon's growing lineup of original video streaming content that takes aim at leader Netflix (NFLX), which does not currently offer live television streaming.The new live TV show is also part of a broader effort to establish Amazon as a fashion brand, which hasn't been an Amazon strength. This year, it quietly launched several lines of Amazon brand clothing.The show itself will offer interactive features such as a live chat for viewers and will feature ""fashion hacks,"" guest experts, celebrities and viewer tips, according to the company's press release.Amazon.com stock was up a fraction in afternoon trading on the stock market today. Shares are up 20% since touching a six-month low of 474 in early February. The company has an IBD Composite Rating of 80, where 99 is the highest.Meanwhile, as virtual reality slowly lurches into the mainstream, CEO Jeff Bezos has been quietly growing Amazon's secretive VR division. Virtual reality and augmented reality blog Upload VR spotted a job posting for a senior software developer to lead Amazon's VR team, which some say suggests that Amazon Video might soon include VR options.Competing streaming services such as Netflix and Hulu have already demonstrated interest in the much-hyped VR business. Despite the interest, Netflix CEO Reed Hastings has dismissed VR for streaming video, suggesting that it was more practical for video games.The Facebook (FB) virtual reality Oculus Rift headset is expected to ship this July. It costs $599 and requires top-notch PC hardware to use.

281,ABC,"Donald Trump, long-time Republican primary front-runner, slipped into second place in two respected Iowa polls recently. Perhaps coincidentally, Trump appeared on not one, not two, but three Sunday morning shows.Trump supporters list his bluntness as a plus. They say much less, however, about Trump being coherent. Or crafting logical, nuanced arguments explaining detailed policy positions he'd carry into the Oval Office as the nation's chief executive.Watching Trump is one thing. Reading those same remarks is something else. So, here in Trump's own words, edited only for length, are extensive excerpts of his Sunday statements:On the U.S. military and terror:TRUMP: It's strength. Nobody is going to mess with us. Our military is going to be made much stronger. I mean, look at Libya. Look at Iraq. Iraq used to be no terrorists. He (Saddam Hussein) would kill the terrorists immediately, which is like now it's the Harvard of terrorism.""If you look at Iraq from years ago, I'm not saying he was a nice guy. He was a horrible guy, but it was a lot better than it is right now. Right now, Iraq is a training ground for terrorists. Right now Libya, nobody even knows Libya.""Frankly, there is no Iraq and there is no Libya. It's all broken up. They have no control. Nobody knows what's going on. They're worse than they ever were. People are getting their heads chopped off. They're being drowned."" (CNN, State of the Union)On balancing the budget:TRUMP: Well, I'd like to do it as quickly as possible and I'll be able to cut far better than anybody else and I'll be able to bring jobs back far, far better than anybody else. Nobody will be close. (CBS, 'Face the Nation')On Ben Carson:Q: Those comments about Ben Carson’s religion, Seventh Day Adventist, 'I don’t know about that.' What were you trying to say?TRUMP: I know nothing about it really. I’m a Presbyterian and I
"
282,ABC,"had mentioned that, and I did say I don’t know about it. And, in fact,
"
283,ABC,"those are my exact words. So I just really don't know about the Seventh

"

"
289,ABC,"evangelicals. But, no, not at all. I just don’t know about that
"
290,ABC,"particular religion.Q: Why raise it?TRUMP: Because I just
"
291,ABC,"said I don’t know about it. I said nothing about it. I would never say
"
292,ABC,"bad -- I’d never say bad about any religion. And as you know, in fact, I
"
293,ABC,"think you just had a quote on, I said exactly, 'I don’t know about it.' (ABC, 'This Week')On immigration:TRUMP: We have very weak rules on immigration and I’m for making them strong and solid, like a country should have. And Ben is very weak on that subject.Q: But he says you still haven’t spelled out how you can actually deport those 11 million undocumented aliens who are in the country right now.TRUMP: Yes, and through very good management that will happen, and the people that are really good and outstanding and have had outstanding records will come back in, and they’ll come back in legally. They’re going to come back in legally so we have a country.""And the bad ones, and you know there are many bad -- you have -- I have been so right on that subject, and I think it’s one of the reasons I’m leading in virtually every national poll and most, almost every state poll, frankly, including by the way some in Iowa.""But it’s one of the reasons is illegal immigration. They’ll come in legally. The ones that are bad -- and we have some real bad ones in this country -- they’re going to get out so fast your head will spin."" (ABC)On raising the debt limit:TRUMP: Well, I think what they should do is use the debt limit as a very strong negotiating tool to make other changes and to cut costs elsewhere. The Republicans don't know how to negotiate, to be honest with you. I'm a Republican. It's embarrassing to watch them negotiate.""Well, I don't want to say (how I would negotiate) and I'll tell you why: We should use it as negotiation. And the problem we have in this country, we're so predictable. Whether it's with ISIS or with Iraq or with a negotiation of a debt. Boehner should not be saying, 'We will not close' (the government) because you can't negotiate once you say that. You've given up 95% of your strength when you do that....""There is so much waste and so much fat, it's like Jeb Bush's campaign. There's waste and there's fat and he's trying to solve the problem. But, see, a person like that cannot solve the problem of the country because the country has the same problem that he has."" (CBS)

294,ABC,"On falling into second place in Iowa:TRUMP: I know that I'm very honored by what's happened in New Hampshire and South Carolina. It's amazing results, amazing.

So I'm actually surprised, very surprised that I'm even tied in Iowa. (CBS)

295,ABC,"On Hillary Clinton:Q: How are you going to be a unifier when in your campaign rallies like yesterday you said the country is going to hell if Hillary Clinton gets elected?TRUMP: Well, I think that’s true.

Our military doesn’t perform because it’s not allowed to perform, and it’s not in great shape, as you know. All you have to do is speak to the generals. It’s in probably the worst shape it’s been in in 50 years.""Our country is in serious trouble. We make deals for Bergdahl. We make the Iran pact, which is one of the worst contracts I’ve ever seen negotiated and one of the dumbest. No, our country’s in bad shape and if we have Hillary, it will just get worse.""

296,ABC,"Gun ownership is greatest among rural whites, a group whose voting power is diminishing. The conclusion, according to Adam Winkler in the Washington Post, is that the NRA will inevitably decline in power.The theory isn't new. Tom Smith, director of the General Social Survey, told me in 1997 that the large drop in gun ownership shown by his poll would ""make it easier for politicians to do the right thing on guns.""According to Smith's survey, the percentage of homes with a gun has fallen fairly continuously since the 1970s — from approximately 50% to 32% earlier this year.On the other hand, surveys by Gallup and ABC News/Washington Post show that gun ownership rates have been flat since the 1970s. The number is uncertain for a number of reasons, including people's willingness to tell the truth to pollsters about whether they own guns.The ""hard"" data that we do know is that concealed handgun permits and gun sales have soared. Concealed handgun permits tripled from 2007 to 2015. The National Instant Criminal Background Check System shows that the number of gun purchases doubled from 2006 to 2014.But while significant demographic changes have been occurring for decades, there hasn't been any steady increase in support for gun control. Indeed, the opposite is actually true.According to Gallup, 78% of voters supported stricter gun control in 1990. By last fall, that number had fallen to 47%. Look at PEW polls and you'll see that support for stricter gun control has fallen dramatically since the late 1990s. CNN's polls show a similar pattern since 1993.Most people now believe the ""More Guns, Less Crime"" hypothesis. Gallup recently asked Americans if they thought that residents are safer with a gun in the home. People answered yes by a margin of 63%-to-30%. In 2000, Americans answered no by a margin of 51%-to-35%.People are more frequently buying guns for personal protection, especially in urban areas. Last December, the Pew Research Center survey found that 57% of Americans believe gun ownership ""protects people from becoming victims of crime.""That was up from 48% two years earlier. Support for gun ownership grew especially among blacks, rising by 25 percentage points in just two years.It's not just the polls. Between 2007 and 2014, the percentage of concealed handgun permits held by blacks and other minorities increased more than twice as fast as it did for whites.The growth rate was almost twice as fast for women as for men.My research shows that blacks benefit most from concealed carry because they are relatively more likely to be victims of violent crime. The elderly benefit because they will have trouble resisting an assailant without the aid of a firearm. The same often applies to women.Gun control groups have spent hundreds of millions of dollars trying to convince Americans that gun control is the answer. In 2013, gun owners' groups — including the NRA — spent less than one seventh as much on television advertisements.In 2014, almost as much was spent pushing one gun control initiative in Washington state as the NRA spent on all elections in the country.All that spending didn't work. Those ""inevitable"" demographic changes didn't result in a collapse in support for gun rights. Lott is the president of the Crime Prevention Research Center and the author of ""More Guns, Less Crime"" (University of Chicago Press, 2010, 3rd edition).

297,ABC,"Netflix (NFLX) does a pretty good job at picking original shows that get good reviews from critics, but it's still not as good at it as Time Warner's (TWX) HBO is.Entertainment news website Exstreamist did a study of shows by six major TV networks to see which does the best at green-lighting critically acclaimed original programs. It used data from Rotten Tomatoes, which aggregates reviews from media critics, and looked at non-reality prime-time shows from 2013 to the present.HBO ranked first, with original shows getting an average score of 79.65% positive reviews. HBO is the home to ""Game of Thrones,"" ""Veep,"" ""True Detective"" and other shows.Netflix came in second with an average score of 71.5% positive reviews. Netflix has such popular shows as ""House of Cards,"" ""Marvel's Daredevil"" and ""Narcos.""Last month, HBO trounced Netflix at the 67th annual Emmy Awards. HBO won 43 Emmys vs. four for Netflix.Walt Disney (DIS)-owned ABC was third in the Exstreamist study with an average score of 67.18% positive reviews. ABC is home to such well-received programs as ""Modern Family"" and ""How to Get Away with Murder.""CBS (CBS) ranked fourth with an average score of 65.5%. CBS airs such top-rated programs as ""The Big Bang Theory"" and ""The Good Wife.""Fox, owned by 21st Century Fox (FOXA), came in fifth place with an average score of 63.84%. Its shows include ""The Simpsons,"" ""Gotham"" and ""Empire.""Bringing up the rear in sixth place is Comcast (CMCSA)-owned NBC. It had an average score of 59.5% positive reviews, or a little better than a coin toss, for picking good shows. Its programming lineup includes stinkers like ""The Mysteries of Laura"" and ""The Player.""Has No 'Secret Sauce'While Netflix is doing well with the critics, favorable reviews don't always translate into big viewership.Netflix executives say the company has an edge in choosing which shows to produce because it can mine its user database for insights.But Morgan Stanley analyst Benjamin Swinburne doubts Netflix has a ""secret sauce"" for picking hit shows.""Netflix is like any other network, with hits and misses, and we do not expect its data advantage to provide it with a better batting average,"" Swinburne said in an Oct. 12 research report.Meanwhile, Netflix's first original movie debuted both online and in theaters starting Friday. ""Beasts of No Nation,"" which stars Idris Elba, earned 90% positive reviews, according to Rotten Tomatoes. But the African war drama was a bust at the box office, where it earned just $50,699 from 31 theaters in its first weekend.Netflix says it wants to provide a home for the type of movies that studios no longer make: prestige films and mid-budget star vehicles. By releasing the movie in theaters, not just for streaming, ""Beasts of No Nation"" is now eligible for the Academy Awards. The movie has reportedly been getting Oscar buzz.RELATED:Netflix experiences trouble on the home frontHow Netflix's DVD business is like the baby in 'Trainspotting'.

298,ABC,"AT&T (T) and CenturyLink (CTL) are vulnerable to further broadband market share losses vs. Comcast and other cable TV firms, says Morgan Stanley, based on customer dissatisfaction in areas where copper-based DSL broadband service is available.While cable TV firms — including Comcast (CMCSA), Charter Communications (CHTR), Time Warner Cable (TWC) and privately held Cox Communications — already dominate the broadband market, there's still upside for them, Benjamin Swinburne, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, said in a research report.Swinburne says that cable TV firms should also target the pay TV customers of satellite broadcasters DirecTV Group and Dish Network (DISH), which currently resell DSL services from phone companies. Morgan Stanley surveyed 2,500 U.S. households during August and September on broadband and TV services.""U-verse and AT&T DSL had especially weak satisfaction results, and satellite pay-TV subscribers' broadband satisfaction fell materially year over year,"" said the Morgan Stanley report. ""For cable broadband, satellite TV households remain an opportunity.""Cable customers reported an average speed of 38 megabits per second (Mbps), while DSL subscribers said they had 21 Mbps service on average. Verizon Communications (VZ) FiOS customers on average had nearly 30 Mbps service and were happier, despite price hikes, says the Morgan Stanley report.There's also good news in the survey for media firms (Walt Disney (DIS), CBS (CBS), 21st Century Fox (FOXA) and Comcast-NBCUniversal) that own broadcast TV networks ABC, CBS, Fox and NBC.""Seventy-five percent of pay-TV respondents ranked the broadcast networks as one of the top three most important channel groups in their bundle. On average, only 25% of total respondents ranked any one cable network group in their top three,"" said the report.Comcast and Apple (AAPL) are expected to anchor their ""skinny"" TV bundles, programming packages with fewer channels, likely including the broadcast networks.Follow Reinhardt Krause on Twitter @IBD_RKrause.

300,ABC,"While most of America was transfixed by Game 7 of the World Series, Fox News Channel was doggedly pursuing a new story: The FBI's probe into pay-for-play schemes at the Clinton Foundation and the State Department has been far more expansive than anyone reported so far and has been going on for more than a year. FBI sources even warned there could be indictments down the road.Then, The Wall Street Journal broke another new story online, saying, ""Secret recordings of a suspect talking about the Clinton Foundation fueled an internal battle between FBI agents who wanted to pursue the case and corruption prosecutors who viewed the statements as worthless hearsay."" Senior officials wanted to tell FBI agents to ""stand down"" from a Clinton Foundation probe.That's two nuclear explosions in one night. What was the reaction from the news media? Crickets.The stench of corruption between the Justice Department, the State Department and the Clinton Foundation machine is noxious. Add the leftist ""news"" media collusion and it becomes overpowering. This is a cover-up.No one at ABC, CBS or NBC was breaking from the World Series. They couldn't locate the Clinton story and offer even the briefest summary the next morning. MSNBC's Mika Brzezinski offered a serious report early on ""Morning Joe,"" but she was alone. The other ""news"" programs preferred the distraction of breathless baseball updates.The worst moment came on ABC's ""Good Morning America,"" where they acted like the story did not exist. Political analyst Matthew Dowd noted a scandal story might still break. ""So, anything can happen in that regard,"" he said. Sounding totally oblivious to the breaking news, co-host George Stephanopoulos replied, ""We'll see if some big news comes out.""At taxpayer-funded National Public Radio, ""Morning Edition"" found anything and everything else more interesting and ""newsworthy,"" including — we're not kidding — ""teen night owls"" who need later school start times and the perils of the illegal kidney trade in Pakistan.The network blackout so far on this FBI probe is beyond the pale. Everyone knows what the media reaction would be were there a report about indictments related to the Trump Foundation. There would be an immediate flash mob of reporters camped in front of Trump Tower, breaking away from regularly scheduled programming and offering play-by-play commentary. Anyone denying the double standard is lying.This is just the latest Clinton scandal scoop out of hundreds over the last 24 years that the networks have skipped or downplayed or just dismissed as toxic waste. This is why an overwhelming majority of Americans tell pollsters it's obvious the media are undisguised Hillary boosters. Their credibility is shot with the public.Within 18 hours, MSNBC's Andrea Mitchell was bizarrely denying there was any story or any investigation worth noting.

301,ABC,"As Walt Disney (DIS) Chief Executive Officer Bob Iger's scheduled retirement date looms closer, the entertainment giant's search for his replacement remains low-profile, a departure from the open process it previously employed.It's been seven months since heir apparent Tom Staggs' abrupt departure left Iger without a clear-cut successor. The top executive recruiting firms say they haven't been hired by Disney, and Iger hasn't moved members of his executive team into newer or more prominent roles to audition them for the top spot. The company has said only that there is a process in place that the board is following, which will include evaluating internal and external candidates.While there's still time to conduct a search before Iger's contract ends in June 2018, the quiet nature of the current succession planning stands in sharp contrast to the widely watched, five-year bake-off from which Staggs emerged as the leading contender for the job. That's fueling speculation that the board could request that Iger, 65, stay on longer than his scheduled retirement date, something it has already asked of him twice before.""I don't think anyone — employee, investor or director — would be hesitant in granting him a new contract,"" said Anthony DiClemente, an analyst at Nomura Securities in New York. ""That could happen quickly and easily. Why hasn't it happened already? That's a fair question.""Iger said on a May conference call with investors that he didn't have any plans to stick around past the current date.""The board is very actively engaged in a succession process, as it has been actually for some time,"" he said. ""It believes that it has ample time to identify a successor under timing circumstances that will be just fine for the company.""A spokeswoman for Disney declined to comment further. Disney board members on the governance and nominating committee, including former Starbucks (SBUX) CEO Orin Smith, Twitter (TWTR) CEO Jack Dorsey, Facebook (FB) Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg and former Clorox (CLX) Chairman Robert Matschullat, didn't respond or declined to comment.Typically it takes a big public company six to seven months to complete a search once the board begins to contact and interview prospective candidates, though additional time is required before that, said Peter Crist, chairman of Crist Kolder Associates, a boutique search firm outside Chicago. ""We do lots of mapping projects with the company that take months"" about the qualities it wants and needs in a new CEO, Crist said.At Wal-Mart Stores (WMT) executive recruiter Spencer Stuart began consulting with directors about what the company needed in a new leader and who they should consider about a year before Doug McMillon was named the retailer's CEO in November 2013, according to people familiar with the situation who asked not to be identified because they aren't authorized to talk publicly. The board narrowed its search to two internal candidates, McMillon and former head of U.S. operations Bill Simon, about six months before making its final decision.At Procter & Gamble (PG), directors first started talking about replacing then-CEO Bob MacDonald in July 2012 and then asked A.G. Lafley to return as CEO and chairman in May 2013. Lafley, who'd already served as CEO at P&G from 2000 until 2009, immediately reorganized the company into four businesses, each headed by a president who was considered a contender for the CEO post. One of the four, David Taylor, was named global president of home care and subsequently also took charge of P&G's beauty business.In July 2015, Lafley and P&G's other directors named Taylor the consumer giant's new CEO, concluding the two-year process.Iger himself was promoted in 2005 after a six-month search by the board. The executive, who had led Disney's TV operations and international business and had served as president for five years, was evaluated against external candidates with help from Heidrick & Struggles, directors said at the time. He got the top job only after a high-profile campaign by some shareholders to oust then-CEO Michael Eisner. Former directors in a long-running feud with the company still criticized Iger's selection as hasty, but the board said it had been thorough and careful.Until this year, it looked as if Disney's choice for Iger's successor would be more orderly, with a seasoned executive waiting in the wings in the COO position. Staggs had risen to the No. 2 spot at the company after a five-year period in which he and another senior manager, Jay Rasulo, competed with each other to become Iger's successor. The two even switched jobs to give Staggs more experience operating a business and Rasulo exposure to the executive suite. Rasulo, then serving as chief financial officer, left the company last year after Staggs' promotion to COO.Staggs' exit, after failing to gain the full backing of Iger and the board, left no other internal candidate with both operational experience and a corporate role.Of the six CEOs since Disney's founding in 1923, only Eisner came from the outside. Eisner, who served from 1984 to 2005, joined the company from Paramount Pictures, where he was president.While the board contemplates who will lead the company after June 2018, Iger remains active in planning how to shape Disney's future. In recent weeks, he considered buying Twitter, but decided to pass, partly because of price and partly because of concern about bullying on the social-media site, people familiar with the matter said last month.At an October event in Boston, Iger said it wasn't enough for the company to own key brands like ABC, ESPN and Pixar. Disney needs to have a direct connection to consumers through mobile devices, he said.""What we're thinking about a lot is what role does technology have in distributing from us to the consumer?"" he said. ""How must we invest in that?""In its search for Iger's replacement, Disney's board should be casting a wide net, looking for candidates inside and outside the company, particularly ones with high-tech chops, said Paul Winum, a senior partner at the management consulting firm RHR International and co-author of ""Inside CEO Succession.""""The landscape is changing so rapidly, technology is opening up new distribution platforms, overseas markets will be  huge opportunities,"" he said. ""The leadership skills have changed dramatically just in the last two years.""When a CEO succession plan unravels, as it did at Disney, the company usually starts thinking about the next, younger generation of executives inside, giving them bigger and different kinds of experience to prepare them for the top job, said Joseph L. Bower, a Harvard Business School professor who has studied succession planning. Disney hasn't made any major changes recently to suggest it's grooming anyone internally, however.""Disney isn't in trouble and currently has a strong CEO in place,"" Bower said. ""But you don't want someone to come in at the last minute to take over.""

302,ABC,"Investment bank Goldman Sachs (GS) is trying to persuade Apple (AAPL) to make a competing bid for entertainment giant Time Warner (TWX), the New York Post reported Saturday.Telecom firm AT&T (T) announced on Oct. 22 that it intends to buy Time Warner for $85.4 billion in cash and stock. Including Time Warner's debt, the deal has a total transaction value of $108.7 billion. The acquisition would bring the parent of HBO, CNN and Warner Bros. studios under the umbrella of the wireless and wired communications firm.The New York Post said Goldman Sachs is upset that it was left on the sidelines of the massive deal.Apple reportedly approached Time Warner about a possible merger a few months ago before AT&T became a suitor, the Wall Street Journal reported.Apple stock fell a fraction to 113.54 on the stock market today.Apple has long had ambitions to shake up the television market, but its efforts so far have underwhelmed. It has tried to put together a best-of-cable streaming video service, but has encountered resistance from content providers.Apple's exposure to the TV market today is limited to its Apple TV set-top box and its iTunes video download service.IBD'S TAKE: Apple stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 73, meaning it has outperformed 73% of stocks in key metrics over the past 12 months. For more information on Apple stock, visit the IBD Stock Checkup.Last week, Apple announced a cross-platform TV app that aims to simplify how people experience television. The app, called simply ""TV,"" provides a unified experience for discovering and accessing TV shows and movies from multiple video apps on Apple devices. It works on the Apple TV set-top box, iPhone and iPad. The TV app can respond to spoken requests using the Siri voice-activated personal assistant program.The TV app will be available as a free software update for supported devices in December, Apple announced Thursday.Apple wants users to access live and on-demand video programming through its TV app. But not all video services are supported. For instance, Netflix (NFLX) and Amazon.com's (AMZN) Amazon Prime Video are not available through the interface.""The Apple TV app won't include Netflix or Amazon in its search results,"" Phillip Swann, president of TVPredictions.com, tweeted after Apple announced its TV app. ""That's like TV Guide launching in the 1950s without CBS and ABC in its programming listings.""Pacific Crest Securities analyst Andy Hargreaves said Apple's TV strategy is ""flawed"" and ""needs a reboot.""Apple's current strategy is to use the TV app to drive its iOS device sales, he said in a research report Thursday. But if Apple wants to make a big impact in the internet television market, it will need to offer its own subscription service, Hargreaves said.""Apple's best opportunity to dominate consumer engagement and create a massive business in video is with an extraordinary service that operates effectively on all internet devices (but probably a little better on its own),"" Hargreaves said. It could either start a multichannel pay television service or offer its own subscription video-on-demand service.Apple CEO Tim Cook likes to say that the future of television is apps, but Apple wants people to use just one app — Apple's new TV app, UBS analyst Steven Milunovich said in a report Thursday.The TV app aggregates content from other sources, such as HBO and Starz, in one place and makes it accessible across iOS devices.""The TV app enables Apple to control the user experience, an important aspect for keeping users within the Apple ecosystem,"" Milunovich said. ""It seems the company would rather own the platform and the user experience than the content.""Apple's TV app could cause friction with content providers because it doesn't offer branded channels, Piper Jaffray analyst Gene Munster said in a report Thursday. Instead, content on the app is organized by specific TV shows and movies.Also, cable TV services might not like the idea of Apple becoming the gatekeeper for their offerings. The TV app bypasses pay TV program guides and sends viewers right to the shows they want, using voice commands and customized viewing lists.RELATED:Apple Unleashes Redesigned MacBook Pro, New TV AppConsumer Groups Knock AT&T-Time Warner MergerAT&T CEO On Time Warner Deal: Aiming To Set Pace In Innovation

303,ABC,"It was a huge week for earnings. Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL) were A-list headliners, but a slew of industrials, medicals, restaurants and more also reported. Tesla Motors (TSLA) reported a surprise profit, while Qualcomm (QCOM) will buy NXP Semiconductors (NXPI).The Nasdaq fell 1.3% for the week, with Amazon's miss and Apple's modest beat failing to impress. The tech-heavy index dropped below its 50-day line after retaking that level last week. The S&P 500 sank 0.7%, while the Dow rose 0.1%. Bonds continued to fall around the world, pushing the 10-year Treasury yield to multimonth highs.In the September quarter, Apple earned $1.67 a share, down 15% year over year, on sales of $46.85 billion, down 9%. Analysts expected Apple to earn $1.66 a share on sales of $46.94 billion. For the holiday quarter, Apple guided Wall Street higher on revenue, but its profit margin outlook came up short. Apple also unveiled new MacBook Pro notebook computers, which feature a touch-screen strip for application commands and shortcuts that replaces the function keys. Apple fell 2.5% for the week, but remains above its 50-day line.Amazon reported Q3 earnings of 52 cents a share, a big gain but well short of estimates for 78 cents. The e-commerce giant plowed money into its Amazon Web Services cloud computing unit, along with a big expansion of fulfillment centers heading into the holiday season. Revenue rose 29% to $32.7 billion, meeting views. AWS was among the bright spots in the earnings report as revenue rose 55% year over year to $3.23 billion, beating the consensus. Q4 revenue guidance also lagged. Amazon shares fell 5.2% Friday, closing below its 50-day line for the first time in months.Q3 earnings per share minus items rose 23% to $9.06 while total revenue climbed 20% to $22.45 billion vs. consensus estimates of $8.60 and $22.05 billion. Google-parent Alphabet signaled higher investments in its  cloud computing business and higher Q4 marketing costs tied to the September launch of Pixel-branded smartphones and a smart home speaker that competes with Amazon's Echo. Google's Q3 net revenue — despite higher traffic acquisition costs (TAC) costs of $4.18 billion — was $18.27 billion, topping views.Alphabet shares nearly hit a record high Friday morning, but closed the day fractionally higher and the week fractionally lower, but still in buy range.Tesla Motors earned 71 cents a share excluding items, soundly beating the consensus estimate of a 54-cent loss. Revenue climbed 45% to $2.3 billion, up 45% and topping estimates of $1.977 billion. Elon Musk had pushed Tesla to boost deliveries and turn a profit in Q3, but some analysts are skeptical that the effort is sustainable. Tesla maintained its guidance of 50,000 vehicle deliveries for the second half of 2016, with a Q4 plan of just over 25,000.Tesla and SolarCity (SCTY) late Friday were expected to unveil an integrated product offering of solar panels, battery storage and charger. Tesla is in the process of buying SolarCity. Elon Musk is the top shareholder in both companies, as well as SpaceX.Tesla found resistance at the 50-day line and reversed, ending the week down 12 cents at 199.97. SolarCity climbed 2.7%.Gigamon (GIMO) reported third quarter profit and revenue that blew past estimates and raised current quarter guidance. Santa Clara, Calif.-based Gigamon said Q3 EPS minus items rose 64% to 36 cents, while revenue jumped 47% to $83.5 million. Analysts had projected 31 cents and $79.6 million. In the current quarter, Gigamon forecast EPS of 37 cents and revenue of $92 million at its midpoint of guidance vs. consensus estimates of 33 cent profit and 29% revenue growth to $86 million. Analysts say AT&T (T) may be a new customer, joining T-Mobile US (TMUS).Gigamon shot up 16.1% Friday, hitting a record high intraday. Shares had fallen 5.2% Thursday to below its 50-day line.Lumentum (LITE) said Q1 EPS rose 69% to 44 cents and revenue climbed 19% to $252.3 million, topping expectations but current quarter revenue guidance was light amid a telecom component shortage from an unnamed supplier. EPS guidance of 51 cents at the midpoint was above consensus estimates of 49 cents. Lumentum fell 3.7% after its late Thursday report, but that followed a 4.3% fall Thursday as Acacia Communications (ACIA) crashed 16% that day and for the week. Chinese telecom gear giant ZTE, a key Acacia customer, reported weak revenue.Qualcomm announced a deal to buy NXP Semiconductors for $39 billion, creating the No. 2 chipmaker by revenue after Intel (INTC). Including debt, the deal is worth $47 billion. Mobile-communications chipmaker Qualcomm said the acquisition will expand its footprint into key growth markets, including automotive, Internet of Things, security and networking. The Qualcomm-NXP transaction marks the biggest semiconductor deal ever, surpassing Avago Technologies' $37 billion purchase of Broadcom (AVGO).New Oriental Education and Technology (EDU) met fiscal Q1 EPS views with a 15% gain to 90 cents. Revenue climbed 16.5%, above analysts' expectations, as enrollment boomed. The IBD 50 stock sees Q2 revenue above analyst guidance.

Same-store sales tumbled 21.9% as fast-casual burrito chain still struggles to recover from late 2015 food-borne illness outbreaks. Shares fell 9% Wednesday, hitting a 3-year low. Panera Bread (PNRA) beat views, sending the stock higher intraday Wednesday, but reversed lower, falling to an eight-month low on Thursday. Buffalo Wild Wings (BWLD) met EPS views and missed on sales, but shares rose 6% Thursday from recent lows.Food delivery services provider GrubHub (GRUB) reported that EPS rose 73% and revenue 44%, both topping. But Grubhub's active diners rose by 19%, missing estimates slightly. Shares, which had been near an 18-month high, fell nearly 13% on Wednesday, tumbling below its 50-day line.Biogen (BIIB) posted $2.96 billion in sales and $5.19 EPS ex items, topping views and prodding shares up nearly 4%. Thursday, Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) rose 5%, Celgene (CELG) 7% and Alexion (ALXN) 9% after beating on earnings. Amgen (AMGN) late Thursday beat, but shares tumbled nearly 10% Friday amid concerns about key drug Enbrel going forward. Also Friday, Novo Nordisk (NVO) dived 13% and Sanofi (SNY) rose 4.3%, as the European drugmakers had different views on the outlook for insulin treatments.Meanwhile, drug distributor McKesson (MCK) crashed 22.7% Friday after a big miss, blaming rival AmerisourceBergen (ABC) for heavy competition and further pressure from political attention on drug prices.

While Apple is said to be keen on including live broadcast networks NBC, ABC, CBS and Fox, its plans for cable TV channels such as Discovery (DISCA) are not clear.""While the market, at the moment, is hyper-focused on the risks from pay-TV subscribers shifting to smaller channel bundles and outright cord-cutting, we are less concerned with this risk, particularly as it relates to CBS,"" Kraft wrote.CBS has been among the first to adopt a direct-to-consumer model among media firms, launching its own stand-alone Web streaming products, including broadcast TV and movie channel Showtime.Kraft expects upside for CBS shares generally. He set a price target of 60 on the stock.CBS was flat in midday trading in the stock market today, near 43.50.Kraft wrote: ""We see an inflection point in EPS growth with limited risk to estimates because cost pressures are abating, ad revenue expectations are achievable with catalysts benefiting the next year, Showtime's OTT service should become an earnings driver in 2016, (advertising) scatter pricing is strong in Q3, CBS is significantly undermonetizing the pay-TV ecosystem, and CBS is best positioned to grow from a shift toward smaller bundles and new entrants (Apple).""

334,ABC,"On the same day last weekend that the IBD/TIPP tracking poll showed Donald Trump with a 2-point lead over Hillary Clinton in a four-way matchup, the ABC News tracking poll had Clinton over Trump by a huge 12-point margin.In this, one of the strangest presidential campaigns in modern U.S. history, the polls in part reflect both the confusion and the division in America. Who's right?The ABC News poll is not a radical outlier. The RealClear Politics average for the most-recent major polls gives Hillary Clinton on average a 48.0% to 41.9% lead over Donald Trump, a comfortable 6.1-point margin.News stories suggest that, based on these polls and perhaps her own internal polling, Clinton is coasting and focusing instead on helping Democrats win seats in Congress.For daily updates until the election and full details, including demographic breakdowns of results, follow the IBD/TIPP Presidential Tracking Poll.For instance, the Washington Post, New York Times and online political site Politico report that the Clinton campaign was keen on claiming a large enough margin for a mandate, and is already looking beyond the election.But that 12-point margin may be a chimera, says IBD/TIPP pollster Raghavan Mayur.""Think back to 2008 and 2012, when Obama won,"" said Mayur. ""He had a 7.2 percentage point margin in 2008 and a 3.6 percentage point margin in 2012. And those were elections where people were greatly excited about him. And still, that's not 12 percentage points, even combined.""""There is nothing like that excitement at the margin for Hillary Clinton,"" he added. ""So a 12-point victory just doesn't look plausible.""And remember, in polls enthusiasm — excitement — matters. In the current IBD/TIPP Poll, Trump holds a 67% to 61% edge in ""intensity of support."" Whose followers will show up on voting day?When you pull apart the polls, you can see where the differences lie — and the similarities.Mayur notes for instance that, in recent days, the Los Angeles Times Poll and the IBD/TIPP Poll have fairly similar data when it comes to women voters.The IBD/TIPP Poll has a 46% to 38% lead for Hillary Clinton over Donald Trump, while the L.A. Times has a 49% to 39% lead for Hillary Clinton over Trump. Basically very similar.The ABC News Poll, on the other hand, reports a 55% to 35% lead for Clinton among women in its tracking survey — a 20 percentage point difference.They can't all be right. But most of the polls can be wrong.As evidence for that, we only have to go back to June of this year, and Britain's vote on Brexit, the June 23 referendum to have the U.K. either leave or remain in the European Union.Starting in January, the majority of polls foresaw defeat for those who wanted to leave. Over nearly six months, out of 115 polls tallied by the Financial Times' Poll of Polls, just 54 showed that the ""leaves"" would beat the ""remains."" That's less than half.And of the final 10 polls taken just before the vote, just three showed the ""leaves"" winning. The average for the Poll of Polls on the eve of the election was 48% ""remain"", 46% ""leave."" So everyone expected ""leave"" to go down in flames.The final poll given in the FT's list, just before the election, was one by a group called Populus. It showed the ""leave"" losing by a whopping 10 points. It's fair to say that, among Britain's knowledgeable elites, confidence was high that Britain would ""remain.""But they were all wrong.The actual vote on June 23: 52% ""leave,"" 48% ""remain.""This should perhaps be a cautionary tale for those who call names and cast aspersions on the honesty of polls they disagree with. No pollster is ever 100% correct. But polls do ultimately have to be reconciled with reality.Tracking polls are exactly what they suggest: A reading of likely voters based on near-term data. It says how the election would probably turn out, based on that day's data gathering. It is not a prediction.IBD/TIPP is fairly transparent. The typical poll is intended to have between 750 and 900 respondents, a random sample of registered voters. Those are then further winnowed by identifying likely voters, as opposed to just registered voters, through both targeted questions and demographics of the respondents.The Oct. 24 poll is pretty typical: It yielded 815 likely voters with a margin of error of plus-or-minus 3.6 percentage points at a 95% confidence level. That means, based on the sample, there's a 95% certainty that the ""true"" support levels for the candidates are within 3.6 percentage points of the reported results.TechnoMetrica, IBD's polling company, conducts the survey by telephone. It uses both landline and cellphones, with about 35% coming from landlines and 65% coming from cellphones. All of the interviews are done live — no ""robocalls"" or other dodgy techniques that might bias the outcome.The numbers are not reported raw. They are adjusted to match the presumed registration percentages of the political parties. That way no party is systematically underrepresented. The same is done for race, gender, region, and party affiliation.This ensures a more accurate end result than simply relying on raw poll responses. On party affiliation, the presumed mix is as follows: Democrats 37% of likely voters; Republicans a bit over 29%; and independents at 34%.In the end, that latter category may be key. IBD/TIPP in its latest poll has Trump ahead among independents and ""other"" by 41% to 32%. That's much wider than most other polls, and one possible explanation for why the poll differs from others.Polls are, by their very nature, approximations. They use a wide variety of means to guess what literally tens of millions will do, based on just a small sample. Sometimes that yields very big differences, as it has this time.What about political bias, as some darkly allege? Well, no pollster wants to be wrong. If any poll is really out of whack, it's likely because they missed something in their polling — not political bias.RELATED:Could Trump Pull A Brexit-Style Surprise In November?IBD/TIPP Presidential Election Tracking Poll: Latest ResultsIBD/TIPP Tracking Poll: The Most Accurate Presidential Poll In AmericaIBD/TIPP Poll Results And Analysis

335,ABC,"The media industry is ""likely one more deal away from potentially reshaping the landscape for at least a decade,"" said Barclays analysts in a lengthy dissection of the entertainment and telecom sectors following confirmation of the $85.4 billion merger of AT&T (T) and Time Warner (TWX).But there are a number of other scenarios in play, especially with CBS (CBS) and Viacom (VIAB) being forcefully nudged toward merger talks by Sumner Redstone's National Amusements, and even reports of Disney (DIS) potentially being interested in Netflix (NFLX).Could the latter be the landscape-changing deal?The House of Mouse, which owns ABC, ESPN, Marvel, Lucasfilm and has an investment in streamer BAMTech, is missing a key direct-to-consumer business, in Barclays' view, and its streaming efforts aren't coming soon enough to help offset ESPN's subscriber-loss issues.Streaming heavyweight Netflix would significantly bolster Disney's distribution and technological capabilities, Barclays said.But such a combination is unlikely, according to media reports. And comments from Disney CEO Bob Iger about the complementary, supplemental nature of an online ESPN-branded channel point to the conglomerate wanting to keep its premium cable network a sports destination and a valued cable-bundle component.""We have no misconceptions about how disruptive the deal could be to the Disney culture given a potentially toxic mix of Hollywood and technology mindsets having to coexist,"" said Barclays. ""However, we believe if there was ever a time to take this risk, it would probably be now given that technology players are for the first time outlining a real vision around video instead of the small scale experiments thus far. ""It added that such a merger would be ""a defining moment for the media industry,"" bringing together the top media company and the original streaming disrupter and potentially ""reshaping the industry for decades into the future.""Shares of Disney closed up 0.4% at 93.37 on the stock market today, falling just short of their 50-day after and hitting resistance at that key level of support for a second straight session. Netflix dipped 0.1%, after jumping 3.4% Friday, when news of the AT&T-Time Warner deal broke.IBD'S TAKE: Is Netflix still a tech company or a media company? The answer to that question may affect any price tag for Netflix as the two sectors converge.But a Disney-Netflix deal isn't the only move that would reshape the industry.Barclays sees a not-too-distant future, five to seven years in the making, in which three or four vertically integrated media conglomerates fight for share among themselves and online competitors.""With Comcast (CMCSA) getting into wireless and AT&T getting into content, Comcast's and AT&T's business models may become indistinguishable in the coming years, especially if 5G makes fixed wireless video delivery a real possibility,"" said Barclays.""We believe Charter (CHTR) and Verizon (VZ) are the other two companies that have the opportunity to reach this end state given their scales in wireline and wireless, respectively.""RELATED:Consumer Groups Knock AT&T-Time Warner MergerHow Aggressive AT&T Has Out-Maneuvered Verizon, ComcastNBCUniversal Doubles BuzzFeed Bet As Old Media Seeks New GrowthNetflix Countersues, Slams 21st Century Fox 'Involuntary Servitude'Disney, Salesforce Didn't Bid On Twitter Because Of 'Haters'

336,ABC,"Google has signed up its first broadcasting content partner -- CBS (CBS) --  for a web TV service set for an early 2017 launch.The over-the-top (OTT) market is expected to heat up with new offerings from AT&T (T), Amazon.com (AMZN), Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google and Hulu. What differs in this new wave from earlier Internet video services is the expected inclusion of more live broadcast content. Most OTT services have featured on-demand programming.Google has gain edrights to all of CBS' content, including live NFL games, Reuters and the Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday. CBS has marketed its own stand-alone, direct-to-consumer, web TV service.IBD'S TAKE: The new ""Unplugged"" OTT service will be part of Google's YouTube platform. Google has not disclosed YouTube's profitability or revenue. Read this IBD in-depth report about YouTube's mysterious financials.AT&T is expected to launch DirecTV Now this quarter. AT&T has leveraged satellite broadcaster DirecTV's programming deals to cobble together an Internet video service. But AT&T has not finalized deals with CBS and 21st Century Fox Entertainment (FOXA), analysts say.""The Google deal is understood to pay CBS a rate card premium to its traditional (pay-TV) services,"" said Stifel analyst Benjamin Mogil in a report. The deal does not include Showtime movies and TV shows, he said.Google reportedly is in talks with  21st Century Fox and Walt Disney (DIS), owner of broadcast network ABC.Dish Network (DISH)  launched SlingTV, its OTT service in early 2015. Sony (SNE) offers PlayStation Vue, a high-end option.AT&T is expected to price its DirecTV Now service at around $50 to $55 monthly. Google's ""Unplugged""-branded service may be priced lower, say reports.Hulu is a joint venture of Disney, Fox, and Comcast (CMCSA). Time Warner (TWX) recently bought a 10% stake in Hulu.Apple (AAPL) last year shelved its web TV service as talks with programmers stalled.

337,ABC," How many more broadcast bust-ups will it take before America finally decides to make its presidential election debates tolerable again? I can't take it anymore. Can you?For the past three cycles -- 2008, 2012, and 2016 -- I've chronicled the depressing, systemic bias of left-leaning partisans whom the Commission on Presidential Debates routinely installs as ""moderators."" It would be one thing if these activists posing as journalists were upfront about their political preferences. But they continue to star in phony debate theater wearing their dime-store costumes of objectivity.The even bigger farce? Masochistic Republican Party bosses let them get away with it year after year after year.Note to President Obama: This is not ""whining."" This is truth-telling. I find it rather rich that the complainer-in-chief who spent two terms incessantly attacking Fox News and conservative talk radio is now wagging his waggy-licious finger at anyone else who bears grievances against hostile media and its enablers.In 2008, the Commission on Presidential Debates allowed liberal PBS anchor Gwen Ifill to serve as unfettered moderator for the sole vice presidential debate. As I reported at the time, Ifill had failed to disclose before the event that she had a book coming out on Jan. 20, 2009 -- a date that just happens to coincide with the inauguration of the next president of the United States -- titled ""Breakthrough: Politics and Race in the Age of Obama.""The promotional material left no question about Ifill's perspective. She hyped Obama's campaign as ""stunning"" and marveled at his ""bold new path to political power."" She also used her access to author a hagiographic pop culture piece for Essence magazine about the Obama family.When asked to respond to criticism about her ideological and financial conflicts of interest, Ifill acted like a true-blue leftist and played the race card.This year's vice presidential debate ""moderator"" didn't fare much better. Billed as a ""historic"" choice because of her Filipino heritage, Elaine Quijano was a historic doormat for Clinton's babbling running mate, Tim Kaine. Her media cheerleaders, led by The New York Times' Nick Kristof, naturally invoked the gender card to defend her embarrassing passivity.Another ""diversity"" moderator, Telemundo celebrity journalist Maria Celeste Arraras, known as ""the Katie Couric of Spanish TV,"" soaked up nearly half a CNN GOP primary debate earlier this year representing ""the Latino community"" on issues such as Puerto Rico's bankruptcy.2012, of course, was the year of Bitter Candy -- CNN's Candy Crowley. She notoriously injected herself into the second debate (a town hall debate that was supposed to spotlight citizens' questions) by arguing with then-GOP nominee Mitt Romney about Benghazi and running interference for Obama.Crowley was just the latest Democratic plant at a CNN-sponsored election debate. The network has a long history of passing off partisan operatives as ""ordinary people"" and ""undecided voters"" during town halls while failing to disclose their political affiliations to viewers.Moreover, there's no telling how many CNN contributors are acting as moles for Democratic campaigns. We know of at least one. This week, CNN host Jake Tapper was forced to admit that a WikiLeaks-published email showing CNN contributor and DNC head Donna Brazile had tipped off the Clinton campaign in advance to town hall questions was ""horrifying.""And four years ago, we also endured the spectacle of Clinton adviser-turned-ABC newsman George Stephanopoulos pushing the Democrats' ""war on women"" propaganda by pressing Republicans on a nonsense contraceptive ban.Yet, the debate commission and the Republican National Committee keep drawing from the same tainted well of cloistered media personalities. Establishment journos Anderson Cooper of CNN and Martha Raddatz of ABC News were repeat moderators this year -- with disastrous results. Raddatz, another left-wing PBS alumna and Beltway fixture, created her own bitter Candy moment at the second presidential debate last week when she lost her marbles over Syria and scrapped with Donald Trump over Syria. He was right to call the townhall charade a ""one on three"" battle.Actually, ""one on three"" is not quite accurate. As the Center for Public Integrity revealed this week, a whopping 96% of the nearly $400,000 in presidential campaign donations from ""people identified in federal campaign finance filings as journalists, reporters, news editors or television news anchors -- as well as other donors known to be working in journalism"" has gone to Hillary Clinton.Wham! There's your fact-check of the year, my fellow journalists. I'm looking at you in particular, Washington Post reporter Chris Cillizza. Annoyed by mounting social media criticism of liberal reporters tilting their coverage, he tweeted this week: ""Let me say for the billionth time: Reporters don't root for a side. Period.""Denial ain't just a river in Egypt. It's the fuel that sustains the Fourth Estate's undeserved superiority complex and monopoly over the debates. What would be so wrong with allowing open, transparent, informed partisan journalists from all sides of the political aisle a bite at the presidential debate apple? Abandon the pretenses. Put all the ideological cards on the table. Make the debates honest and tolerable again.The problem isn't the partisan press. It's the poseur press.
"
338,ABC,"In the election cycle dominated by Donald Trump, it should not be much of a shock that the first October Surprise came from ""Access Hollywood."" In a 2005 outtake, Trump told then-""Access"" co-host Billy Bush how he could rudely grab women's genitals and get away with it because ""when you're a star, they let you do it. You can do anything.""They say it was a recent discovery. No media October Surprise there. No, siree.Smelling Trump's blood in the water, the Clinton-enabling press sprung into action. None of them seemed to reflect for 5 seconds about how Trump could be describing Bill Clinton's modus operandi. Trump talked as Clinton did. The press' moral outrage was as phony as Hillary Clinton's. ""This is horrific,"" Clinton shamelessly tweeted. ""We cannot allow this man to become president.""The women who were actually harassed by Bill Clinton were never offered any support from Hillary Clinton, or her feminist army in the press. In February of 1994, Paula Jones held a news conference to accuse Bill Clinton of exposing himself and requesting oral sex in a hotel room in Little Rock, Arkansas. Other than 16 seconds on ABC, the media decided that wasn't news ... until Jones filed a lawsuit and the Clintons hired a lawyer three months later.But the Jones case vanished from the press and played no significant role in the 1996 presidential campaign. There were 11 network stories during the entire election year. Half of them were perfunctory notices of legal claims, and the other half focused on the Republican National Committee making an ad mocking Bill Clinton for claiming that he couldn't be sued because he was on ""active duty"" as commander in chief. Once Clinton was safely re-elected, a few establishment media outlets decided that maybe there was something to this Jones thing.The lawsuit eventually led to the deposition of former Clinton intern Monica Lewinsky, so the story became a huge, national nightmare — in part because both Bill and Hillary Clinton claimed for months that Lewinsky was lying. When the story broke, Hillary Clinton even said on ABC that Lewinsky misunderstood that Bill Clinton is just ""a happy, friendly, loving, kind, good person."" He ""reaches out to all kinds of people.""ABC enabled that. No laugh track. No skepticism. It was gullible to a fault.The emergence of Lewinsky led to other women who said that Clinton assaulted them. In March of 1998, Ed Bradley interviewed Kathleen Willey on CBS ""60 Minutes."" Willey said the president fondled her breast and put her hand on his crotch during a 1993 Oval Office visit. Willey had been begging for a job. The Clinton team quickly put out letters Willey had written Clinton to erase the idea that she was assaulted, and the story vanished. A federal judge ruled in 2000 that the Clinton White House violated the Privacy Act with that disclosure. The Big Three TV networks gave that ruling 66 seconds combined.This pattern was even repeated with Juanita Broaddrick, who declared in a ""Dateline NBC"" interview in 1999 that Clinton raped her in a Little Rock hotel room in 1978 (""You better get some ice for that,"" he told her after). On the evening newscasts, CBS aired one story, and ABC and NBC did nothing — even though NBC secured the interview!When Trump invited these women to the second presidential debate, guess what the networks did. They attacked Trump for going ""personal.""So ask yourself this question: How many times since 1994 have TV interviewers asked Hillary Clinton what she did or didn't do to smear these women? Try and find (SET ITAL) one (END ITAL) occasion.As repugnant as it was, Trump's offense was words. The Clintons' offenses were actions.The cynicism boggles the mind.Bozell is the president of the Media Research Center. Graham is director of media analysis at the Media Research Center and executive editor of the blog NewsBusters.org.

339,ABC,"For too long, environmental activist organizations have unfairly inflicted huge economic harm on businesses by spreading misinformation and unfounded fearmongering. They are engaging in economic warfare on an international scale.Alas, too often businesses have made the strategic mistake of avoiding engagement to limit the damage of the attacks. It is time businesses go on the offensive and use every lever available to expose and stop this massive, well-coordinated and dangerous fraud.An outstanding example of how unfairly-attacked companies should respond is Resolute Forest Products, the world's largest producer of newsprint. It has courageously and boldly led the charge in fighting back through the courts. Others should follow suit.In 2013, Resolute filed a defamation suit against Greenpeace in Ontario, Canada Superior Court which is still making its way through the court system there. Then this May the company filed a federal racketeering suit against Greenpeace in the United States.According to the U.S. lawsuit, ""Greenpeace and others working with it have aggressively targeted Resolute's customers with extortive threats and other illegal conduct. To identify those customers, Greenpeace employees and agents have impersonated Resolute employees, its customers, and others to illegally misappropriate proprietary customer and supply chain information.""The damage Greenpeace has done to Resolute is undeniable. After a Greenpeace intimidation campaign, Best Buy dropped the company as its paper supplier. Greenpeace had gone so far as to tell its activists to write a ""false product review on Best Buy's website. Be creative and make sure to weave in campaign issues!""Greenpeace's own numbers estimated that it has done at least $100 million (Canadian) in damage to Resolute's bottom line.""We have an obligation to our business ethics, and our many shareholders, customers, partners and stakeholders to draw the line after all other means have been exhausted,"" Resolute President and CEO Richard Garneau said when the company filed the racketeering lawsuit.Bravo! All other companies should take the same stance. To ignore or accommodate these extremist organizations is to surrender to them. Companies owe it to their shareholders, their employees — and indeed to civilized society — to stop these malicious economic attacks. And the sad reality is that for far too long businesses have ceded the battle in the so-called court of public opinion and allowed the activists to frame the debate.Take the extremist greens' completely unscientific crusade against genetically modified organisms (GMOs). Both the National Academy of Sciences and the World Health Organization have stated unequivocally that foods containing GMOs have never been found unsafe for human consumption. In June, more than 100 Nobel laureates signed a letter urging Greenpeace to drop its anti-GMO campaign because the scientific research proves beyond a doubt that GMOs are not harmful.Yet despite the mountain of evidence which absolutely prove GMOs are safe, Greenpeace and other groups continue to convince the public that GMOs are a threat. A recent ABC News survey showed that only a third of Americans believed foods containing GMOs were safe.It is even harder to win over the public when governments cowardly collude with activists. On the very day in March when more than a dozen state attorneys general accused Exxon-Mobil of ""fraud"" and ""deceiving the American people"" on climate change, New York's attorney general, who led that news conference, met secretly with environmental activist organizations to discuss how they could attack oil companies.Email records show the New York AG's office urging activists ""to not confirm that you attended or otherwise discuss the event"" if reporters come calling.Exxon-Mobil won the first round in its fight against these coordinated state attorneys general in getting the truth-ignoring ringleader of this assault, who hails from the U.S. Virgin Islands, to withdraw his unreasonable subpoena. It should continue to take the fight to the other states that are coordinating with the green activists.Resolute Forest Products is awaiting the response to its racketeering suit against Greenpeace before the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Georgia, but has already shifted the debate away from the Greenpeace messages against it to focus on the illegal activities being undertaken for the primary purpose of harming its bottom line.Unfortunately, there are many other examples of environmental activists putting this same playbook to work.  Whether it's their ""Our Forests Aren't Fuel"" campaign against the wood pellet industry ""in spite of the fact that (the industry) is helping the EU and UK meet their carbon reduction standards"" or the coordinated efforts to force public institutions and pension funds to divest their fossil fuel related stocks ""even though many of those investments have historically enjoyed among the biggest returns for their investors and their beneficiaries.""Sometimes, even the cover of the playbook can be tainted. That was the case when Al Gore was criticized for including a doctored photo of the globe on the cover of his book, ""Our Choice: A Plan to Solve the Climate Crisis."" The cover incorporated an image with a reduction in the amount of visible polar ice as well as some artificial hurricanes pasted in, just to be sure readers were adequately alarmed.In the court of public opinion, businesses often tend to make decisions based on ethical considerations and codes of conduct, as well as legal limits to which the activists do not feel the same obligation. The activists will say and do almost anything to inflict economic harm on their targets. The legal system remains the ultimate venue to address these attacks.But companies should also be more aggressive in pushing the truth with the court of public opinion. I am encouraged by Resolute and Exxon-Mobil drawing the line and taking the fight to the environmental extremists. It is time more businesses stand up for themselves and their shareholders, fight back and force the activist environmental groups to pay a price for their corrupt behavior.

368,ABC,"Jim Henson's Muppets revolutionized puppetry. Frustrated by the limitations of traditional puppets, Henson made his creatures more lifelike, gave them memorable personalities and used them to make learning fun for kids. And he promoted a better world as he entertained adults.

"
371,ABC,"Rise In Mississippi
"
372,ABC,"Henson (1936-90) was born in Greenville, Miss., to a U.S. Department of Agriculture scientist and a practical Southern belle, both with a good sense of humor. His maternal grandmother, called Dear, often visited; she taught Jimmy to sew, draw and paint, and encouraged him to read books like Frank Baum's ""Wizard of Oz"" and newspaper comics such as ""Pogo.""
"
373,ABC,"Dad's jobs caused the family to move between the farms of Leland, Miss., and the Washington, D.C., suburb of Hyattsville, Md.
"
374,ABC,"Jimmy spent much time in movie theaters and listening to radio shows such as one starring ventriloquist Edgar Bergen and his dummy, Charlie McCarthy.
"
375,ABC,"Then in 1950, the Hensons bought a TV set.
"
376,ABC,"The D.C. area had four stations, and one of Jimmy's favorite programs was ""Kukla, Fran and Ollie,"" with Burr Tillstrom's puppets.
"
377,ABC,"Near the end of Henson's senior year of high school, the local CBS TV station hired him and a friend to manipulate marionettes on a new children's show. Henson knew nothing about puppetry but checked out books from the library to teach both himself and his friend.
"
378,ABC,"Three weeks later, the station canceled their program. Its host hired them for another one where they used puppets to lip-synch to records; it lasted two months.
"
379,ABC,"Meanwhile, Henson had caught the eye of a producer at the higher-rated NBC station WTOP — and soon was puppeteering again. His work involved interacting with a country singer who told stories of the frontier and showed scenes from Westerns.
"
380,ABC,"Henson stayed there until 1961.
"
381,ABC,"All the while, Henson was in school. He graduated from high school in 1954 and entered the University of Maryland. He studied set design, costuming and commercial art, which he hoped would lead to a job at a TV show.
"
382,ABC,"One of his classmates was Jane Nebel, who would become his business partner and wife.
"
383,ABC,"Over the next few years, Henson developed puppets that were easier to move and had more expressive faces. As early as 1954, he referred to them as Muppets to differentiate them from traditional hand puppets and marionettes.
"
384,ABC,"Jim And Jane
"
385,ABC,"He and Nebel began working together and found that if they watched tiny TV monitors, they could see what the audience liked and react accordingly.
"
386,ABC,"They began doing segments on NBC's ""Tonight Show"" in 1956, and the visibility brought them advertising work. Their first client made specialty coffee and had them shoot 180 commercials that were so funny, fans said they watched TV less for the programs than the ads.
"
387,ABC,"Henson, at 21, still didn't think puppets would be his long-term career; they were a way to pay bills and get experience working in TV.
"
388,ABC,"Then he turned over his duties to friends while he went to Europe for a few weeks. He was stunned to find that puppetry there was popular with adults on a sophisticated stage of puppets, sets, stories and audience interaction.
"
389,ABC,"""It was as if those few weeks in Europe had opened a creative floodgate — for what followed would be a period of enormous experimentation and artistic growth as Jim pursued a wide variety of interests and began to play with other forms of media,"" wrote author Brian Jay Jones in ""Jim Henson: The Biography.""
"
390,ABC,"Work And Marriage
"
391,ABC,"In 1958, Henson and Nebel formed Muppets Inc. (of which he owned 60%). The next year, they married.
"
392,ABC,"In 1960, they earned an astounding $100,000 (worth $750,000 today) from their puppetry and commercial creations.
"
393,ABC,"Henson finally got his college degree. He and Jane had their first child, Lisa, bringing her along to their first convention of the Puppeteers of America. There, he met Tillstrom, who introduced him to Bernie Brillstein, a talent agent who would become a major factor in Henson's success.
"
394,ABC,"In 1961, Jane bore their second daughter, Cheryl, and retired from performing. Henson auditioned replacements and began building a crew of superstar talent, including Frank Oz and Jerry Juhl.
"
395,ABC,"Henson hoped to land his own network show and knew that to have that shot, he had to be in New York City. So the family moved there from Maryland in 1963, the same year son Brian was born.
"
396,ABC,"Henson's big break came in 1968. The nonprofit Children's Television Workshop asked what was now called Henson Associates to help create a program on Public Broadcasting Service TV stations.
"
397,ABC,"The result was ""Sesame Street.""
"
398,ABC,"Henson's goal was to educate in such an entertaining way as to hold the attention of kids.
"
399,ABC,"He expected the series to last 13 weeks. Little did he know.
"
400,ABC,"The first episode aired in November 1969 and was a hit from the start, with characters such as Big Bird and Bert and Ernie becoming household names.
"
401,ABC,"A 1996 survey revealed that 95% of American kids had watched ""Sesame Street"" by the time they were 3, and over 1,000 studies have been done on its impact. The program has won 159 Emmy Awards, far more than any other, has been broadcast in 140 countries and recently partnered with cable network HBO for a cash infusion after donations to CTW declined.
"
402,ABC,"As Henson's empire expanded in the 1970s, he maintained the same easygoing persona, sugarcoating any criticism of employees in the gentlest way while insisting on perfectionist standards.
"
403,ABC,"""He was working in a very collaborative medium, so he would put ideas out there and hope others would respond to his creative vision,"" said Lisa Henson. ""He enjoyed their innovative solutions and the teamwork needed to push projects to the next level.""
"
404,ABC,"Recalled Oz in a 1996 documentary, ""Henson's Place: The Man Behind the Muppets"": ""He was quiet and unassuming when you met him, but he also had this steely determination to succeed. That enabled him to create more popular characters than anyone since Walt Disney.""
"
405,ABC,"Yet TV networks, which didn't see an adult audience for puppets, turned down Henson's two pilots for what was to become ""The Muppet Show.""
"
406,ABC,"Lew Grade of Associated Television in Britain was more optimistic. In 1976, he began airing the first of 120 episodes. The show went into endless syndication in America, won four Primetime Emmys and led to a series of feature and TV films, starting with ""The Muppet Movie"" in 1979.
"
407,ABC,"Henson found himself commuting from London to Toronto (where the popular TV series ""Fraggle Rock"" was shot) to New York to Los Angeles and back.
"
408,ABC,"The absences from his family took a toll. In 1982, Jane filed for divorce, though they remained close. 
"
409,ABC,"In 1989 he returned to U.S. TV with ""The Jim Henson Hour"" on NBC, mixing light Muppet material with more adult themes. Critics liked it, but the show was canceled after just 13 episodes due to low ratings, which Henson blamed on the network's constant rescheduling.
"
410,ABC,"He was negotiating with Walt Disney (DIS) to sell his company for $150 million so that he could concentrate on the creative side when he died at 53 from a streptococcal bacterial infection.

416,ABC,"Politics: The president's global warming tour in Alaska has been a hit with the media, which are always ready to fawn over him. It has some problems with reality, however.The Associated Press reported Tuesday that President Obama ""stared down a melting glacier ... in a dramatic use of his presidential pulpit"" — and, no doubt, super powers — ""to sound the alarm on climate change.""Meanwhile, NBC gushed that ""Obama's Arctic Visit Buoys Climate Refugees"" and ABC was happy to report on his ""adventurous day in Alaska.""But it was all theatrics and stage craft, as some media outlets acknowledged, to set the tone for the upcoming climate talks in Paris.Included in the theatrics was a lot of fiction. Obama pointed out melting glaciers and rattled off the points written for him by someone else as if he were the author of the profound string of words.The message: Humans are burning so much carbon-dioxide-emitting fossil fuel that the planet is warming from the greenhouse effect — and they have to stop.What a colossal waste of time, effort and resources. If Obama wanted to visit Alaska as part of his official duties, fine. But a trip merely to yammer about man-made global warming is a trip that shouldn't have been made.Climate change exists. There's no denying it. Always has. Always will. Glaciers recede and sea levels have varied through the centuries. No denying these, either. The question is: Why do these things happen?The political left wants to blame human activity so that it can appropriate advanced Western economies and regulate lives. But it cannot say with any degree of certainty that man is causing his planet to overheat.There are too many climate variables and too much history of climate change before man began to burn fossil fuels as he does today to blame humans.Natural climate cycles cannot be discussed, of course, because they confirm the skeptics' position. Researchers who dare are punished with a loss of grant money.David Dilley, a former National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration meteorologist, says that ""strong-arm politics"" and grant money ensure that the public hears only the alarmist side in what he believes ""will likely end up being one of the greatest scandals of the 21st century.""Rather than warming, Dilley says Earth has begun a cooling phase, part of the warming-cooling cycles that occur every 220 to 230 years. He could be wrong, too. But at least he's not blaming the cycles on man.

417,ABC,"Bias: Hewing to their corrupt anti-cop narrative, the Big Three news networks refuse to cover Black Lives Matter activists chanting death threats within hours of a cold-blooded police execution linked to their movement.While ABC, NBC and CBS covered the deadly ambushing of a white Houston sheriff's deputy by a black man, who sneaked up behind the uniformed officer at a gas station and fired 15 bullets at close range, they left out the related news that Black Lives Matter protesters shortly thereafter demonized cops as ""pigs"" and called for them to ""fry.""Even so, some of the networks blasted the deputy's boss for tying the racist assassination to the violent anti-cop rhetoric spewed by Black Lives Matter agitators.""Over the weekend, Harris County Sheriff Ron Hickman made controversial statements linking the crime to the Black Lives Matter movement,"" the CBS Evening News scolded. ""Some have called the statement insensitive,"" though no critics were ID'd.Here's what's really insensitive: Turns out that Black Lives Matter borrowed their chant from the anti-cop ""pigs in a blanket"" rhetoric of the killer of two NYPD officers in December. Before ambushing and shooting the cops as they sat in their patrol car, Ismaaiyl Brinsley said that he was taking revenge for what jurors and even the Obama Justice Department deemed the justified police shooting of Michael Brown.""I'm putting wings on pigs today. They take 1 of ours ... let's take 2 of theirs,"" Brinsley wrote on Instagram, alongside a photo of a silver handgun. ""This may be my final post ... I'm putting pigs in a blanket.""Also missing from the mainstream media's coverage: the Democratic National Committee's issuing of a new resolution in support of the Black Lives Matter movement.That's right: the DNC just passed a resolution praising the belligerent group: ""Whereas we hear the 'Black Lives Matter' cry . .. be it resolved that the DNC joins with Americans across the country in affirming 'Black Lives Matter' ... as they condemn extrajudicial killings of unarmed African-American men ... at the hands of the police.""The Democrat Party's statement of support goes on to exalt Michael Brown while echoing Black Lives Matter's calls for ""demilitarization of police, ending racial profiling (and) criminal justice reform.""Given that four cops have been murdered in the past seven days, this is a scandalous political development. The media elite ignored it to protect fellow Democrats.It's clear that the media are trying to paint a one-sided picture of the interaction between the black community and police in this country. By twisting the facts and burying hard truths, they're feeding into what has become a very real and dangerous war on cops.

432,ABC,"Scandal: Hillary Clinton says if she wins the presidency, it might be a good idea for former President Clinton to cut his ties to the Clinton Family Foundation. Good idea? A new IBD/TIPP Poll suggests that average Americans are way ahead of her on this issue.""I don't think there are conflicts of interest"" with having former Bill Clinton run a foundation that raises money around the world during her campaign, Hillary Clinton said in an interview with ABC News on Tuesday. Americans, it seem, would disagree.Average people have a far less benign view of what's gone on at the Clinton Foundation. And it looms as a major problem for Clinton as she pursues the presidency.In our latest IBD/TIPP Poll, taken the week of Aug. 26 to Sept. 1, shows that Americans are increasingly wary of the Clinton Foundation's questionable practices, which IBD has written about extensively. The poll of 934 adults has a margin of error of +/- 3.3 percentage points.The ups and downs of the Clinton Foundation, it turns out, are of big interest to average Americans. Some 72% in the IBD/TIPP Poll said they are following it.Perhaps more significantly, of the 72% who are following it, three-fourths — or 77% -- believe that donors to the Clinton Foundation received special access and favors from the State Department while Hillary Clinton was secretary of state from 2009 to 2013.And there is, surprisingly, bipartisan agreement on this: Some 55% of Democrats agree that the Clintons used public office to dispense favors to their foundation's friends.Yet, those investigating both the Clinton email scandal and the related questions about the Clinton Foundation have been met with hostility by Clinton partisans. FBI Director James Comey, who all but indicted Hillary with his words when he announced he would not prosecute her, this week even had to defend his decision to release more documents from his investigation. For the record, his investigation — and subsequent testimony to Congress — found that Hillary lied repeatedly about her home-brew email server and about sending and receiving classified information on it. All of these are crimes.But even bigger questions are now being raised about the cozy ties between the Clinton Foundation and Hillary's State Department. Though she promised an arms-length relationship to the foundation when she was first named secretary of state, at least 181 Clinton Foundation donors — companies, individuals, even countries — lobbied the State Department during her years there.Indeed, more than half the non-government people who met with Hillary — 85 of 154 — while she was in office gave money to the Clinton Foundation. Those donors, together, gave as much as $156 million to the Clinton Foundation, according to an Associated Press analysis.It strongly suggests a quid-pro-quo relationship, given that the State Department can act as a favor-giver and gatekeeper for business deals and other lucrative arrangements around the world. It reeks of a corrupt pay-to-play system based on a major conflict of interest, in which Hillary Clinton was ideally positioned to grant government favors to those who had already enriched her, her husband Bill and her daughter, Chelsea, by giving boatloads of money to the eponymous family foundation.Charles Ortel, a highly regarded Wall Street financial expert, took a look at the Clinton Foundation's books over the last year or so and this week published his partial conclusion: ""To informed analysts, the Clinton Foundation appears to be a rogue charity that has neither been organized nor operated lawfully from inception in October 1997 to date ... it is a case study in international charity fraud, of mammoth proportions.""Based on what appears to be repeated violations of the law and a shocking disregard for the minimal ethics requirements of government officials, it's time for a special prosecutor of Hillary Clinton to look into both the family foundation and the emails.Our polling shows Americans would definitely support such a move, either before or after the election. According to IBD/TIPP, nearly two-thirds (63%) think a special prosecutor should be appointed. And 88% of Republicans and 68% of Independents want a special prosecutor to look into the possible misconduct. The sentiment that something wrong has taken place is overwhelming.To save the nation from another failed presidency, it's time to put this issue to rest by naming a special prosecutor.RELATED:What's The Latest News On The Hillary Clinton Email Scandal?Scandal Without End: Is The Clinton Foundation A Fraud?Clinton Scandal: Bill, Hillary And The $18 Mil They Made From A State Dept.

433,ABC,"2016 Election: Talk about a bad a start to a political convention. The release of almost 20,000 emails hacked out of Democratic National Committee servers has forced the head of the DNC to resign, sparked protests from Bernie Sanders supporters, and showed the media in cahoots with Democrats. Now, in desperation, the Clinton campaign is claiming that this is somehow all Donald Trump's fault.The breech, first exposed in mid-June, let hackers gather emails from seven top DNC officials over the first six months of the year.It's proved to be a treasure trove of embarrassing information showing how the DNC, which publicly insisted that it wasn't pulling for Clinton, was, in fact, pulling for Clinton at the highest levels.In May, for example, DNC Chief Financial Officer Brad Marshall pushed to ""get someone to ask...does he (Sanders) believe in God ... This could make several points difference with my ... Southern Baptist peeps."" DNC Chief Executive Office Amy Lacey responded with an ""Amen.""In one email, DNC chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz called Sanders a ""damn liar"" and in another berates him for having ""no understanding of what we do.""Even before these emails emerged, there were signs that the DNC was tipping the scales. In fact, Mika Brzezinski, co-host of MSNBC's Morning Joe, in May called on Wasserman Schultz to resign over how she and the DNC had treated Sanders. That sent Wasserman Schultz into a blind fury demanding, in an email to NBC's Chuck Todd, that ""this must stop.""In the wake of these revelations, Sanders called for Wasserman Schultz resign, which she later announced she would do once the convention was over.The revelations also reignited the already uber-passionate Sanders' supporters, who had all along felt the process had been rigged against him. On Sunday, more than a thousand Sanders' supporters protested in Philadelphia — making it already larger than any of the protests mounted in Cleveland during the GOP convention.The leaked emails uncovered other embarrassing tidbits, such as the DNC's decision to create a fake Craigslist job posting to embarrass Donald Trump. When asked about it by her underlings, communications director Luis Miranda's only response was that ""as long as all the offensive sh-t is verbatim I'm fine with it.""Then there's the revelation that a Politico reporter shared his entire story with the DNC to get its approval before showing it to his editor. (Just try to imagine any reporter giving the RNC the chance to review and amend a story before publishing it.) There are emails showing NBC's Todd all too willing to intervene in Wasserman Schultz's tirade against Brzezinski. And emails showing DNC officials talking breezily about how they could ""utilize reporters to drive a message.""The Clinton campaign's response has only made matters worse. On Sunday, campaign spokesman Robby Mook told ABC News that ""experts are telling us that Russian state actors broke in to the DNC"" and ""some experts are now telling us that this was done by the Russians for the purpose of helping Donald Trump."" Experts? Who are these experts? Mook isn't saying.And Democrats keep accusing Trump of making reckless, unfounded accusations.

434,ABC,"Health care services and information provider McKesson is combining most of its technology solutions arm with IT specialist Change Healthcare to form a new business with $3.4 billion in annual revenue, the companies said in a joint statement Tuesday.""The new company will establish a more efficient suite of end-to-end payment and claims solutions, as well as clinical capabilities, while unlocking the value of our (Technology Solutions) businesses in a tax-efficient manner,"" said McKesson Chief Executive John H. Hammergren.McKesson and Change will split ownership of the new company 70%-30%, respectively. Hammergren will be chairman and Neil de Crescenzo will serve as CEO of the newly formed company, which will be jointly governed by McKesson and Change Healthcare.The deal is seen closing in the first half of calendar 2017. The new company has commitments for $6.1 billion of transaction-related funded debt, said McKesson and Change in the statement. About $2.7 billion will pay for existing Change debt, while McKesson and Change stockholders will receive $1.25 billion and $1.75 billion in cash payments, respectively.Meanwhile, McKesson said separately that it is exploring strategic alternatives for its enterprise information solutions business, which is part of its technology solutions business that is not merging with Change.McKesson shares closed up 2.3% on the stock market today.

435,ABC,"When in his 1964 GOP acceptance speech Barry Goldwater declared that ""extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice,"" a reporter sitting near journalist/historian Theodore White famously exclaimed: ""My God, he's going to run as Barry Goldwater!""Six weeks into Donald Trump's general election campaign, Republicans are discovering that he indeed intends to run as Donald Trump. He has boasted that he could turn ""presidential"" -- respectful, respectable, reticent, reserved bordering on boring -- at will. Apparently, he can't.GOP leaders who fell in line behind Trump after he clinched the nomination expected, or at least hoped, that he would prove malleable, willing to adjust his more extreme positions and tactics to suit a broader electorate.Two problems. First, impulse control: Trump says what he actually feels, whatever comes into his head at any moment. Second, a certain logic: Trump won the primaries Sinatra-style, his way -- against the odds, the experts and the conventional rules. So why change now?""You win the pennant,"" Trump explained, ""and now you're in the World Series -- you gonna change?""Hence his response to the Orlando terror attack. Events like these generally benefit the challenger politically because any misfortune that befalls the nation gets attributed, fairly or not, directly or indirectly, to the incumbent party (e.g., the 2008 financial collapse). And Hillary Clinton is running as the quasi-incumbent.The textbook response for the challenger, therefore, is to offer sympathy, give a general statement or two about the failure of the incumbent's national security policy, then step back to let the resulting national fear and loathing, amplified by the media, take effect.Instead, Trump made himself the (political) story. First, he offered himself unseemly congratulations for his prescience about terrorism. (He'd predicted more would be coming. What a visionary.) Then he went beyond blaming the president for lack of will or wisdom in fighting terrorism, and darkly implied presidential sympathy for the enemy. ""There's something going on,"" he charged. He then reiterated his ban on Muslim immigration.Why? Because that's what Trump does. And because it worked before. It was after last December's San Bernardino massacre that Trump first called for a Muslim ban. It earned him lots of opprobrium from GOP leaders and lots of support from GOP voters. He shot up in the polls, never to descend until he clinched. So why not do it again?Because the general election is a different game. Trump assumes that the Republican electorate is representative of the national electorate. It's not. Take the Muslim ban. Sixty-eight percent of GOP voters support it. Only 38% of Democrats do. And there are approximately 7 million more Democrats in the country. (Independents are split 51-40 in favor.)The other major example of doing what's always worked is the ad hominem attack on big-dog opponents. It worked in the primaries. Trump went after one leading challenger after another, knocking them out sequentially.Hillary Clinton is a lousy campaigner but her machine is infinitely larger and more skilled than any of Trump's 16 GOP competitors. More riskily, Trump is now going toe-to-toe with a sitting president.Barack Obama is no Jeb Bush. He's not low energy. He's a skilled campaigner who clearly despises Trump and relishes the fight. And he carries the inestimable advantage of the gravitas automatically conferred by seven and a half years of incumbency. Moreover, he now enjoys an unusually high approval rating of around 53%. Trump's latest favorability is 29% (Washington Post-ABC News).It's no accident that Trump's poll numbers are sliding. A month ago, when crowned as presumptive nominee, he jumped into a virtual tie with Clinton. The polls now have him losing by an average of six points, with some showing a nine- and 12-point deficit (Reuters/Ipsos and Bloomberg).This may turn out to be temporary, but it is a clear reflection of Trump's disastrous general election kickoff.His two-week expedition into racism in attacking the Indiana-born ""Mexican"" judge. His dabbling in conspiracy, from Ted Cruz's father's supposed involvement in the Kennedy assassination to Vince Foster's (""very fishy"") suicide. All of which suggests, and cements, the image of a man who shoots from the hip and is prone to both wild theories and extreme policies.Reagan biographer Lou Cannon thinks that the Goldwater anecdote is apocryphal. How could anyone (even a journalist) have thought that Goldwater, who later admitted he always knew he would lose, was going to run as anything but his vintage, hard-core self?Same for Trump. Give him points for authenticity. Take away for electability.

436,ABC,"Stocks fell mildly in the first hour of trading Friday, setting up what is likely to be another grim week for equities following news of weaker-than-expected April payrolls growth in the U.S. and more pessimism on the earnings picture for the rest of the year.A few names in the generic drug and pharmacy industries sold off sharply on dark full-year profit forecasts, but nursing and physician staffing firm AMN Healthcare Services (AHS), No. 2 in the IBD 50, soared to a new high after posting robust results.The S&P 500 was off less than 0.3%, while the Dow Jones industrial average eased 0.2%. The Nasdaq composite fell more than 0.4%. The S&P 500 is trying to remain above its rising 50-day moving average, which would indicate a healthy uptrend, but the large-cap index has been saddled with as many as seven distribution days over the past 25 trading sessions. Distribution days, or significant declines of 0.2% or more in heavier volume than the prior session, signal intense professional selling.The Nasdaq fell below its 50-day moving average April 29 and has failed to quickly rally back the critical support line, a negative sign. It also scores a D Accumulation/Distribution Rating from IBD, indicating increased selling among institutional players such as mutual funds, banks, hedge funds and pensions. You can track this rating for the Nasdaq, S&P 500 and the Dow by clicking on the link to a separate chart page, found at the bottom of the daily Big Picture column.Endo International (ENDP), a maker of both branded and generic medicines, plunged more than 36% to 16.85 in huge trade after reporting an 8% drop in first-quarter profit despite a 35% jump in revenue to $963.5 million. It was the first year-over-year EPS drop in five quarters. Endo cut full-year guidance due to strong competition from its rivals in the generic drug space. The poor action parallels the deep sell-off in AmeriSourceBergen (ABC) after the drug distributor noted earlier this week tough pressure on generic drug costs.Endo stock had been showing poor action since diving below its 200-day moving average on Aug. 20 last year and failing to rebound. That decline broke a long-term uptrend in the stock. Endo scores a lowest-possible 1 Relative Strength Rating from IBD out of a maximum 99, as well as a 32 Composite Rating.Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) dropped in sympathy, falling more than 3% to 78.89 in strong turnover. The pharmacy chain announced on Thursday that affiliates of the private equity firm KKR (KKR) plan a secondary offering of 15 million shares.On the upside, AMN rose more than 7% and hit a new high of 38.91 in heavy volume. The company on Thursday chalked up a 100% jump in Q1 profit to 60 cents a share, 20% above Wall Street's consensus view, as revenue jumped 43% to $468 million. The company has now achieved 40%-plus revenue gains for a fourth straight quarter. Net margin soared to 29.5% vs. 18.4% a year earlier.The stock has rallied more than 13% since breaking out past a 33.40 double-bottom-with-handle buy point on March 30, so for the now stock is extended. AMN, based in San Diego, gets a 95 Composite Rating out of a maximum 99 from IBD Stock Checkup.

437,ABC,"In the crowded Republican field of presidential candidates, no one performed better in that first Aug. 6 debate than Carly Fiorina.And Americans in national polls responded, surging her support by a whopping 15 points even though she was in the secondary afternoon debate, which drew a quarter of the prime-time event's 24 million viewers. Post-debate surveys found her support jumping more even than better-known participants in the main debate, such as Ohio Gov. John Kasich. Fiorina's concise presentations, clear language and command of issues set her apart. Not to mention a willingness to throw a rhetorical elbow without appearing strident.Since then, she's appeared in dozens of interviews while campaigning non-stop across the early voting states of New Hampshire, South Carolina and Iowa, where she is this week.However, the businesswoman may still be barred from the main stage of the next GOP debate at the Reagan Presidential Library Sept. 16 because of CNN's selection process. Not an insignificant issue for any candidate as national visibility, name recognition and poll numbers drive fundraising, where Fiorina has lagged until recently.Here's the problem that could adversely affect her campaign in these important early months: CNN plans two separate debates that day, both hosted by Jake Tapper, Dana Bash and radio host Hugh Hewitt.One would include the top 10 candidates according to an average of 14 national polls (ABC/The Washington Post, Bloomberg News, CBS/The New York Times, CNN, Fox News, Gallup, Marist, McClatchy, Monmouth University, NBC/The Wall Street Journal, Pew, Quinnipiac, USA Today and Time.)And a secondary debate would present all other candidates registering at least one percent in that same national average. Today, only Jim Gilmore in the field of 17 would not qualify at all.But CNN intends to take the poll average from July 16 through Sept. 10. That includes three weeks when Fiorina barely registered in national polls. Support there lags behind state poll results, where Fiorina had been doing well. Making up that much ground in a 14-poll average before Sept. 10 could be a steep challenge.Her supporters also criticize the national methodology as over-weighting states far beyond those mattering in the first months of voting, stressing cross-country name recognition when candidates are only focused on a handful of early states.""Nobody is running nationally,"" said Katie Hughes, a spokeswoman for Carly for America, a super-pac supporting the former corporate CEO.The Fiorina campaign feigns no concern. But her staff is using this precarious crunch time in letters seeking donations to buy more media time, driving voter awareness and her numbers even higher.This situation is awkward for CNN and the Republican National Committee, which could appear to be shunting the lone female GOP candidate into the background, despite her growing strengths. One solution would be to hold both debates in prime-time.Larry Sabato, widely-respected director of the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia, has an alternate idea: Two debates, back-to-back the same evening, both in prime-time, with participants in each selected by lottery that day.RELATED:History predicts the 2016 GOP ticketVote for Hillary, she's not convicted of anything yetFrom vacation, Obama complains Congress is on vacationWhy does Obama want to keep PLO money from US terror victims?

Remember: Clinton's email server was completely unencrypted for three months after she put it into operation, making it incredibly vulnerable to hackers.And it wasn't until after she left the State Department that Hillary decided to hand the server over to Platte River Networks to improve security, and then only after pal Sidney Blumenthal's emails had been hacked.The bottom line is that Clinton was either ignorant of the stunning risk her private server posed to national security, or she and her top staff didn't care enough to take even the most rudimentary steps to protect it.Either way, it's a damning indictment of a woman who thinks she deserves the title ""commander in chief.""

471,ABC,"The latest Quinnipiac poll shows that the American public rejects President Obama's Iran deal by more than 2-to-1. This is astonishing. The public generally gives the president deference on major treaties. Just a few weeks ago, a majority supported the deal. What happened? People learned what's in it. And don't be fooled by polls that present, as fact, the administration's…
"
472,ABC,"Pat Boone is finding it hard to slow down at 81 — after six decades in showbiz. He capped his career sales of 45 million albums with the announcement that last year's ""Legacy"" would be his final album with original songs.
"
473,ABC,"But the Christian entertainer finds temptation everywhere, like being able to release audio outtakes from the TV show that made him a household name in his early 20s.
"
474,ABC,"The new ""Duets"" features pairings with long-ago guests such as Ella Fitzgerald, Andy Williams and Nat King Cole.
"
475,ABC,"As if that weren't enough, Boone:
"
476,ABC," Just finished parts in two films.
"
477,ABC," Has had a weekly contemporary gospel music radio program for 30 years.
"
478,ABC," Is considering dozens of requests to perform.
"
479,ABC," Is in discussions about hosting a TV variety series.
"
480,ABC," Pitched a car that runs on compressed air, and when ABC's hit investment show ""Shark Tank"" accepted it, he had the biggest on-air deal in its history.
"
481,ABC,"""I really do want to spend more time with my wife, Shirley, and we are very active in philanthropy,"" Boone told IBD by phone from his home in Beverly Hills, Calif. ""But God blessed me with an insatiably curious mind, and I've always had a lot on my plate.""
"
482,ABC,"Rise In The South
"
483,ABC,"Boone (the great-great-great-great grandson of pioneer Daniel) was born in Jacksonville, Fla., and when he was 2 his parents moved to Nashville, Tenn.
"
484,ABC,"He began singing in church, but was drawn to pop music and by 12 was performing all over the city and on local radio and TV.
"
485,ABC,"During his junior year of high school, he suddenly developed an interest in country music when Shirley, the daughter of singer Red Foley, transferred to his school.
"
486,ABC,"Pat was so enthralled with her, he wrote his first country song — and even though Shirley's dad turned it down, Boone turned it into a hit.
"
487,ABC,"At 18, Boone won a high school talent contest, which earned him an audition in New York City for Ted Mack's TV show, ""The Original Amateur Hour.""
"
488,ABC,"He won that competition three weeks in a row, then beat out professionals on another popular TV program, ""Arthur Godfrey's Talent Scouts.""
"
489,ABC,"Even so, Boone didn't think a full-time entertainment career was a good bet, so he planned to become a high school English teacher.
"
490,ABC,"Shortly after turning 19, he married Shirley and over the next five years they would have four daughters. By the time he graduated from Columbia University magna cum laude in 1958, he was already a celebrity, so the plans to teach were shelved.
"
491,ABC,"By 1955, he was so hot that Elvis Presley opened for him one night in Cleveland. Little Richard credited Boone with introducing rock to white audiences with the cover of ""Tutti Frutti.""
"
492,ABC,"Boone would have 38 Top 40 and six No. 1 hits and still holds the record for having at least one single on the Billboard pop charts for 220 consecutive weeks.
"
493,ABC,"On Billboard's ranking of all Top 40 artists of the rock era from 1955 to 1995, Boone stands No. 9, right behind the Rolling Stones and just ahead of the Beach Boys.
"
494,ABC,"With his movies ""Bernardine"" and ""April Love"" becoming hits in 1957, he was voted the third most popular star in America, according to a poll of movie exhibitors.
"
495,ABC,"The same year, with Boone just 23, ABC gave him his own TV variety series, ""The Pat Boone Chevy Showroom,"" which was a hit through the 1960 season.
"
496,ABC,"Boone was simply on a fast track, appearing in 18 other films, including the hits ""Mardi Gras,"" ""Journey to the Center of the Earth"" and ""State Fair.""
"
497,ABC,"""Last year I was on the set of 'Boonville Redemption,' nothing to do with my name, which is a faith-based film, a market that is doing very well,"" said Boone. ""I also have a part in the sequel to the very successful 'God's Not Dead,' which will be released next year.""
"
498,ABC,"A longtime conservative activist, Boone campaigned for Ronald Reagan for California governor in 1966 and 1970, and happened to call Reagan just as he won the presidency in 1980. That made Boone the first to congratulate him.
"
499,ABC,"In 2011 he received a lifetime achievement award from the Conservative Political Action Conference. He has continued to write about social and political issues on his blog at PatBoone.com and for WorldNetDaily and Newsmax.
"
500,ABC,"Boone admits his own family life hasn't always been smooth. In 1968 he was so wrapped up in his career that while he, his wife and children attended church, they endured a lot of friction. Through prayer and study, Pat and Shirley had a spiritual awakening, recounted in the 1989 memoir ""A New Song.""
"
501,ABC,"Meanwhile, some of his of investments — ranging from electric cars and franchise restaurants to soy-based food and sports franchises — went south. ""Even with all the precautions of my advisors, there were a lot of fizzles,"" he said.
"
502,ABC,"Healthy Path
"
503,ABC,"He credits taking care of his health, since ""the body is the temple of God, the Bible says,"" with helping him ""have the energy to do so much."" His faith ultimately reduces stress.
"
504,ABC,"From 1974 to 1977, Boone was on Motown's country music label and his family often performed together. On her own, daughter Debby won the Grammy Award for Song of the Year for 1977's ""You Light Up My Life.""
"
505,ABC,"Boone's sense of humor came to the fore in 1997 with his hard-rock album, ""In a Metal Mood: No More Mr. Nice Guy,"" with big band arrangements of genre classics.
"
506,ABC,"Then he appeared in leather with fake tattoos on stage with Alice Cooper at the American Music Awards to present that year's trophy in the hard rock-heavy metal category. A Christian network, convinced he'd gone to the dark side, fired him, but was eventually persuaded he was just pushing creative boundaries and having fun with the new look.
"
507,ABC,"For the 2002-05 MTV reality series ""The Osbournes,"" Pat's former neighbor Ozzy Osbourne chose as his theme song a version of ""Crazy Train"" that recalled Boone's swinging cover.
"
508,ABC,"In 2003, the Nashville Gospel Music Association inducted Boone into its Hall of Fame, and three years later he returned to his roots with ""Pat Boone R&B Classics.""
"
509,ABC,"Also in 2006, he wrote the coffee table volume ""Pat Boone's America — A Pop Culture Treasury of the Past 50 Years,"" with 200 rare photos.
"
510,ABC,"Solid Partner
"
511,ABC,"""I've known Pat for 22 years and he's been our spokesman based on a handshake, not a written contract,"" said Craig Smith, founder and chairman of Swiss America Trading, a gold and silver coin investment firm in Phoenix. ""He's the most decent and honest person I've ever met. I know he sounds too good to be true!""
"
512,ABC,"Boone has his own labels, Lamb & Lion Records, with contemporary Christian groups, and Gold Label Artists, which features rock and pop bands/singers Sha Na Na, the Ventures, Glen Campbell and Jack Jones.
"
513,ABC,"Then there's the Air Car, which he presented on an episode of ""Shark Tank"" taped last November and broadcast in May. Robert Herjavec offered $5 million for 50% of the first U.S. plant making the compressed-air-run vehicle.
"
514,ABC,"""Unfortunately, there was some miscommunication with Robert's team about the terms of the deal afterward, so I've never received a call from him,"" said Boone. ""But Zero Pollution Motors, which is where my investment is, has others who are interested. The Indian auto giant Tata Motors (TTM) has signed to produce it in China and there are negotiations for the technology in Britain, Australia and Japan.""
"
515,ABC,"If the revolutionary car doesn't roll out of a factory here, not to worry. Boone has done a U-turn from those money troubles of years ago while building a net worth of over $60 million.
"
516,ABC,"Pat and Shirley spend much of their time on philanthropy, including a project in Tanzania to bring clean water, medical care and education to rural tribes.

"
518,ABC,"Some years ago the late Peter Jennings, an ABC News anchor and kind
"
519,ABC,"friend, moderated a nationally-televised presidential debate.
"
520,ABC,"Immediately afterward, a colleague asked him on-air who had won and what
"
521,ABC,"he thought. Jennings, who'd sat directly in front of the debaters and
"
522,ABC,"asked the questions, said he really didn't know. He'd have to watch the
"
523,ABC,"tape to tell.Anyone who's ever attended a pro football game,
"
524,ABC,"then watched a replay on TV can attest to the wisdom of Jennings'
"
525,ABC,"answer: What you see in person and what you see on the screen can be
"
526,ABC,"very different.The transmission through the cameras and announcers'
"
527,ABC,"narrations subtly or not so subtly creates another reality stressing style and appearance
"
528,ABC,"that has forever changed American politics in the 20,037 days -- and
"
529,ABC,"14 (seriously, that many?) presidential contests -- since the first debate on Sept. 26, 1960.Tonight
"
530,ABC,"in Cleveland all 17 Republican presidential candidates will face off in
"
531,ABC,"a pair of debates on Fox News Channel. One at 9 p.m. ET pits the top 10 candidates
"
532,ABC,"by a combination of late polls. The second Trump-free debate contains
"
533,ABC,"everyone else at 5 p.m..We wondered the other day how other political
"
534,ABC,"junkies watch these events. So, we asked them. Wednesday we published
"
535,ABC,"Part I of these debate-watching tips from friends and media
"
536,ABC,"professionals, which you can review here. This morning, we have the concluding part below. Feel free to leave your own tips in the Comments section.-0-
"
537,ABC,"Chuck Todd -- Assuming Fox puts the
"
538,ABC,"front-runners center stage, it will be hard for Trump, Bush and Walker
"
539,ABC,"(1,2,3 in the polls) to avoid being the literal and figurative center of
"
540,ABC,"attention, with Trump, obviously, the focal point. Bush and Walker are
"
541,ABC,"the most recent recipients of Trump attacks and because of that, I’m
"
542,ABC,"most curious to see how Bush and Walker handle the inevitable moment
"
543,ABC,"when they are forced to respond to him directly.Respond too strongly
"
544,ABC,"and risk getting into a food fight with him that will be hard to win,
"
545,ABC,"respond too weakly, then there's a question of being tough enough to
"
546,ABC,"stand up to Trump.Of course, there will be some candidates who
"
547,ABC,"try and pick a fight with Trump because they want the attention; and
"
548,ABC,"there will be some who stick up for Trump because they eventually want
"
549,ABC,"his supporters; both are dynamics I’ll be watching for.One final
"
550,ABC,"idea: If you really want to understand how candidates feel about each
"
551,ABC,"other on that stage, try watching the debate a second time but without
"
552,ABC,"sound. Body language and facial expressions and ticks (think eye rolls
"
553,ABC,"etc).Also, what could be intriguing for political junkies to focus on,
"
554,ABC,"seeing which candidates are afraid to be seen yucking it up with each
"
555,ABC,"other post-debate, worried that some video of a hug or handshake after
"
556,ABC,"the debate will get used in a general election TV ad, as sort of a
"
557,ABC,"negative punchline. Moderator and Host, NBC’s Meet the Press.Michael Barone -- Obviously watch for what will be the biggest sound bites. But also watch for serious public policy ideas, if you can find any. Political analyst and longtime principal author of 'The Almanac of American Politics' who's endured visits to all 435 congressional districts.Bill Kristol -- Expect the unexpected.
"
558,ABC,"Debates--especially multi-candidate debates--are unpredictable. The
"
559,ABC,"story coming out of a debate is rarely what pundits expect--either with
"
560,ABC,"respect to the person or the issue that makes news. Editor, The Weekly Standard.Tammy Bruce  -- I want to see who
"
561,ABC,"comes across as a ""leader"" without being a bombastic bully. Leadership
"
562,ABC,"is a certain strength and self-confidence, rooted in experience. As
"
563,ABC,"Reagan illustrated, it does not involve smug arrogance, or a patronizing
"
564,ABC,"attitude. It's also not about being soft, or being everything to
"
565,ABC,"everyone.It will also be extremely helpful to see who thrives
"
566,ABC,"under the pressure of a debate. After all, that's one of the more
"
567,ABC,"important aspects of a debate, and speaks to the discipline and focus of
"
568,ABC,"the individual.Considering some candidates' difficulties on the
"
569,ABC,"issues (Carson), temper (Christie) and showmanship over substance
"
570,ABC,"(Trump), I want to see who's able to overcome their known weaknesses.
"
571,ABC,"Who has chosen to truly be a serious candidate by recognizing their
"
572,ABC,"issues and trying to overcome them. This debate will thin the herd,
"
573,ABC,"which is something I'm looking forward to. I'm looking to be impressed
"
574,ABC,"and I expect to be. Lots of talent on the stage. It'll be exciting to
"
575,ABC,"see who delivers. Fox News Contributor, Author, Radio Talk Show Host.Melissa Clouthier --I watch them on TV with my Twitter open. I look for who commands the stage and who surprises me.Follow her here @MelissaTweetsLucianne Goldberg -- First off, I watch for a
"
576,ABC,"Perry-type flubber. Then I want some Trumpesque name-calling. Then I
"
577,ABC,"want Kasich to step forward and knock everybody's socks off with common
"
578,ABC,"sense. Of course this is what I want. None of it will happen. I think
"
579,ABC,"with all those people, it's going to be a royal rat-%#&*. Lucianne.comClifford D. May -- At this point, I think, it's
"
580,ABC,"like a sports car rally. You're just watching to see if anyone develops
"
581,ABC,"a significant lead -- or crashes. President, Foundation for Defense of Democracies and Washington Times columnist.Ron Fournier -- I try to watch with an open mind and write what I see really fast. Veteran journalist and senior political columnist for National Journal.Kurt Schlichter -- I want to see candidates who
"
582,ABC,"can talk. Not just mouth words and repeat consultant-generated
"
583,ABC,"platitudes but really talk to people and articulate conservative ideas
"
584,ABC,"and principles.And I want them to talk about the things that matter to
"
585,ABC,"me, not K Street-driven issues but the issues I care about like illegal
"
586,ABC,"immigration, Iran and the proliferation of welfare dependency. And I
"
587,ABC,"want to see candidates who can take a hostile question, attack its
"
588,ABC,"faulty premise and turn it around.Townhall.com columnist. ####Pete Wehner -- These days, given the way the
"
589,ABC,"social media world works, best (and worst) sound bites matter a lot.
"
590,ABC,"Rick Perry learned that in 2012, in a negative way. This is more
"
591,ABC,"important than ever, since those moments are linked to and replayed more
"
592,ABC,"than ever, and they can alter initial impressions.Other key
"
593,ABC,"elements that strike me as important include which candidate will do
"
594,ABC,"best when there's a clash with Donald Trump; who can offer the most
"
595,ABC,"compelling narrative for their candidacy (which is different than simply
"
596,ABC,"answering specific questions with detailed answers); and who can
"
597,ABC,"conduct themselves in ways that leaves a durable, positive impression. People
"
598,ABC,"often don't remember specific debate answers; they leave with
"
599,ABC,"impressions. And impressions are a combination of a lot of things --
"
600,ABC,"command of issues, presence and confidence, humor and likeability,
"
601,ABC,"winsomeness and the ability to persuade, the capacity to defuse
"
602,ABC,"concerns. Worked in three Republican administrations, Senior Fellow, Ethics and Public Policy Center.Clarence Page -- I'll be watching to see who gets off the best one-liner against Donald Trump --and survives his rebuttal. Nationally-syndicated columnist for the Chicago Tribune.Robert Schmuhl --Debate watchers should look for
"
603,ABC,"the statements or moments that reveal a candidate's vision for the
"
604,ABC,"nation and sense of command. It's important to look beyond
"
605,ABC,"fire-breathing outbursts that make good television to assess qualities
"
606,ABC,"of leadership that a debate format might demonstrate. How much thought
"
607,ABC,"has a candidate given to governing, and how well can the candidate
"
608,ABC,"express that thinking? Professor of American Studies and Journalism, University of Notre Dame, author of 'Statecraft and Stagecraft.'Roy Macgregor -- I look for 1) the ridiculously
"
609,ABC,"rehearsed bon mot -- one that rings so shrilly of ""media consultant"" and
"
610,ABC,"""rehearsal"" that you buckle over in laughter. 2) Mental reminders that
"
611,ABC,"could just as easily be printed in boldface on the forehead. That moment
"
612,ABC,"where the candidate reminds himself or herself to ""be firm,"" ""be soft,""
"
613,ABC,"""be the guy you'd love to have a beer with (even if they've never had a
"
614,ABC,"beer mustache in their life!) 3) Overuse of names, particularly when
"
615,ABC,"speaking or responding to the ringmaster journalist. 4) Real anger --
"
616,ABC,"something we need to see more of. These people hate each other, so why
"
617,ABC,"pretend otherwise? Journalist, author, friend and notorious Canadian. ####RELATED:Bye-Bye, DebbieGOP Debate: What the pros watch for--ICarly Fiorina: 'Here's what I will do as Commander-in-Chief'Flashback: Obama explains his awful debate showing (*Not his fault)

Find out at IBD Stock Checkup""Looking ahead, we expect our gross profit in the second half of the year to be negatively impacted by certain accelerating headwinds, including an increase in the rate of generic deflation and a lower contribution from new generic launches,"" Chief Executive Steven Collis said in a prepared statement.""In addition, an internal strategic initiative we had launched to increase sales of PRxO Generics and to increase our independent retail segment revenues is ramping slower than we had anticipated,"" Collis went on to say.AmerisourceBergen sees 2016 revenue growth of about 8%, short of current views for 9% growth.Those headwinds are seen eating into fiscal 2017 as well, said Collis. He sees 4%-6% in 2017 earnings growth, above the midpoint of new 2016 guidance -- $5.71-$5.82 a share -- and cited revenue gains that are ""slightly better than the market,"" without elaborating.Shares gapped down 7.4% to 78.02 in the stock market today, having already broken support at their 50-day line on Thursday after briefly surfacing above the key moving average.During the second quarter, the company earned $1.68 per share, up 16% from the previous year and 9 cents above views. Revenue rose 9% to $35.7 billion, just short of estimates for $35.8 billion.Late Wednesday, McKesson reported fiscal-fourth-quarter earnings that missed consensus forecasts but offered up fiscal 2017 earnings guidance that topped.McKesson shares surged 4.7% to 172.70.Walgreens Boots Alliance stock fell 3 cents to 81.46.

619,ABC,"Donald Trump has reason to be reluctant to release his tax returns. In a New York Times piece about Ben Rhodes, President Obama's deputy national security adviser, Rhodes cynically explains that today's journalism consists of young people whom he flat-out describes as ignorant. ""The average reporter we talk to is 27 years old,"" Rhodes said, ""and their only reporting experience consists of being around political campaigns. That's a sea change. They literally know nothing.""What do 27-year-old reporters know about how wealthy big-business people file their taxes? In the real world, moguls like Donald Trump hire accountants and tax attorneys to file what are known as ""aggressive"" returns -- seeking every possible deduction, exclusion, tax break or deferral.Given this, Donald Trump is likely audited nearly every year, with the IRS settling with him on some of these issues, often for less than the IRS initially claimed he owed. If Trump releases his taxes now, the IRS -- to avoid embarrassment or public criticism that they are giving a rich guy a break -- might be reluctant to negotiate down from what they initially argued he owes. Therefore, Trump is likely telling the truth that his attorneys advised him not to release his tax returns until after the audit had been settled.There's another legitimate reason that Trump may be reluctant to release his tax returns: media bias. During the 2012 presidential race, ABC News' Jonathan Karl falsely reported that at 14%, Mitt Romney paid a lower effective federal tax rate -- the percent of your total gross income paid in taxes after all deductions, exemptions and credits are applied -- than a $75,000/year auto mechanic.This would be true only if the mechanic had zero exemptions, deductions, etc. -- which, rich or poor, never happens. The IRS gives you a standard deduction just for breathing. Assume Mr. Auto Mechanic is married, with two children. After offsetting gross income with exemptions, deductions for things like mortgage interest and assorted tax credits, Mr. Mechanic's effective federal income tax rate -- the percentage of income actually paid in taxes -- is much lower than Romney's rate.At that time, the liberal Tax Policy Center reported that 91.4% of individual taxpayers with adjusted gross incomes (AGI) between $50,000 and $100,000 paid less than 15% in taxes. And 43.9% of the $50,000-$100,000 AGI taxpayers paid an effective rate between 5% and 9.99%, while 4.6% of this group paid no federal income tax at all.Also not lost on Trump is how then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., flat-out lied about Romney's taxes on the floor of the Senate. Reid said, ""The word's out that (Romney) hasn't paid any taxes for 10 years.""Later, post-election, Harry Reid admitted he said this without any evidence. Asked whether it was fair or if he had regrets at the lowball tactic, he said, ""Romney didn't win, did he?"" His admission generated no condemnation -- not even fake condemnation -- from fellow Democrats. The blatant lie does not seem to have affected his reputation or stature. Bygones were bygones. The end justified the means.Republicans seem to have learned little about how dirty the Democrats play. Mitt Romney, having been victimized by Reid, even used a Reid-like tactic to criticize Trump. About Trump's refusal to release his tax returns, Romney said, ""It is disqualifying for a modern-day presidential nominee to refuse to release tax returns to the voters,"" and suggested Trump was hiding a ""bombshell."" With Republican friends like these ...And then there's the usual selective outrage. No law requires a presidential candidate to disclose his tax returns, although it is certainly true that all recent presidents have done so. Similarly, there is no law that requires a candidate to release his grades or test scores. Most have done so or had them disclosed by the media. In Obama's case, it's now seven years into his presidency, and he's not turned over his grades and test scores, nor has the media demand that he do so. In fact, the media long ago lost interest in the matter.Warren Buffett is not running for president. But in making the case for higher taxes, he claims to pay a lower tax rate than does his secretary. He has never released his returns or those of his secretary to verify this assertion or to allow for an examination as to why he pays a lower rate -- assuming he does.For all these reasons, Trump drags his feet on releasing his tax returns. Eventually, media pressure and criticism will force him to do so.When he releases them, no matter what percentage he pays or the amount he pays, rest assured he will be accused of ""not paying his fair share."" As Trump puts it, ""That I can tell you.""

620,ABC,"A new Gallup survey seems to suggest that majority of Americans now back government-run health care.That, at least, is what Gallup’s headline about its poll says: “Majority in U.S. Support Idea of Fed-Funded Healthcare System.”The mainstream press eagerly ran with the story. The Washington Post, for example, headlined its piece: “Poll: Most Americans want to replace ObamaCare with single-payer -- including many Republicans.”The ABC News headline blared “Poll Says Majority of Americans Prefer 'Medicare For All' Health Care,” and the story led by saying that “A growing number of Americans now support the idea of federally funded health care.”Look more carefully at the poll itself, however, and you see that it doesn’t show that at all.Gallup asked three questions relating to ObamaCare that were meant to gauge the public’s support for repealing the law.What it found was that 51% now say ObamaCare should be repealed, whether or not it’s replaced with anything, while just 48% favor keeping it in place.The poll also asked about “replacing the ACA with a federally funded health care program providing insurance for all Americans.”That question elicited 58% support.What this response means is anyone’s guess. Even Gallup admits it can’t say for sure, particularly since the Republican response to this question is highly questionable.According to the survey results, 41% of Republicans favor replacing ObamaCare with a single-payer system. Gallup’s Frank Newport says the finding could simply reflect that Republicans “view any proposal to replace the ACA as better than keeping in place.”Without that unreasonably high GOP number, the support for “Medicare for all” basically vanishes. (Interestingly, Gallup didn’t bother to include a question in the poll asking about replacing ObamaCare with free-market reforms.)In any case, other far-more-straightforward polls show widespread public opposition to government-run health care.Gallup itself has for several years asked whether the public supports a “government-run health care system” or one “based mostly on private health insurance.”The majority has consistently backed the current private system: 55% did so in 2015, which is almost exactly where it stood in 2011.Meanwhile, an AP poll taken earlier this year found that only 39% say they back “replacing the current private health insurance system with a single-payer, Medicare-like plan.”Even that meager support dropped when the details of such a plan were made clear. Just 28% said they supported the idea if it meant “your own taxes would increase” or if it meant giving up employer coverage. Just 18% supported single-payer if it meant “longer wait times for nonemergency medical services.”Well, guess what, that’s exactly what Sanders’ “Medicare for all” -- or any other single-payer plan for that matter -- would produce. By definition, they would force everyone off their private insurance plans and onto the government-run program. Everyone would see their taxes climb.Among other things, Sanders raises income taxes on all taxpayers. The liberal Urban Institute found that the tax hike needed to pay for Sanders' plan would be $32 trillion over the next decade, or more than twice what Sanders claims.The public is even less likely to back single-payer when they learn that Sanders’ own home state of Vermont canceled plans to adopt a single-payer system, once the governor realized that the costs involved would wreck the state’s economy.Meanwhile, anyone who has looked at Canada or Britain -- or at the Veterans Health Administration here at home -- knows that government-run health care invariably produces chronic delays in treatments, even for emergency procedures.So, no, the public doesn’t support “Medicare for all” or anything like it.What the new Gallup poll does show is something the mainstream press -- and even Gallup itself -- missed. Which is that, six years after it became law, most Americans want ObamaCare repealed, including a quarter of Democrats.In a presidential election year during which one candidate has promised to repeal ObamaCare on Day One, this finding is, well, yuuuge.RELATEDThank You, Bernie Sanders, For Exposing The True Cost of Socialized Medicine$10 Billion Later, The VA Makes Veterans Wait Even Longer To Get CareCanadian Patients Waiting Longer Than Ever For Treatment

622,ABC,"Walt Disney had his own formula for creating a magic entertainment kingdom.In the process, Disney became synonymous with imagination and wonder. He built an empire and laid a foundation that endures: Walt Disney (DIS), which he founded in 1923, is the world's largest entertainment firm. It had sales of $54 billion last year while enjoying a 700% stock ride since 2008.Disney (1901-66) began his career with no money and no connections. His dreams were often met with naysayers.“People often ask me if I know the secret of success and if I could tell others how to make their dreams come true,” Disney said in “The Quotable Walt Disney.”  “My answer is, you do it by working.”And he knew exactly where he wanted to apply his work: bringing joy to people through entertainment. “Most of my life I have done what I wanted to do,” he said. “I have had fun on the job. I have never been able to confine that fun to office hours.”Emerging out of Disney’s imagination came Mickey Mouse and other cartoon characters, then the first full-length animated movie, ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,” setting the standard for all others to come.Then came his landmark, utopian theme parks, Disneyland and Walt Disney World.Among his many honors, Disney received seven Emmys and 22 Academy Awards. In 1964 he received the Presidential Medal of Freedom.In the half-century since his death, Disney’s philosophy is still paying dividends, on screen and in the parks: “We keep moving forward -- opening up new doors and doing new things -- because we’re curious. ... We’re always exploring and experimenting. We call it Imagineering -- the blending of creative imagination with technical know-how.”For example, a roughly 14-acre ""Star Wars""-themed land was announced last year and is currently under construction at Disneyland Resort and Walt Disney World.“If Walt had one great gift, it was that he kept his head down and kept trying,” nephew and longtime senior Disney executive Roy Disney said in “How to Be Like Walt,” by Pat Williams with Jim Denney. “Over the years, he was told that his ideas were impractical, impossible and would never work.... Walt proved the only way to get things done is by sticking to your ideas and your beliefs.”Walt Disney’s wife, Lillian, with whom he had two daughters, said, ""(He) just wouldn’t give up if he thought he was right.”“Above all, Walt was one of the great storytellers ever to walk on the face of the earth,"" Williams told IBD. ""He could get his people, his staff, so excited with his pure ability to tell stories about upcoming projects, like his movies or theme parks.”Walter Elias Disney was born in Chicago and raised in Missouri.His mother and father instilled a solid work ethic in him. But early on, when Walt showed in interest in drawing, his dad called it a waste of time.“He scoffed at me” and contended that wanting to become a commercial artist was foolish, Disney recalled. His dad said he should get a “real job,” suggesting an opening in a jelly factory.Another naysayer was Walt’s fourth-grade teacher, who admonished him during a class sketching assignment, “Flowers do not have faces!”But they did to Walt, and his imagination could not be bridled or discouraged.After graduating from high school, he then spent a year in art school before joining the Red Cross during World War I as an ambulance driver in France.He returned to Missouri and became a working commercial cartoon artist. When he was introduced to animation, his career focus changed. Instead of drawing stationary cartoons, he immersed himself in the study of making ones that moved.In 1922, Disney started Laugh-O-Gram Films, raising $15,000 -- over $150,000 in today’s money -- from investors. Disney secured an $11,000 contract to produce cartoons; but after six of them, the client went bankrupt. Disney’s company was close to folding, too, but stayed afloat with a smaller client.Walt reinvested his money into developing his own series, called “Alice Comedies,” which featured a live-action little girl in a cartoon world.“In order to crack the field, I said, 'I’ve got to get something a little unique,’ ” Disney recalled.But he ran out of money and had to file for bankruptcy protection. He was able to keep a movie camera and his unfinished Alice film as he headed to a new start in Los Angeles in 1923.There he opened a studio and connected with film distributor Margaret Winkler. She liked the Alice film and offered a contract for six of them at $1,500 (worth $21,000 now) apiece.Realizing that he needed additional startup capital and financial business guidance, Walt turned to his older brother, Roy, who invested what money he had and persuaded an uncle to contribute some, too. What would become Walt Disney Co. was founded in October 1923 as Disney Bros. Studio.Walt fired himself as an animator in 1925, seeking out better artists. He focused on his talents for producing, directing and leading his company.“Walt’s enthusiasm made overachievers of us all,” said Disney film editor Norman Palmer, who joined Disney in 1940. “If it hadn’t been for Walt, there would have been a lot of times we would have settled for less than our best. But Walt made us believe we could do better.”In 1927 Winkler’s husband, film distributor Charles Mintz, approached Disney for a cartoon series featuring a rabbit. Disney and animator Ub Iwerks created “Oswald the Lucky Rabbit,” but Walt unknowingly signed away ownership of the character.The series was a hit, then Mintz drastically cut Disney’s pay for the cartoons. He threatened Disney that if he didn’t agree to the new terms, he’d raid Disney’s animators.Disney refused and came up with a new cartoon character that would trump Mintz and everyone else.Disney created and owned Mortimer Mouse. After Lillian frowned on the name, Mortimer became Mickey.Within eight months, Mickey Mouse was on his way to becoming a worldwide cartoon phenomenon, and Disney and his studio were on top.“No matter how bad things seemed, Walt believed in himself, his product and his future,” Williams said.Said Disney: “I thought of (Mickey) from the first as a distinct individual, not just a cartoon type or symbol going through a comedy routine.”Mickey’s legions of fans included President Franklin Roosevelt and England’s King George V. Disney received a special medal from the League of Nations in 1935, recognizing Mickey as “a symbol of universal goodwill.”After conquering the cartoon world with Mickey, then the musical cartoon series “Silly Symphonies,” Disney in 1934 decided to make the Brothers Grimm fairy tale, “Snow White,” into the first animated feature film.It was considered a huge financial gamble that could bankrupt the studio. Roy and Lillian tried to talk him out of it.They couldn't budge Walt, who mortgaged everything to see his dream through.His overriding message to his animators was always: “Until a character becomes a personality, it cannot be believed.... Unless people are able to identify themselves with the character, its actions will seem unreal. And without personality, a story cannot ring true to the audience.”Disney spared no effort or expense in providing his animators everything they needed to make the film visually stunning.Orlando Ferrante, a Disney theme park designer, said, “Walt has a simple philosophy: 'Get the job done, but never sacrifice quality.’ He often told us, 'You worry about the quality. Let me worry about the cost.’ ”“Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs” came out in 1937 and was a smash hit, artistically and commercially. Now the Disney name had even more magic, and animated feature films “Pinocchio,” “Fantasia,” “Dumbo,” “Bambi” and “Cinderella” followed. Not all were financial successes, but that didn’t stop Disney from continuing to make them artistic ones.While the brand was strong, the studio was again deep in debt by 1948. What to do?Another idea had been germinating in Disney’s head, something that would become his most lasting legacy: a utopian theme park.Again, he was met with naysayers, including Roy, who called it a “screwball idea” that would take the company down.Disney forged ahead anyway, again mortgaging everything. He sold his dream to the American Broadcasting Company, which became an investor and sponsor.The result was Disneyland, which opened in July 1955 in Anaheim, Calif.“Walt was a risk-taker at the highest level,” Williams said. “He would have been bored to death if he wasn’t taking these highflying risks. He had thought them through, yet everyone around him said they were going to be disasters.”“Almost everyone warned us that Disneyland would be a ... spectacular failure,” Disney said. “But they were thinking about an amusement park, and we believed in our idea -- a family park where parents and children could have fun -- together.... Disneyland is a work of love. We didn’t go into Disneyland just with the idea of making money.”He put it this way: “We are selling happiness.”The next huge theme park was Walt Disney World, which opened in Orlando, Fla., in 1971, five years after Walt died. As for ABC? Disney now owns it.Disney encouraged everyone to pursue dreams, no matter how overwhelming they may be. He offered a perspective about all he had done and where he began: “I only hope that we never lose sight of one thing -- that it was all started by a mouse.”Opened Disneyland in 1955.Overcame: Numerous setbacks and naysayers.Lesson: Follow your heart.“Get a good idea and stay with it.... Work at it until it’s done, and done right.... All our dreams can come true -- if we have the courage to pursue them.”""Courage is the main quality of leadership. Courage to initiate something and keep it going, a pioneering spirit, an adventurous spirit, the courage to blaze new ways.”“All the adversity I’ve had in my life, all my troubles and obstacles have strengthened me.”“If you can dream it, you can do it.”“I must explore and experiment.... I am never satisfied with my work.”“I still look at the world with uncontaminated wonder, and with all living things I have terrific sympathy. It was the most natural thing in the world for me to imagine that mice and squirrels might have feelings just like mine.”Related News:Walter Knott Had A Berry, Berry Good Idea For A Theme ParkDisney Reanimated: How Eisner Brought The Magic BackUb Iwerks Co-Created Mickey Mouse, Won Academy Awards

629,ABC,"The agreement helped McKesson post its biggest revenue gain in years during fiscal 2015, which ended in March. The company logged a little more than $179 billion in revenue for the year, up 30% from fiscal 2014.
"
630,ABC,"McKesson, along with AmerisourceBergen (ABC) and Cardinal Health (CAH) — which partner with Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) and CVS Health (CVS), respectively — control roughly fourth-fifths of the U.S. drug distribution market.

However, Bloomberg News has reported that Omnicare has attracted recent buyout interest from Express Scripts Holding (ESRX) and CVS Health, which could threaten the McKesson relationship.
"
634,ABC,"During its fiscal fourth quarter, McKesson's wholesale drug distribution business drove its sales to grow 19% from a year earlier to $44.9 billion. Excluding one-time items, its earnings from continuing operations climbed 15% to $2.94 a share.

"
638,ABC,"""We are calling for continued growth and strength right across the distribution solutions business,"" he said.
"
639,ABC,"Beer pointed to solid generic-drug price increases in fiscal 2015, saying that higher prices were an ""increasingly important factor"" and that this positive trend ""will be the case again in 2016.""
"
640,ABC,"It's too soon to gauge if the current fiscal year will be as strong on that front as last year, he said. But generic prices are still expected to rise amid heightening demand for drugs to treat a wide array of ailments.
"
641,ABC,"On the branded drug front, Beer said, McKesson anticipates steady pricing and volume growth in the year ahead as several drugs, including some that treat hepatitis C with high cure rates, are increasingly prescribed.
"
642,ABC,"Strong prices and volume are both important for drug distributors, which buy medications from manufacturers, store them and then sell them to retail pharmacies and other outlets.
"
643,ABC,"The distributors profit on the spread between the wholesale price charged by the manufacturer and the retail price that pharmacies set in conjunction with insurers.
"
644,ABC,"Even if drug prices taper off, distributors can still generate solid profit margins by selling drugs and other products in high volume.
"
645,ABC,"The majority of McKesson's pharmaceutical distribution business is in North America, but it is pushing for growth internationally. Its 2014 buyout of German drug distributor Celesio helped McKesson grow its sales outside North America by 3% in its latest completed quarter.
"
646,ABC,"""We continue to view McKesson as one of the best-positioned companies in the pharma supply chain and believe generic drug purchasing, Celesio synergies, and capital deployment could drive upside"" to the stock, Deutsche Bank analyst George Hill noted in a June research report.
"
647,ABC,"CFO Beer said at the May conference that more buyouts could be in the offing ""if we can find attractive opportunities at sensible prices.""
"
648,ABC,"In a June report, Barclays Capital analyst Eric Percher said that, based on his talks with McKesson management, ""M&A is a clear priority."" Percher suggested that McKesson is most likely to build off of the Celesio deal and make Europe its international priority.

651,ABC,"Sam Pappas, CEO of Mystic Asset Management and a long-time health care industry investor, told IBD that as populations age in developed parts of the world, including Europe, demand for prescription drugs increases.
"
652,ABC,"This is particularly evident in the U.S. with the massive baby boomer generation, he said. That, coupled with more Americans now covered by health insurance in the wake of the ObamaCare rollout, means that more people will not only need medications, but more Americans will be able to afford them.
"
653,ABC,"""The need for health care, including medications, is only going to continue increasing,"" Pappas said.
"
654,ABC,"Roughly 75 million Americans belong to the baby boomer generation born between 1946 and 1964, according to U.S. Census data.
"
655,ABC,"As many of them have moved into retirement, Pappas says, they have shown a propensity to seek out medications early and often to treat ailments caused by aging. They do it to remain active, and it drives up overall demand for prescription drugs.

But generic prices are still expected to rise amid heightening demand for drugs to treat a wide array of ailments.On the branded drug front, Beer said, McKesson anticipates steady pricing and volume growth in the year ahead as several drugs, including some that treat hepatitis C with high cure rates, are increasingly prescribed.Strong prices and volume are both important for drug distributors, which buy medications from manufacturers, store them and then sell them to retail pharmacies and other outlets.The distributors profit on the spread between the wholesale price charged by the manufacturer and the retail price that pharmacies set in conjunction with insurers.Even if drug prices taper off, distributors can still generate solid profit margins by selling drugs and other products in high volume.The majority of McKesson's pharmaceutical distribution business is in North America, but it is pushing for growth internationally. Its 2014 buyout of German drug distributor Celesio helped McKesson grow its sales outside North America by 3% in its latest completed quarter.""We continue to view McKesson as one of the best-positioned companies in the pharma supply chain and believe generic drug purchasing, Celesio synergies, and capital deployment could drive upside"" to the stock, Deutsche Bank analyst George Hill noted in a June research report.CFO Beer said at the May conference that more buyouts could be in the offing ""if we can find attractive opportunities at sensible prices.""In a June report, Barclays Capital analyst Eric Percher said that, based on his talks with McKesson management, ""M&A is a clear priority."" Percher suggested that McKesson is most likely to build off of the Celesio deal and make Europe its international priority.Similarly, Morningstar's Lekraj said that acquisitions — particularly international ones along the lines of Celesio — would give McKesson added ""global purchasing power"" and complement its U.S. distribution operation.Boomer BoostSam Pappas, CEO of Mystic Asset Management and a long-time health care industry investor, told IBD that as populations age in developed parts of the world, including Europe, demand for prescription drugs increases.This is particularly evident in the U.S. with the massive baby boomer generation, he said. That, coupled with more Americans now covered by health insurance in the wake of the ObamaCare rollout, means that more people will not only need medications, but more Americans will be able to afford them.""The need for health care, including medications, is only going to continue increasing,"" Pappas said.Roughly 75 million Americans belong to the baby boomer generation born between 1946 and 1964, according to U.S. Census data.As many of them have moved into retirement, Pappas says, they have shown a propensity to seek out medications early and often to treat ailments caused by aging. They do it to remain active, and it drives up overall demand for prescription drugs.All of that points to sales growth for prominent prescription-drug distributors such as McKesson, which Lekraj says ""should be one of the better beneficiaries of the trends in health care overall.""

658,ABC,"A favorite among the yoga set, Lululemon (LULU) is known for women's activewear. But its men's comps are crushing it, as its ABC — ""anti-ball-crushing"" — pants gain popularity.Lululemon's men's business delivered 19% comparable growth in Q1, said management during Tuesday's Q1 earnings call, according to Reuters. This marks acceleration from 16%, 11% and 5% comp growth in the last three preceding quarters. Last quarter, CEO Laurent Potdevin namechecked the ABC pant as the anchor behind its men's comps.The pants have garnered media attention for the cheeky name and solid reviews on the Lululemon site.Their ""engineering gives you and the family jewels room to breathe,"" according its product page.The company, which opened a standalone men's store in New York City in November, has been assertively growing its men's business as sportswear rivals Nike (NKE) and Under Armour (UA) move in on women's wear. Under Armour's bid for share in the women's activewear space has included high-profile endorsements from Gisele Bundchen and ballerina Misty Copeland.Nike shares fell 0.4% to 101.09. Under Armour fell 1.1% to 80.11. Lululemon rose 6.4% to 65.45 in the stock market today.Lululemon's Q1 earnings were flat, year over year, at 34 cents, beating Street views by a penny. Currency headwinds, weather and the West Coast ports slowdown weighed on the quarter, said management, according to Reuters. As a result of the ports issue, product inventories will be elevated for a few quarters, it said, but markdown risk is minimal.Revenue grew 10% to $423.5 million, topping forecasts for $418.9 million.Overall same-store sales rose 6%, including a 1% dip in brick-and-mortar comps and 31% comp growth in online sales.In Q1, Lululemon repurchased 300,000 shares.""To support our long-term goals, we are intentionally striking a strategic balance between strong growth and investments within innovation and infrastructure,"" said CEO Laurent Potdevin in a statement.Lululemon upped full-year guidance to $1.86 to $1.91, up from $1.85 to $1.90. The raised earnings outlook remains below consensus estimates for $1.93.The company's increased revenue guidance for $2 billion to $2.05 billion, based on overall same-store sales ""in the mid-single digits,"" is more or less in line with views for $2.02 billion in revenue. It had previously guided for $1.97 billion to $2.02 billion.In Q2, management sees 31-33 cents in earnings per share, below views for 34 cents, and guided for $440 million to $445 million in sales vs. forecasts for $439.7 million.Follow Elaine Low on Twitter: @IBD_ELow.

670,ABC,"Iran Deal: Critics of the nuclear pact with Tehran are exposing what should have been in the forefront of Americans' minds all through these misguided negotiations: the ultimate need for a military solution.Senate Foreign Relations Committee Ranking Democrat Bob Menendez of New Jersey, appearing on ABC News on Sunday, pointed out, ""We have gone from preventing Iran having a nuclear ability to managing it.""When President Obama announced a deal to negotiate a deal with Iran in November 2013, the press treated it as if the hard part was done and what lay ahead were just formalities. Obama called it ""a new path toward a world that is more secure — a future in which we can verify that Iran's nuclear program is peaceful and that it cannot build a nuclear weapon.""Secretary of State John Kerry and America's P5+1 negotiating partners, of course, have caved on that requirement. This deal very much leaves Iran with the ability to build a nuclear weapon.Menendez, whom the Obama Justice Department thought it had silenced by hitting him with an ethics probe, noted:""We started off with the wrong premise ... that Iran could not keep its nuclear infrastructure, at least all of it.""Instead, Iran still gets to have a plutonium reactor, and ""we have uranium enrichment deep inside of a mountain,"" as Menendez said. ""That doesn't happen for a peaceful civilian program.""Even under a deal, the senator said, he hopes that Obama ""makes a very clear statement to Iran that as it relates to the future, we cannot accept Iran having a nuclear weapon, period. That's the premise we started on. That's the premise we should finish on.""Which means we're likely back to where we were before any talks or deal — having to attack Iran sooner or later before the world's foremost terrorist client state becomes the world's sole nuclear-armed terrorist state.These negotiations have been a colossal bait and switch. The people of the United States and the other P5+1 countries were under the impression that their negotiators would bring home a deal that would, as Obama claimed, ""prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon,"" a viable alternative to a ""rush towards conflict.""The infamous White House ""fact sheet"" after the 2013 announcement promised ""a comprehensive solution that would constrain Iran's nuclear program over the long term, provide verifiable assurances to the international community that Iran's nuclear activities will be exclusively peaceful, and ensure that any attempt by Iran to pursue a nuclear weapon would be promptly detected.""Like so much else promised by this president, it was too good to be true. If we can detect violations, a big if, any serious attempt to re-impose sanctions would mean exposing the deal as a failure — an admission that roughly 18 months of talks were a dangerous waste of time. It won't happen.We have foolishly delayed the inevitable. A pre-emptive military operation to prevent a future atomic 9/11 that would incinerate millions of innocents is one of the few options left.

691,ABC,"Walt Disney (DIS) missed second-quarter expectations late Tuesday, sending shares gapping down out of buy range Wednesday, closing down 4%.But is it all bad news? Here are a few takeaways from the media conglomerate's earnings call.IBD's Take: How sturdy is the House of Mouse? Find out at IBD Stock CheckupFewer sports fans are paying for ESPN (again), but Disney's pay-TV situation is perhaps not as dire as once perceived, thanks to ESPN's inclusion in over-the-top bundles from Dish Network (DISH) and on the Sony (SNE) PlayStation.""The numbers on both of those platforms have been encouraging, and they were a driver of (subscribers),"" Chief Executive Bob Iger said on the earnings call late Tuesday. ""They did contribute incremental subs for ESPN this last quarter."" He added that current and new distributors have an ""avid interest"" in including ESPN in their packages.Disney's 10-Q filing for the quarter notes subscriber declines having a 1% revenue impact to its media networks division, down from a 2% impact in its fiscal first quarter. Cable networks, (including ESPN and others) and broadcasting (including ABC) make up the media networks division.""These trends suggest some deceleration of subscriber declines, likely related to positive momentum coming from Sling TV and to a lesser extent Sony Vue,"" Piper Jaffray analyst Stan Meyers wrote in a recent note to clients, referring to so-called ""skinny bundle"" packages involving a few select channels. Meyers reiterated his overweight rating on the belief that ""the upcoming film slate will drive significant value over the next five years despite the decelerating pace of growth at ESPN.""Media networks revenue, which was flat from the prior year's second quarter, was ""largely in line (with my expectations) and, more importantly, largely in line on the affiliate (revenue) front,"" wrote Stifel analyst Benjamin Mogil, who rates Disney a buy.Revenue from both the cable networks unit and greater media networks segments slightly missed Wall Street consensus, according to Stifel, but analysts didn't seem to mind much -- in stark contrast to the previous quarter's call.Once in the shadow of Netflix (NFLX), Hulu garnered some attention in the wake of news that it will launch a live-TV package next year that will include broadcast and cable channels, as well as live sports and news.""Hulu's become an important investment for us, not just as a distributor of the programs that we make, but ultimately as a buyer of original product and ultimately as a distributor of our channels"" Iger said during the call, billing it as a ""best of cable"" middle-ground option between a bigger package and a Sling-style skinny bundle.The streaming service is a ""key strategic asset for Fox (FOXA) and Disney and one which allows for greater ad monetization over time but, more importantly, is expected to continue to bridge the product gap between MVPD (multichannel video programming distributor) service and OTT (over-the-top) services,"" Mogil wrote in a separate note.Iger refrained from commenting on Disney's plans for subscription video-on-demand, except to say that it will keep investing in the creation of intellectual property.""One of the best examples of that would be Marvel and what we've been able to do with Netflix in terms of multiple original series, renewal of second seasons on two of them, and the addition of another series from Marvel to Netflix,"" he said, adding that Marvel has also ""been in discussions"" with other distributors.Netflix shares were down 2.6% Wednesday.Separately, he said the value of Disney's IP in China ""is on the rise."" The soon-to-be-opened Shanghai Disney Resort will feature Marvel characters, and characters from the Disney animated film ""Zootopia"" will pop up in the park ""sooner than we had initially anticipated,"" said Iger, due to the movie's success in China.""In general, you're going to find a park that is going to take advantage of what is clearly a growing interest in our intellectual property, as well as a blend of some original intellectual property too,"" he said.Disney's IP flows through its various branches, as original characters become Disneyland attractions and toys that help the consumer products segment chug along.Spider-Man's return to the Marvel fold won't hurt, either. Marvel and Sony struck a deal last year to share the character, the top Marvel character from a merchandise perspective, said Iger. That means Disney probably expects fans to snap up Spider-Man toys and products next year when ""Spider-Man: Homecoming"" hits theaters.

692,ABC,"Walt Disney (DIS) shares plummeted late Tuesday on a second-quarter miss, as the House of Mouse noted a decline in both ESPN subscribers and the sports network's advertising revenue.But CEO Bob Iger sees a ""very robust marketplace and a very strong upfront"" season ahead for both ABC and ESPN, he said during the post-earnings call.Shares sank 5% late, after closing the regular session up 1.2%.ESPN didn't consume the Q2 call as it did during the previous quarter, but Iger did say that the channel's inclusion in over-the-top bundles correlated with some ""very encouraging sign-ups.""Instead, focus drifted to Hulu, which has become an ""important investment for us not just as a distributor but as a buyer of original product,"" according to Iger, and he put Hulu's recently announced live-TV package as a ""best of cable approach"" that lies somewhere between a big, expanded bundle and lighter packages, such as those from Dish Network’s (DISH) Sling TV.Disney is ""fully aligned"" with joint Hulu co-owner 21st Century Fox (FOXA) on a strategy for the over-the-top platform, he said, and doesn't foresee Disney having issues related to being both a content distributor and a content creator.The lookout for a successor to Iger's chief exec spot also came up, as Wall Street tries to anticipate who will take the helm of the media titan.Iger was mum on the circumstances of Tom Staggs' recent exit from the COO post, but confirmed that he has no plans to extend his contract beyond June 2018, when he is currently scheduled to step down as CEO.The board is ""actively engaged in a succession process as it has been for some time,"" he said, and the board believes it has ""ample time"" to identify a successor.The media conglomerate's Q2 earnings per share grew 11% to $1.36, excluding items, and revenue rose 4% to $12.97 billion, falling short of expected adjusted EPS of $1.40 on $13.19 billion in revenue.Media networks revenue, which includes the cable networks and broadcasting units, was ""relatively flat"" at $5.8 billion. Cable networks revenue fell 2%, while broadcasting revenue rose 3%.ESPN revenue rose, but advertising revenue notably decreased, and the company said affiliate revenue growth was ""partially offset by a decline in subscribers."" Iger had said in a February call that ESPN had experienced a slight uptick in subscribers in recent months.Studio revenue shot up 22% to $2.1 billion, bolstered by the theatrical success of ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" and the recently released ""Zootopia.""Parks and resorts revenue rose 4% to $3.9 billion. The anticipated Shanghai Disney Resort opens on June 16.Consumer products and interactive media revenues fell 2% to $1.2 billion.Notably, Disney shuttered its Infinity console games business, taking a $147 million charge during the quarter. While the company ""did quite well"" with the first iteration and ""OK"" with the second iteration, console gaming is a changing business that ""we didn't have the confidence"" to stay in, said Iger during the call, asserting that Disney was better off staying in licensing than publishing.RELATED:Verizon, Disney Bury The Hatchet Over ESPN, Skinny TV BundleWhat ‘Captain America: Civil War’ Means For Disney Ahead Of Earnings

693,ABC,"If conventional wisdom ruled in this election cycle thus far, America's most prominent journalists would have painted the traditional portrait of the candidates. They would show Hillary Clinton and the Democrats warmly reminding the country of her husband's allegedly centrist presidency. Whoever the Republicans nominated would either be declared by the media as too conservative to win, or be utterly ruined by trying to placate those crazy Tea Party people who inevitably make the moderates unelectable.But Clinton's long and frustrating march to put away her socialist competitor Bernie Sanders has disrupted the narrative. She cannot package herself as centrist. The media elite will admit Sanders has dragged her to the left. But that doesn't mean her increasing leftism could damage the Democratic Party with independent voters.Consider the liberal-media huddle they call ""Washington Week"" on PBS. On April 15, Time magazine's Washington bureau chief, Michael Scherer, was blunt.""There's the race for delegates, which Bernie Sanders is losing and Hillary is winning and almost certainly will win,"" Scherer said. ""But there's this other race between them about how far left he could push her. And every time she moved a little bit, he seemed to celebrate and get the crowd going and say, 'Look, see, I did that, she said $15-an-hour minimum wage instead of $12.' ... It's not that she wouldn't be happy if (this) came true, but, you know, she's created a very modulated campaign so far.""Actually, that's contradictory on its face. She  wanted  to create a very modulated campaign, but has capitulated instead, and not just on economic issues. The Clintons have been dragged away from Bill Clinton's crime bill and welfare reform in the wake of the onslaught of the Black Lives Matter movement.On the same PBS show, New York Times political correspondent Jonathan Martin implied that bowing to the radical left is simply acknowledging reality: ""It's a reflection of today's Democratic Party that that's what she has to get to. She doesn't have a choice in the matter. She has got to accommodate a party that is very different today than it was when Bill Clinton ran, you know, in '92.""At no time in this insular little bubble conversation did they talk about consequences. Drifting too far to the left doomed the Democratic candidates in 1968, 1972, 1980, 1984, 1988, 2000 and 2004.Liberal reporters like Sanders' influence on Clinton. They equate socialism with the conscience of the country. His candidacy is welcome because it's pushing her toward the radical positioning they favor.This is why Sanders has outperformed Clinton when pitted against the Republican candidates in head-to-head polls. Because he's still perceived by some as having little chance of winning the nomination, no one is really bothering to hammer him for being extreme, and not much focus has been put on the nagging hypocrisy that he's a millionaire with two homes and donated only 4% of his income to charity.They've loved Sanders from the start. In February 2015, ABC's David Wright gushed that Sanders is ""as unabashedly progressive as Ben & Jerry's. ... Sanders rails against the corrupting influence of money in politics. He stands for economic justice. ... He's not just for raising the minimum wage, he wants to double it.""If forced to describe someone who is as staunchly on the right as Sanders is on the left, ABC probably wouldn't sound delighted. They would need a motion-sickness bag to get through it. The media's location on the ideological spectrum is so close to Ben and Jerry's you can almost taste the Cherry Garcia.

694,ABC,"Walt Disney (DIS) could solve a couple of problems if it acquired streaming video leader Netflix (NFLX), maverick Wall Street analyst Richard Greenfield said Friday in a blog post.Disney CEO Bob Iger is facing two big concerns: succession planning and the erosion of its ABC and ESPN broadcast businesses, Greenfield said.Iger is scheduled to retire in 2018, but he is without an heir apparent after the surprise departure this week of Chief Operating Officer Thomas Skaggs.Meanwhile, the company's cable and broadcast businesses are facing a loss of viewers who are shifting more to on-demand Internet video services like Netflix. ESPN in particular is in trouble because it overpaid for NBA and other sports broadcast licenses before subscriber losses from cord-cutting became apparent, Greenfield said.Acquiring Netflix would give Disney a foothold in on-demand video distribution and a future leader in Netflix CEO Reed Hastings, Greenfield said.“Netflix is already a great friend of Disney,” Greenfield said. “In fact, Iger has repeatedly acknowledged how they are in part responsible for Netflix’s success. … Disney continues to sell more and more content to Netflix spanning movies and television series, while at the same time struggling to get their own direct-to-consumer content business off the ground in the U.K.”Netflix wouldn’t come cheap. The firm has a market capitalization of $44 billion vs. $157 billion for Disney. And Greenfield wonders whether Disney’s board would make such a bold acquisition.“We doubt Disney’s board comprehends just how much trouble their broadcast/cable network assets are facing to seek a transaction so near-term dilutive as Netflix, especially given the incredible success they are having contentwise in 2016,” he said.If Disney acquired Netflix, it could offer subscribers a bundle of on-demand video from Netflix and live sports from ESPN.“Combining Disney and Netflix effectively re-creates the best of the legacy video bundle, removes the distributor, packaging together great content with best-in-class technology spanning all devices consumers love to use,” he said.In midday trading in the stock market today, Disney was down a fraction, near 96, and Netflix was down more than 1%, near 103.

695,ABC,"Now that it looks like the GOP nomination won't be decided until a contested convention in Cleveland, Donald Trump and his supporters assert that the whole system is undemocratic.But if democracy was organized to give everyone a fair and equal shot to impress voters with their knowledge and experience, then our system has been rigged for Trump for the last nine months. The media -- not just the liberal media, but some ""conservative"" media, too -- have been the gale-force wind beneath Trump's wings.On the nightly news shows on ABC, CBS and NBC, Trump has far outpaced anyone other GOP candidate for attention. From last July through April 6, he's drawn 1,228 minutes of airtime, or 56% of the total coverage of the Republican primary race. The other 16 candidates have split the remaining 44%. Trump's closest rival, Sen. Ted Cruz, has only been granted 269 minutes of airtime, or 12%. That's roughly a 5-to-1 disparity. Gov. John Kasich has received only 46 minutes, or 2.1% of the Republican nightly news pie. Even when Cruz or Kasich win a primary, the dominant story is Trump stumbling, not them winning. It's Trump or virtually nothing by design.The media carnival for Trump was intense in the beginning, with the reality TV star getting 71% of the coverage in July and August last year. Now we're late in the primaries and nothing's changed. When the field shrunk to three candidates in March, Trump surged again with 72% of the coverage. He was given 267 minutes of airtime, compared to just 52 minutes for Cruz (14%) and a mere 18 minutes for Kasich (4.8%).Even in the first week of April, when Cruz won Wisconsin, Trump drew 74.5% of news minutes. Overall, Trump has received more than four times the coverage as Cruz, and 26 times more times than Kasich. Forget about fairness and balance. Anyone who tunes in is aware that the networks' coverage of Trump is often negative, but they still deny airtime to his opponents.Defenders of this overcoverage insist that Trump is the most newsworthy one, so his actions make the most news. But the problem is not just the quantity of Trump segments, but the quality. Reporters let his bluster and theatrics dominate, and they ignore the substance of his assertions.Take the delegate selection in Colorado. News headlines everywhere covered Trump complaining that the Colorado primary was rigged, saying, ""I'm hundreds of delegates ahead, but the system, folks, is rigged. It's a rigged, disgusting, dirty system."" What was not news, except as a rejoinder by a Cruz partisan (whose very presence cast suspicion on the veracity of the ""opinion""), is that Trump is not being truthful.Colorado established its delegate rules last August, and Trump either didn't have an organization in the state, or he didn't care. The real story is Trump dishonestly crying foul about every state he loses: Every loss is due to stupid voters and/or a corrupt process. Show us how many networks have made that a story.In effect, the media have handed Trump the microphone and let him say whatever he wants about anything he wishes. It has granted him credibility no matter how outrageous the claim, and has let him control the campaign narrative.It's quite possible in the coming months that, even if Trump is denied the nomination, he will continue to dominate the narrative. Just as he still dominates after Cruz wins primaries, he could dominate if someone else becomes the nominee, by constantly needling whoever took his place. Whether or not he could succeed or even run as a third-party candidate, the media could continue to let Trump's commentary on the campaign dominate.Let's have full disclosure here: We have personally endorsed Ted Cruz, which for some might cast doubt on this column. But we challenge you to dispute any of what is written above.

696,ABC,"Nice guys finish last, the saying goes. But whoever said it never met bowling great Dick Weber.“He was the greatest ambassador in the history of the game,” Professional Bowlers Association Commissioner Tom Clark told IBD. “Everybody liked Dick Weber, even the guy he was beating.”And he beat plenty of them. Weber (1929-2005):Won 30 PBA tour events, including senior tournaments. Won a tournament in each of six decades, one of only two men to do that.Entered the PBA Hall of Fame in 1975.Took top honors in a 1999 Bowling Magazine poll as the Greatest Bowler of the Century.And that just scratches the lane of his honors.His feats on the boards provided a platform to promote the game, and Weber is admired almost as much for his selfless dedication to that effort. Uniformly, those who remember him recall the quality of his character, whether he was participating in bowling or promoting it.“Dick Weber was a star and carried himself with a level of class with history in mind,” Clark said. “He elevated the entire game. That’s why everyone in bowling speaks of him in such glowing terms.”Weber’s professional life paralleled the rising popularity of 10-pin bowling in America. An Indianapolis native and self-described bowling alley bum, he set pins for pennies a game as a kid. While working as a mail carrier, he built a reputation in local professional tournaments.But a bigger lane was about to open.In 1955, Weber moved to Florissant, Mo., near St. Louis, to join the legendary five-man Budweiser match bowling team, sponsored by the beer maker. Bowling with him were Don Carter, Ray Bluth, Tom Hennessey and Pat Patterson, all future PBA Hall of Famers.The St. Louis Sports Hall of Fame said that they were “considered the equivalent of the 1927 New York Yankees.” At the 1958 National Team Match Games, they bowled a combined 3,858 pins, setting a record lasting almost 36 years.Also in 1958, another lane opened. Weber put his name among the founding members of the Professional Bowlers Association. Of the tour’s first 23 events, Weber won 10 of them, including seven victories in 1961.Something was about to happen that would be much bigger than a win or even a handful of them. It would expand bowling’s popularity and make Weber a superstar: television.In 1962, ABC launched its “Pro Bowlers Tour” on Saturday afternoons. Just a year later, says Pricenomics.com, “Harry Smith, the top bowler in 1963, made more money than (baseball's National League) MVP Sandy Koufax and NFL MVP Y.A. Tittle combined.”The televised tour often led into ABC’s “Wide World of Sports,” and Clark points out that TV technology of the day -- one or two stationary cameras -- favored a sport like bowling.In the 1960s, bowling was the big league, and Weber was its superstar.“Bowling was a pioneer in the sports world on television, and Dick Weber was the face of that,” Clark said. “He was not only one of the best bowlers from a talent standpoint, but he was very charismatic. He had a face like a movie star and carried himself like a professional.”If bowling had a reputation as a pastime for a rowdy, beer-swilling crowd, Weber knocked it down like a five-seven split.Trim, fit, standing straight, always a smile for every fan, always a signature for every autograph hound, he was in bowling’s heyday the approachable star adored by fans and respected by peers.Recall that Weber was one of two men to win tournaments in six straight decades. The other, Johnny Petraglia, got into bowling because of Dick Weber.“I had fallen in love with bowling at an early age, and I was 13 years old in 1960 when they built two lanes in Madison Square Garden for a bowling exhibition with Don Carter and Dick Weber,” Petraglia, yet another PBA Hall of Famer, told IBD. “I went to watch, and I was extremely impressed by Weber, not only the bowler but the kind of person he was. At the age of 13, I said, ‘I know what I want to do now. I want to be like Dick Weber.’ ”So inspired, Petraglia set a goal to be good enough to turn pro at 18. He did and won his first tournament at 19.“He was a tremendous influence on my life,” Petraglia said. “His class, the way he had about him and everything he did for the sport.”Petraglia and others liken Weber’s role in bowling to that of Arnold Palmer in golf.“Like Palmer, he’s the one who got everyone interested in the sport,” Clark said.In the locker room, Petraglia recalled, no special place was set aside for Weber, no star treatment. He greeted everyone with a smile and treated everyone as an equal.“My second PBA event was in Denver, and I was 18 years old,” Petraglia said. “Surprisingly, I made the finals, and I’m bowling (against) Dick Weber. I blurted out, ‘Does life get any better than this?’ I knew I had a front row seat to greatness. It’s a wonderful feeling, and that’s what Dick Weber meant.”In the 1980s and 1990s, bowling felt the squeeze from other televised sports, like football and basketball, along with the overall decline in bowling league play. ABC broadcast its final Saturday tour in 1997.But for Weber, even as interest in bowling declined, he remained famous and used his star power to promote his sport. He appeared several times on “Late Night With David Letterman,” where producers improvised a bowling lane outside on West 53rd Street in New York City. Weber proceeded to knock down a set of pins, a TV set, a pyramid of champagne glasses filled with flaming brandy and a fishbowl full of gum balls.Weber was about more than professional events. He owned a bowling center in Florissant and brought the same dedication to that work.“He was all-out, no matter what,” said Pete Weber, Dick’s son and also a Hall of Fame bowler. “If he was in a bowling tournament, he bowled because he felt like he could win. At the bowling center he owned, he was there every day at 5:30 a.m. and always very gracious with his customers. No wonder he was well liked. He was gracious to everyone.”His excellence in sports and business extended to his role as husband and father, too.“He was a great dad. He was very supportive of whatever we wanted to do,” Pete Weber said. “He was a sports fanatic, and he came to all our games he could. Softball. Baseball. He would argue with the umps. He taught us if you wanted to win, then you win. No one is going to give anything to you.”Dick Weber’s lifetime tournament earnings of $930,000 don’t sound like much now, but he also enjoyed a decades-long sponsorship with AMF Bowling. He lived modestly in the home that he first bought with his wife, Juanita, when they moved near St. Louis. That's where they raised their four children, Pete, Paula, Rich and John.Even now, 11 years after Dick Weber died at age 75, emotion fills Pete Weber’s voice as he speaks of him.“It has been an honor and privilege to be his son,” he said.A particular Johnny Petraglia memory might offer the best insight into the total package of Dick Weber.Petraglia hosted a charity bowling match in the late 1990s in New Jersey. He asked Weber to participate, and the great veteran did so without hesitation.In addition to the exhibition match, Weber sold kisses for a dollar, and fans were lined up.Later, Petraglia realized that Weber had never filed an expense report to get reimbursed for travel, hotels and food.“Six months down the line,"" said Petraglia, ""I asked him about it again. ‘I can’t even find the son of bitch,’ he told me. ‘It’s for charity; just leave it alone.’ He never charged me a nickel.”Expanded professional bowling’s reach and status with world-class skill, movie-star looks and unfailing kindness to fans and competitors.Overcame: Bowling’s decline in popularity.Lesson: In whatever you do, go full tilt and be gracious to all you meet.“Mine is a straight, nothing-fancy, down-and-in delivery.”

723,ABC,"President Obama touted his signature namesake, ObamaCare, during an international news conference in Europe Monday. He said the health care plan's costs are lower than even optimistic predictions and ""none"" of the doomsday scenarios of its unworkability have come true. Obama skipped around any of the plan's chronic problems, such as the continued spike in emergency room visits and disappointing word that ObamaCare missed its 2015 enrollment goal by 22%.In his remarks in Germany, the Democrat also slipped in some attempted intimidation of the Supreme Court, which will announce its decision on state exchanges any day. He expressed his disapproval through a bit of rhetorical overkill:""There is no reason why the existing exchanges should be overturned through a court case. ... This should be an easy case. Frankly, it probably shouldn't even have been taken up ... a contorted reading of the statute. ... It's a bad idea. It's not something that should be done based on a twisted interpretation of four words. ... I'm optimistic that the Supreme Court will play it straight.""Now that he's back home in time for Game 3 of the NBA Finals, Obama may be disappointed to learn that Americans disagree with him strongly on ObamaCare. A new ABC News/Washington Post Poll finds that only 39% favor the cumbersome law that the president predicted people would embrace once they read it.The more they experience the law, the less Americans seem to like it, according to the new survey. ObamaCare support has plummeted 10 points, or 20%, in just the past year to match the all-time low support from three years ago. With premiums set to increase sharply and hit consumers' pocketbooks, the outlook isn't good for much immediate improvement.A convincing majority of the 1,001 adults — 54% — polled oppose ObamaCare, approaching the all-time high for disapproval of the law.Opposition focuses on the individual mandate, as it has since the beginning of polling in the fall of 2009 when 50% opposed it.Fading support for the law crosses all demographic groups and is tied, as always, to partisan feelings. Not surprising since the massive measure rolled through a Democratic Congress without a single Republican vote.Self-described liberals and Democrats favor ObamaCare 2-to-1. But opposition is 51% among moderates, 56% among independents, 78% among Republicans and 82% of ""strong conservatives.""Although Obama aimed the law at lower-income groups, support for the law is highest among people with higher incomes and higher educations. Also it's higher in urban areas and among blacks. Sixty-four percent of them favor ObamaCare, exactly twice the rate of support among whites.No one ever accused Americans of being consistent in their opinions. The ABC survey also found that while they don't like the law in growing numbers, 77% of its supporters want Supreme Court justices to keep the plan's federal insurance subsidies.Andrew Malcolm is IBD's national politics columnist.

767,ABC,"Homeland Insecurity: With multiple bomb threats against U.S. airlines, it's even more discomfiting to know the agency tasked with protecting airlines from explosives couldn't find them in recent undercover testing.Five planes were grounded Tuesday after a suspected Islamic State ""lone wolf"" phoned in bomb threats to TSA headquarters against multiple flights bound for Philadelphia, San Francisco, Chicago, Atlanta and Mexico.Just as the bomb scare sent airports reeling, the Obama regime axed its acting Transportation Security Administration chief. His removal follows news that TSA checkpoint screeners failed to detect mock bombs and guns in 95% of tests carried out by so-called Red Team agents.The outrageously high failure rate was discovered at dozens of the nation's busiest airports. Screeners failed a whopping 67 out of 70 tests, with agents repeatedly managing to sneak through potential weapons.In one test, ABC said, ""an undercover agent was stopped after setting off an alarm at a magnetometer, but TSA screeners failed to detect a fake explosive device that was taped to his back during a follow-on pat-down.""Red Team agents complained about similarly bad performance in the months leading up to the 9/11 hijackings, when they tested airport security screening for the FAA. ""Things are worse now than before 9/11,"" former senior FAA special agent Brian Sullivan warned.""It is so depressing, infuriating and sad to see that, despite all we've done, our government still fails to protect the American people in this regard,"" he told IBD.Equally depressing is the exorbitant price taxpayers have paid for that incompetence. ""TSA has spent billions, and most of it is wasted,"" former FAA Red Team agent Steve Elson also told us.Despite spending more than $540 million for checked-baggage screening gear and another $11 million for training since 2009, when an internal review found serious holes in the system, the $8 billion-a-year agency has failed to make any real improvements in that critical area either.A recent DHS Inspector General report found ""vulnerabilities"" throughout the luggage-scanning system, including both human and technological errors.TSA can't even keep its personnel or space secure. In a separate report released last month, the IG found numerous breaches of secure areas by ""unauthorized individuals.""TSA is also failing to screen its screeners properly. At least five airports have granted TSA security badges to people with criminal records.This is highly troubling given that TSA is now contracting out for screeners and hiring more Muslims to work checkpoints. A couple of years ago, TSA had to reprimand a Muslim screener at JFK Airport for manning an unplugged metal detector.Meanwhile, thousands of TSA badges have gone missing at airports in Atlanta, San Diego and elsewhere. They were lost or stolen over the past two years.Your government at work. Feel safer yet?

769,ABC,"When the dust settles on this wild and wacky GOP primary season, there will be at least one clear Biggest Loser: the Republican National Committee.After 2012, when liberal journalists routinely hijacked the party's 20 televised debates while cashing in on ratings and advertising revenue, the RNC resolved to change its narrative-surrendering business as usual.There would be no more cable TV anchors belligerently taking President Obama's side while arguing with the GOP nominee (as Candy Crowley infamously did with Mitt Romney over Benghazi).There would be no more former Democratic operatives turned journalists injecting their left-wing social agenda into GOP primary forums (as Clinton advisor turned ABC newsman George Stephanopoulous did at the January 2012 Republican debate in New Hampshire when he pushed the Democrats' War on Women propaganda by pressing Republicans on a nonsense contraceptive ban.)And there would be real balance in the selection of moderators, through partnerships ""with conservative media to make sure the concerns of grassroots Republicans are addressed.""RNC chairman Reince Priebus declared in 2014 after the committee adopted measures to reassert control over the process: ""The liberal media doesn't deserve to be in the driver's seat.""How's that working out? It's the same old, same old. Last week's debate hosted by CNN was commandeered by Telemundo celebrity journalist Maria Celeste Arraras, known as ""the Katie Couric of Spanish TV,"" who soaked up nearly half the show representing ""the Latino community"" on issues such as Puerto Rico's bankruptcy.It shouldn't have been a surprise to the RNC. Arraras did the same during a Democratic presidential debate in 2004, when she argued with candidates about driver's licenses for immigrants here illegally.The lone conservative token questioner, Salem Radio talk show host Hugh Hewitt, received a fraction of the time. The infamous ""screaming lady"" in the audience earned far more buzz.Hewitt had made an earlier appearance in the second debate hosted by CNN last September. But again, he was relegated to the margins. As even the left-wing New York Times pointed out, the network ""came to the second Republican primary debate looking for a fight"" along with an agenda of setting up ""catfights"" between Donald Trump and the rest of the candidates.Conservative blogger Scott Johnson of Power Line noted that instead of giving GOP voters ""a chance to assess the strengths of the candidates and to pick the strongest candidate to achieve their objective ... (CNN moderator) Jake Tapper had other ideas in mind. His consignment of Hugh Hewitt to the witness protection program is representative of his pursuit of other ideas.""The third debate hosted by CNBC in Boulder was deemed a complete disaster by observers across the political spectrum.Instead of focusing on economics, as the network and RNC promised they would, the ""moderators"" made themselves the center of attention with trivial and condescending questions designed to instigate circus conflicts between personalities instead of enlightening viewers about actual policy differences between candidates.Again, this shouldn't have been a surprise to the RNC. CNBC chief clown John Harwood had a long public record of running interference for Hillary Clinton, denigrating conservative critics of ObamaCare and shrugging at convicted infant murderer and abortionist Kermit Gosnell.As for giving actual conservatives a central chance to address the candidates directly, the RNC yielded to Google during the seventh debate in Iowa in January. We didn't hear from grassroots voters who had their health insurance canceled because of ObamaCare or business owners negatively affected by Dodd-Frank or victims of illegal alien crime who oppose amnesty.Instead, the privileged questioners included a YouTube fashionista who had crossed the border illegally from Mexico as a child and a Muslim activist who spread debunked, CAIR-style propaganda about ""Islamophobia"" hate crimes in America.The ninth debate, hosted by CBS in South Carolina, was moderated by John Dickerson, a Beltway liberal elite who called on President Obama to ""go for the throat!"", ""declare war on the Republican Party"" and ""pulverize"" his political enemies over gun control, climate change and immigration.The event was remarkable not so much for any overt political bias as it was for a complete lack of control over both the candidates and the audience.And, of course, no one remembers anything about the first debate other than the feud between Fox News Channel anchor Megyn Kelly and Donald Trump.The obvious, effective solution is to wrest control from mainstream media networks and hold debates sponsored by conservative media outlets with conservative journalists and broadcast/simulcast on neutral ground (hello, C-SPAN!). The RNC had one such debate in the works but abandoned the idea last month.For the candidates, continuing with these rigged charades is an exercise in futility and masochism. For the RNC, it's suicide. By its passivity and complicity, the current batch of GOP enablers have proved that they don't deserve to be in the driver's seat.

770,ABC,"Amazon.com (AMZN) is moving closer to launching a live TV streaming service to complement its Prime video service, which offers movies and on-demand content, analysts speculate in the wake of media companies' earnings calls.In the pay-TV industry, ""virtual MVPD"" (multi-channel video programming distributor) is a term for a cable-TV-like service delivered via the Internet.“Amazon appears most likely to launch a virtual MVPD in 2016,” Pacific Crest Securities analyst Andy Hargreaves said in a research report. “Amazon was hinted at multiple times throughout the quarter as being in negotiations with content providers in the hopes of launching a video product in the future.”AMC Networks (AMCX) referred to ongoing “experimentation” at Amazon on its Q4 earnings call on Feb. 25. Walt Disney (DIS), meanwhile, mentioned Amazon while discussing ESPN’s streaming strategy on Feb. 17.Satellite TV broadcaster Dish Network (DISH) has more than 500,000 subscribers to its “Sling” Web TV service, launched in early 2015, analysts estimate. However, Sling does not offer live content from the four major broadcast networks (ABC, CBS, Fox and NBC).Bloomberg reported in October that Amazon was in talks with Comcast’s (CMCSA) NBCUniversal, CBS (CBS) and others.Amazon’s challenge would be aggregating content licensed from major programming networks. Apple (AAPL) reportedly has, for now, broken off talks with the broadcast networks for a Web TV service.If Amazon’s offers live content, it would set itself apart from Netflix (NFLX) and Hulu, both of which do not. Amazon, like Netflix, has already moved into producing original content.One Amazon strategy could be licensing content for current seasons of popular programming now available mainly from pay-TV companies. Federal regulators are probing the influence of cable TV companies over content deals, the Wall Street Journal reported Sunday.In a report in mid-February, Jefferies noted that Amazon’s Prime video service offers the most content from CBS, including “Vegas.” Its on-demand shows, though, are from prior broadcast seasons.“Relative to Netflix and Hulu, Amazon Prime carries significantly less network programming,” said the Jefferies report. “Overall, the platform only carries nine fall shows aired between 2012 and 2015, six of which aired on CBS.”Amazon in 2015  licensed season-one episodes from NBCUniversal’s hit, “Mr. Robot,” which airs on the USA Network. Amazon also signed content deals with AMC Networks and Time Warner (TWX) for six seasons of HBO’s “Sex and the City.”

771,ABC,"MADISON, Wis. -- The Super Tuesday primaries underscore how super Southern our presidential nominating process has become. This makes our way of picking standard-bearers unrepresentative of the country as a whole.In particular, it sharply reduces the influence of the great American Midwest even though the region's states are among the most important general-election battlegrounds.Southernization is a special problem for Republicans because their Southern supporters tend to be far more socially conservative than the rest of the party or the country. Southern politics is also more deeply polarized around race, giving backlash candidates a leg up.The GOP's slide rightward creates electoral difficulties for it in presidential elections and is the central factor in Washington's inability to find consensus on much of anything.True, the whole carnival starts in Iowa, which is as Midwestern as you can get. But the caucus system gives more conservative Iowa Republicans an out-sized influence because white evangelicals play a disproportionate role in what is a relatively low-turnout contest.It is to the evangelicals' credit as democratic citizens that they organize, mobilize and participate. But their civic virtuousness only makes the final result less reflective of opinion in the party, in Iowa itself and elsewhere.New Hampshire comes next, and its voters frequently reach verdicts at odds with those Iowa renders. This means South Carolina often plays a tie-breaking role on the GOP side. Talk about shifting the dialogue right: The site of the opening skirmish of the Civil War is not only one of the most conservative states in the nation; it is also one of our most racially divided polities.All of 1% of this year's Palmetto State Republican primary voters were African-American, according to the network exit poll -- yes, 1%. Some 96% were white.The matter of diversity is why the Southernized process is less problematic for Democrats. Having the South vote early gives the party’s large and loyal African-American constituency a significant role in choosing a nominee.In Hillary Clinton’s sweep of Saturday's South Carolina primary, black voters cast about 60% of the ballots and gave her a margin of roughly 6-to-1 over Bernie Sanders, according to exit polls reported by ABC.Pushing Nevada's voting dates up has diversified the calendar a bit, but now we confront Super Tuesday. It includes primaries in Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas and Virginia.Yes, this Southern-fried, hickory-smoked mix is leavened by primaries in Massachusetts and Vermont, caucuses in Colorado and Minnesota, and, on the Republican side, a ""preference poll"" in Alaska. But there's a reason why the day is often called the ""SEC primary,"" after the Southeastern college sports conference.Not until March 8 does a big Midwestern state (Michigan) vote, and not until March 15 do Illinois and Ohio weigh in. Wisconsin doesn't hold its primary until April 5, and Indiana will not be casting its ballots until May 3.The Dixiefied calendar is now an issue in Republican presidential maneuvering, with the possibility that the Midwest would be further disenfranchised. Republican honchos may have presided over a party that ""brought to life"" and ""fed"" the ""Frankenstein monster"" they see in Donald Trump.Never mind. The feckless establishmentarians now have the temerity to tell Ohio Gov. John Kasich that he should do his part in their belated anti-Trump operation by dropping out in support of Florida Sen. Marco Rubio -- even though Rubio has yet to win a single primary.Kasich is saying no dice, and he is wholly right to insist that his own base be heard from before he calls it a day. There's a strong case that Kasich is far better prepared to be president than Rubio is, and that Kasich's tonally (and, to some degree, substantively) more moderate brand of conservatism has more appeal outside Republican ranks than Rubio's narrow conservative orthodoxy.In any event, it's clear that if the GOP's powers-that-be forced Kasich out before Michigan and Ohio voted, they would be confirming for all to see that their party only has room for Southerners (Rubio and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz) or, in the case of Trump, Northerners who speak the Republican South's language on immigration, race and nationalism.High-minded thinkers regularly bemoan the sharp polarization of American politics and wring hands earnestly over why this has come to pass. One of the principal causes is the Southernization of Abraham Lincoln's party, and our primary process only makes it harder for those who would reverse the trend.

772,ABC,"Apple’s excuses for defying a federal order to help the FBI unlock the San Bernardino terrorist’s iPhone and save lives have gone from hyperbolic to apocalyptic. Relax, Big Brother won’t creep into your phone if it complies.In a filing Friday to block the court order, Apple claimed it was being forced to let the government spy on ""hundreds of millions"" of people.""This is not a case about one isolated iPhone,” the company said. ""Rather, this case is about the FBI seeking a dangerous power to force companies like Apple to undermine the basic security and privacy interests of hundreds of millions of individuals around the globe.""The FBI has repeatedly called on Apple to help break into the iPhone 5c of Syed Farook, who, along with his wife, killed 14 and wounded 22 at a Christmas party last year. Last week, a federal judge ordered Apple to help agents. Now GOP presidential candidates are weighing in on the escalating battle, with both Sens. Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz arguing at Thursday’s debate that Apple should comply.While privacy concerns are real, given the recent NSA controversy, they are overblown in this case. Rights won’t be compromised if Apple cooperates with authorities. Here are 10 reasons why:1. Technology is already solving privacy issues. What the FBI is asking Apple to do (with overwhelming probable cause) can’t be done in future phone models.According to Wired magazine, Apple is adding an impenetrable “secure enclave” to the next generation of iPhone models, making concerns about the FBI gaining a “back door” into everybody's smart phones moot. Though the terrorist’s iPhone 5c would be affected by Apple helping the FBI unlock its software protection, any spying concerns would be confined to that older model. It won't compromise the privacy of all Apple customers.2. Contrary to Apple’s statement, this case is indeed about “one isolated iPhone.” The FBI is not asking for a master key to get into all phones, just one to unlock Farook’s, which agents believe contains the names of other terrorists and clues to other plots.3. The FBI says in court briefings that Apple can keep the software code needed to override the security system on the iPhone 5c and destroy it after the phone is unlocked.4. It also states that the work on the phone will be conducted ""at an Apple facility,"" and that the software never has to come into the government’s custody.5. More important, the so-called software image file, or SIF, “will be coded by Apple with a unique identifier of the phone so that the SIF would only load and execute on the subject device.""6. Even if the FBI somehow obtained the disabling code, or a software tool to break into other iPhone 5 models, it would still need a warrant and court order to use it.7. Apple has complied with much-less-significant FBI investigations of Apple devices running similar versions of the operating system on the 5c. Apple is no privacy purist.8. The late Farook didn’t own his phone. It’s the property of his employer, the San Bernardino County government, which gave the FBI permission to crack into it.9. The FBI has given Apple the option of using an “alternative technological means” to hack into the phone and has offered to pay whatever it takes to do it. In other words, it doesn’t care about the software, just getting at Farook’s texts, contacts, emails and photos.10. This is a national security imperative, a unique case where patriotism trumps privacy. ABC News is reporting that the FBI suspects a third terrorist may have been involved in the San Bernardino massacre, which may explain why agents recently raided Syed Farook’s brother’s home. There is an increasing likelihood more terrorists are on the loose and plotting more strikes, ramping up the urgency to unlock the phone.Bottom line: Apple is thwarting the public interest in a full investigation of the deadliest act of terrorism on U.S. soil since 9/11, effectively obstructing investigators from finding clues to other terrorists.The clock is ticking. Apple should stop the histrionics, quit worrying about its brand and business model, and start working to help the FBI before we have another San Bernardino -- or perhaps a Cupertino.• Sperry, formerly IBD Washington bureau chief, is author of “Infiltration: How Muslim Spies and Subversives Have Penetrated Washington.""

773,ABC,"The Justice Department on Friday filed a motion to compel Apple to comply with a court order to help the FBI hack an iPhone used by one of the shooters in the San Bernardino, Calif., massacre.Apple earlier in the day had been given a three-day extension, until Feb. 26, to respond to the federal court order issued Tuesday.Apple CEO Tim Cook issued an open letter late Tuesday opposing the court order. He said the order would set a ""dangerous precedent"" and threaten the privacy and security of all its customers. The court's demand would force Apple to write new software that would create a ""backdoor"" to bypass password-protection measures on its smartphones.Tech industry and civil liberties groups have voiced support for Apple's position, while a number of politicians and law enforcement officials have backed the government's stance.The DOJ motion seeks to expedite the court's order that Apple help the FBI in accessing data on an iPhone 5C used by Syed Rizwan Farook, one of the shooters in the Dec. 2 attack, which left 14 people dead. The phone is owned by Farook's former employer, the San Bernardino County Department of Public Health.The FBI wants to see if the iPhone holds data about possible accomplices and links to Islamist terrorist groups like ISIS. But the data is encrypted by default by Apple's iOS operating system. The FBI wants Apple to disable the security option that erases data from an iPhone after 10 unsuccessful attempts to unlock it with a password. Investigators want to crack the password using “brute force” -- electronically entering millions of combinations without risking deletion of the data.""Rather than assist the effort to fully investigate a deadly terrorist attack by obeying this court's order of February 16, 2016, Apple has responded by publicly repudiating that order,"" prosecutors wrote in a new filing Friday, ABC News first reported.The DOJ filing says Apple's refusal to cooperate is ""based on its concern for its business model and public brand marketing strategy,"" AppleInsider reported.

774,ABC,"At her most recent press conference in December, Federal Reserve Board Chair Janet Yellen had this (abbreviated) exchange with ABC News reporter Rebecca Jarvis: Jarvis: Historically, most economic expansions fade after this long. How confident are you that our economy won't slip back into recession in the near term?Yellen: . . . I think it's a myth that expansions die of old age. I do not think they die of old age. So the fact that this has been quite a long expansion doesn't lead me to believe that . . . its days are numbered.Yellen is wrong -- and she has a lot of company. It is an amazing reality that, among economists, the faith in the possibility of endless expansions has survived the 2008-09 financial crisis and the Great Recession.It is true, as Yellen explained, that there is no magic threshold (say, six years) beyond which an economic expansion must give way to a recession, usually defined as two quarters of falling output (gross domestic product).Business cycles differ. But it is also true that the longer an expansion continues, the more it changes attitudes, behavior and spending patterns in ways that doom the expansion. Sooner or later, old age is fatal.Some threats are widely recognized. Pent-up demand for cars or homes is exhausted. Inventories of consumer goods become excessive, as personal purchases slow faster than production. There's over-investment in some sector (example: high tech) that results in bankruptcies. Higher inflation convinces the Fed to raise interest rates. Or there are outside ""shocks"" to the economy -- for instance, a huge jump in oil prices.All these causes are standard. They usually take about a year to work through the system. (The average length of the 12 recessions since 1945 has been 11 months, says the National Bureau of Economic Research, an academic group that designates recessions.)Less understood and more destructive are the widespread changes in economic behavior induced by the two longest business expansions in U.S. history: the 106-month stretch in the 1960s, almost nine years from February 1961 to December 1969; and the decade-long expansion from March 1991 to March 2001.At the time, they seemed pleasurable triumphs; with hindsight, the booms led to destabilizing busts that lasted for years.The 1960s' legacy was inflationary psychology. Government had seemed to promise that, with the right economic policies, it could end recessions and guarantee ""full employment."" This liberated companies and workers from price and wage restraint. The consequences were devastating.In practice, both inflation and unemployment got worse, as the Fed vacillated between fighting one and then the other. Inflation peaked at 13% in 1980. There were four recessions from 1969 to 1981. Americans were frightened. In Gallup polls from 1973 to 1981, they consistently ranked inflation as the nation's No. 1 problem.The boom in the 1990s and early 2000s had a similar, though not identical, effect. The economy seemed to have become less risky. Economists proclaimed the ""Great Moderation"" of the business cycle.The Fed had crushed inflation. By tiny changes in interest rates, it could defuse serious slumps. There were only two mild recessions (1990 and 2001). A less-risky economy justified once-dangerous practices. Banks became overly dependent on short-term borrowings. Home loans could go to less-worthy borrowers because jobs would be plentiful and house prices would always rise, making the collateral stronger.We now know that this was mostly wishful thinking. The economy had not become permanently more stable. Paradoxically, the longer the prosperity lasted, the more it bred self-deceptive and self-destructive thinking. Psychology shifted for the worse, just as in the 1960s.No one wants the present business expansion to end soon. Though the recovery is approaching seven years, it still doesn't feel like a recovery to millions of Americans. As with the 1960s, the aftermath of the boom has been a prolonged period of heightened instability and anxiety. But we also dare not ignore the larger lesson of these episodes.What history teaches is disquieting. It is that the quest for unending prosperity is doomed to fail. Indeed, it may backfire. Periodic recessions and bear markets perform a useful, if distasteful, function. They remind people of risk; they restrain inflation.Too many setbacks, of course, transform a desirable discipline into social tragedy. What is the optimal mix of recessions and expansions? This is a hard, perhaps impossible, question to answer, but economists ought to be trying and aren't.The trouble with thinking that expansions don't die of old age is that they do -- not on any predictable schedule but simply as a practical matter. Ignoring this holds out the false promise that some ideal set of policies can sustain economic expansion forever. It can't.

775,ABC,"National Security: The CIA director confirms that the Islamic State uses chemical weapons days after the director of national intelligence says ISIS is planning attacks on the U.S. homeland in 2016. Connect the dots.CIA Director John Brennan, in a CBS News ""60 Minutes"" interview that will air Sunday, said ISIS has ""used chemical munitions on the battlefield"" and can construct chlorine and mustard gas-releasing weapons.Earlier this week, Defense Intelligence Agency Director Lt. Gen. Vincent Stewart told the Senate Armed Services Committee that ISIS will ""attempt to direct attacks on the U.S. homeland in 2016,"" and that the caliphate is infiltrating the refugees fleeing the ISIS mayhem in Iraq and Syria.At the same hearing on Tuesday, Obama's Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said ISIS operatives are ""pretty skilled at phony passports, so they can travel ostensibly as legitimate travelers,"" with Syrian passport machines having been commandeered by the terrorist organization.The ""Worldwide Threat Assessment of the U.S. Intelligence Community"" Clapper presented to Congress on Tuesday said ISIS ""has become the preeminent terrorist threat.""So ISIS is ""the preeminent terrorist threat"" in the world.It can make and has used weapons of mass destruction.It is hiding among refugees, using fake passports to cross borders.And it will ""attempt to direct attacks on the U.S. homeland in 2016.""Can we please put two and two together? If ISIS is going to cross our border and attack America, why wouldn't it shoot for the moon and use chemical weapons against us in assaults that would make the 9/11 attacks look like a walk in the park?ISIS wouldn't even have to smuggle them in. ABC News recently asked experts such as Michael Allswede of the Department of Emergency Medicine at the University of Pittsburgh and Thomas Inglesby of the Center for Civilian Biodefense Studies at Johns Hopkins University about terrorists making chemical weapons surreptitiously within the U.S.""Because they're relatively easy and inexpensive to manufacture, chemical weapons have long been considered 'the poor man's atomic bomb,' "" they said, and ""could be dispersed from a crop-dusting plane, from aerosols, or by distributing the chemical in water supplies.""This nation should be on Code Red right now with a ""severe risk of terrorist attack"" -- a WMD terrorist attack that could kill many thousands. Except that President Obama abolished the color-coded terrorism threat advisory scale five years ago.

776,ABC,"JPMorgan is bullish on the upcoming “Broadcast Incentive Auction,” which will free up prime, low-frequency airwaves owned by local TV broadcasters for wireless data services.Naysayers continue to contend that the Federal Communications Commission faces many challenges in pulling off a successful auction, which for now is scheduled to start late next month. One risk is that broadcasters might drop out of the auction if they determine that bidding prices are disappointing.The auction is key for T-Mobile US (TMUS), which needs spectrum. AT&T (T) and Verizon Communications (VZ) own most of the available low-frequency spectrum, in which waves travel longer distances, among other advantages over higher-frequency spectrum.JPMorgan expects at least 70 MHz of airwaves, and possibly more, to be auctioned. The key is that broadcasters that own two local TV stations will sell off airwaves from one and keep spectrum from the other, says JPMorgan.“We estimate that 70-100 MHz will be auctioned, for $25 billion to $35 billion,” said JPMorgan in a research report.Twenty-First Century Fox (FOXA) and CBS (CBS) are expected to sell airwaves in some markets. While Comcast’s (CMCSA) cable company is a potential bidder, it also owns media firm NBCUniversal, a likely seller of airwaves.Smaller local TV station owners include Sinclair Broadcast Group (SBGI) and Gray Television (GTNA).“We view FOX and CBS as best positioned to monetize duopoly affiliates in large markets, followed by Comcast and Sinclair,” said JPMorgan. Walt Disney (DIS), which owns ABC, is not expected to sell airwaves. Private investment firms such as Columbia Capital are eyeing the auction, says a Washington Post report.JPMorgan predicts cable TV firms will show up, but it doubts that Internet giants will bid.""We expect that AT&T, Verizon, and T-Mobile will be the biggest bidders ($21 billion-$30 billion cumulative spend), that Sprint (S)/SoftBank (SFTBY) will not register, and Dish Network (DISH) will at most be an opportunistic buyer,"" said the JPMorgan report. ""We estimate Comcast, potentially in partnership with other cable companies, could spend $3 billion-$5 billion, and private equity funds in aggregate could spend $1 billion-$2 billion.""We do not expect digital economy players like Alphabet-Google (GOOGL) or Amazon.com (AMZN) to bid, though they can never be ruled out.”

781,ABC,"Best Mutual Funds 2015: April Performance Report
"
782,ABC,"The $5.9 billion American Century Heritage Fund has been in a groove.
"
783,ABC,"Its return this year through April 30 was 6.42%. That topped 91% of its midcap growth rivals tracked by Morningstar Inc.
"
784,ABC,"That was a big step up from the fund's performance over the past 12 months. Its 16.89% gain in that period beat 79% of its peers.
"
785,ABC,"And it's a giant step up from its performance over the past three years.
"
786,ABC,"In that span, the stock mutual fund's 13.61% average annual gain outran just 35% of its peer group.
"
787,ABC,"Managers David Hollond and Greg Walsh have not changed their approach. It's the stock market that's changed, the managers say.
"
788,ABC,"The market is rotating back toward the high-quality, low-debt stocks that this fund likes and that have made it a top stock mutual fund over the past decade.
"
789,ABC,"Lead manager Hollond, 45, and senior investment analyst Nalin Yogasundram, 39, discussed from their offices in Kansas City, Mo., what the Heritage management team has been doing to return to the front ranks of successful investors.
"
790,ABC,"IBD: Why is the mutual fund's relative performance improving?
"
791,ABC,"Hollond: The weak economy and low-interest-rate environment were difficult for us.
"
792,ABC,"In that environment the past several year, there was a high correlation between stocks. Investors did not differentiate between stocks. Lower-quality, highly leveraged companies would not do well without access to cheap capital.
"
793,ABC,"Though the Federal Reserve has not acted yet, now it feels like (the start of interest rate hikes) is not far away, although it's not clear exactly when that will begin.
"
794,ABC,"So the prospect of higher rates is turning into a headwind for lower-quality, highly leveraged companies. It's a tailwind for the type of higher-quality companies we like.
"
795,ABC,"IBD: So the outlook for normalization of interest rates has helped the fund, right?
"
796,ABC,"Hollond: So long as things normalize, that should benefit this fund. It's already benefiting.
"
797,ABC,"IBD: For people who may not know your basic approach, take a moment to describe it, please.
"
798,ABC,"Hollond: We are growth managers. What we look for is early recognition of acceleration in a company's growth rate. We try to find companies at the inflection of their fundamental improvement. We try to find companies growing faster today than in the recent past, and which will continue to grow faster. The key is, we look for catalyst-driven acceleration. We look for a driver that explains why the growth rate has picked up, a driver we can analyze and be confident that is sustainable for the foreseeable future.
"
799,ABC,"IBD: You invest bottom up, not based on sectors. Yet sector weights reflect where you've been expecting to find buys. Why were consumer discretionary, technology and industrials your three biggest sectors as of March 31?
"
800,ABC,"Yogasundram: We look for bottom-up ideas. But consumer discretionary and tech have dispersion. You can find companies doing well vs. companies doing badly. It's unlike energy, where it's much harder to find dispersion.
"
801,ABC,"IBD: Is your stake in Harman International Industries (HAR) a play on U.S. economic expansion fueling more car purchases?
"
802,ABC,"Hollond: Harman does infotainment in car systems. Years ago, you found that only in high-end cars. It's been moving down market. So Harman has been improving its content per car.
"
803,ABC,"Yes, they're benefiting from a cyclical trend. But Harman is also a secular story, independent of the economic cycle. There's this secular trend toward infotainment and people wanting all of their (digital) devices to connect with their car's entertainment system and GPS. People are willing to spend more money on that. Harman has gained share and dollar content per car, getting paid more per car.
"
804,ABC,"IBD: What did you see in LinkedIn (LNKD) that made you boost the fund's stake to 326,000 shares as of Dec. 31 from 281,000 as of Oct. 31?
"
805,ABC,"Yogasundram: LinkedIn is the professional network that has the most and very accurate data on professionals like us. They're layering in more services (that they can sell) to take advantage of that data. They started by helping recruiters find better candidates for jobs. Now they're laying in services to help corporate marketing divisions sell to other businesses.
"
806,ABC,"And they're selling services to China. They're leveraging data well. And they're expanding services from human resources and recruiting to sales and marketing, and they're going international. It's a solid secular growth company.
"
807,ABC,"IBD: Thoughts on last Friday's price plunge on a disappointing outlook?
"
808,ABC,"Yogasundram: LinkedIn is a solid company with a good long-term outlook. However, a combination of an acquisition-related write-off and some sales reorganization drove a temporary headwind.
"
809,ABC,"IBD: Chipmaker Avago Technologies' (AVGO) growth has picked up. Earnings per share went from an 8% decline eight quarters ago to quarterly gains of 3%, 16%, 29%, 39%, 70%, 124% and 149%. Is it sustainable for now?
"
810,ABC,"Yogasundram: There are two reasons their EPS growth accelerated and will continue to improve. First, they have a top-notch management team that bought good companies in the past. Most recently, they bought LSI, which was a badly run, high-cost company with a bloated infrastructure. They made it more efficient. Those gains dropped straight to their bottom line, which you've been seeing in their EPS.
"
811,ABC,"Avago is the leading provider of communications devices to the iPhone and Samsung smartphones. As phones get more complex, Avago is a share gainer. And they've increased their dollar content on phones. That will continue with the iPhone 6 and 6+ and new Samsung phones as well.
"
812,ABC,"IBD: AmerisourceBergen (ABC) is another holding with accelerating EPS growth. Is this a beneficiary of ObamaCare?
"
813,ABC,"Hollond: The Affordable Care Act means more people are covered by insurance, so more people get health care and drugs. The ACA is a driver, but not the full story.
"
814,ABC,"AmerisourceBergen is a pure play on drug distribution. If that's what you want to invest in, you can get that solely through AmerisourceBergen.
"
815,ABC,"They've got some favorable fundamentals driving long-term attractiveness. With generics, after this year there will be robust acceleration in the generics launch calendar. That will provide a lift.
"
816,ABC,"IBD: What about specialty pharmaceuticals?
"
817,ABC,"Yogasundram: That's another area for them. They have key expertise. And there's robust growth in the specialty area. And it's higher margin. So it's an increasingly larger part of their business.
"
818,ABC,"Let me mention one last thing. They acquired MWI Veterinary Supply, which presents an increasing market they can go after.
"
819,ABC,"IBD: Palo Alto Networks (PANW) is a play on heightened concerns about network security, right?
"
820,ABC,"Yogasundram: You're right. What you have today is an installed base of security that is woefully behind the threats.
"
821,ABC,"Palo Alto is a next-generation security company, enabling customers to better defend themselves. Palo Alto is a secular share gainer. And it provides many more services than its layered defenses.
"
822,ABC,"Their initial sale to a customer is an appliance. The second, third and fourth sales are higher margin. Their services can tell a customer exactly what happened (when a security breach occurs) and how to prevent that breach.
"
823,ABC,"IBD: Lighting sounds dull. What's attractive about Acuity Brands (AYI)?
"
824,ABC,"Yogasundram: Acuity is the largest lighting equipment company in the U.S. Adoption of LED lights is accelerating, especially as costs go down, so customers are layering in more products with LEDs.
"
825,ABC,"When you have both cyclical and secular drivers, we really like that. That's what we have here.
"
826,ABC,"IBD: What's your outlook for Electronic Arts (EA), which plans to release its next ""Star Wars Battlefront"" game about a month before December's scheduled debut of the next ""Star Wars"" movie?
"
827,ABC,"Yogasundram: We started investing a couple of years ago when a new management team came in. They found a heavily bloated infrastructure. In the past couple of years they've reduced costs, reduced the number of (game) titles. Margins expand from 9% and 10% to 25% in the four or five quarters.
"
828,ABC,"IBD: Is your stake in Hain Celestial (HAIN) a play on the growing appeal of organic and healthful foods?
"
829,ABC,"Yogasundram: Correct. They've been in organic foods for some time. But we're really seeing two things happen. One is that organics is not just a Whole Foods (WFM) story (which the fund also owned as of its latest disclosure). It is also a Kroger (KR) story. It is a Target (TGT) story. Organic food is going from early adopters to more mainstream consumption.
"
830,ABC,"That's a trend we're playing in a few different directions, including Whitewave Foods (WWAV) and Constellation Brands (STZ).
"
831,ABC,"With Hain, they're selling more to Whole Foods and to Target and Kroger, so they're expanding distribution. And they're layering in more products. So it's a solid organic secular growth story.
"
832,ABC,"IBD: Constellation isn't an organic play, so what is your thesis?
"
833,ABC,"Yogasundram: There is a consumption change. Millennials and people in general are drinking beer less and wine and spirits more.
"
834,ABC,"Constellation was part owner of Corona, the largest U.S. beer brand, and they brought the brand in-house and a few others like Pacifico. Since then, they've boosted advertising and brand awareness, and really started to grow that business. Beer is a 1% to 2% grower, but they've been growing it 10% to 11% to 12% the past couple of years.
"
835,ABC,"They've seen better margins and better capital allocations and buybacks, but the crux is that they're a share gainer.
"
836,ABC,"Corona grows faster than the U.S. market. There's a growing U.S. population of Latin Americans, and their favorite (beer) is Corona. But the mainstream U.S. is also drinking more Corona.
"
837,ABC,"Constellation is also bringing Pacifico and Modelo as alternate brands to the U.S.
"
838,ABC,"IBD: Is Middleby (MIDD) a play on growing U.S. GDP growth?
"
839,ABC,"Yogasundram: It is a play on the U.S. economy in general. But you're also getting refreshes (in commercial kitchen equipment). For example, Chipotle (CMG) wants not only Mexican food, but also to move into pizza. McDonald's (MCD) wants to change their mix of items to more health friendly. So changing consumer tastes drives changes in equipment.
"

Rubio finished well ahead of him in the voting.And instead of moving on to South Carolina for the next primary Feb. 20, Christie said he needed to ”reassess.” In politics-speak that means he’ll be taking a long walk off a short pier on the Jersey shore.After another dismal showing Tuesday, after investing $16 million and so much time in New Hampshire, the governor canceled his trip and headed home for the fatal campaign reassessment.One more Republican candidate down, another governor, But still too many competitors for now to stop the Trumptrain. Who will get Christie’s handful of supporters?After spending chump change of a little under $4 million in New Hampshire, the billionaire New Yorker captured 34% of the record turnout, to Kasich’s 16%. Not bad for putting in only 23 days and 11 town halls there.Kasich did 62 days and talked his way through 104 town halls for half the results. If he goes on to more conservative South Carolina, Kasich will be brushed aside by the organized ground operations of all the others.More likely, he'll return to the Midwest to build an operation for those state primaries ahead.After ABC barred her and her ads from Saturday’s debate, Carly Fiorina still finished with four percent in New Hampshire. That's twice as much as Ben Carson, who was allowed on the ABC stage, though he looked lost much of the time. Fiorina has vowed to move on no matter what. Carson may need to go home for fresh clothes and his own reassessment.Only 10 days until South Carolina Republicans vote on Feb. 20, a shorter campaign than usual. Democrats will again decide between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders, who destroyed the former first lady in New Hampshire by an embarrassing, 60% to 39%. Democrats don’t vote in South Carolina until Feb. 27.You didn’t think they’d make it easy, did you? Then comes Nevada with Republicans caucusing on Feb. 23 and Dems on Feb. 20.Clinton, who’s now losing her presumptive nominee status for the second time, conceded to Sanders. Then she turned her remarks into what sounded like Sanders socialism, vowing to fight against big anything for the rights of every conceivable liberal interest group she could list.""Now we take this campaign to the entire country,” she said. “We are going to fight for every vote in every state. People have every right to be angry. But they are also hungry. They are hungry for solutions.” Behind her, hubby Bill clapped continuously as if she'd promised ice cream for good behavior.But for now Trump is riding high and mighty. After claiming that Cruz cheated him out of the Iowa win, Trump was energized Tuesday. He introduced his entire family, including some deceased members. Then, he laid out in trademark stream of consciousness what he regards as policy details:“The world is going to respect us again. Do we love our country? We’re going to make great trade deals. We’re going to rebuild our military. It’s going to be so strong, so powerful. Nobody is going to mess with us. We’re going to take care of our vets. We’re going to have strong, incredible borders, and people are going to come in legally. We’re going to build a wall. Believe me! It’s not that difficult to do. We’re going to repeal and replace ObamaCare. It’s a total disaster. We’re getting rid of Common Core. We’re going to educate our children locally. We’re going to preserve our very sacred Second Amendment. Not going to be any more chipping away…I am going to be the greatest jobs president that God ever created. By the way, we’re going to knock the hell out of ISIS and it’s going to be done the right way…It’s going to be so great. Our national debt is $19 trillion, soon going to be $21 trillion. What is going on? We’re going to make our country so strong…We’re going to make America so great again, maybe greater than ever before. I love you all. We’re going now to South Carolina. We’re going to win in South Carolina.”RELATED:

845,ABC,"Making predictions about U.S. primary elections is ridiculous, especially in this volatile year and especially in snowy New Hampshire’s vote today.The large polling leads of both Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders seem unlikely to stand up in final results tonight. But the elderly men do appear prohibitive favorites. Oh, and Jim Gilmore is not going to win any state delegates there.You can, however, watch for other indicators, results which will sketch the evolving shape of the GOP race and set the stage and tone for the next leg of this presidential nominating endurance contest. That comes in South Carolina in 11 days. Then Nevada and Florida beyond.Do not look for Ted Cruz to win this week, as he did in Iowa eight days ago. He’s been slogging along in fourth place in the RealClearPolitics state poll average, behind Marco Rubio, John Kasich and barely ahead of Jeb Bush. No, seriously.New Hampshire voters contain barely a third the evangelical population of Iowa. And New Hampshirites are an ornery bunch. They like folks who pander and can put up with hanging around there a lot – think Kasich, Chris Christie and Bush, whose parents reside next door in Maine.New Hampshire Republican primary voters (remember, independents and disgusted Democrats can jump in there too) have rejected the GOP's Iowa winner every time for the past 20 years. They even discarded Barack Obama in 2008. In 2000, they spanked prohibitive favorite George W. Bush by 19 points in favor of John McCain, who endured months in their living rooms for that brief glow.You may have noticed the religiosity of political soundbites dissipate since Des Moines. Be thou patient. They’ll return heading into South Carolina.The Palmetto state is more welcoming for Cruz’ blunt brand of conservatism. And his people have been organizing throughout the Southeast since last summer, especially among energetic college students who aren't socialists.Be aware though. A desperate national media is capable of creating a nail-biting competition out of a retirement-home race of seniors with walkers. It craves black-and-white winners and losers, even if the numbers don't hold up. Recall how Rubio was an Iowa winner, while finishing third.So, much of recent media buzz has focused on Christie’s attacks on the post-Iowa emerging star during the first half of Saturday’s debate, the lowest-rated so far. Rubio recovered, but that doesn't fit the up-and-down narrative.Anything can happen in the minds of New Hampshire’s notoriously late-deciders. But tracking polls since show no dip for the GOP’s youngest candidate – and no boomlet for the New Jersey governor.Who in the unlikely case you’ve somehow missed his repetitive, robotic claims, was a federal prosecutor after 9/11, has fought a Democratic legislature in a Democratic state and intends to aggressively prosecute Hillary Clinton come fall.Every candidacy has such thunderclap days. Some devolve into lethal tailspins. Others take the hit and keep on ticking, which is what voters should want when hiring a commander-in-chief. Primaries are not just news events; they’re a long, long marathon of mid-term exams.Today’s mid-term exam, like Iowa’s caucuses, could produce more dropouts on the GOP side. Despite predictable vows of durability, it’s difficult, for instance, to imagine Christie or Kasich moving much farther without strong showings in the Granite state.Kasich’s softer brand of conservatism suits New Hampshire’s sizable crowd of moderates. A third-place finish in the mid-teens would be impressive. But then what? In 2012, Jon Huntsman was third behind Mitt Romney and Ron Paul with 17%. He vowed to move on. He didn’t.Carly Fiorina could also use a good showing. She was denied a............debate spot Saturday with its valuable state and national exposure; ABC even refused to sell her ad time. So, calling herself a fighter for the long-term as the only woman in the conservative competition, Fiorina bought an effective Super Bowl ad. Watch above.Watch too Trump’s outcome. He’s in a strangely difficult spot way ahead. He needs to demonstrate that his appeal can grow beyond the hardcore 25% of deaf GOP voters who hail his combative candor. A soft performance in vote totals would be the second straight time he’s under-performed both expectations and his own amazing boasts.Trump’s short-lived grace in defeat after Iowa could re-emerge with pouting and profanity gradually diminishing his future showings. Although Cruz trails Trump significantly in New Hampshire, Monday night Trump inexplicably elevated him to the election-eve news by labeling Cruz with a crude, five-letter word for part of the female anatomy.RELATED:

847,ABC,"Ray Charles had the odds stacked high against him ever becoming a musical superstar.He was reared by his mother in segregated Florida during the Great Depression without indoor plumbing.He was totally blind from age 7. To learn piano music, he’d feel the Braille dots with one hand while he played it with the other, then do the reverse and memorize the combination.After his mother died when he was 14, he acted up in school and was expelled.But Charles became a hit maker in genres from jazz and blues to country and pop, inventing the fusion known as soul music and winning 17 Grammy Awards.In Charles’ memoir, “Brother Ray,” co-author David Ritz recalled, “I never met anyone braver. He had no fears. He walked through the world like a lion. If anything, his handicap gave him an edge. … His mind was quicker than yours, his memory better, his instincts keener. Keeping up with him required resilience.”Charles (1930-2004) was born Ray Charles Robinson in Albany, Ga., and grew up in Greenville, Fla. At 3, he was fascinated by a cafe's boogie-woogie pianist, who put the kid on his lap and gave him lessons.But at 5, a thick mucous began coming out of his eyes, probably juvenile glaucoma, and he lost his sight. His mother was sick and knew her son needed to learn to be entirely on his own, so she told him to find his way around with a cane, listening to sounds and counting steps. By the time he was in his teens, he could cook and type.Sent to a school for the blind in St. Augustine, Fla., at 14, he played with two bands and learned how to get into sync with the other musicians. He worked hard at new songs, jammed offstage, listened to radio and records and improved how he sang. “Musically, I was raised during a time of absolutely no compromise,” he wrote. “I’ve always felt the need to perfect my skills.""After leaving school at 15, he moved around Florida trying to make a living with different bands. His skills progressed, but he didn’t like segregation, so he moved to Seattle.He was soon in demand there, and he met his lifelong best friend and occasional arranger, Quincy Jones, recording his first songs for an independent label. The producer changed his stage name to Ray Charles to avoid confusion with boxing champion Sugar Ray Robinson.In 1950, Charles moved to Los Angeles, which would be his home base for the rest of his life. The next year he had his first national hit with “Baby, Let Me Hold Your Hand.”Also in 1951, Charles wed Eileen Williams, but they divorced a year later. He married Della Howard in 1955, and they would have three children, Ray Jr., David and Robert, before their divorce in 1977.In 1952, his label was going broke and his contract was bought for today's equivalent of $22,300 by Ahmet Ertegun, co-owner of Atlantic Records, who was about to become an industry legend and make Charles famous.During the ups and downs of his early career, Charles kept himself emotionally stable by reading his Braille Bible and reciting the Lord’s Prayer, as his mother had taught him.In 1955, he had had a best-selling single with his own composition, “I Got a Woman.” A synthesis of rhythm and blues, gospel and jazz, it was the first example of what came to be called soul music. It was followed by the success of his blues song “A Fool for You.”By 1959, Atlantic was the top independent label, and Charles was reaching beyond blacks to a broader audience that now had him on the road 300 days a year. The same year, he had another smash with “What'd I Say,” which was highly unusual at eight minutes long and the result of improvisation at a concert. Later that year came the big-band pop sound of “The Genius of Ray Charles,” his first album to break into the pop Top 40.But ABC-Paramount Records made him an offer he couldn’t refuse: ownership of his master recordings, something few artists have ever had (Frank Sinatra had to create his own record company to get them). Charles was also made his own producer, unheard of for a singer, which meant he made a lot more if a record was successful but shared the risk if it wasn’t.In 1960, Charles had his first ABC hit, with “Georgia on My Mind” going to No. 1.Billboard said it “packs a powerful emotional wallop, with violins and chorus backing a big sound.” The next year, he was scheduled to perform in Augusta, Ga., but canceled after being informed that the dance floor would be for whites only. A year later, he performed at the same venue because it had been desegregated, and the state adopted “Georgia” as its state song in 1979.In the early 1960s, Charles had an album (“Genius Hits the Road”) on the pop charts for 82 weeks and two No. 1 songs with “Hit the Road Jack” and “I Can’t Stop Loving You.” The last was from his first country album, “Modern Sounds in Country and Western,” which ABC had strongly opposed because no black singer had ever had success in that genre. It was the label’s first album to sell over 1 million. He also created his own publishing firm to be able to collect royalties on his compositions and songs he purchased.“Today, many more artists own their songs and run their own companies, but few with Ray’s grasp of business or attention to detail,” Michael Lydon, author of “Ray Charles: Man and Music,” told IBD. “Ray was a true entrepreneur and took pride in the control he had over his work.”In October 1964, Charles was arrested in Boston for drug possession and was facing the horror of 60 years in prison. He decided to take a year off at 34, the first long break he had taken since he was 15. He reflected on all the musicians he had known who had died or gotten into big trouble with drugs and feared how his being in prison would affect Ray Jr. He checked into a rehab hospital to kick his habit cold and was put on probation.In December 1965, he had two songs in the Top 10 for the first time in two years. But as the pop music world was increasingly dominated by rock groups, Charles went his own way over the next four decades with innovative albums in a variety of genres that were critically hailed but sold modestly.Charles’ last album, “Genius Loves Company,” was recorded in 2003, after he was diagnosed with cancer. Between treatments, he sang duets with fellow stars B.B. King, Nora Jones, Willie Nelson and Elton John. It sold 7 million copies when it was released in 2004, making it the most successful album of his career, but he had died two months earlier at age 73.A film about his career, “Ray,” was finished in time for Charles to screen a rough cut, with Jamie Foxx winning the Academy Award for best actor.At his funeral, which drew 1,500 of his closest friends, the singers ranged from Stevie Wonder to Glen Campbell, a testimony to his influence.Charles' estimated net worth was $50 million, said Lydon, but that doesn’t include the real value of the master recordings. “They’re like Rembrandt canvases, truly priceless, and might be worth at least as much as the rest of the estate,” he said.Sinatra called Charles “the only true genius in the business,” and Rolling Stone magazine ranked him No. 2 on its 2008 list of “The 100 Greatest Singers of All Time,” behind Aretha Franklin.His former headquarters in Los Angeles is now the Ray Charles Memorial Library, which preserves his legacy and supports music teaching in schools.One of the greatest musicians and singers in the history of popular music.Overcame: Opposition by record labels to his innovations.Lesson: To make a real difference, sign on for big, calculated risks.“I never wanted to be famous. I only wanted to be great.”

848,ABC,"How is Comcast’s (CMCSA) $15-per-month Web-based TV service, called Stream, doing? Comcast, the nation’s biggest cable TV firm, launched Stream in Boston and Chicago last quarter. Comcast's Stream service targets broadband-only homes, mainly millennials who have never subscribed to pay TV services. No set-top box is required, and Stream works with Apple (AAPL) TV, Roku and other devices.With Stream, Comcast got the jump on Apple, which has been delayed in launching its expected Web TV service.Comcast included Stream subscribers in its surprising 89,000 net video subscriber additions in Q4.But Comcast did not break out how many Stream subscribers it has. “Stream is in the numbers, but I don't think it moves the needle a lot,” UBS analyst John Hodulik told IBD in an email.Comcast has stated plans to bring Stream to its entire cable TV territory in 2016. Comcast's Stream service includes the major live broadcast networks -- ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox -- along with HBO and local TV channels.Comcast Cable CEO Neil Smit, on the company's earnings conference call Wednesday, said ""it's probably too early to say what it (Stream) will be, what it will turn into over time. But we feel good about the usage and good about the product. It's a good value proposition for the customer, and we'll continue to roll it out to other markets.""The Federal Communications Commission is likely curious about how Stream is doing in hard numbers, given that the agency has been asking questions about the Web service related to its net neutrality rules. The problem, according to critics, is that Comcast does not count its own Stream service toward the monthly data caps of its broadband customers. Comcast says the Stream service is not a net neutrality issue because the service uses IP technology over its own network, not the public Internet, to reach households.A federal court is expected to rule on the FCC’s net neutrality rules in April. The agency's clout could again be gutted -- or not, which might lead to more enforcement of the new net neutrality rules.Comcast joins Dish Network (DISH) in mashing new Web streaming video subscribers along with traditional pay TV customers in earnings reports. In Dish’s case, new subscribers to its $20-per-month Sling Web TV service have helped offset its loss of satellite TV customers.Dish discussed Sling subscriber additions for the first time when reporting Q2 earnings in early August. Sling had 240,000 subscribers as of June 30.Dish Network did not update Sling’s subscriber total when reporting Q3 earnings. Goldman Sachs has forecast that Sling could hit 2 million by the end of 2016.For Comcast, Stream numbers might be more material by the time it reports Q1 earnings. Comcast’s 89,000 video subscriber additions in Q4 were way up from 6,000 in the year-earlier period.Aside from launching Stream, Comcast has also stepped up its promotion of lower-priced skinny bundles, with fewer TV channels and broadband-first promotions to college students.Analysts say its deployment of  Internet-ready X1 set-top boxes and improved customer service have improved video subscriber results.On Comcast’s earnings call, Smit played down the impact of  lower-revenue skinny bundles. He said 75% of video subscribers added in the December quarter had “higher-end packages.”

851,ABC,"Journalism: In another sign the left's grip on the news is bigger than anyone knew, ABC News' George Stephanopoulos hid a $75,000 gift to the Clinton Foundation even as he reported news about corruption allegations. While skeptically interrogating author Peter Schweizer about ""Clinton Cash,"" his book exposing the Clinton Foundation last April 26, the anchor for ABC News conveniently left out the highly relevant fact that he himself had donated $75,000 to the Clinton Foundation.Listeners had no clue about just who was doing the news. Instead of an impartial newsman with a mission to lay out all the facts and let the audience decide, this was a political operative doing the bidding for the very foundation under the spotlight.Naturally, he pooh-poohed Schweizer's allegations the foundation was an influence-purchasing machine more than a charity, telling the author he had no proof.It appeared that he hadn't read the book, as Schweizer addressed how investigations of such white collar crimes are done in law enforcement circles through patterns of activity, which was the approach he took for his book. In reality, he was talking to a spin doctor up to his eyeballs in involvement with the other side.After he was caught, Stephanopoulos first protested that it was for all the good works the foundation was doing on deforestation and other stuff. But that fell flat, because Schweizer had already reported that only 9% of the foundation's funds went to charity, far less than comparable organizations.After that, he protested that the information was public anyway, as his donations could be looked up by anyone interested in reading the fine print of tax filings. And with the heat on, he then recused himself from any involvement in the upcoming Republican debates.All of this serves to illustrate the research that Schweizer did, pointing out that the organization was a pay-to-play instrument for buying influence, as well as a nontransparent organization — so much so that charity watchdogs didn't even want to get involved with ranking the Clinton Foundation because of its secretive structure.The takeaway here is that, in addition to being a vehicle for foreign governments to buy influence, it appears that the Clinton Foundation also is a vehicle for journalists to purchase influence or perhaps even access at the highest levels of government.Small wonder the public holds the mainstream media is such low regard. Sure, the media's bias is ideological, but it may go deeper than that, to a relationship of political puppet-string pullers and their pawns doing others' bidding while pretending to be actual newsmen.It ties in well with President Obama's recent statement that the way the media reports the news has got to change. Those were remarks he made this week at an anti-poverty summit, where he specifically singled out Fox News, a news agency with a skeptical line on power but no known ties to the leftist political machines.""We're going to have to change how our body politic thinks, which means we are going to have to change how the media reports,"" said President Obama, going into a long diatribe about poverty reportage that was unhelpful to Democrats' ""narrative"" for more spending.If what he means is more agents of influence reporting the news and concealing their role to the public, it bodes very ill for the future of a free press.It's a terrible picture, given the various federal lunges for control of media decision making through the Federal Communications Commission (which not too long ago proposed a plan to police newsrooms under the pretense of ""research""), and the speech codes and other impediments on free speech seen in the left-controlled universities.And that should cause Americans to ask where it's possible to get truly objective news instead of the undisclosed political gamesmanship that is on display with Stephanopoulos. There's no reason to think it won't grow.
"
852,ABC,"Media Bias: George Stephanopoulos' $75,000 gift to the Clinton Foundation says a lot about the major media. Not only are they dominated by the left, but their stars have often worked for the very people they're supposed to cover.Political operatives become journalists, and journalists become political operatives. It happens all the time.But Stephanopoulos didn't just take a job as a talking head or pundit. He was elevated to a high-profile news position. He poses as an objective journalist when, in fact, his entire background has been political.It's a long resume, including stints as an aide to Democratic Rep. Edward Feighan of Ohio in the 1980s, deputy communications director of the Dukakis-Bentsen presidential campaign in 1988 and floor manager for House Majority Leader Dick Gephardt from 1989-91.But he really made his reputation in Bill Clinton's 1991 campaign. In ""The War Room,"" a 1993 documentary of that race, Stephanopoulos comes across as politically ruthless. At one point, he menacingly tells someone on the phone: ""I guarantee if you do this, you'll never work in Democratic politics again."" He was 30 years old.Once in the White House, Stephanopoulos became a spinmeister par excellence, dealing with Clinton's so-called ""bimbo eruptions"" and the many other scandals that surfaced — Whitewater, Travelgate, Filegate, Nannygate, coptergate, and so on — too many to number.When former FBI agent Gary Aldrich wrote ""Unlimited Access,"" an unflattering expose of the Clinton White House, Stephanopoulos attacked. He called Aldrich a ""pathological liar"" and, with others, pressured ABC's ""Nightline,"" CNN's ""Larry King Live"" and ""Dateline NBC"" to cancel Aldrich appearances.Even liberal journalists came to distrust Stephanopoulos. As we noted in 1996, Clinton's first press spokesman in 1992 was moved to another job within just months ""because everyone in the White House press corps quickly learned not to believe a word he said.""So how did Stephanopoulos the fact-challenged operative become Stephanopoulos the objective journalist?A little tap dancing is all it took. After losing a bruising battle to become Clinton's chief of staff, Stephanopoulos quit in 1996. The highly partisan aide ""portrayed himself as nonpartisan after leaving the White House and was hired by ABC News in 1997 as a news analyst,"" wrote Shirley Anne Warshaw in ""The Clinton Years.""In 1999, he completed his self-rehabilitation with a political confessional titled, ""All Too Human: A Political Education."" In it, he offered mild criticisms of the Clintons, and bemoaned his own lost political innocence.That did the trick. In 2002, he became anchor of ABC's Sunday news program, ""This Week.""Fact is, George Stephanopoulos' donation to the Clinton Foundation underlines that he is no objective journalist, but rather an emblem of Washington's revolving-door journalism and pervasive left-wing bias.The Media Research Center last year estimated that 30 Obama administration members either had gone into journalism or from journalism into the White House. Remember that as you read or watch the news.We continue to ask: Is it any wonder the public no longer trusts the media to tell the truth?

881,ABC,"Racial Politics: President Obama has a tendency to wade into local crime cases, second-guessing police decisions and making wild accusations of racism, without knowing all the facts. Baltimore is his latest faux pas.Obama strongly suggested that Baltimore police were to blame for the death of a young black man who died while in custody.Freddie Gray, a 25-year-old convicted drug dealer who'd been arrested 18 times previously, resisted another arrest April 12. He was so violent, he required additional restraints and a paddy wagon to take him to jail.""Our laws were not applied evenly in the case of Mr. Gray,"" Obama intoned, ""and accountability needs to exist.""He presumed that Gray had had ""his spine snapped"" while struggling with cops. But once again, it looks like the president spoke prematurely.A police report leaked to the Washington Post shows that Gray likely caused his own injuries by banging his head against the wall of the police transport van in a tirade over his bust.The report quotes another prisoner in the van who observed, ""(He) was intentionally trying to injure himself.""A local ABC News affiliate, meanwhile, reports that the medical examiner found that Gray's fatal injury was caused when he slammed into the back of the van, apparently breaking his neck.""A head injury he sustained matches a bolt in the back of the van,"" the report said.In other words, Gray wasn't paralyzed during the confrontation with police. The president jumped to the wrong conclusion, along with civil-rights agitators.There was a similar rush to judgment in the Michael Brown case, when Obama and his attorney general reinforced the black community's belief that the 18-year-old African-American was gunned down by a white cop as he surrendered, hands up. It didn't happen that way.Yet Ferguson, like Baltimore, burned. And Obama hasn't learned from that tragic error.""Since Ferguson, we have seen too many instances of what appears to be police officers interacting with individuals — primarily African American, often poor — in ways that have raised troubling questions,"" he said.""And it comes up, it seems like, once every couple of weeks .. . . This is a crisis ... . This has been going on for a long time. This is not new, and we shouldn't pretend that it's new.""He's right about there being a crisis. But black crime, not police bias or brutality, is at the heart of it. The only one pretending otherwise is the president.

885,ABC,"Verizon Communications (VZ) has become the latest pay-TV provider to offer skinny bundles of TV channels to consumers seeking lower-cost viewing options.Following the lead of Dish Network (DISH), Verizon's FiOS service will begin offering a slim package of TV channels, including broadcasters like ABC and Fox and cable networks like CNN and AMC, starting Sunday. It will offer add-on ""channel packs"" covering genres such as sports, news, lifestyle, entertainment and children's shows, the Wall Street Journal reported Thursday.FiOS Custom TV is targeted at millennials, cord shavers and cord cutters, Verizon spokesman Phillip Burrows said. ""It's a simple way for customers to choose the types of channels they want without paying for those they don't,"" he said.The cheapest plan costs $55 a month and includes a base channel package with over 35 channels (all local broadcast channels and cable favorites like CNN, HGTV, AMC and Food Network), plus two add-on channel packs. Extra channel packs cost $10 a month. Each of the seven current genre-specific channel packs includes an average of 10 to 17 channels.Verizon's skinny bundle offering comes as consumers are starting to demand greater flexibility in selecting channels to watch and lower-cost options. Earlier this year, Dish's Sling TV and Sony's (SNE) PlayStation Vue became the first to offer skinny bundle alternatives to traditional pay TV services. Apple (AAPL) reportedly plans to offer a similar service.Last month, Bernstein Research analyst Todd Juenger said the new skinny TV bundles are unlikely to please either potential cable TV cord-cutters or cord nevers. The offerings are too narrow for existing pay-TV subscribers and are too expensive for people who have opted not to subscribe to traditional pay-TV services, he said.The trend coincides with the rise of over-the-top Internet television services, such as Netflix (NFLX), Amazon (AMZN) Prime Instant Video and Hulu Plus, which provide subscription on-demand programming.On a conference call with analysts Wednesday, Netflix CEO Reed Hastings sounded the death knell for traditional linear TV channels.""Linear TV has been on an amazing 50-year run,"" Hastings said. ""Internet TV is starting to grow. Clearly, over the next 20 years Internet TV is going to replace linear TV.""Programmers are starting to launch stand-alone subscription over-the-top video services. They include CBS (CBS) All Access, Time Warner's (TWX) HBO Now and Viacom's (VIA) Noggin.

886,ABC,"McKesson (MCK) on Monday cut its fiscal 2016 earnings-per-share outlook and sees next year's EPS getting hit by 85 cents, citing weak generic-drug prices and ""recent customer consolidation.""The drug distributor's grim forecasts come after Rite Aid (RAD), with which McKesson has a distribution deal, agreed last year to be acquired by Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA), which has a distribution partnership with AmerisourceBergen (ABC). The merger cast into doubt McKesson's long relationship with Rite Aid.For the fiscal year ending March 31, McKesson now expects EPS of $12.60-$12.90, down from an earlier forecast of $12.50-$13.00, saying that its profits will be lower than expected during the second half of the year. Analysts expected $12.83.McKesson also expects fiscal 2017 EPS growth of 7%-12%, from the 2016 forecast issued Monday. Analysts expect 13% growth. The company will update 2017 guidance when it reports Q4 results, likely in May.Shares gapped down and finished 10.3% lower in the stock market today. Rival AmerisourceBergen fell 4%. Cardinal Health (CAH), another distributor, fell around 5.5%.Walgreens ended essentially unchanged, while Rite Aid dipped 0.3%. CVS Health (CVS) rose 1.5%.McKesson's headwinds for 2017 also reflect the expiration of its contract with health services company Optum and ""the transition of its contracts with (elder-health company) Omnicare and Target (TGT)."" But McKesson expects its current partnership with Rite Aid to ""continue through the end of fiscal 2017.""The forecasts could signify a considerable misstep for the company, FBR analyst Steven Halper said in a note Monday.""Over the years, MCK has rarely had an operational hiccup such as this in its core pharma segment,"" he wrote. ""It remains to be seen if the issues are temporary or more structural in nature.""The company, which buys drugs, holds them and supplies them to drugstores, said that it was reviewing its administrative cost structure for the fourth quarter. Drug distributors' profits hinge on the difference between the prices that manufacturers charge them to buy the drugs and the prices that they can charge in selling the drugs to retailers.The EPS outlook for 2016 does not include any restructuring that the review may bring, the company said.McKesson reports third-quarter earnings on Jan. 27.Follow Bill Peters on Twitter @IBD_BPeters.

888,ABC,"TV broadcasters and wireless phone companies are in store for a “spectrum extravaganza,” says FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler, but others question whether the upcoming government airwaves auction will live up that billing.The Federal Communications Commission plans to begin the “Broadcast Incentive Auction” on March 29. The auction, which could last as long as five months, will free up an estimated 60 megahertz to 80 MHz of prime, low-frequency radio spectrum owned by local TV broadcasters.Wireless firms and other companies can file as bidders from Tuesday through Feb. 9.TV broadcasters need to be persuaded to relinquish their airwaves. The FCC has set opening prices in hundreds of markets, but bidders likely will end up paying less, under the auction’s complex structure.The deadline for broadcasters to file as auction participants was Jan. 12; the FCC has not said how many local TV stations, out of roughly 2,000 eligible nationwide, filed.The National Association of Broadcasters says it expects “robust” participation by local TV broadcasters. The rub, points out William Bird, an analyst at FBR & Co., is that broadcasters could walk away at any point.“There is little risk to participating since broadcasters may drop out of the bidding in any round if they decide the prices are too low,” he said in a research report.Paul de Sa, an analyst at Bernstein Research, says it’s still unclear “how much spectrum will ultimately be auctioned.” Broadcasters have 120 MHz in all.In the wireless industry, AT&T (T)  and Verizon Communications (VZ) more than 70% of low-frequency airwaves in the top 100 U.S. markets. Low-frequency airwaves travel over long distances and also through walls, improving in-building services.The auction is an opportunity for smaller T-Mobile US (TMUS) to grab what Wheeler calls “beachfront spectrum.” Sprint (S) has said it will not bid, but parent SoftBank might, some analysts say.Observers speculate cable TV leader Comcast (CMCSA) will bid for airwaves, most likely in local markets where it sells cable services, and perhaps an Internet giant such as Alphabet’s (GOOGL) Google.The last spectrum auction, AWS-3, ended in January 2015, and it raised $41 billion. The TV broadcast auction will have trouble matching that total, analysts say, unless dark horses such as Comcast emerge.“Without non-traditional bidders, the auction results are likely to disappoint broadcasters,” said a Moody's Investors Service research report.Analysts at Morgan Stanley, Citigroup, Jefferies and Deutsche Bank have estimated Comcast could spend $4 billion to $6 billion in the auction. On the other hand, Charter Communications (CHTR), which is seeking regulatory approval to buy Time Warner Cable (TWC) and Bright House Networks to become the No. 2 cable firm, is not likely to bid, analysts say.Both AT&T and Verizon have talked down their interest in the broadcast airwaves.
"
889,ABC,"Verizon CFO Fran Shammo in October told analysts Verizon isn’t sure the TV broadcasters’ 600 MHz spectrum is a good fit with Verizon’s 700 MHz footprint because of potential interference issues.John Donovan, AT&T’s senior executive of technology, at a Citigroup conference in January said the low-band, 600 MHz spectrum might be better suited for rural areas than urban markets.These comments might just be pre-auction posturing, some analysts say. Oppenheimer analyst Tim Horan estimates both AT&T and Verizon could spend at least $10 billion in the auction.The FCC, meanwhile, plans to set aside a large chunk of spectrum that AT&T and Verizon cannot bid for, a policy the agency says is aimed at fostering competition.Some 30 MHz of spectrum would be set aside for smaller carriers, if at least 70 MHz is put up for bid overall.The FCC’s Wheeler expects lots of action. At the consumer electronics show, CES, in early January, he said, “I think it is safe to say that you are going to see a spectrum extravaganza — that you are going to see lots of interest in selling the spectrum and lots of interest in buying the spectrum, and that is going to be transformational.”There’s disagreement over when the sold spectrum would be available for wireless firms. AT&T says not until 2020. T-Mobile says as soon as 2018 in many cases, because local TV stations will want to get paid.T-Mobile says it could spend up to $10 billion in the auction.The exact number of frequency blocks and licenses to be auctioned will not be set until broadcasters state their intentions. The FCC plans to take a patchwork of vacant TV channels in local markets and create tighter blocks of spectrum for wireless firms to use — a process called “repacking.”While local TV stations have the option of vacating all their airwaves and thus going off the air, most are expected to move to a new frequency band or share spectrum. Opening prices are meant to persuade TV stations to part with airwaves. Telemundo’s UHF station in the New York City market has the highest opening price, at more than $900 million.Barclays analyst Kannan Venkateshwar, in a report, forecasts that more airwaves will come from independent TV stations rather than local stations owned and operated by the four major broadcasters — Walt Disney’s (DIS) ABC, CBS, Fox and NBC.Twenty-First Century Fox (FOXA) and CBS (CBS) are expected to sell airwaves in some markets. While Comcast’s cable company is a potential bidder, it also owns media firm NBCUniversal, a potential seller of airwaves.

890,ABC,"Smaller local TV station owners include Sinclair Broadcast Group (SBGI) and Gray Television (GTNA).“On the supply side, we foresee potential robust participation from the major broadcasters, excluding ABC,” Credit Suisse analyst Omar Sheikh wrote in a recent research note. “Sinclair, Media General (MEG) and Tribune Media have clearly vocalized their interest in the auction.“Nexstar (NXST), E.W. Scripps, and Entravision (EVC) have been less vocal on their strategy, and Meredith has stated it doesn’t believe a material opportunity exists for its footprint.”While other wireless carriers were little changed in the stock market Monday, Sprint plunged 12.2% to 2.52, ahead of its Tuesday-morning earnings report. The company has axed at least 2,500 jobs in customer care centers and at its headquarters since last fall, the Associated Press said in a Monday-afternoon report. Last week Sprint notified employees at six customer service centers around the country that it would be closing those locations or reducing the staff there, AP reported.

893,ABC,"Wall Street is overlooking the ""unrecognized"" value of assets like Hulu in 21st Century Fox's (FOXA) current stock price, according to Credit Suisse analyst Omar Sheikh, who raised Fox's price target to 38 from 34 on Wednesday. Like Netflix (NFLX), the online streaming service is a ""must-have"" for the modern digital consumer, he said.""After years of investment, we believe investors have lost sight of the potential payback from Hulu and STAR India,"" he wrote. ""We believe the two businesses can deliver meaningful profitability by 2020 ($1.5bn/$883m EBITDA respectively), and that visibility on this trajectory will become more apparent over the next 12 months."" Fox-owned STAR India is a 51-channel broadcaster that operates online streamer Hotstar.Hulu, which is jointly owned by Fox, Walt Disney (DIS) and Comcast (CMCSA), gets far less attention than Netflix and Amazon (AMZN) Video, though the over-the-top (OTT) service is growing at a quick clip: Hulu said earlier in 2015 that it has 9 million subscribers, a 50% climb from the previous year. But that still pales in comparison to Netflix's 69.2 million member base.Credit Suisse estimates that Hulu has lost $1 billion cumulatively at a net income level since it first launched in 2008, a loss which in the past year has been driven by higher programming and marketing costs.But it is now in a ""good position to grow strongly,"" said Sheikh. If Hulu can reach 37.5 million-42.5 million subscribers by 2020, it ""could justify valuations in the $12bn-$18bn range, with $15bn at the mid-point."" His analysis sees Hulu bringing in more than $1 billion in net income by that time.The online TV service — which streams currently airing programs from ABC, NBC, FOX and other channels, thanks to its traditional broadcast parentage — is seen as benefiting from its content offering, pricing and marketing strategy.""In particular, we think the service should benefit from the addition of an ad-free option; the expansion into commissioning original series; and more circumspect content licensing activity by big media owners to rival SVOD (subscription video on demand) services, including Netflix,"" wrote Sheikh.""Ultimately, we argue that Hulu will be a cornerstone OTT service for consumers — a 'must-have' digital subscription for cord-cutters and cord-nevers alongside Netflix and potentially (Time Warner (TWX)-owned) HBO NOW.""Sheikh has an outperform rating on Fox.Fox shares closed up 0.5% in the stock market Wednesday.

WTEMHY's methodology employs a process to pick the highest 30% of companies ranked by their dividend yield from a starting universe of 1,200 dividend payers in emerging markets (EM). This selection process—and a further weighting process to magnify higher dividend payers' weights—offers a strict value-oriented approach. As a byproduct of its methodology, the Index has a dividend yield of more than 6%1.

WTEMHY's methodology employs a process to pick the highest 30% of companies ranked by their dividend yield from a starting universe of 1,200 dividend payers in emerging markets (EM). This selection process—and a further weighting process to magnify higher dividend payers' weights—offers a strict value-oriented approach. As a byproduct of its methodology, the Index has a dividend yield of more than 6%1. Emerging markets remain one of the more out-of-favor segments of global markets, and this income-oriented approach is one worth consideration. 1 Dividend yield as of 3/31/15. Important Risks Related to this Article Diversification does not eliminate the risk of experiencing investment losses. Investments focused in China are increasing the impact of events and developments associated with the region, which can adversely affect performance.

It should work out great because if there are two things NFL players respect it’s authority and women.Conan: NBC plans a series about the Biblical events after Jesus' crucifixion. Called “Jesus 2: Payback Time.” He forgives, but he doesn’t forget.Fallon: It seems everyone went to see 'Furious 7' last weekend. Asked why, husbands replied, “Revenge for '50 Shades of Grey.'”Conan: The top 15 contenders for the Republican presidential nomination own at least 40 guns among them. In other words, if we elect a Republican president, nobody is hopping over the White House fence.Meyers: In a joint statement the NCAA Final Four coaches all condemned “discrimination of any kind” -- except on short people. They don't allow any of those types on their teams.Conan: A new stamp honors poet Maya Angelou. Theo only problem, it has a quote that's not hers. Apparently, Maya Angelou never said, “Bitches be crazy.”Conan: There are now four finalists in the campaign to put a woman on the $20 bill -- Rosa Parks, Harriet Tubman, Eleanor Roosevelt and Flo from the Progressive ads.SNL: Despite Hillary Clinton’s claims that she used her personal email while Secretary of State to avoid carrying more than one device, a new report shows that she emailed with her iPad in addition to her BlackBerry. Even more alarming, her email signature was, “sent from my Benghazi cover-up device.”Conan: Gov. Jerry Brown says Californians could be fined for taking long showers. Then he unveiled his new slogan: “Gov. Jerry Brown: I’m Watching You Shower.”Conan: California may force the city of Beverly Hills to cut its water use by up to 35%. So yet another tough break for Beverly Hills farmers.

909,ABC,"Hot Air: President Obama says we must tackle global warming because it's already causing asthma rates to climb. But his argument is full of holes. In any case, didn't the U.N. climate chief say we need to depopulate the planet?The White House this week organized a roundtable with government and public health officials to warn that global warming is an immediate health threat and discuss how to deal with it.A White House fact sheet says that asthma rates have doubled in the U.S. over the past three decades, and that ""climate change is putting these individuals ... at greater risk of landing in the hospital."" More wildfires, meanwhile, will increase the amount of air pollution from harmful particulate matter.The White House also pointed to an American Thoracic Society survey in which 77% of its members said that they've seen ""increases in chronic disease severity from air pollution"" caused by global warming.Obama himself argued that global warming ""can induce greater incidents of asthma or more severe incidents of asthma."" Later, on ABC News, the president said that the issue was personal to him, because his daughter Malia had had asthma as a young child.If it all sounds scary, it's meant to. Decades of warnings about alleged climate calamities to come have failed to move public opinion on global warming much, so making it about personal health today might have a stronger impact.The claims that Obama & Co. are making, however, are about as solid as smog.True, asthma rates have been climbing. But the cause can't be a global warming-induced increase in smog, because smog levels in the U.S. have dropped 33% since 1980, according to the EPA.As to the Thoracic Society survey, these doctors are misinformed. As with smog, levels of every type of air pollution that the EPA measures — including particulate matter — have dropped significantly over time.So if doctors are seeing an increase in chronic diseases, it doesn't have anything to do with global warming.Obama's fixation on public health doesn't make any sense anyway. According to a 2013 interview with U.N. climate chief Christiana Figueres that was unearthed this week, ""we are already ... exceeding the planetary carrying capacity"" because of overpopulation, and ""should do everything possible"" to cut population growth if there's to be a hope of fighting climate change.Isn't depopulating the planet only going to be harder if Obama is busy keeping everyone healthier?

941,ABC,"Signing far-reaching executive orders seems to have become contagious in American government, at least among Democrats.Gov. Jerry Brown went on national TV Sunday to explain his newly-announced mandatory water restrictions that will, among other things, require California residents to shower less. And if you've ever visited France, you know what that means.Last week Brown, now in his fourth term as chief executive of the nation's most populous state, said California has not properly prepared for the kind of long-term drought it appears to face now. Brown, who turns 77 Tuesday, did not blame George W. Bush, but instead global warming.His wide-ranging 31-point plan, announced during a photo-op in a snow-free mountain field, imposes a 25% water reduction on California cities and towns, empowering water boards to encourage conservation with higher household rates and fines on individuals for liquid disobedience.It also prohibits new residential construction from using potable water for traditional landscape irrigation, bans watering much public property and curbs water use by campuses, golf courses and cemeteries.Additionally, the governor warned private
"
942,ABC,"property owners of the kinds of broad behavioral changes he expects
"
943,ABC,"from his unprecedented order. ""The idea of your nice little green grass
"
944,ABC,"getting water every day,"" Brown vowed sarcastically, ""that's going to be a thing of the past.""Of course, Democrat Brown's plan also involves -- wait for it! -- increased and expedited government spending. Last month the governor signed ""emergency legislation"" involving $1 billion in projects, including food aid, wildlife tracking and flood prevention, which might not seem an urgent spending concern in a four-year drought.Republicans, who are enduring their own political drought controlling anything in Barack Obama's favorite ATM state, prefer long-term drought relief such as construction of reservoirs, part of a $2.7 billion water bond issue approved last year. But none of those GOP priorities are scheduled before 2017 at the earliest.And apparently the coastal state never heard of desalination plants that operate wonderfully elsewhere in the world.Had reservoir expansion been inaugurated by previous state administrations such as, say, Gov. Jerry Brown's other 12 years in office (1975-83 and 2011-15), the water scarcity in the so-called Golden State would be much improved today.Brown's historic executive order falls under the never-let-a-good crisis-go-to-waste category.Because it embraces the MSM-favored agenda of climate change and the obvious need for more government control of private lives down to personal hygiene, there was no challenge to his basic premise during the ABC News interview. It began with the predictable slow-pitch softball query about wake-up calls.""It is a wake-up call,"" Brown agreed, ""and it should be for everyone, because this executive order is done under emergency power. And it has the force of law. Very unusual.""And it's requiring action and changes in behavior from the Oregon border all the way to the Mexican border. It affects lawns. It affects people's -- how long they stay in the shower, how businesses use water.""As with most government programs, however, there is....
"
945,ABC,"....a catch. Brown's much-ballyhooed statewide executive order mandating water cuts covers a mere 20% of all water use.The remaining 80% goes to agriculture, which was completely exempted. Farming is an immense economic activity in California, a major source of America's veggies, fruits and dairy products. Thus, it's a major state political force and a controlling factor in food prices nationally.Brown explained ag's freedom from sanctions by saying the industry provides thousands of jobs and has already faced severe restrictions that forced fallowing thousands of acres.The governor referred Californians to his favorite state water conservation site. There, dim-witted residents are instructed to turn off lawn sprinklers when it's raining. Other ideas: Flush less. Slash shower times in half. And turn the shower completely off while washing your hair.Yes, you will likely get a chill while lathering. But the bureaucrats don't mind. And, the government claims with creepy precision, that saves 150 gallons a month.Also, it will obviously have no effect on Gov. Brown's head.RELATED:How low will Michelle Obama take her high life?Ted Cruz & the large 2016 GOP presidential fieldObama's EPA cracks down on your long hotel showersWhy exactly are rabbits delivering chicken eggs to private homes?

959,ABC,"21st Century Fox (FOXA) announced Tuesday that ""The X-Files"" will return to TV as a six-episode ""event series."" David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson will reprise their roles a Mulder and Sully in the science-fiction drama, which originally aired from 1993-2002, and spawned two feature films. Creator Chris Carter will be back at the helm.If a Hollywood studio can bring back a show that arguably outstayed its welcome, what about a critically acclaimed show that was cancelled too soon? Specifically, can we finally bring back ""Firefly,"" the short-lived sci-fi western with a big cult following?""The X-Files"" revival isn't about the future, but about the past. A few new episodes won't do much for Fox's ratings. But it could make the old content valuable, especially on streaming networks.""The X-Files"" is available on Netflix (NFLX), Amazon (AMZN) and Hulu. New episodes could let Fox sign a much more lucrative deal by generating viewer interest in streaming the entire series.That's what Fox did with ""24."" It brought back the Jack Bauer series in a limited run last summer — ""24: Live Another Day."" It got relatively low ratings. But Fox was able to sell exclusive streaming rights for the entire series to Amazon.'Firefly' Lives?Which brings us to ""Firefly."" Fox aired just 11 episodes out of 14 made for the 2002 TV series. But it quickly became a cult hit among rabid science-fiction fans. Creator Joss Whedon managed to turn ""Firefly"" into a 2006 feature film, ""Serenity."" The movie got good reviews, but didn't make its money back — until strong DVD sales and other follow-on revenue.""Firefly"" has lived on in comic books, an unauthorized online ""spinoff"" and at Comic-Con. It's almost a rite of nerd culture to say that you're a ""Firefly"" fan.""Firefly"" could return to Fox. It presumably wouldn't make money by itself, but might make ""Firefly"" more lucrative as streaming content, like ""The X-Files"" and ""24.""Firefly also could return as a streaming only series. Netflix brought back the Fox comedy ""Arrested Development"" for a streaming-only season, but has said previously that it would pass on reviving ""Firefly.""""Firefly,"" with its custom sets, special effects and large cast, would be expensive. But Amazon, Hulu Plus or Yahoo Screen might decide that ""Firefly"" could make the winner a must-have streaming service and be a loss leader that pays off long term.Yahoo (YHOO) revived ""Community"" this month on Yahoo Screen after the comedy aired five seasons on Comcast (CMCSA)-owned NBC. The online giant hopes that ""Community"" will raise interest about the no-subscription Yahoo Screen, which is airing more original content.A sticking point for rebooting Firefly may be getting the key players back together. The show had a large ensemble cast that has gone its separate ways. In particular, Nathan Fillion (Captain Mal on ""Firefly""), is the title character in ""Castle,"" on Walt Disney (DIS)-owned ABC.Fillion has made it clear that he would love to see ""Firefly"" return. He and co-star Alan Tudyk recently crowdfunded ""Con Man,"" which will be a series of 10-minute shorts about two actors on a sci-fi show canned too soon. Hmm...But could — or would — Fillion actually commit to a ""Firefly"" return?""Firefly"" also would be unthinkable without Whedon. He directed the hugely popular ""Avengers"" movie as well as the upcoming sequel. He apparently passed on making the next two Avengers films to avoid burnout. But it's unclear if the creator of ""Buffy,"" ""Angel"" and ""Cabin In The Woods"" would want to re-till old ground with ""Firefly.""Other Possible Cult-Hit Revivals?What other shows could get a (revenue) streaming or TV/streaming revival?* ""Chappelle's Show"" (2003-2006). The Viacom (VIA)-owned Comedy Central sketch comedy show (2003-2006) still gets good ratings in reruns. An ""event series"" could introduce Chappelle to a new generation.* ""Pushing Daisies"" (2007-2009). A critical hit, but a ratings bust. It's unclear if this sweet, quirky dramedy would generate huge buzz beyond its niche fan base.

961,ABC,"Apple (AAPL) reportedly will unveil a long-awaited revamp of its Apple TV set-top box this June, at the same event where it is likely to announce a subscription Internet TV service.Apple's next-generation set-top box will include a faster processor, a big increase in onboard storage and an improved operating system that can support Siri voice controls as well as downloadable apps from a new App Store, BuzzFeed reported Friday. Apple will release a software development kit and finally allow developers to write apps for the device, BuzzFeed said.Apple hasn't significantly updated the Apple TV box since a third-generation model debuted in March 2012. Apple has sold 25 million units of its streaming video box since it first hit the market in January 2007. The device allows owners to watch subscription video-on-demand services like Netflix (NFLX) and Hulu Plus and pay-per-view movies from Apple.It competes with streaming devices from Roku, Amazon.com (AMZN), Google (GOOGL) and others.Last week, Apple cut the price of its current Apple TV hardware by 30% to $69. It also announced that it would be the exclusive launch partner for Time Warner's (TWX) new streaming video service HBO Now.Apple will announce the new Apple TV hardware and software at its Worldwide Developers Conference, tentatively scheduled for early June in San Francisco, BuzzFeed said. At the same conference, Apple is expected to announce a new subscription streaming music service, as well as an over-the-top Internet TV service to compete with cable offerings and new OTT services from Dish Network (DISH) and Sony (SNE).Apple's Internet TV service is expected to launch in September with about 25 channels, including CBS (CBS), Fox (FOXA) and Walt Disney (DIS)-owned ABC broadcast networks. Comcast (CMCSA)-owned NBC would be offered as a separate subscription on Apple TV, not part of the basic bundle, according to news reports. The price for the Apple television service is rumored to be $30 to $40 a month.An Apple Internet TV service could accelerate Apple's path to getting 20% of its operating income from services in the next couple of years, Morgan Stanley analyst Katy Huberty said in a research report Friday. Other Apple services include iTunes, App Store, Apple Pay and the Beats subscription music service. Services accounted for 14% of Apple's operating income in 2014, she said.""Just in the U.S., we see the potential for Apple to add 15 million subscribers to its TV service, or 8% of U.S. Apple users,"" Huberty said. At $30 a month, 15 million Apple TV subscribers would bring in $5.5 billion in revenue and $1.6 billion of earnings before interest and taxes, she said.RELATED:Here's why Apple wants a new streaming music serviceSony pursues cord cutters with over-the-top TV servicePaid Video Streaming Reaches Over 40% Of U.S. Homes.

962,ABC,"After months of beta testing, Sony (SNE) on Wednesday launched its PlayStation Vue television service, which aims to compete with cable and other pay TV offerings.PlayStation Vue offers a starting package of 50 channels for $50 a month, but you must own a Sony PS3 or PS4 game console and have broadband Internet service to receive it. Initially it will be available only in New York, Chicago and Philadelphia.Sony introduced the service in November, calling it a ""pioneering new cloud-based TV service that reinvents the television experience.""The company also is offering two higher-priced tiers of Vue that include more channels for $60 and $70 a month.PlayStation Vue follows the nationwide launch of Sling TV from Dish Network (DISH), another over-the-top Internet pay TV service. Sling TV offers a starting package of 20 channels for $20 a month and is available using Roku and Amazon.com (AMZN) streaming devices and Microsoft 's (MSFT) Xbox One game console.Apple (AAPL) reportedly is preparing to enter the OTT TV market this fall. Media reports say Apple will launch its service with about 25 channels for $30 to $40 a month. Apple stock has risen three straight days since the Wall Street Journal broke the news.The OTT services from Dish, Sony and Apple are aimed at ""cord cutters"" — consumers who have quit traditional pay TV services — and millennials who have never received cable. Each offers a different set of channels with noticeable absences. For instance, Sony's Vue is missing the CW network and channels from Walt Disney (DIS), including ABC and ESPN.Meanwhile, several content providers are launching their own OTT services. Time Warner (TWX) will launch its HBO Now service in April for $15 a month. CBS (CBS) offers CBS All-Access for $6 a month. Viacom (VIAB)-owned Nickelodeon offers its Noggin programming for $6 a month.These services both complement and compete with subscription video-on-demand services from Amazon, Hulu, Netflix (NFLX) and others.Programmers wouldn't be participating in over-the-top TV services if they didn't believe it was additive to their businesses, rather than cannibalistic, Deutsche Bank analyst Bryan Kraft said in a research report Wednesday.""They believe it could be an opportunity to monetize some of the (about) 18 million TV households that don't subscribe to a pay-TV service today, which we forecast to grow to 31 million by 2020,"" Kraft said.

965,ABC,"Election '16: Donald Trump returning praise for Russian ruler Vladimir Putin is yet another disqualification for the GOP front-runner. A commander in chief so susceptible to flattery would be a security risk.In P.G. Wodehouse's comic novel, ""The Code of the Woosters,"" the eponymous code dictated that dunderhead Bertie Wooster might have ended up marrying a girl against his will so as not to appear unchivalrous.""The Code of the Trumps"" apparently demands that anyone — even a murderous tyrant — who compliments The Donald immediately gets complimented back.Flattery will get you everywhere, even if you're an imperialist adversary of the U.S., exploiting President Obama's Mideast power vacuum and seeking to return Russia to global superpower status.Trump considers it ""a great honor"" that Putin called him ""bright"" and ""talented without doubt"" and considers the casino mogul ""the absolute leader of the presidential race."" On ABC's ""This Week,"" Trump remarked that ""Obama doesn't get along with Putin... . Putin can't stand our president, and it's causing us difficulty.''But it isn't that Putin isn't happy about Obama being president; how could he not be happy, since it's let him, forgive the pun, trump America in the most strategically important region of the world?Last Friday, Trump told MSNBC, ""When people call you 'brilliant,' it's always good, especially when the person heads up Russia."" When it was pointed out to him that Putin rubs out political opponents and critical journalists, Trump retorted, ""he's running his country, and at least he's a leader, unlike what we have in this country.""Asked again, Trump actually said, ""Well, I think that our country does plenty of killing, too.""Talk about U.S.-Russian moral equivalence.On ABC, Trump dug the hole even deeper, contending that ""if he has killed reporters, I think that's terrible."" But then the man so quick to insult so many Americans gave the former KGB officer the full benefit of the doubt: ""This isn't like somebody that's stood with a gun and he's, you know, taken the blame or he's admitted that he's killed. He's always denied it.""As geopolitical players go, the now highly-experienced Putin is as shrewd as they come. He knows that you play different opponents different ways, exploiting the weaknesses they show you.He bamboozled George W. Bush, who claimed, ""I looked the man in the eye,"" found him ""trustworthy,"" and ""I was able to get a sense of his soul."" He treats our feckless current president with contempt. Now Putin sees that Trump's weakness is his easily stroked ego.Ego drives most of Donald Trump's behavior, which includes a liberal — even socialist — past. Now we know that his vanity is also a security risk.
"
966,ABC,"Politics: Democrats like to portray themselves as champions of the good ol' middle-class. Yet on key issues, they've staked out positions diametrically opposed to the desires of those same Americans.Item 1: Democrats have been trying to force American consumers to buy cars they clearly don't want.One of the first things President Obama did in office was push through a 35% increase in the federal fuel-economy mandate for cars and trucks. Next year, the average mileage per gallon for all cars sold is supposed to be 34.1. Ten years from now, it's supposed to hit 54.5.Obama constantly sells this as a big win for consumers, who are supposedly being denied the gas-sipping cars they want by Big Auto. But actual car buyers are voting with their wallets against what the president wants.This week, his Environmental Protection Agency reported that, despite the tightening standards, the average fuel economy of cars sold in 2014 was unchanged from the year before. In fact, it's barely budged in years.The University of Michigan's Transportation Research Institute, which tracks the fuel economy of cars sold on a monthly basis, says that fuel economy worsened between October 2014 and this November by almost a full mile per gallon.Why? Because consumers are buying more gas-guzzling pickup trucks, SUVs and crossovers. The EPA data show that trucks accounted for almost 41% of car sales last year, up from 36% in 2012.What they aren't buying are plug-in electrics and hybrids, which still make up a tiny fraction of auto sales despite massive government subsidies.In other words, consumers are putting power, utility and safety considerations well above the Democrats' demand for greater MPG.Item 2: Democrats have also made it their mission to impose stricter gun control laws on the country. On Wednesday, House Democrats introduced a measure to ban assault weapons, and Obama is preparing still more executive orders to tighten access to guns.The public? They want more access to guns, not less. Gun sales have exploded after each mass shooting, as an increasing number of people realize that being armed is the first, best defense against a terrorist or crazed killer.Meanwhile, polls show a steady decline in support for stricter gun control laws. A Roper tracking survey finds support below 50%, lower than it's been since they started the survey in 1989.Even more surprising, for the first time ever, the majority of Americans oppose a ban on assault weapons, the bete noire of the gun control crowd, according to an ABC News/Washington Post poll. Where 80% supported such a ban in 1994, only 45% do now.Item 3: Democrats insist that the U.S. play host to tens of thousands of Syrian refugees, even after the terror attacks in Paris and San Bernardino. In fact, Democrats running for president are in a bidding war to see who will admit more refugees. Hillary Clinton's current offer is 65,000.That's despite widespread opposition from the public. The latest IBD/TIPP Poll — taken in late early December — found that 56% oppose letting even 10,000 Syrian refugees into the country.They have good reason to feel that way. Syria is now a hotbed of ISIS radicals who have publicly stated that they intend to use the refugee crisis (which they've created) to smuggle terrorists into other countries to carry out attacks — as they did in Paris.Plus, the administration has admitted that it has no way to guarantee it can properly vet the refugees Obama wants to let in.The Democrats' response to such concerns is ""suck it up."" Accept the increased risk of terrorism, give up your guns and stuff your family into a tiny electric car.And we're supposed to think Republicans are the out-of-touch extremists?

967,ABC,"Homeland Insecurity: San Bernardino terrorist Tashfeen Malik posted pro-jihad, anti-U.S. messages on social media, yet Homeland Security deliberately overlooked the rants before admitting the Pakistani to the U.S.It's been reported that DHS simply ""missed"" the posts when reviewing Malik's visa application. But ABC News now reveals that the immigration officials were following Obama regime policy barring checks on applicants' Facebook and Twitter accounts.""During that time period, immigration officials were not allowed to use or review social media as part of the screening process,"" said John Cohen, a former acting undersecretary at DHS for intelligence and analysis.Even after immigration officials complained about the policy in early 2014, Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson refused to end it. As a result, Malik received a U.S. visa in May 2014, despite what the FBI says were extensive social media messages about ""jihad and martyrdom.""These were obvious red flags signaling sympathies with Islamic terrorism. Had they been heeded, Malik would have been denied entry, and the lives of 14 Americans might have been spared.The lax immigration-screening policy stems from a training manual distributed by DHS' Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties. Titled ""Countering Violent Extremism: Training Do's and Don'ts,"" the internal document prohibits agents from equating the desire for Sharia law, including jihad, with criminal activity.""One can have radical thoughts/ideas, including disliking the U.S. government, without being violent,"" the manual states. Just because someone like Malik hates America, you see, doesn't disqualify him from entry.The manual, which reads like a mindless set of PC rules, also discourages agents from using ethnic or religious ""indicators"" to identify people likely to carry out acts of violent extremism. Making a connection between Islamic practices or culture (i.e., jihad) and suspicious activity is a big no-no.Stereotyping foreign Muslims, even those coming from hostile Islamist countries, as extremists must never be done. ""It is incorrect and damaging to assert that all Muslims have terrorist ties,"" DHS civil-rights attorneys warn agents and their supervisors.In screening Muslim immigrants, even those from high-risk nations, DHS doesn't even bother to do what every parent, employer and college admissions officer does — look closely at social media postings.

968,ABC,"Walt Disney (DIS) disclosed late Wednesday that ESPN has lost 7 million customers in two years as cord-cutting ramps up and people switch to streaming services such as Netflix (NFLX), Amazon (AMZN) and Hulu.ESPN had 92 million subscribers as of Oct. 3, according to a Walt Disney SEC filing. That's down from 95 million a year earlier and 99 million in 2013.Most other Disney cable channels lost ground, including ABC Family, Disney Channel and Disney XD.ESPN's woes are a bad sign for other cable channels and, to a lesser extent, pay-TV operators. Sports programming and, to a lesser extent, reality TV are key reasons to continue subscribing to traditional cable and satellite providers. You can't get the Super Bowl live on Netflix or Amazon streaming services.Subscriber losses suggest ESPN is less of a must-have, or that cable operators decide they won't pay heavily for ESPN2, ESPN News and other sister channels, and may push them to lesser tiers as ""skinny packages"" become more common.Cable channel operators like Viacom (VIAB) will have a tougher time. Viacom has Comedy Central, MTV, Nickelodeon and many other channels that cater to kids, teens and young adults — classic cord-cutters or cord-nevers. They may opt for the same or similar programming via Netflix or other streaming services.Walt Disney's August warning of ESPN subscriber losses triggered a sharp sell-off in Disney's stock and shares of other TV content firms.

991,ABC,"Time Warner's (TWX) upcoming negotiations to renew programming deals with pay-TV service operators will be key for the media and entertainment giant's growth prospects, analysts say.Time Warner, which on Wednesday reported Q4 earnings that topped estimates, has upcoming talks with Comcast (CMCSA), satellite TV broadcaster Dish Network (DISH) and Time Warner Cable (TWC). Federal regulators are reviewing the proposed Comcast-Time Warner Cable merger.""The pivotal question for Time Warner investors is whether management will successfully complete the U.S. affiliate deals in 2015 needed to drive a dramatic acceleration,"" said UBS analyst Doug Mitchelson in a research report. ""We expect TWX will be successful with renewals.""Analysts say that the biggest content providers — such as Time Warner, Walt Disney (DIS) and Twenty-First Century Fox (FOXA) — may have an edge over smaller programmers as pay-TV distributors look to lower programming costs.Pay-TV companies are shifting to slimmer programming packages, offering consumers fewer channels either in new ""over-the-top"" Internet video services or in ""broadband-first"" deals. To target cord cutters looking for ""a la carte"" packages, Comcast, Cox Communications and AT&T (T) have stepped up promotions of cheaper, $40 to $50 monthly plans that feature high-speed Internet and basic TV — without ESPN, Discovery (DISCA) and other high-cost channels.Larger content firms have a better chance of having their cable networks included in slimmed down TV packages, analysts say. That's why Viacom (VIA) and CBS (CBS) are reportedly exploring a merger to gain more negotiating clout.""(Time Warner's) outlook for growth beyond 2015 appears much more reliant on a meaningful acceleration in revenue growth, which is likely to require successful renegotiation of the last two major domestic (pay-TV) deals and highly successful box office performance,"" said Andy Hargreaves, analyst at Pacific Crest Securities, in a report. Time Warner owns the Warner Brothers film studio.Dish Network has rolled out a new TV Web-only offering called Sling. It's called ""skinny"" because the satellite TV broadcaster's Web-based offering includes only 12 channels, but for just $20 monthly.Dish's deal includes programming from Disney, Time Warner's Turner network, Scripps Networks Interactive (SNI) and AMC Network (AMCX). Left out of the Dish Sling TV package were the big four national TV networks — ABC, CBS, Fox and Comcast's NBCUniversal — as well as cable channels from CBS, Discovery, Fox, NBCU and Viacom.Some media firms plan to go it alone with their own Web offerings. Time Warner plans to sell HBO on the Webin 2015, and CBS has launched a subscription streaming service. The Web streaming services target young adults and other consumers that ""cut the cord,"" industry jargon for the growing number of people that disconnect pay-TV service in favor of more affordable online video options and on-demand content.

1015,ABC,"He rates Apple stock outperform with a price target of 135.Apple (AAPL) is preparing to enter the over-the-top Internet television market this year with a multichannel subscription service that would provide an alternative to more expensive cable, satellite and telco TV services. The streaming video service will launch this fall with about 25 channels, including several broadcast networks, the Wall Street Journal reported late Monday. Apple's service would be available on iOS devices including iPhones, iPads and the Apple TV set-top box.Apple's service reportedly will include CBS (CBS), Fox (FOXA) and Walt Disney (DIS)-owned ABC broadcast networks. NBC is not part of the subscription programming bundle, but the Comcast (CMCSA)-owned network plans to offer a stand-alone streaming app for Apple TV later this year, 9to5Mac reported Tuesday.Apple is aiming to offer the service for $30 to $40 a month. It likely will announce the service in June and launch it in September, the Journal said.The news follows the recent launch of Dish Network 's (DISH) watershed Sling TV service. Sling TV starts at $20 a month and includes live streaming of 20 cable networks including AMC, Cartoon Network, CNN, ESPN, TBS and TNT. Additional channels are available through add-on packages.On Tuesday, Sling TV added Microsoft's (MSFT) Xbox One video game console to its list of compatible hardware. It's the third big-screen platform for Sling TV, which is also available on Roku and Amazon (AMZN) Fire TV hardware. Microsoft said Xbox One owners can get a one-month free trial of Sling TV service.Sony (SNE) is planning to launch a similar service aimed at so-called ""cord cutters"" soon.Apple stock was up more than 1.5% in afternoon trading on the stock market today, near 127.Apple's over-the-top television service could lay the groundwork for Apple to come out with its own television set, possibly in 2016, Piper Jaffray analyst Gene Munster said in a research report Tuesday. Munster rates Apple stock as overweight with a price target of 160.This month, Apple slashed the price of its Apple TV set-top box to $69 from $99 and announced that it would be the exclusive launch partner for Time Warner's (TWX) HBO Now streaming service in April.The Apple television service could be a low-margin business designed to keep customers using its hardware, Wells Fargo Securities analyst Maynard Um said in a note Tuesday. Um rates Apple stock market-perform.""While this could help revenue, we believe margins may be low when taking content and other costs into account,"" Um said. ""Rather, we believe this strategy could be to drive further lock-in to stem any threats of attrition and potential to gain share (i.e. hardware sales).""Given Apple's immense size, revenue from the TV service would be ""largely immaterial"" to the company, Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi said in a note Tuesday. And the service likely would cut into Apple's gross profit margin, he said.""We see an Apple TV service's principal value as enhancing Apple's iOS ecosystem, akin to other service offerings like iCloud, Siri, and Apple Pay, which we believe collectively help strengthen and differentiate the platform relative to Android,"" Sacconaghi said.He rates Apple stock outperform with a price target of 135.

1016,ABC,"The furor over Hillary Clinton's private email account while Secretary of State, and her poor handling of the revelations, should be a serious blow for her presidential ambitions. She broke or twisted the rules apparently to hide her communications from the public. More broadly, it revived general concerns about her likability and skill as a campaigner.Yet Clinton has no serious rivals for the nomination. Credit the Clinton brand and her vast political connections for scaring off significant challengers.But another big reason is that Democrats lack a deep bench. And Democrats can thank President Obama for that.The party controlling the White House almost always loses down the ballot, especially for a two-term president, according to Geoffrey Skelley, associate editor of Sabato's Crystal Ball.But under Obama, Democrats have lost more than 900 state legislative seats, 69 U.S. House seats and 13 U.S. senate seats, all the most since World War II. Democrats also have lost 11 governorships.Republicans now control 31 governorships. Obama was elected as a sitting senator, but usually governors, former governors or vice presidents win.""That executive experience has to make you a more attractive option,"" Skelley said. ""Governors have a track record for executive decision-making.""The GOP has governors in several key battleground states, including Florida and the Midwest's Wisconsin, Indiana, Michigan. It even has the governor's mansion in deep-blue Illinois and Iowa.It's not a real surprise that the early GOP front-runners for the 2016 presidential nomination are Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker and ex-Florida Gov. Jeb Bush.But it gets worse. Democrats don't just lack a bench. The bench lacks a bench.The GOP now controls 68 of the country's 98 legislative chambers, excluding Nebraska's officially nonpartisan unicameral legislature. That's a gain of 30 chambers since the end of 2008. Republicans hold the most slate legislative seats since the 1920s.As a result, the Democrats' pool of potential future governors and U.S. senators is historically low. That suggests that the ranks of attractive Democratic presidential contenders will be thin for years to come, even if the party starts to reverse its down-ticket losses.Democrats do control most big cities. But no sitting mayor has ever been elected president. Grover Cleveland is the only ex-mayor (Buffalo) to take the White House, and he was governor of New York before becoming president.Besides, mayors face major fiscal challenges over the coming years that will make it hard to stay popular. With public employee retiree costs soaring, Democratic mayors have to choose between raising taxes, cutting services, or taking on unions. Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel is in a runoff for re-election in large part because he's butted heads with teachers unions.So Democrats seeking an ABC candidate (Anybody But Clinton) are left grasping at straws. Their great hope is Elizabeth Warren, a senator for two years, who is probably to the left of the decidedly liberal Massachusetts. And she says she's not running.Then again, Democrats (and Republicans) don't need a slew of great choices. They just need one every four to eight years.Democrats obviously don't want Republicans to control the White House and Congress. But a President Clinton would likely exacerbate the party's down-ticket woes, Skelley said.""For the long-term health of the Democratic party, it might be good for Hillary to lose,"" he suggested. ""A Hillary win could make the health of the Democratic bench even worse.""Follow Ed Carson on Twitter: @IBD_ECarson.

The S&P 500 climbed 0.8%.Volume rose, up about 5% each on the Nasdaq and NYSE exchanges.The stock market today continued to carefully watch the ongoing Greece/eurozone crisis. A letter from Greek leaders Tuesday night conceded to more of the creditors' austerity demands than before, but requested an extension for the now-expired bailout support and additional funds. Reuters reported that German officials were skeptical of the proposal, but said the ""door was still open for negotiations.""Early U.S. economic news was mixed, with new jobs and layoffs increasing in June.June manufacturing softened. The Purchasing Managers Index eased to 53.6, down from 54 in May and a tad shy of views for 53.7.The ISM Index from the Institute of Supply Management was more positive, rising to 53.3. That was above May's 52.8 tally and narrowly above consensus estimates for 53.2.Construction spending slowed sharply in May, the Commerce Department said, rising 0.8% vs. April's downwardly revised 2.1% increase. Still, the number was better than the 0.5% increase forecast by economists.Among automakers reporting June sales, Nissan Motor (NSANY) led with a 13.3% increase. Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) reported an 8.2% gain for the month. Ford (F) sales gained 1.6%. General Motors (GM) sales fell 3%.In stocks, insurer Travelers (TRV) popped 3.6% to lead the Dow. The stock was possibly boosted by this morning's news that Switzerland-based Ace (ACE) would buy New Jersey-based insurer Chubb (CB) in a deal valued at $28.3 billion. Chubb shares spiked 33% at the open. Ace climbed 7%.On the Nasdaq 100, Wynn Resorts (WYNN) spiked 7%, stretching its legs for a second day after regulators in China eased travel restrictions for visitors from mainland China to Macau, where Wynn and competitors operate a hive of casinos. Wynn has been in a correction for 15 months.Among IBD 50 stocks,France's Criteo (CRTO) sparked up 5% out of the starting gate.

1039,ABC,"Barack Obama wanted 15 minutes of airtime on Sunday night, the most heavily watched night of the week, to speak to the nation about the San Bernardino shooting.It was appropriate for the president to request it, and for the networks to grant it, but everyone knew he would say nothing new of substance. On the matter of Islamic terrorism, he never does. And he didn't. And in so not doing, he wowed the press again.The stenographers underlined his good intentions. On ABC, Clinton-donating George Stephanopoulos summarized: ""A stern and direct President Obama, laying out what he called a strong and smart strategy to deal with the terrorist threat that has evolved here in the United States.""On PBS, anchor Judy Woodruff said, ""I was struck when the president said we will destroy the Islamic State. He said we will prevail by being strong and smart.""No one in these slavish studios would dare to suggest that events from Paris to San Bernardino had exposed Obama as hapless and weak. Or that more speeches weren't going to fix it, especially when he offers no new initiative to change a failed policy.Go back about eight years, when President Bush asked for a primetime address on Sept. 13, 2007, to address the status of the surge of troops in Iraq.Here's what NBC morning host Meredith Vieira asked future Obama defense secretary Chuck Hagel, then a Republican of sorts: ""Senator, good morning to you. Let me ask you right out of the bat — when the president speaks about Iraq tonight, do you believe that he will have any credibility?""That was mild for its time. MSNBC's top ""talent"" Keith Olbermann at that point was suggesting Bush was either a ""pathological presidential liar"" or an ""idiot-in-chief.""After Bush's 2007 address, there came a five-minute Democrat response from Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island. Did anyone at the networks line up a Republican response to Obama for Sunday night? No one even considered it, apparently — despite the fact that Obama predictably went political and blamed the GOP majority in Congress for failing to pass enough gun control.President Obama is also losing on his proposal to admit 10,000 Syrian refugees into the United States. In his speech, he declared ""it is the responsibility of all Americans — of every faith — to reject discrimination. It is our responsibility to reject religious tests on who we admit into this country.""Couldn't anyone in the press find the irony here? Under President Obama, the State Department reports that out of 2,184 Syrian refugees admitted into the U.S. since the Syrian civil war erupted in 2011, only 53 (2.4%) have been Christians, while 2,098 (or 96%) have been Muslims.Since the Paris terror attacks on Nov. 13, the State Department has admitted 237 Syrian refugees — 236 Sunni Muslims and one Christian (0.4%).The latest Investor's Business Daily/TIPP poll showed that 60% of the country believes allowing Syrian refugees into America is a threat to our national security. By 56% to 39%, they oppose admitting 10,000 Syrian refugees, and 56% are not confident in the U.S. government's vetting process.The Obama administration is dreadfully incompetent, and this president is seriously out of touch. The networks have some propaganda to make, so they're airing stories of sympathetic Syrian refugees now living in America and proclaiming how much they love it — take that, you racist, Islamophobic Republicans who would dare to put the flow of these patriotic refugees on hold! Bozell is president of the Media Research Center. Graham is the center's director of media analysis and executive editor of the blog NewsBusters.org.

That doesn't hold up, either.On Sunday, Obama told the public that the Muslim terrorist couple who shot 35 people in a government office Dec. 2 were not ""part of a broader conspiracy here at home."" That, like previous statements, is proving premature, if not bogus.We've since learned Syed Farook's mother is under FBI investigation for possible complicity in the attack, which killed 14. Rafia Farook, 62, was living in the terrorists' Redlands, Calif., home, where Farook and his wife Tashfeen Malik made pipe bombs and accumulated a massive cache of ammunition totaling more than 7,000 rounds. A UPS driver said that he dropped off more than a dozen packages a day at the address in the week leading up to the attack.Investigators, moreover, found shooting targets, GoPro camera packaging and vise-grip tools inside a Lexus registered to the mother. ISIS terrorists have used helmet-mounted GoPros to capture grisly footage during their attacks. Rafia's daughter-in-law had sworn allegiance to ISIS.The FBI is also tracing large money transfers from Farook to his mother, including at least three transfers of $5,000 in the days before the shooting. The son received a mysterious loan of $28,500 before the attack.Investigators, who already have grilled the mother for more than 10 hours, are also looking into a certificate of membership made out in her name from a Pakistani-tied Islamist group — the Islamic Circle of North America. ICNA supports an Islamic caliphate and promotes teachings of a notorious jihadi preacher from Pakistan.Meanwhile, ABC News says that Farook's father ""has been placed on a federal terrorist watch list"" known as TIDES. The father told an Italian newspaper that his son supported ISIS and hated Israel, yet he never told authorities about his radicalism.Both he and the mother insist they knew nothing of their son's murderous plans. The more we hear about the Farook family, though, the more suspicious we get.Then there's Farook's long-time neighbor and friend, whom agents are investigating for purchasing the two assault rifles used in the attacks. Enrique Marquez — a Muslim convert who attended mosque with the Farook family — bought an M&P15 semi-auto rifle and an A-15 semi-auto rifle for his pal.Now investigators are also looking at a possible foreign connection to ISIS recruiter Mohamed Abdullahi Hassan, a Somali refugee who immigrated to Minneapolis before fleeing the country as a wanted terrorist fugitive. Farook is believed to have had contact with Hassan, wanted in connection with the recent ISIS-led terrorist attack in Garland, Texas.Other reports indicate that Farook's plot included other targets involving a larger cell. San Bernardino police are investigating suspicious behavior by two Middle Eastern men at a local movie theater less than 48 hours before the attack. And Los Angeles police are looking into reports of a man matching Farook's description and another man casing a downtown high-rise.So Obama has now fumbled the terror ball three times in just the last three weeks with claims that ISIS is ""contained,"" there are ""no credible threats"" to the homeland, and the San Bernardino attack was not part of a broader conspiracy.After he's created such a demonstrably false sense of security, how can an increasingly fearful American public trust this president when it comes to terrorism? With such gross incompetence, how can anyone have confidence that he can protect us and our families?
"
1065,ABC,"President Obama, just back from the ongoing Paris climate summit, is stuck on his doomsday global warming kick. But if like most Americans you disapprove of the Democrat's so far ineffectual strategy against ISIS, stick around a few minutes. It'll change.It did again Tuesday. For the better, if you'd like to see the terrorist army's globally-growing tentacles addressed in a lethal way.Here, briefly, is Obama's tangled history with ISIS: 23 months ago he dismissed it as the JV. Seven months later he admitted no strategy to address the rampaging radical jihadist horde of rapists, beheaders, executioners and crucifiers conquering broad territories in Syria and the Iraq that Obama exited so hastily in 2011.Remember Obama has frequently assured his party: ""I will not put American boots on the ground in Syria."" After ISIS publicly beheaded an American hostage, Obama vowed to ""degrade and ultimately defeat"" it. He announced a half-hearted strategy of bombing and an expensive training program for so-called moderate Syrian rebels. Both flopped.The training program cost north of $40 million and produced -- wait for it -- about a dozen fighters, status currently unknown.The air campaign was so hamstrung by Obama's rules of engagement that 75% of the planes returned with their ordnance. Frustrated pilots tell of orders to drop leaflets announcing raids hours or a day before attacks, providing ample time for ISIS to move/hide troops and gear.This fall Obama dispatched 50 Special Ops forces to place experienced eyes inside the fragile coalition of anti-Assad forces. One Delta Force member died in a firefight, but Obama aides grotesquely denied it was combat.Two weeks ago the president assured ABC News that ISIS was ""contained."" Oops! That night its followers exploded that claim and suicide vests in Paris, killing 130.Tuesday as Obama droned on in that same city about global warming, which he calls the worst national security threat facing America, his secretary of Defense Ash Carter and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Joseph Dunford appeared before the House Armed Services Committee.We've slightly edited a C-SPAN video of their testimony below here. The interplay is revealing. News bits include:Obama is ""deploying a specialized expeditionary targeting force to assist Iraqi and Peshmerga forces."" These Special Ops guys, perhaps around 200 to start, will ""over time be able to conduct raids, free hostages, gather intel and capture ISIL leaders.""But wait! There's more from Carter. ""This force will also be in a position to conduct unilateral operations in Syria."" Members will presumably wear boots on that ground.Under direct questioning, the Marine general contradicted Obama: ""We have not contained ISIL.""During the 83 interminable months of this presidency we've all learned that Obama's intellectual insecurities render him incapable of admitting mistakes. Red line. ObamaCare. New job creation. Benghazi video. Et al.Obama will never acknowledge under-estimating ISIS. That won't matter if this new deployment starts a serious bid to degrade and ultimately destroy it. But if it's yet another tardy half-measure to run out the next 414 days, that'll loom as a far larger legacy than Obama's global-warming hot air.RELATED:

1070,ABC,"Apple (AAPL) has been trying for years to break into the Internet television business with plans to offer a package of basic cable channels that could serve as an alternative to traditional pay-TV services. But Apple hasn't been able to secure the content deals needed to make it happen.Now that Dish Network (DISH) and Sony (SNE) have blazed a trail with such services, Apple once again is looking to enter the over-the-top television business. Apple is now negotiating with TV programmers and has shown demos of its proposed service, Re/code reported Wednesday.Apple's talks with TV programmers are at an early stage, and details like pricing and timing still need to be worked out, Re/code said.Meanwhile, Apple's streaming video box, the Apple TV, is overdue for an upgrade. The Cupertino, Calif.-based company hasn't come out with a new version of the $99 set-top box in two years.Dish Network began rolling out its Sling TV service last month after earning rave reviews with its introduction at the 2015 International CES show in Las Vegas.For $20 a month, Sling TV will deliver live sports, lifestyle, family, news and information channels, video-on-demand entertainment and the best of online video to broadband-connected devices at home and on the go. The base package includes 12 channels: ESPN, ESPN2, TNT, TBS, Food Network, HGTV, Travel Channel, Adult Swim, Cartoon Network, Disney Channel, ABC Family and CNN. Dish also will sell add-on packs costing $5 a month focused on sports, news and kids channels.Sony's PlayStation Vue will launch soon with about 75 channels from CBS (CBS), Discovery Communications (DISCA), Fox (FOXA), NBCUniversal, Scripps Networks Interactive (SNI) and Viacom (VIAB). By the end of March, the subscription cloud TV service is expected to go live in four cities: New York, Philadelphia, Chicago and Los Angeles. Pricing has yet to be announced, but some reports say it could cost $60 to $80 a month.

1071,ABC,"2016: Media attacks on GOP White House hopefuls contrast sharply with the kid-glove treatment of Democrats. We saw the same one-sided vetting in the 2012 and 2008 campaigns. But this time, hits on Republicans are coming earlier than ever.Republican candidates haven't even officially thrown their hats into the ring. Yet they've been blasted with a barrage of negative press in an orchestrated attempt to turn voters off to the entire GOP field and take down any threats against Hillary Clinton's coronation.No sooner had Mitt Romney bowed out of the race and Jeb Bush moved to the front of the GOP pack than the old liberal media tarred Bush with the same brush that they smeared Romney with in 2012.If you believe the Boston Globe and its 4,350-word hit piece, which ""investigated"" Bush all the way back to his high school days at Phillips Academy, Bush is the same prep-school bully in Massachusetts that Romney allegedly was in Michigan. The Globe said the 6-4 Bush was so cruel, he sewed a smaller student's pajama legs together at the bottom. A sadist has no place in the Oval Office.It gets worse: The Globe discovered Bush smoked pot and had a few bad grades, too.Obama's grades, in contrast, are still unknown. His school records, from high school to law school, remain hidden. The media never pried into his financial support or his international travel. The same vetting failure has transferred to Hillary's past. Her early days are still a relative blank slate.Bloomberg News recently ran a lengthy hit piece on Bush under the headline ""Jeb Bush Has a Mitt Romney Problem"" and a graphic showing Romney emerging from the unzipped face of Bush. His crime? He holds overseas investment accounts.What accounts does Democrat Sen. Elizabeth Warren hold? New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo? The media don't say. All we've seen are puff pieces on these Democrat hopefuls.The media blackout on Warren is particularly galling. She presents a target-rich environment for any enterprising journalist.Warren maintains in her recent memoir that she is Cherokee Indian, despite evidence to the contrary. Her claim is relevant in light of her tenured professorship at Harvard, which claimed her as a minority.Her Senate financial disclosure records reveal that she is a multimillionaire, yet she demonizes ""millionaires and billionaires."" Then there's her shoddy scholarship, which has been exposed by several colleagues.Her honesty and integrity are ripe for debate, but the big media aren't interested. Because she claims to champion the poor. St. Elizabeth gets a pass.Not GOP Sen. Rand Paul. The New York Times this week weighed in with a 5,300-word expose linking Rand to a think tank whose ""affiliated"" scholars ""have combined dark biblical prophecy with apocalyptic warnings that the nation is plunging toward economic collapse and cultural ruin.""Spooky stuff, but it gets worse. ""Others have championed the Confederacy."" So there it is: Rand is a kooky End Times racist.At the same time, the Washington Post just ran a lengthy piece making Paul look like a quack for wanting a fairer board certification process for eye doctors like himself. The Kentucky state board required licensing for new doctors but not older doctors, so Paul started his own board.Even though Paul's board certified some 60 doctors, the Post treated it as a self-serving gimmick and pointed out ""grammatical errors"" in the board's mission statement.The next day, the Post bashed the libertarian Paul for suggesting that the government should not mandate most vaccines and that parents should be given more choice over immunizations. Now, liberal hate-bloggers are branding Rand an ""anti-vaxxer.""They're also slapping the same label on New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who suggested the same thing.On Monday, the New York Times unleashed its top investigative reporters on Christie and found he has ""a fondness for luxury."" He likes to hang out in the Dallas Cowboys owner's box. And recently, the King of Jordan treated Christie to ""a champagne reception in the desert."" His family also got an all-expenses-paid vacation.See the pattern? The media vetted John McCain and Sarah Palin to the best of their ability in 2008, and vetted Mitt Romney going back 50 years into his history.The Pew Research Center's analysis of media coverage of candidates bears out media tilting public opinion against GOP candidates and in favor of Democrats.Of 259 MSNBC segments that Pew studied during an eight-week period of the 2012 campaign, 3% were positive for Romney, while 71% were negative. Four years earlier, 10% of MSNBC's coverage of McCain was positive, while 73% was negative.CNN ran three negative stories for every one positive on Romney. Negative stories on Romney on the ABC and CBS evening newscasts outnumbered positive stories 2-to-1.The tone of coverage for Obama, meanwhile, was positive, Pew found. In 2008, moreover, ""Obama enjoyed a large advantage in the tone of newspaper coverage over his rival John McCain,"" the group found.Obama's positive coverage exceeded negative by almost 2-to-1, while McCain's negative to positive was 11-to-1. Fair?This round, Clinton and other Democrats are getting the same media honeymoon — even though the stakes couldn't be higher.The national media might as well be acting as the opposition research arm of the Democratic Party. How can we have a healthy democracy when the press is this corrupt?

1072,ABC,"You have a great business idea. Next: the cash hunt.Many firms sprint to business pitch competitions for awards of investment capital and support.""Shark Tank,"" a pitch competition in its sixth season on ABC, secured 7 million viewers last year. Smaller competitions are hopping in all 50 states. How to win: Go big. ""Talk about the size of the opportunity, right upfront,"" Kim Thanos, CEO of online education firm Lumen Learning, told IBD. ""Make sure it is significant enough to grab the attention of the investors and judges you're pitching to. If you cover that information in a compelling way at the beginning of your pitch, it will cue investors to pay attention.""Her company won the grand prize at the Educause Game Changers Business Competition in Orlando, Fla., last fall.""It surprises me how often company pitches don't discuss the size of the opportunity,"" Thanos added. ""That is such a fundamental part of convincing anyone your business concept has merit."" Talk perks. Focus on benefits. Sometimes that takes a little tweak in how you think about your work.Example: ""When you are talking about a Hoover vacuum cleaner with a 3.7 amp power motor, the benefit is you can vacuum in 30 minutes or less,"" said Keith Chamberlain, who organized the Game Changers meet where Lumen soared by emphasizing how students can advance by not having to buy their weight in textbooks. Aim for perfection.  ""Practice until you know your pitch by heart and you can do it over and over again in the time allotted,"" Thanos suggested. ""Practice your pitch around other people and ask them for feedback so you know which phrases get people nodding their heads and really getting what your company is about. Practice with people who know nothing about your business. If you can get them nodding and excited about your business concept, you're on the right track. And if they just stare at you blankly, you know you've still got work to do."" Speak up. ""Don't have your engineer get up there,"" Chamberlain said. ""Have your charismatic CEO or your public marketing person present."" Dig deep. The more you research to back up your gold mine's appeal, the better, Thanos and Chamberlain advise. ""An investor wants to hear that it's been validated in one shape or form,"" he said. Keep shining. Smart businesses should focus on grabbing another great prize — relationships with members of the panel.""Each time you do your pitch for an investor audience, it is a learning opportunity,"" Thanos said. ""Ask them for suggestions to improve your pitch, and then keep tightening it up and polishing it.""Emily Foote, co-founder of online learning company ApprenNet, agrees. Now in its fourth year of business, her firm is a veteran on the startup pitch circuit. ApprenNet went up against Lumen and 10 other firms at the Game Changers competition in Orlando.Not every meet has led to cash, she says, but business is still booming, partly because of the valuable exposure and networking time at pitch events. ""It's a cheap way to get good feedback,"" she said. Balance. Pitching often gives entrepreneurs an irresistible rush, but the most successful businesses treat it as just one of many ways to raise capital and bulk up the customer base. Advice: Don't let the sport of pitching get in the way of your day-to-day operations and long-term strategy. ""It's so fun,"" Foote said. ""But as you get older and get wind under your sails, (pitch competitions) can become a distraction.""

For $20 a month, Sling TV will deliver live sports, lifestyle, family, news and information channels, video-on-demand entertainment and the best of online video to broadband-connected devices at home and on the go, the company said Jan. 5 at CES.At a press event, Dish CEO Joseph Clayton said Sling TV is targeted at millennials who balk at paying for higher-priced cable, telco and satellite TV packages.Sling TV will be supported by a host of Internet-connected devices, such as Amazon's (AMZN)  Google's (GOOGL) Nexus Player, as well as game consoles, smart TVs, PCs, tablets and smartphones.For $20 a month, Sling TV will offer a ""Best of Live TV"" package that includes 12 channels: ESPN, ESPN2, TNT, TBS, Food Network, HGTV, Travel Channel, Adult Swim, Cartoon Network, Disney Channel, ABC Family and CNN.Consumers will be able to add extra channels with add-on packs costing $5 a month. A ""Kids Extra"" add-on includes Disney Junior, Disney XD, Boomerang, Baby TV and Duck TV. A ""News & Info Extra"" add-on includes HLN, Cooking Channel, DIY and Bloomberg TV. A ""Sports Extra"" package is coming soon, Dish said.Engadget awarded Sling TV its ""Best in Show"" CES award, after giving it earlier awards for best home theater product and best software app.""Many of us have been waiting, hoping and even lusting after Sling TV before we'd ever heard of it: an Internet TV service that gives you the channels you love, on any screen, anywhere, without a subscription to traditional cable or satellite TV service,"" Engadget Editor-in-Chief Michael Gorman wrote . ""Sling TV is a big deal, folks. It could very well be the beginning of the end for traditional pay TV here in the U.S.""CNet declared that Sling TV ""stole the show"" at CES.""None of the major TV networks (CBS, ABC, Fox, etc.) (is) included, but if you add Sling TV to an over-the-air antenna and/or subscriptions to Hulu Plus or CBS All Access, you're pretty close to a basic cable package for far less money,"" CNet section editor David Katzmaier wrote.GoPro, Facebook, other CES winnersA lot of consumer electronics companies came out with action cameras at CES to compete with GoPro (GPRO) . But GoPro emerged with its mindshare lead intact, Rosenblatt Securities analyst Brian Blair said in a note Monday.""While CES showcased a number of would-be GoPro competition from companies like Sony (SNE), Panasonic and Polaroid, none of them garnered much attention in our view,"" Blair said. ""A number of Chinese manufacturers were additionally showing low end knock-offs of the camera in a variety of colors. If CES is reflective of the current consumer view, there is one player that holds the mindshare in the action-camera genre and it remains unchallenged.""Third-party accessories for GoPro cameras were plentiful at the show in another indicator of GoPro's success, Blair said.Another big winner at the show was Oculus VR, owned by Facebook (FB). Several pundits noted the long lines at the Oculus booth for people wanting demonstrations of the virtual reality headsets.Digital ad company Amobee Intelligence put together a list of the most talked about products and companies at CES 2015, based on social network chatter.Samsung was the most talked-about company on social media at CES with its 4K televisions, advanced washing machines and Internet of Things initiatives, Amobee reported Sunday. Sony came in second for online chatter about CES news, followed by LG and Intel (INTC).The most buzzed-about car company at the show was Mercedes-Benz, which showed off its concept of a self-driving car. Audi came in second, followed by BMW, Amobee said.The four-day International CES in Las Vegas ended Friday. It was the largest show to date, drawing more than 170,000 industry professionals. Over 3,600 exhibitors took up more than 2.2 million square feet of exhibit space, show organizer Consumer Electronics Association said Friday.

1135,ABC,"Walt Disney (DIS) disclosed late Wednesday that ESPN has lost 7 million customers in two years as cord-cutting ramps up and people switch to streaming services such as Netflix (NFLX), Amazon (AMZN) and Hulu.ESPN had 92 million subscribers as of Oct. 3, according to a Walt Disney SEC filing. That's down from 95 million a year earlier and 99 million in 2013.Most other Disney cable channels lost ground, including ABC Family, Disney Channel and Disney XD.ESPN's woes are a bad sign for other cable channels and, to a lesser extent, pay-TV operators. Sports programming and, to a lesser extent, reality TV are key reasons to continue subscribing to traditional cable and satellite providers. You can't get the Super Bowl live on Netflix or Amazon streaming services.Subscriber losses suggest ESPN is less of a must-have, or that cable operators decide they won't pay heavily for ESPN2, ESPN News and other sister channels, and may push them to lesser tiers as ""skinny packages"" become more common.Cable channel operators like Viacom (VIAB) will have a tougher time. Viacom has Comedy Central, MTV, Nickelodeon and many other channels that cater to kids, teens and young adults — classic cord-cutters or cord-nevers. They may opt for the same or similar programming via Netflix or other streaming services.Walt Disney's August warning of ESPN subscriber losses triggered a sharp sell-off in Disney's stock and shares of other TV content firms.

1143,ABC,"Less than two days after the deadliest attacks in France since World War II, a dozen French warplanes struck at least 20 targets in Raqqa, Syria, the ISIS capital.Eager to claim some credit, Obama administration officials leaked word they'd provided the ISIS target intelligence to France. That leak backfired, however.If the U.S. had such ample target intelligence, why hadn't American planes already attacked them? That likely fuels the growing Washington controversy over Obama's ineffective ""strategy"" to ""degrade and ultimately defeat ISIS.""In a Friday interview with ABC News, Obama talked less about defeating ISIS and more about ""constraining"" the terror army. Asked about ISIS power, Obama said, ""I don't think they're gaining strength...We have contained them.""Hours later in coordinated incidents, Paris was rocked by eight separate ISIS terrorist attacks killing more than 130 people, the largest death toll there since World War II. That was just the latest of Obama's silly statements on terror that display more his wishful or delusional hopes than reality.Remember how al Qaeda was on the run in 2012? There was no global war on terror, Obama claimed. How Obama mocked Mitt Romney for seeing Russia as a strategic opponent. The counter-terrorism success story Obama hailed in Yemen, just months before its government fell to rebels and the U.S. lost a half-billion dollars in military equipment.Nearly two years ago Obama dismissed ISIS as a ""JV"" team. Six months later he admitted he had no strategy to combat the rampaging terrorists shooting, torturing, crucifying, beheading and incinerating thousands of Muslims and Christians in Syria and Iraq. Last spring Obama declared the U.S. was winning against ISIS.This fall Obama abandoned a much-vaunted program to train Syrian rebels that produced about a dozen soldiers for nearly $50 million. When a Delta Force officer was killed in a raid on an ISIS prison this autumn, Obama aides argued that was not really combat. Obama later dispatched 50 Special Ops troops to fight ISIS' estimated 40,000 troops.ISIS affiliates have emerged in Libya and Afghanistan and apparently in Egypt's Sinai, where a Russian airliner was recently downed by sabotage. Now, the attacks in France by at least one Syrian refugee and fears of assaults in North America. Ben Rhodes, an Obama national security aide, sought to downplay homeland attack fears: ""There's not a specific, credible threat to the homeland at this time.""That was Sunday. This is Monday.At the G20 summit in Turkey Obama was seen in animated discussion with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Russian aides said the topics were Ukraine and ISIS.On CBS Mike Morrell, former deputy CIA director, said it has become ""crystal clear"" that ""our strategy, our policy vis-à-vis ISIS is not working, and it’s time to look at something else.” Morrell also said the Paris attacks were deadly warnings against underestimating ISIS:“You’ve got a large number of operatives. They have to get explosives. They have to get weapons. They have to communicate among themselves and communicate back to Iraq and Syria. This is a level of sophistication that we have not seen since the London bombings in 2005.”Naturally, Obama's ineffective battle against ISIS and the Democrat's plans to admit at least 10,000 un-vetted Syrian refugees have become a growing political issue. Sen. Lindsey Graham warned on CNN, ""There's another 9/11 coming.""On CBS' 'Face the Nation' Sen. Richard Burr, chair of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, said: ""We don’t have a strategy in Syria as it relates to ISIL. The president talked the other morning about how ISIL was contained. America learned within 24 hours that it’s not contained. It’s rampant.”Commenting on Hillary Clinton's refusal, like the Obama administration, to use the term ""radical Islamic terrorists"" during Saturday's Democratic debate, Jeb Bush, another presidential candidate, spoke with CNN's Jake Tapper. Bush said: ""This is a political ideology that has co-opted a religion, and I think it's more than acceptable to call it for what it is and then organize an effort to destroy it.""Another Republican candidate, Sen. Marco Rubio, said the administration's fear of calling terrorists terrorists is ""like saying we weren't at war with Nazis, because we were afraid to offend some Germans who may have been members of the Nazi Party but weren't violent themselves.""RELATED:Americans don't believe Obama, see ISIS winningObama OKs admitting 10,000 more Syrian refugeesObama aides claim a deadly firefight with ISIS wasn't really combat

Baird analyst.William Power, an analyst at R.W. Baird, says Q3 media comments suggest that live, OTT (over-the-top) offers from Apple or perhaps Amazon.com (AMZN) may be coming, though timing, as usual, is unclear.Apple's long-awaited Web TV service is expected to raise the bar for live streaming, thanks to its expected line-up of broadcast TV and sports.""We believe media company Q3 comments suggest the increasing likelihood of live OTT skinny bundles from tech/media providers in 2016,"" wrote Power in a report.Apple has been seeking streaming rights to live broadcast content from broadcasters ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox. Apple is expected to offer a low-priced TV package, starting at around $40 monthly, with limited channels. So-called ""skinny bundles"" are believed to appeal to the young adults called millennials.CBS, 21st Century Fox, Time Warner (TWX) and NBCUniversal owner Comcast (CMCSA) have reported September quarter earnings. Walt Disney (DIS), which owns ABC, reports late Thursday.Here's Power's report on what media companies had to say during earnings calls on pending OTT services.FOX's CEO stated, ""We anticipate some of the conversations we are having with new streaming distribution service not yet in the market will result in new revenue and will augment existing viewing alternatives.""CBS' CEO stated, ""There is a very good chance that one or more major media or tech companies will launch a new skinny bundle next year, leading to significant incremental subscription revenue for us.""Time Warner ""noted that it expects to participate in potential OTT bundled offers. Time Warner also remains positive on the HBO Now opportunity.""Moody's Investors Service said in a report published on Friday that an Apple Web TV service could increase demand for high-speed broadband services from cable TV companies such as Comcast, though they may lose video subscribers.

1189,ABC,"Cyberwar: Like a bomb detonating in slow motion, the scale and destructiveness of the Sony hack has only now become fully apparent. Telling Americans to go to the movies doesn't cut it as a government response.At first, it seemed as if Sony was the latest victim of hackers who delight in stealing confidential information and sending it along to WikiLeaks. The hackers called themselves ""Guardians of Peace"" and claimed, ""We want equality. Sony doesn't."" Sony initially labeled the event as ""an IT matter.""For a while, the hack seemed to threaten only the reputations of some Hollywood big shots, as the leaks exposed outsized salaries, mean-spirited backbiting and embarrassing private emails.It wasn't until eight days later that Sony said North Korea might be involved. And it was only this Tuesday — 22 days after the attack — that the hackers revealed their true and frightening purpose: to censor a movie that the North Korean government found offensive.The plot worked. The next day, Sony canceled the opening of ""The Interview"" — an action comedy about a CIA plot to assassinate Kim Jong Un. Newt Gingrich had it right when he tweeted, ""No one should kid themselves ... America has lost its first cyberwar.""In that light, President Obama's comments to ABC News seem wholly inadequate. All he could bring himself to say was that he's taking it seriously, and ""if we see something that we think is serious and credible, then we'll alert the public.""If we see something? Isn't stealing 100 terabytes of data — enough to hold 10 copies of the Library of Congress' entire collection — and destroying $200 million worth of Sony's capital and holding the country hostage to the whims of a brutal dictator 6,000 miles away ""serious and credible"" enough?Obama instead blithely said,""My recommendation would be that people go to the movies."" (This from the same guy who routinely mocked President Bush for saying Americans should go shopping after the 9/11 attacks — something Bush never really said.)If North Korea had detonated a bomb that destroyed $200 million worth of private property, do you think Obama's response would have been so tepid?Dave Aitel, former NSA scientist who heads cybersecurity firm Immunity, told Business Insider: ""We need to change the way we think about cyberattacks. In many cases, these aren't 'crimes'; they're acts of war.""You can bet that North Korea, ISIS and anyone else with a grudge against America are watching how we respond to this attack, and are trying to penetrate not so easily dismissed targets such as the nation's power grid and banking system.And remember that in cyberwar, America's geographical advantage — which has largely protected the country from foreign attacks — doesn't exist.

1272,ABC,"Eye-catching prices paid by wireless phone companies for radio spectrum in the AWS-3 government auction give TV broadcasters more reason to sell their airwaves, an anticipated upcoming auction that could happen later than regulators hope.The Advanced Wireless Service No. 3 spectrum auction, the first major sale of airwaves since 2008, has blown past forecasts, raising more than $43 billion. The AWS-3 auction handily surpassed the $19.8 billion raised in 2008.AT&T (T), Verizon Communications (VZ) and T-Mobile US (TMUS) and other winning bidders will add debt to pay for AWS-3 spectrum, analysts say. They'll need time to rebuild cash reserves before the next auction, which will involve airwaves owned by TV broadcasters.The Federal Communications Commission on Thursday proposed initial rules for the ""Broadcast Incentive Auction"" and asked for public comment. The FCC pushed back the broadcast auction to ""early 2016"" from 2015.Local TV stations own a broad swath of airwaves that regulators aim to reconfigure for wireless broadband services. To make the auction happen, TV broadcasters must be convinced to give up some or all of their spectrum rights. The FCC plans to take a patchwork of vacated TV channels in local markets and create tighter blocks of spectrum for wireless firms to use. Local TV stations would keep airwaves for broadcasting purposes.That's the plan. But the National Association of Broadcasters and a group led by Sinclair Broadcasting Group (SBGI) have sued the FCC, claiming proposed auction rules are unfair. Among other things, broadcasters worry that the repacked spectrum would be prone to interference. ""Court challenges to the auction rules by some broadcasters have introduced uncertainty,"" said Gary Epstein, chairman of the FCC's Incentive Auction Task Force, in a blog.A deal enabling the auction is very possible, analysts say, but there are hurdles.CEA Sees Tough Challenge""The FCC faces a tough challenge developing an auction process that can work for stakeholders and broadcasters alike,"" Gary Shapiro, president of the Consumer Electronics Association, said in a statement Thursday.The CEA has supported the FCC's proposed rules.Wireless phone companies will be saddled with more debt following the AWS-3 auction, says Oppenheimer analyst Tim Horan. Even Sprint (S), which did not take part in the AWS-3 auction, needs to raise cash if it plans to bid in the broadcaster auction, he says.""The FCC may have to delay the broadcast auction even further so carriers have more time to de-lever after spending a collective $40 billion on the AWS-3 auction,"" Horan said in a report. He says the TV auction could slip into 2017, with the bidding reaching $70 billion.In the AWS-3 auction, 65 megahertz of spectrum was up for grabs.Broadcasters own roughly 120 MHz of spectrum, and the FCC is aiming for 84 MHz of spectrum to be available in the auction. For that auction, the FCC has initially proposed an average price per MHz-population area that's below prices being paid in the AWS-3 auction.The broadcast spectrum is low-band, meaning at lower frequencies than AWS-3 airwaves. At lower frequencies, wireless signals travel over longer distances — important in rural areas — and through office walls. So broadcast TV spectrum could, in theory, fetch a higher price than the AWS-3 airwaves.The big four national broadcast TV networks — Walt Disney's (DIS) ABC, CBS (CBS), Fox and Comcast's (CMCSA) NBCUniversal — haven't been expected to be among the sellers. But the media companies paid attention to AWS-3 auction bidding.""Spectrum presents a very great opportunity for us,"" CBS Chief Executive Leslie Moonves said at a UBS conference on Dec. 9, looking at possible airwave sales. ""When you see numbers being thrown out there for the spectrum of a local television station, suddenly that looks attractive to a CW duopoly."" Moonves referred to markets where CBS owns two TV stations.The outcome of the AWS-3 auction could have other ramifications, says Paul Gallant, analyst at Guggenheim Partners. AT&T and Verizon have been expected to garner the lion's share of AWS-3 spectrum. If so, then T-Mobile and Sprint could ask the FCC to set aside more spectrum in the broadcast auction for bidding among smaller carriers, says Gallant.""The TV broadcast auction probably will be the last big spectrum auction for years,"" he said.

1273,ABC,"War On Terror: California Sen. Dianne Feinstein and her fellow Senate Democrats' ""torture report"" is as dangerous as it is libelous. Our friends know that they shouldn't trust us; our enemies will be emboldened to attack.It speaks volumes that the White House Wednesday refused to answer ABC News correspondent Jon Karl's question on whether information extracted from terrorist prisoners through enhanced interrogation saved lives, as the CIA argues.According to White House press secretary Josh Earnest, the U.S., by ""acknowledging our shortcomings"" in releasing the Senate Democrats' report on the tough methods, will help rebuild the moral authority of the world's lone superpower.President Obama has been in office for almost six years now, and we have his own CIA factually refuting a report that he extols as right on the money.The CIA declassified the fact that detainee Ammar al-Baluchi, for instance, was subjected to harsh methods and subsequently revealed that Abu Ahmad al-Kuwaiti was an Osama bin Laden courier — information instrumental in killing the al-Qaida founder.The agency also said that Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, who was waterboarded, in 2003 gave information that foiled the London Heathrow Airport terrorist plot, which would have killed hundreds at least.Former CIA director Michael Hayden also told Fox News the methods gave the U.S. ""a Home Depot-like storage of information on al-Qaida"" we still rely on.As former CIA analyst and Center for Security Policy senior fellow Fred Fleitz writes in NewsMax, Feinstein's five-year investigation, costing taxpayers $50 million, includes a ""38-page table on statements about the program"" made by Hayden ""that essentially accuses him of repeatedly lying to Congress"" — yet Senate Democrat investigators refused to interview Hayden or other CIA personnel.Enough of this ""acknowledging our shortcomings"" by the greatest nation on earth. This report tells our allies that we are a superpower lying on a psychiatrist's couch, wracked with guilt and unable to keep either secrets or promises.Would Poland, or the dozens of other countries that helped us house and transport terrorist prisoners, ever go out on a limb for the U.S. again when we are so plagued with doubt in our own methods and purposes?Other facts also smash the Senate report's legitimacy: secret rendition of terrorists, for instance, took place under President Bill Clinton; Feinstein, and the White House too, used the Holocaust term ""never again"" for such questioning — but she has a personal beef against the CIA for peeking into her committee's databases; high-ranking congressional Democrats were briefed dozens of times about the harsh methods during the Bush administration yet repeatedly acceded to them.Moreover, which is more just: having a U.S. drone act as judge, jury and executioner of terrorists, which is the Obama administration's approach? Or capture them and make them reveal their fellow jihadists' plots?Here's an idea: How about investigating the IRS's violation of the rights of innocent Americans instead of the CIA's roughing up of murderous terrorists?

1274,ABC,"Under Siege isn't just the name of a Steven Seagal movie — it's the state of the media industry, UBS said as it initiated coverage of the U.S. media and entertainment sector with a neutral rating.But bright spots include entertainment conglomerate Walt Disney (DIS), movie and cable TV giant 21st Century Fox (FOX), and movie, TV and publishing company Time Warner Inc. (TWX).UBS initiated coverage on all three with buy ratings, saying they should weather the industry upheaval better than others.Data from a variety of sources show that TV viewing has already dropped to 85% of total video viewing in the U.S., UBS analyst Doug Mitchelson said in a note.Meanwhile, online streaming video from companies like Netflix (NFLX) has reached a 15% market share, well above the 10% figure often reported, ""and we expect streaming will more than double to 35% of video usage by 2020.""Worse yet, national TV advertising dollars are following viewers online, he added.But UBS launched coverage of Disney with a 106 price target, citing low U.S. advertising exposure, a good start to the season for its ABC TV network and benefits from leveraging investments such as its $4.64 billion acquisition of Marvel Entertainment in 2009.Also, Disney is expanding internationally, including a new Shanghai theme park slated to open in 2016.All of this suggests ""modest upside to Disney's already premium valuation,"" UBS said.Disney shares rose fractionally on the stock market today.Fox has strong operating growth driven by its well-positioned international network, leading to the fastest earnings per share growth among traditional media companies, UBS said.UBS projects strong long-term growth, saying ""Fox is creating more value the next 6 years than any other company in our coverage.""Fox's EPS rose 18% in fiscal Q1, 35% in Q4 and 24% in Q3. Consensus of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters is for fiscal Q2 EPS to climb 30% in Q2 then dip 6% in Q3.UBS's price target for Fox is 46. Shares slipped less than 1% Monday.Time Warner also has a healthy long-term movie lineup and TV production pipeline, UBS said.Additionally, it's seeing strong growth in its domestic affiliate station renewal cycle, ""while its lower domestic advertising revenue exposure and accelerating EPS growth are juxtaposed against the lowest (price to earnings growth) valuation in our coverage, leading to our buy rating.""Time Warner stock has a near-best 97 IBD Composite Rating, meaning its stock has outperformed 97% of all stocks on key metrics.

1275,ABC,"The drop-off in TV viewership among young Americans is snowballing, says Nielsen, which recently called for new ratings measures that would capture viewing on digital streaming devices.Nielsen on Wednesday said viewership on ad-supported live TV fell 4% in Q3 for all audiences compared with a 2% decline in the June quarter.Online video streaming, while still smaller in terms of total consumption, jumped 60% as millennials flocked to Netflix (NFLX) and similar services.For TV broadcasters ABC, CBS, Fox and NBC, trends are worsening for younger viewers, 18- to 24-year-olds and 12- to 17-year-olds, says Brian Wieser, an analyst at Pivotal Research Group. Among them, he says, traditional TV viewing fell 14.2% in Q3 compared with 9% in the June quarter.""The scale of the declines among a few key groups accelerated, which is notable,"" Wieser told IBD.""While declines should level off eventually and viewing levels would certainly look better if tablets and out-of-home viewing were included in the data, a concern is that if reported viewing levels continue to fall at these levels, and if the industry is unable to generally make its case for why advertisers should use the medium, marketers who might otherwise have continued to focus their spending on TV may incrementally look towards other alternatives — namely, digital media at a broader level,"" he added in a report.Nielsen's ratings don't collect live TV viewing on Web-connected TVs, gaming consoles or tablet computers. Nielsen says a new standard should include all viewing.The average daily time spent watching live TV fell 4% to 4 hours and 32 minutes, says Nielsen. Online viewing rose 60% to nearly 11 hours monthly.Audience ratings also have been falling for cable TV networks. Cord-cutting — people disconnecting from pay-TV service — is a worry for Comcast (CMCSA) and other providers. Viacom (VIA) in November said it plans to explore ad revenue sources not tied to Nielsen ratings.Shares in ABC parent Walt Disney (DIS) edged down in afternoon trading on the stock market today, while CBS (CBS) stock was up 1.7%. Shares in 21st Century Fox (FOXA) and Comcast, which owns NBC, were roughly unchanged.

1284,ABC,"Media Bias: What does it take for reporters to pursue a scandal story these days? Apparently, more than video proof of lying and obfuscation by top officials to get a massive entitlement enacted. But don't call them partisan.Few political scandals are as tailor-made for television as the one involving the recently unearthed videos of ObamaCare architect and Massachusetts Institute of Technology economist Jonathan Gruber.First you have Gruber, a guy paid $400,000 to design ObamaCare, admitting on tape that lawmakers purposely misled the public to get the bill passed, and counted on the ""stupidity"" of the American people not to notice.On the explosive revelations scale, this and subsequent other Gruber videos rank right up there with Mitt Romney's ""47%"" statement.The only difference is that while the broadcast news networks aired the Romney clip so often that even the least-informed voter in America had heard of it, these same outfits have imposed a virtual Gruber blackout.Up until Tuesday night, when ABC ended its silence, CBS was the only network to mention Gruber on its nightly news program. As of this writing, NBC's Nightly News still hasn't broken its Gruber embargo, according to the Media Research CenterNBC did have time enough Tuesday night for a report on how the share of homes with two-car garages could drop by 2040.And while other mainstream outlets have covered the story, they've been perfunctory, or written in a way that casts Gruber's revelations purely in light of how they've helped the GOP's anti-ObamaCare crusade.Not only have Gruber's comments been treated as if they never happened, the TV networks haven't shown any interest in the next round of Gruber stories — in which the White House and Democrats made bald-faced lies about their connections to Gruber.Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., for one, claimed she had no idea who Gruber was, although she is on tape from five years before praising his expertise.And President Obama himself, in answer to the one question he's gotten on the matter — from a Fox News reporter — brushed Gruber off as ""some adviser.""That's despite the fact that Gruber had been to the White House nearly two dozen times during the ObamaCare debate. And he was prominently featured in a 2012 Obama campaign ad — from the Obama-Biden ""Truth Team"" — saying how he'd helped the president craft ObamaCare. And he is someone from whom Obama once said he stole many ideas.Worse still, though, are reporters' amateurish attempts to explain the story away, or defend themselves against charges of glaring liberal favoritism.Witness Politico's Paige Winfield Cunningham, who four months after declaring Gruber ""one of ObamaCare's chief architectsnow dismisses him as just one of ""the legion of policy and technical experts who played a role in the massive legislation.""Then there's ""Meet the Press'"" Chuck Todd, who actually claimed that the reason the networks aren't covering Gruber is ... well, you have to read it to believe it:""It's a political story,"" he told Newsmax""Network news in general hasn't been covering the political back-and-forths of Washington a lot lately. I don't think it has to do with Gruber specifically. I would just caution people on that.""Still, what can you expect from reporters who spent all of 2009 and early 2010 cheerleading for ObamaCare, and then spent the next four years covering up its many glaring problems? The Gruber comments reveal their dereliction of duty as much as it does the Obama administration's malfeasance.That the press now expect no one to notice shows just how insular and corrupt it has become.

1286,ABC,"Grubergate: The lies are getting pretty thick these days. The president claims that he never misled anyone about ObamaCare and that Jonathan Gruber was just ""some adviser."" In fact, Gruber was a key player in the deception.When Fox News' Ed Henry asked Obama on Sunday if he'd misled the American people ""in order to get the bill passed,"" Obama's answer was ""No, I did not."" Space prohibits listing all the ways Obama did, in fact, mislead the public.No one even bothers to deny that his ""keep your plan"" and ""ObamaCare will cut premiums by $2,500"" promises were premeditated efforts to deceive the public. But Obama's response to Henry's question about Gruber is just as grand a fabrication.In his remarks, Obama tried to minimize Gruber's role in crafting the plan, saying Gruber ""never worked on our staff"" and that his recent comments about how lawmakers used deception to enact ObamaCare ""is no reflection on the actual process that was run.""Actually, Gruber played a central role in a coordinated campaign to deceive the public — a campaign that arguably proved instrumental in getting ObamaCare enacted. To see how he did it, let's turn the clock back to Nov. 4, 2009.At the time, the White House was in a frantic push to get ObamaCare through the Senate before the year was up. Democrats, who held 60 seats at the time, could not afford to lose a single vote against unified GOP opposition. And they were rightly worried that a January special election in Massachusetts would deny them their filibuster-proof majority if voters elected Republican Scott Brown.That day, the White House touted a research paper that Gruber had issued, describing it as an ""objective analysis"" that showed how ""reform will help small businesses (and) lower premiums for American families."" Later that month, Nancy-Ann DeParle — director of the White House Office of Health Reform — said that another Gruber study ""confirms"" that the ""Senate health reform bill reduces costs and improves coverage.""The press, not surprisingly, ate it all up, and Gruber became what ABC News called ""a go-to voice for reporters seeking a respected academic view on health care reform."" Politico's Mike Allen wrote a piece in late November headlined ""MIT analysis backs Obama,"" which said that Gruber's research ""provides new ammunition for Democrats as the Senate begins formally debating (ObamaCare).""But what neither the White House nor Gruber told the public was that Gruber was actually a highly paid consultant working with Obama to construct the very law that his ""objective"" analyses were extolling.In fact, the existence of Gruber's fat $400,000 contract didn't emerge until after the Senate passed ObamaCare — when a blogger for the left-wing website Daily Kos posted a link in early January 2010 complaining about Gruber's ""sole source"" contract for ""technical assistance in evaluating options for national healthcare reform."" The contract claimed that Gruber was the ""only one responsible source"" available for such help.When that news came out, the press — which could have easily ferreted out Gruber's contract long before — issued a few mea culpas for not disclosing his glaring conflict of interest, and then let the matter drop. But it was too late to make any difference, anyway. The Senate had passed ObamaCare in late December, and the House later approved the exact same bill, which Obama signed into law in March 2010.In other words, had the Gruber/White House disinformation campaign not been so effective, and had the Senate bill not passed, there probably would be no ObamaCare today.

1306,ABC,"Heading into the last hectic weekend of the 2014 midterm election campaign, a couple of revealing findings stick out that are ominous for Democrats:Young 'Hope & Change' voters, who formed the core of Barack Obama's 2008 victory, have drifted away from their guy. In other words, they are growing up.Second, Latinos, another leg on the aging Obama support stool, are flaking off too.Besides his vigorous fundraising efforts, the Democrat president has spent much of his campaign effort this year working on his party's election day turnout, historically a flaccid factor in liberal midterm balloting. But that may not help much because the base he's trying to turn out has changed.Conservatives, on the other hand, have a traditional stake in turning out. This time it's especially driven by opposition to Obama policies and pushing GOP candidates to control six more seats to control the Senate, stall Obama's remaining liberal agenda and and help Harry Reid find his way to Sunny Acres.Among the youths surveyed by Harvard's Institute of Politics, a majority voted for Obama in 2012 and 64% said there's at least a 50-50 chance of their voting next Tuesday. But 43% consider the country headed in the wrong direction. They disapprove of everybody's job performance in Washington: Obama (53%), Democrats in Congress (60%) and Republicans there (72%).They disapprove of Obama's job on the economy (60%), ObamaCare (57%), the deficit (65%), foreign policy (60%) and immigration (61%).But -- and here's the key -- youths who voted in 2008 went for Obama by 34 points and 23 points in 2012. Even in 2010, a really bad year for Obama's party, youths supported Democrats 55%-43%.This time, however, that same cohort will be voting for a GOP-controlled Congress 51%-47%.As for Latinos, an increasingly important sector of the electorate, the new ABC News-Washington Post Poll shows they are just fine with Republicans taking control of both houses on Capitol Hill. Fifty percent say it doesn't matter which party controls Congress. Worse for Obama, now out on his longest campaign swing of the cycle, 30% say it would be a good thing if Republicans win control of the Senate. That's twice the size of those who say bad thing.

1330,ABC,"What if the president of the United States came to speak at your campaign rally and no one cared? In fact, a lot of his party loyalists walked out as soon as the nation's chief executive stepped to the podium.That's just what happened to the one-time golden-tongued Barack Obama Sunday in Maryland when he joined Democrat gubernatorial candidate Anthony Brown.Hard to believe -- right? -- because Obama always seems to be campaigning. But it was actually his first real campaign appearance this cycle. With his current high disapproval ratings on so many issues including credibility, Obama's not exactly this fall's Homecoming King in political popularity.The 100 other Obama appearances were party fundraisers. It reportedly takes a bit more selling, but some folks are still willing to shell out up to $100,000 to hear Obama's canned 15-minute funder. They all sound like political speeches, to be sure, because he's always bragging on how robust he's made the economy.And how so many of the nation's problems that have worsened during his endless watch would be solved if only Republicans weren't blocking even more government spending. Obama took a brief break from his partisan attacks in his weekly remarks, which he devoted to promising Americans that ""Ebola is actually a difficult disease to catch.""Here are some of the more inspirational excerpts from Obama's 25 minutes of Sunday remarks:“You’ve got to vote.....There are no excuses. The future is up to us. Go find your friends to vote. Get your cousin to vote. Get your uncle to vote.....Maryland, we have made progress. Don’t let folks say otherwise.”Speaking of broken records, Obama added: ""Now, look I believe that Republicans are patriots. I think they love their country. They love their family. But they are a broken record.""By the time Obama finished, the crowd was considerably smaller, a far cry from the days when audience members would shout: ""We love you, Barack!"" There was one heckler, but he didn't yell: ""You're boring, Barack!"" In fact, Brown may not need much Obama ""help."" Polls give him a seven-point lead over his Republican opponent, Larry Hogan. Obama's next campaign stop, however, was different.From Maryland, the president took Air Force One to Chicago for another appearance with Illinois' embattled Democrat incumbent Gov. Pat Quinn.Quinn, you'll remember, was the nobody lieutenant governor who inherited the job when fellow Democrat, Gov. Rod Blagojevich, was impeached and then, like most recent former Illinois governors, shipped off to prison.For some strange reason, Quinn's in trouble with state voters for jacking state taxes temporarily and now -- Shocker! -- trying to make them permanent.He's also presided over an exodus of businesses and jobs to three surrounding states, which -- Oh, look! -- enjoy Republican governors and balanced budgets.Polls show Quinn in a virtual dead heat with Republican businessman Bruce Rauner.Quinn is not that popular within Chicago's ruling Democrat machine either. But he's their Democrat and generally obedient. So, Michelle Obama made two campaign appearances with him, among her many political stops this fall.Obama spoke at a Quinn fundraiser previously. And then Sunday night Obama did an actual rally in Chicago before visiting his own South Side house.The Nov. 4 midterm election is only 15 days away, although widespread early voting is already underway. Speaking of elections, the 2016 presidential balloting for Obama's successor is only 750 days away. So, you must be anxious to know who's in the lead this close.A new ABC News/Washington Post Poll finds that Hillary Clinton is favored by 64% as the Democrat candidate. That's almost five times the support that Hunter Biden's father draws. But she's now showing some weaknesses among men, voters under 50 and Democrat-leaning independents, rather significant demographics.On the Republican side, despite repeated demurrals, Mitt Romney gets the support of twice as many voters as his closest GOP colleagues, Jeb Bush and Mike Huckabee. Without Romney, Bush, Huckabee and Rand Paul all cluster around the 12% level with the other wannabes lower in single digits.RELATED:Obama fundraised, so Ebola fears spread faster than EbolaMichelle Obama is very sincerely supporting what's-his-name

The Islamic terrorist group ISIL has long been recruiting terrorists in the West and is known to have members with Western, even American, passports.Deliberately spreading the disease to the U.S. might not even require a plane ride, and it's possibile that terrorists already willing to strap bombs to their bodies might just as willingly get infected and pay a coyote to get them across our open southern border.We remember the 9/11 Commission saying that terrorist attack was due in part to our lack of imagination. We couldn't imagine young Middle Eastern males learning to fly, but not land, passenger jets as part of a plan to fly them into skyscrapers.The spreading of Ebola to the U.S. could be intentional, given the virus' relatively long incubation period of up to three weeks without symptoms, and no shortage of terrorists willing to die for their cause. It would be easy for an infected terrorist to slip in among the OTMs (Other Than Mexican) who have also been crossing our border.""Central Americans are not the only ones being smuggled through Mexico to the United States,"" said a 2012 report by the U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime, a fact regularly reported by the U.S. Border Patrol.""Irregular migrants from the Horn of Africa (Eritrea, Somalia and Ethiopia), as well as South Asia (Bangladesh, Nepal, India), China and other African and Asian states are being smuggled through Central America.""Albert Spratte, a spokesman for Local 3307 of the National Border Patrol Council, has repeatedly noted how the Rio Grande is being crossed by more than just Central Americans, including individuals from Africa. On one weekend, a group of Chinese females was apprehended.Dr. Elizabeth Lee Vliet, a preventive medicine specialist, told Breitbart News recently that the dispersal of illegal aliens, including unaccompanied minors, throughout the U.S. without proper medical screening ""is the ideal condition for a viral outbreak.""""A public health crisis, the likes of which I have not seen in my lifetime, is looming,"" Vliet wrote recently for World Net Daily. ""Drug-resistant tuberculosis is the most serious risk, but even diseases like measles can cause severe complications and death in older or immunocompromised patients."" And possibly Ebola?""There's nothing to prevent someone traveling here asymptomatically during the incubation period,"" said ABC News' chief health and medical editor, Dr. Richard Besser, who served as acting director of the CDC during the swine flu outbreak.GlobalSecurity.org says that there is evidence that the former Soviet Union's biological weapons program researched and weaponized the Ebola virus — and that Japanese terrorist group Aum Shinrikyo reportedly sent members to Zaire during an outbreak to harvest the virus. So its use as a bioterror weapon is not a new idea.The prospect of terrorists hacking their way through the Mall of America or LAX carrying a weaponized container of the Ebola virus is a very real possibility unless we secure our borders and let in only the invited — and the healthy.

1335,ABC,"Last month Barack Obama assured the country it was very unlikely that any American stateside would become infected with the deadly Ebola virus that's killed thousands in West Africa.On Sept. 30, Dr. Tom Frieden, head of the Centers for Disease Control, assured Americans, ""I have no doubt that we will stop it in its tracks in the U.S.” You know, the sophisticated nationwide healthcare system that we've all taken for granted until congressional meddling began four years ago.Here's what's happened since: The first foreign carrier of Ebola to enter the country died despite all that sophisticated care. Now a Dallas nurse who cared for him is infected, the first in-country American, despite all the sure-fire sophisticated preventive measures Frieden and others expressed such confidence in.Now comes an ABC News/Washington Post Poll

"
1338,ABC,"the feds are doing enough.No one has a clue how the nurse became infected despite all the protective gear and procedures. Was there a splash of vomit? Is the virus perhaps mutating already to bypass existing precautions? Sherlock Frieden's line Monday was, ""Stopping Ebola is hard.""He admitted the CDC must rethink and double-check all its existing procedures. Design new ones. More infected Americans may show up from the same safety gap(s).It was inevitable 21 days from a midterm election that Ebola would also infect the nation's politics. The usual Washington suspects call for flight bans, as if no one can change planes in Europe. They call for an Ebola czar, as if another padded federal department would fix things right up.It's all just futile flopping for an anxious population detecting the spread of an even more virulent virus: Fear.Here's the real problem: There is no national leadership. We have a president. But he is no leader. He had no ISIS strategy until polls told him to get one. No problem, no screw-up, no scandal is ever his fault. But no one gets fired. Not Eric Holder. Not Kathleen Sebelius.He's spent most of his 2,093 days in office degrading faith in American institutions -- Congress, the Supreme Court, anyone who opposes him. Having promised to unify, he's divided instead. He's mislead and lied so often that millions of countrymen -- not to mention foreign leaders -- tune him out. Or turn cynical.He's built a trust deficit as big as his early budget deficits.Here's what Obama's been up to recently: As our brave military flew token air sorties against ISIS hordes and Ebola percolated inside no-one-knows-how-many other Americans, Obama spent most of last week out West at political fundraisers, wowing Gwyneth Paltrow and sucking in more money for the Democrat Party.He returned to D.C. Saturday late. Sunday Obama had a phone call with HHS Secy. Sylvia Burwell for a brief briefing on the Ebola situation. Photographers were herded to Oval Office windows to capture the moment.As you can see from his desk above, Obama was buried in work. And dressed for what he really had in mind: His 200th round of golf. It was a one-man photo-op.Monday Obama met with the same senior advisers who've given us healthcare.gov, no ISIS strategy and a failed Iraq withdrawal and ""urged"" them to draw new lessons from the unfolding medical crisis.""Urged"" them? What is he adviser to the high school stamp club? He's the freaking commander-in-chief. This Ebola outbreak is a big $%^&#

1341,ABC,"The market uptrend is under pressure and the distribution day count is high for the S&P 500 and Nasdaq, but several large-cap names in this week's Big Cap 20 are holding gains and trading tightly after breakouts.A couple of other health care names and a railroad operator are acting well, too.After a bullish breakout during the week ended July 25, Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) continues to hang near highs. It's a tad out of buying range after its July 22 gap up.On July 21, Chipotle reported solid earnings and sales as customers shrugged off higher menu prices. Quarterly profit rose 23% from a year ago to $2.50 a share. Sales growth accelerated for the third straight quarter, rising 29% to $1.05 billion.Same-store sales, which exclude sales at newly opened stores, rose an impressive 17.3%. The company opened 45 new restaurants in the quarter as its focus remains on U.S. growth.Facebook (FB), meanwhile, has been getting a lot of ink in IBD lately, and rightly so, because the stock still has the look of an emerging leader. It's still in buying range after clearing a third-stage, cup-with-handle buy point of 68.54. Facebook has gotten its house in order, and then some, after an inauspicious debut in May 2012.A flurry of better-than-expected earnings reports has helped. On July 23, the online social network reported Q2 profit of 42 cents a share, well above the consensus estimate of 32 cents a share, and a 121% increase from the year-ago quarter. Sales rose 61% to just over $2.9 billion.Mobile monthly active users rose 31% to 1.07 billion, while daily active users on mobile devices rose 39% to 654 million. Mobile ad revenue rose 41% to $1.66 billion.After a bullish breakout over 73.91 last month, drug distributor AmerisourceBergen (ABC) continues to hold gains and trade tightly. Shares remain under accumulation after the company's July 24 earnings report. Earnings growth accelerated for the third straight quarter, rising 29 to $1.01 a share. Sales rose 39% to $20.35 billion, helped by its recent pact with Walgreen (WAG).That long-term accord, announced in March 2013, included a 10-year pharmacy distribution contract.Medical products maker Thermo Fisher Scientific (TMO), meanwhile, is working on a long saucer-with-handle base with a buy point of 127.31. It's holding just above its 10-week moving average.And don't forget Canadian Pacific Railway (CP), which is finding support at its 10-week moving average after a recent breakout over 159.87. Support at the 10-week line is a good place to start a small position if the initial breakout is missed.Full-year profit at the railroad operator is expected to rise 21% this year and 24% in 2015.
"
1342,ABC,"Negligence: President Obama's failure to attend intelligence briefings has worsened, and back in 2012 he was warned that the Islamic State would rise. Is this a presidential version of attention deficit disorder?The Constitution does not greatly detail a president's responsibilities, no doubt assuming that for someone like our first president, Gen. George Washington, the duties were obvious.""The executive power shall be vested in a president,"" it states. After a few paragraphs about qualifications and presidential elections, it adds that ""the president shall be commander in chief"" of the armed forces.The current president golfs a great deal in the finest locales, like ultrarich Martha's Vineyard, and conducts lots of political fundraising. But these activities seem to work to exclude the first thing the Constitution says is his duty: leading the defense of the nation.If President Obama hadn't attended less than 42% of his daily national security intelligence briefings in his second term — less than in his first term — as the Government Accountability Institute this week revealed, as reported by Breitbart, he might have given more attention to the ""highly accurate predictions about ISIL"" that ""have been showing up in the Oval Office since before the 2012 election,"" an Obama national security staffer this week told Britain's Daily Mail.For someone who so wanted the presidency, why would Barack Obama rather golf? Is this the presidential equivalent of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, predominantly inattentive (ADHD-PI), which holds back so many teens at school?That illness' symptoms include: not paying attention to details, not listening when spoken to directly, failing to finish work, avoiding tasks that take a lot of mental effort for a long period and being easily distracted.The failure to see IS on the horizon is such an obvious case of presidential negligence that Obama and his minions have begun a wild kind of damage control: Interviewed by ""60 Minutes"" on Sunday, the president blamed his own intel chief, James Clapper — but White House spinmeister Josh Earnest feverishly backtracked, insisting the president got ""strong, sound advice"" from our spy agencies. That, however, contradicts Earnest's simultaneous — and absurd — claim that ""everybody was surprised to see the rapid advance that ISIL was able to make,"" conquering ""large swaths of territory in Iraq."" As ABC News White House correspondent Jonathan Karl pointed out to Earnest, the former Defense Intelligence Agency chief, Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, warned early this year that IS ""probably will attempt to take territory in Iraq and Syria to exhibit its strength in 2014.""As the exasperated parent of a teen flunking school might ask, ""Why won't he focus on doing his work?""

1343,ABC,"Ordered Liberty: White House and other liberal contempt for a D.C. Circuit panel's ruling isn't just about ObamaCare. Representative government itself is threatened when laws don't mean what they say.'Does the letter of the law matter to the White House on this?"" ABC News' Jon Karl asked White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest after a potentially crippling ruling from the second-highest court in the land against ObamaCare's subsidies for states without exchanges.Earnest responded that he didn't have a ""fancy legal degree,"" then expounded on Congress' intentions being that everyone get subsidies, whether it be from ""federal officials or state officials.""But as Judge Thomas B. Griffith wrote in his Halbig v. Burwell ruling, ""asking us to ignore the best evidence of Congress's intent,"" namely the relevant section of the law, ""in favor of assumptions about the risks that Congress would or would not tolerate — assumptions doubtlessly influenced by hindsight"" — is asking the court ""to substitute our judgment for Congress's. We refuse.""Griffith quoted from a series of Supreme Court decisions, including the unanimous 1987 Rodriquez ruling, which emphasized that ""it frustrates rather than effectuates legislative intent simplistically to assume that whatever furthers the statute's primary objective must be the law,"" because ""no legislation pursues its purposes at all costs.""Griffith's conclusion is a ringing defense of the rule of the people through those they vote into power: ""Our duty when interpreting a statute is to ascertain the meaning of the words of the statute duly enacted through the formal legislative process.  This limited role serves democratic interests by ensuring that policy is made by elected, politically accountable representatives, not by appointed, life-tenured judges.""Columnist Ezra Klein sneers that this is just judges giving lawmakers ""a lesson about grammar,"" consequences be damned.  A Washington Post editorial complains, ""the text is a vague mess and the court's interpretation of the language is at odds with the law's obvious intent and with normal deference to executive interpretation.""The Richmond-based Fourth Circuit's unanimous ruling upholding ObamaCare's subsidies, issued the same day, argues that ""denying tax credits to individuals shopping on federal exchanges would throw a debilitating wrench into"" ObamaCare's ""internal economic machinery"" — as if the federal judge's job is to fix badly written laws.As Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia has noted, ""it is simply incompatible with democratic government, or indeed, even with fair government, to have the meaning of a law determined by what the lawgiver meant, rather than what the lawgiver promulgated. That seems to me one step worse than the trick the emperor Nero was said to engage in: posting edicts high up in the pillars, so that they could not easily be read.""The letter of the law is the law.To believe otherwise is to give tyrannical power not only to unelected judges but also to a handful of legislators who tell us in hindsight what laws passed years ago really intended to do.Laws are passed by a majority of all members of Congress, and in the case of an overridden presidential veto, supermajorities.The same principle protects against activist judges looking through floor statements and committee hearing transcripts for supposed hidden meanings not found in the text of the actual laws passed.We're a nation of laws, not of spinmeisters.

1344,ABC,"Immigration: With medical professionals overwhelmed by border chaos, illegal aliens are being sent across the U.S. without basic health screening, raising the prospect of epidemics of diseases once thought eradicated.As unaccompanied minors from Central America who have flooded across President Obama's open borders are dispersed nationwide from Nebraska to Illinois to Massachusetts, concerns have arisen that the nation's health has been put at risk by poor and even absent medical screening.An internal Department of Defense memo obtained by ABC News reports that the director of refugee health at Health and Human Services ""has identified a breakdown of the medical screening processes at the Nogales, Ariz., facility."" This may be just the tip of a medical-disaster iceberg.Officials involved in moving the immigrants from Border Patrol processing centers to Health and Human Services facilities are, according to the memo, ""putting sick (fevers and coughing) unaccompanied children on airplanes inbound for (Naval Base Ventura County) in addition to the chicken pox and coxsackie virus cases.""Three unaccompanied minors were reportedly in the ICU at local hospitals in California, and two of them were diagnosed with strep pneumonia. The same naval base has experienced an outbreak of pneumonia and influenza among the unaccompanied minors at its detention facility.The dispersal of illegal aliens, including unaccompanied minors, throughout the U.S. without proper medical screening is an appalling dereliction of duty by a president and an administration sworn to protect the health and safety of American citizens.""Most of the border minors are being kept in overcrowded facilities ridden with poor hygiene,"" Dr. Elizabeth Lee Vliet, a preventive medicine specialist, told Breitbart News recently, adding, ""This is the ideal condition for a viral outbreak.""""A public health crisis, the likes of which I have not seen in my lifetime, is looming,"" Vliet wrote recently for World Net Daily. ""Drug-resistant tuberculosis is the most serious risk, but even diseases like measles can cause severe complications and death in older or immuno-compromised patients.""Border Patrol agents in Murrieta, Calif., have tested positive for tuberculosis. Hand and foot disease and Chagas disease, a tropical parasitic illness, both previously eradicated from the area, are on the rise.The possibility also exists in these conditions for diseases such as dengue fever to hit the U.S.""We had one get bacterial pneumonia a couple days ago,"" Border Patrol union vice president Chris Cabrera told host Martha MacCallum on Fox News Channel's America's Newsroom Monday. ""A lot of our guys are coming down with scabies or lice.""""The Border Patrol is trying to play catch-up, and we're having a lot of diseases coming in, and some we haven't seen in decades,"" said Cabrera. ""We are worried they'll spread throughout the United States, especially if they are being released and have the disease.""We're worried as well.Rep. Phil Gingrey, R-Ga., who is also a medical doctor, has fired off a scathing letter to the director of the Centers for Disease Control.""As the unaccompanied children continue to be transported to shelters around the country on commercial airlines and other forms of transportation, I have serious concerns that the diseases carried by these children may begin to spread too rapidly to control,"" he says.""In fact, as you undoubtedly know, some of these diseases have no known cure.""Of particular concern, Gingrey continues, are ""reports of illegal migrants carrying deadly diseases such as swine flu, dengue fever, Ebola virus and tuberculosis."" Also of concern, we would add, is the spread of measles and chicken pox among Americans.To repeat: President Obama is putting America's health at risk. His open-border policy is enough to make you sick — literally.

1354,ABC,"Bill Clinton and his wife are just regular folks, you should know. He says they talk to towns people near both of their mansions. They go to the grocery store on weekends and perhaps squeeze the fruit, as careful shoppers would watching their dollars in this stagnant Obamaconomy.Never mind the burly guys in cool shades nearby with curly wires running into their ears and machine guns under the jackets. Or their specially-trained defensive driver. Or the friends' private jets that whisk them to another $200K speech.Ever the gallant husband, Bill Clinton was defending Hillary's oopsey-do claims on her book tour that the couple was ""dead broke"" in 2001, struggling just like ordinary Americans to get mortgages on their two mansions and finance Chelsea's private school. It wasn't easy, Hillary said in that flawed interview with ABC News.Like hell it wasn't.They walked out of the White House into multi-million dollar book contracts and fees for a single speech that exceeded several years' earnings for most Americans. Terry McAuliffe, their political money man who's now Virginia governor, put up more than a million as bridge loan for one house down-payment.Hillary and Bill both boast of having millions in debts when entering private life. Which is true. But where did those debts come from? Well, uh, mountainous attorney fees for numerous actual and alleged wrongdoings while occupying the Oval Office and other rooms.One of the more humorous evergreen characteristics of Democrats in politics is their genetic need to claim humble beginnings and to apologize for being rich beyond the wildest dreams of the little people they claim to so devotedly defend.Somehow, however, the poor remain stuck in poverty despite giving their votes automatically to the latest Democrat year after year. That's terribly unfair, their pols note, but if they'll only vote for them one more time, things will change.Or as Obama's minions did in 2012, to sully Mitt Romney for having turned down an inheritance and earned his own mini-fortune. If you can imagine such a thing in America.Obama, it's worth noting, has somehow become a millionaire making $172,000 as a senator briefly and $400,000 a year as president for way too long. Of course, it doesn't hurt to have a free 747.Joe Biden isn't hurting either. Until last year he was Scrooge McDuck on charitable giving. And he even charges the Secret Service rent for agents using a nearby cottage to protect Biden at home in Delaware.Wealth, of course, is bipartisan in America. Many Republicans are rich too. But they're like, Yeh, so what? Go make your own money.Speaking in a Tuesday interview with David Gregory in Denver, Bill Clinton defended his wife's poverty statements as accurate, but couldn't resist pulling up the old 'America is unfair' meme.“I don't think most Americans resent somebody else doing well,"" Bill said. ""They resent that they're not getting a fair deal.""Hillary is scaring the bejesus out of many Democrats with her book tour's unforced errors. Last weekend she was quoted in the Guardian saying the couple's earnings in excess of $100 million came ""through the dint of hard work"" and that the pair pays ordinary income tax ""unlike the truly well off.""Part of the party's 2016 fear comes from its thin bench. If Hillary crashes again, does anyone seriously believe that after the Obama inexperience, America is eager to elect another freshman legislator like, say, Elizabeth Warren -- even if she really was Native American?The challenge right now, however, is Bill Clinton's. He's a masterful politician. He really is. He appears genuine, thoughtful. He seems to enjoy people, not put up with them as props. He doesn't read remarks robotically through a teleprompter. In the late 1990's Clinton tried to convince Americans that oral sex really isn't sex. Mixed success there.Now, his new challenge is to not talk about Benghazi. And to convince America that his wife, who hasn't driven an automobile since 1996, is not really out of touch with average people.RELATED:Americans' confidence in Obama cratersThe message in Hillary Clinton's 'Hard Choices' is really hard to findObama's decided Iraq's Maliki must go, but be very wary of historyHe's got the perqs down, now time for Obama to master the work part

1356,ABC,"Elections: If Hillary Clinton's much ballyhooed — and ultimately disastrous — national book tour is any indication, Democrats face some hard choices in the months ahead about whom they can run for president.You can't blame Clinton for scheduling her ""Hillary Week"" at a time when there was so much real news going on. But she certainly deserves blame for the fact that the only coverage she managed to get from her book tour was all bad.Even before her tour got started, reviewers — many of whom you'd expect to be cheerleading for Hillary — were instead viciously hammering her book, ""Hard Choices.""Politico's Mike Allen, for example, called it a ""newsless snore"" that will ""fuel the notion that politics infuses every part of her life."" John Dickerson at Slate said it was ""the low-salt, low-fat, low-calorie offering with vanilla pudding as the dessert.""From there her week went downhill. First, there was the interview with ABC News' Diane Sawyer, which can only be described as the worst performance by a book-touring politician since Bob Dole lost his cool over a tobacco question during a 1996 ""Today Show"" interview, where he and wife Elizabeth were trying to pitch their feel-good memoir.First, Clinton fatuously claimed she and Bill were ""dead broke"" and ""struggled"" when they left the White House — as a way to justify the obscene $200,000 per speech she's been getting since leaving the State Department. That then forced Clinton to later spend time amending her comments.That same interview displayed Clinton's inability to defend herself against Sawyer's surprisingly barbed questions about Benghazi. After a fumbling effort to escape any blame for what Sawyer correctly described as a ""systemic failure"" that led to the death of a U.S. ambassador and three other Americans, Hillary unleashed a new Clintonian classic: ""I take responsibility, but I was not making security decisions.""Then, in Chicago on Wednesday, Clinton seemed confused about just which office Abraham Lincoln held before becoming president, calling him Senator Lincoln.And later in the week, Clinton made headlines after a spat with a NPR reporter Terry Gross, who was trying to get a straight answer from Hillary just when and why her views on gay marriage changed.The best part was this:Gross: ""I'm just trying to clarify so I can understand —""Clinton: ""No, I don't think you are trying to clarify. I think you are trying to say that I used to be opposed and now I am in favor, and I did it for political reasons. And that's just flat wrong.""Of course, everything she had said in the interview up until that point demonstrated that her ""evolution"" on gay marriage was entirely based on political calculations.By the end of the week, Clinton was hit with polls showing her approval rating had dropped, along with a story on the wires headlined: ""What If Hillary Clinton Doesn't Run?""This, mind you, is the Inevitable Hillary that the mainstream press had already picked as Obama's heir apparent. Never mind that Clinton had been the ""inevitable"" candidate once before, back in 2008 before Obama ran away with the Democratic nomination.We won't shed any tears if Hillary Clinton doesn't run or loses in the primaries. She would make a terrible president, which, after eight years of miserable Obama failures, is a terrifying prospect.But you've got to wonder what Democrats must be thinking after her inept performance this week, especially when they look at their incredibly weak presidential candidate bench.

Deadly weather caused more than $8 billion in property damage in 2013 and resulted in 440 weather-related fatalities, according to a National Weather Service report.The hit for businesses? One-in-four affected by weather disasters never reopen. That finding comes from the Insurance Information Institute, which stressed the importance of disaster planning and business interruption coverage in the wake of 2012's Hurricane Sandy.• Respond fast. Last winter, the Atlanta area weathered ice storms. At law firm Deming Parker, Hoffman, Campbell and Daly, the unseasonable cold burst an office pipe, flooding servers. The firm already had a disaster plan in place, and was contracted with Agility Recovery, a vendor that swoops in with resources when disaster strikes.""Within 12 hours from close to open we were back up using their satellite Internet and servers,"" said Rick Campbell, managing partner.• Lay groundwork. A facility fire two years prior got partners at the law firm thinking about rapid recovery. ""It was a small fire ... but one building was completely out of commission for six months,"" Campbell told IBD. Time to gear up. ""These things happen in business, and you have to have a plan in place."" The firm's priority? ""Minimal, if any, disruption to our clients.""• Begin simply. Crafting strategies to deal with wide-ranging catastrophes can feel like a daunting undertaking. ""Start by trying to handle the most likely events first,"" Campbell said, like fire or regional weather events.• Keep it alive. Plans should evolve and periodically be reviewed, fine-tuned and practiced. ""It's always a work in progress,"" Campbell said. ""You can't forget about it. It's just like a fire drill.""• Commit. Many firms have an emergency plan, but only 30% of small-business decision-makers report having a formal business continuity plan, according to the Travelers Business Risk Index.Company chiefs should prioritize such preparation, which protects that bottom line. ""This isn't just a safety function. This is a business operational function,"" said Ken Katz, risk control property director with insurance firm Travelers (TRV).• Cover bases. Travelers' step-by-step approach, called ABC-Go, includes assessing risks, performing a business impact analysis, developing controls for prevention and mitigation, and testing the plan. ""These are mission-critical types of conversations,"" Katz said.• Spotlight it. Company leaders are wise to make the topic a priority and involve personnel from various departments. ""You need that breadth of experience,"" Katz said.• Add accountability.  Formalize the process by setting goals and deadlines. Some companies include disaster preparation as a responsibility within job descriptions. ""Now there's an incentive to keeping that going,"" Katz said.• Run through it. Test that plan. ""There's nothing like doing it"" for finding blind spots, said Katz.

1387,ABC,"Leading stocks took their licks in the past week, with only a small clique of IBD 50 stocks posting weekly gains.Among those, China-based TAL Education (XRS) hauled in an 11% gain to end the week at a new high.That left the chain of tutoring centers for kindergarten through 12th grade well extended after its first test of 10-week support since a breakout from an undefined, late-stage base in June.Another China issue, online automotive-data provider BitAuto (BITA), shaved a 6% loss to a slightly positive finish for the week. It marked BitAuto's eighth straight weekly advance. The stock is 21% above a 47.02 buy point in a late-stage base.China stocks were not immune to the selling, though.The diversifying Internet play Qihoo 360 (QIHU) took a 9% hit, ending the week at the bottom of its trading range. That left it flush with its converged 10- and 40-week moving averages, throwing another challenge in front of its late-stage, base-building effort. Qihoo and other stocks fell off the IBD 50 list amid the broad market weakness.From an industry standpoint, the most resilient stocks were drugmakers and other medical stocks.At the head of that list, Team Health Holdings (TMH) rattled off a 5% gain for the week. The outsourced health care staffing firm ended the week in the middle of its trading range and 7% above a 52.28 buy point from a second-stage, base-on-base pattern.Salix Pharmaceuticals (SLXP) and Gilead Sciences (GILD) each rose 2%, the largest gain among the biomed plays. Salix is consolidating just below a July 2 high and 19% above a 113.13 buy point in a late-stage base.Gilead's gain extended its advance to seven weeks, putting it 8% above an 83.80 buy point after clearing a first-stage base early in July.Drug distributor AmerisourceBergen (ABC) ticked up a fraction, holding on to its 4% gain from the prior week's breakout above a flat-base buy point of 73.91. As a side note, AmerisourceBergen's revenue, at $87.9 billion, is by far the largest on the IBD 50 list.Medical plays also figured into the week's hardest-hit leaders. Spain-based Grifols (GRFS) crumbled 14% after the blood-plasma distributor reported second-quarter results Thursday.Grifols' drop dragged its shares out of a second-stage-base-building effort and below key levels of support.Other hard-hit plays on the list included Emerge Energy (EMES).

1388,ABC,"Someone once observed that the job of White House press secretary is very tricky. It involves serving two masters: The president primarily, but also feeding the chronically unhappy and omnivorous media pack that inhabits one of the work-areas in the people's house.Not everyone can be good at it. We're going through a transition this month from Jay Carney to Josh Earnest. The 49-year-old Carney's somewhat surprising sudden exit was announced Friday after months of the former journalist clearly struggling as the PR-face of an Obama administration thrashing for election-year air and relevance amid non-stop scandals and foreign troubles.They include, but are not limited to, the Syrian red-line fiasco, the deadly Benghazi scandal protracted due to Obama stonewalling, the ObamaCare roll-out debacle and the VA scandal.Obama’s standard scandal defense is that he didn’t know about it, sometimes for days after the story had been dominating national news. This is a patently bizarre claim given that Obama is the most powerful leader in the world, whose agencies are collecting virtually every telephonic and electronic communication in the country.But Carney was expected to deliver this repeated response with a straight face, which he attempted with an increasingly combative press corps. You know how dogs can smell fear and so much else that human noses cannot detect? The White House media is that way about the president’s chief spokesman if it senses the press secretary does not have the president’s ear, confidence and looks to be simply passing on policy talking points from someone else.Scott McClellan was in that awkward position for President Bush. Tony Snow and Robert Gibbs, for example, were policy players fully aware of most going on. Politicians seem most comfortable with spokesmen tested in their campaign battles, like Gibbs. And now Earnest.Carney was a journalist (one of a score tapped by Obama administration agencies) before joining the new vice president’s team as his spokesman in December of 2008.As everyone knows, Carney re-shaped Joe Biden’s image from a train-riding, gaffe-prone senator representing the nation’s most insignificant state into a flawless speaker, smiling ambassador of hot air and a persuasive policy advocate who effectively warned Obama against ordering the Osama bin Laden raid.Media experience in a spokesman can be good for the politician because a news veteran knows how ex-colleagues think, what they will question and what they might fall for if packaged properly.That journalism experience can also be bad because a media veteran is typically accustomed to demanding the truth from public figures. And if asked to deliver untruths or misleading partial truths for the $172,000 White House salary, he or she can inadvertently give away the game with those tell-tale tics that criminal profilers — and reporters — watch for closely. Like not looking directly when responding or, as Carney did so often, looking down as if checking podium notes. Also transmitting a visual admission he didn’t know the material cold.According to one news tally a year ago, Carney had responded nearly 2,000 times using some variation of ""I don't know"" since his first briefing in 2011. Further calculations estimate Carney had dodged a question almost 9,500 times.So now, as the Washington cliché goes, the unemployed Carney can spend more time with his family, his wife Claire Shipman of ABC News, and their two children.Oh, by the way, that “someone” who once observed that White House press secretary is a very tricky job serving two masters was actually Jay Carney himself.As a bureau chief for Time magazine, he appeared on C-SPAN on March 2, 2006, more than two years before switching over to the dark side of politics. On that program, the prescient Carney also said this:“The best press secretaries were very deft at serving their boss, the president, the White House, the administration and the press. It’s a tricky job. I’m sure I would not be any good at it.”

The policy reset with a reasonable Russia.All of which, of course, is somebody else's fault.Which is why the grandly-announced Wednesday speech on his plans to degrade and destroy ISIS, the 21st century's first barbarian army, will be largely substance-free. ""I'm preparing the country to make sure we deal with a threat from ISIL,"" Obama told Todd. Uh-huh.That would have been a good idea way back when then-Homeland Security Secy. Janet Napolitano first warned the president about these killers. Or way back a year ago when the murderous group began appearing regularly in Obama's daily intelligence threat warning.Or last winter when Obama instead specifically described them as a JV team.No, Obama's speech tomorrow is really about repairing Obama's own historic gaffe two weeks ago accidentally admitting the truth -- that he has no strategy to fight ISIS in Syria or elsewhere. A gaffe which has already produced a precipitous plunge in his poll approval numbers.A president without a plan for everything is worse than a lame duck. He's a hapless lame duck. Of course, unidentified Obama aides placed blame for a plan's alleged absence on the Pentagon, which is a very large building to throw under a bus.The carefully-crafted news leaks today will make the speech sound serious, such as a coordinated bombing campaign to destroy ISIS' military equipment, much of it American.And an international coalition of willing partners. Let's see if Obama's vaunted coalition exceeds the 37 (thirty-seven!) nations that sent troops there under President Bush -- and drew so much Democrat derision as puny.Obama has this dangerous penchant to play down foreign threats. Remember how al Qaeda was ""on the run"" ""on the path to defeat"" with a ""decimated"" leadership? Until Sept. 11, 2012, in Benghazi when four Americans died at its hands because no one anticipated such a threat. Which, of course, was the fault of a video. Or the Democrat's initial description of Edward Snowden as a mere hacker.Obama also feels constantly compelled to talk about what he's not going to do more than what he will do.He's not going to continue with a missile defense shield in Eastern Europe. He's not going to put American boots on the ground in Iraq or Syria. He's not going to allow Iran to develop nuclear weapons. He's not going to stand for Putin's annexation of Crimea. No military action in Ukraine.Syria's Bashir al-Assad must go and for crossing the Nobel Peace Prize winner's chemical weapons ""red-line,"" al-Assad would experience air attacks (with two weeks notice to disperse and hide targets.) But not too many attacks, john Kerry promised. They'd be incredibly limited. So, don't worry, world. We're not that tough.Obama's classic maneuver came in a West Point speech announcing his second tough troop surge into Afghanistan in which he simultaneously announced, Don't worry they'll all be out by the end of 2014. Mark your calendar, Taliban.Here's what you'll hear Wednesday:Clearly, no U.S. boots on the ground. I am absolutely confident. Targeted air strikes. International coalition. Regional threat. We know how to handle these groups; We've done it before. Degrade the military and financial capabilities of ISIL, a name Obama prefers to ISIS because it leaves out Iraq where he hastily withdrew all U.S. troops in 2011 despite warnings of the resulting vacuum.All of this has cost him. Approval of Obama’s foreign affairs performance plunged eight points since July, to only 38%, according to a new ABC News-Washington Post Poll.

1424,ABC,"Kevin O'Leary of TV's hit show ""Shark Tank"" tells entrepreneurs what they don't want to hear.He's brutally honest with contestants on the ABC investment reality show in a way that often recalls the jarring Simon Cowell, the former judge on ""American Idol.""The other Sharks on the show, which is rated No. 1 on Friday nights, sarcastically call O'Leary Mr. Wonderful. The nickname has stuck. When he shows up at hotels, they often have the reservation under his nickname.""I am Mr. Wonderful because it's wonderful to be told the truth,"" O'Leary, the author of  ""Cold Hard Truth on Men, Women & Money,"" told IBD. ""Everyone else coddles people even when their ideas don't have any merit. In money, there's no gray, only black and white — you make it or you lose it.""Whatever one thinks of his sharp tongue, he knows what he's talking about, with a net worth of $300 million, according to Forbes.O'Leary, 59, was born in Montreal. He seemed predestined for business, given the charisma and wit of his Irish salesman father and his financially conscious mother.But when Kevin was 6, Mom grew tired of Dad's gambling, divorced him and married a student pursuing a Ph.D. in business with just $36 to his name.Not EasyDuring the ensuing custody battle, Kevin's mother kept them safe from his dad's rough friends by taking Kevin and his brother to Switzerland. They returned a couple of months later when the father died of a heart attack.O'Leary's stepfather became an official at the United Nations, and they moved frequently to such nations as Ethiopia and Cyprus.The boys' parents made sure they mixed with the locals and not just U.N. families. ""I had a chance to experience different cultures, something that has made me a better investor,"" said O'Leary. ""Now I can go back to places like Cambodia, where the country has had a dramatic turnaround, and see great opportunities. I'd tell anyone starting a career today that they should consider going where there is high single-digit growth, like China, India, Brazil or Vietnam.""His mother contributed to his future success by showing him the value of frugality, how every saved dollar could become a fortune with patience. Her sons worked hard at whatever jobs were available.Back in Canada, after graduating from high school, O'Leary attended the Royal Military College Saint-Jean in Quebec for two years, then in 1977 earned a bachelor's degree in psychology and environmental science at the University of Waterloo in Ontario. Three years later came his MBA at the University of Western Ontario.After working as an assistant product manager at the Nabisco snack firm — now a subsidiary of Kraft Foods Group (KRFT) — O'Leary and two friends founded Special Event Television, which produced sports programming.One of his partners bought him out for $25,000. So he invested part of the money in a startup, the software publisher SoftKey International, alongside two associates in 1983. With O'Leary as president, working out of his basement, the three compiled software on CD-ROMs.They lost money at first. But over the next decade, they bought other publishers and grew fast by shedding those units' overhead.""I learned that acquisitions need to be truly accretive quickly, and today shareholders don't have patience for anything that might only provide long-term benefits,"" he said. ""What's troubling is that industry consolidation is mainly about tax efficiency, which shows how screwed up the tax code is.""In 1990, O'Leary married Linda Greer and they would have two children, Savannah and Trevor. He makes sure they get together on weekends, no matter where he is. O'Leary owns several houses worldwide; he says his home is wherever the family can meet.By 1995, SoftKey had bought up 60 rivals, including The Learning Co. — a leader in educational software programs — and took on its name. The next year O'Leary's firm moved to Boston. By 1999, The Learning Co. had 467 titles and $800 million in annual sales. That year, it was acquired by Mattel (MAT) in a $4.2 billion stock swap that gave O'Leary a big stake in the company.Mattel saw an opportunity to expand from toys to education. Yet O'Leary departed in 2000 when Mattel sales declined.Three years later, O'Leary became a director with Storage Now, helping the firm become Canada's third largest owner of climate-controlled storehouses.Storage Now was bought by InStorage REIT in 2007 for $110 million, and eventually TKG StorageMart bought the whole outfit.After exiting Mattel as a shareholder, O'Leary became an investment adviser to Genstar Capital and Hamilton Trust, while appearing on financial TV shows in Canada and America.Riding The RulesO'Leary's personal portfolio got clobbered when the Great Recession hit in 2008. He realized he had to return to his mother's investment principles, which are the foundation of O'Leary Funds:• Invest no more than 5% in one stock and only 20% in one segment.• Put money in stocks that pay dividends or in interest-bearing bonds.• Don't invest in anything you don't understand.• If something sounds too good to be true, it is.• Be patient.Just as crucial as the right investments is not wasting money, says O'Leary. In his book and on his website, he offers tips on how to save the critical 10% of income necessary to become rich with good decisions, big and small:• Don't blow money on a big wedding.• Rent instead of buying a house if the mortgage will cost more than 25% of your income — 30% in expensive cities.• Don't buy anything fancy for the baby, who won't appreciate it anyway while you go broke.• Live where you can walk or take mass transit to work.• Instead of joining an expensive diet club, have your doctor design a personal food plan.His empire encompasses everything from O'Leary Mortgages to O'Leary Fine Wines.Apparently, he has good taste.""I was about to buy a winemaker when one approached me about handling the growing, bottling and distribution, so I could concentrate on the product and brand,"" he said. ""I'm probably the only winemaker who was profitable in the first 60 days. I was surprised my name could carry a wine brand, but people trust me, and we've won awards and gone from 5,000 cases the first season to expecting 20,000 in what will be our third.""Time To GoO'Leary's travel time is managed by his assistant, Nancy Cheung, who allocates each 30-minute segment based on return on investment.In 2006 he became one of the stars of the Canadian version of a Japanese venture-capital reality TV show called ""Dragons' Den."" The original has been spun off in markets from Nigeria to Afghanistan, evidence of the universal attraction of entrepreneurship.Another one of the original Dragons was Robert Herjavec, who is now with O'Leary on the American version, ""Shark Tank,"" which debuted in 2009. In each season of the ABC show, 150 small-business owners — winnowed down from 360,000 applicants this year — pitch the Sharks ideas for expansion in exchange for a percentage of the startup, debt financing or a royalty on sales.Daily operations of O'Leary's ""Shark Tank"" commitments are headed by Alex Kenjeev, president of O'Leary Ventures, which manages the 23 he's invested in. One is Wicked Good Cupcakes of Cohasset, Mass., which ships the treats in jars. The firm's leaders were doing less than $200,000 a year when they landed on ""Shark Tank."" ""We're expecting $5 million next year,"" O'Leary said. ""They started with seven employees and now have 50.""Michael DuDell, author of ""Shark Tank Jump Start Your Business,"" is impressed with such sweet success: ""Kevin is one of the most disciplined, pragmatic investors I know. He doesn't get caught up in the hype that often plagues the startup community. His solitary goal is to get a return on his investment, which may not be popular to admit, but it's a big part of what makes him so successful.""Said O'Leary: ""I love to finance and work with entrepreneurs, so I'm having the time of my life now.""

1427,ABC,"Crime: Attorney General Eric Holder's star witness in the allegedly racist police shooting of a black St. Louis teen is a hoodlum with a history of making false statements to police.Dorian Johnson, 22, the main source of the media's racist cop narrative, has lost all credibility. So why is Holder still taking his testimony? And why isn't he behind bars?An ABC News affiliate in St. Louis reported that Johnson is wanted in Jefferson City, Mo., on a 2011 theft charge and also for filing a false police report that same year. Johnson allegedly gave a bogus name and age to investigators in the case.Johnson was walking with Michael Brown when his friend ""Big Mike"" was shot by a local patrolman. He told reporters and anyone who would listen that the unarmed Brown was ""shot like an animal"" by a ""white cop,"" as he raised his hands to surrender.""Me and my friend was walking down the street, wasn't causing any harm to nobody,"" he said, when Officer Darren Wilson pulled up in his patrol car and ""reached his arm out the window and grabbed my friend around his neck. ... (He) was trying to choke my friend.""He claimed Brown broke loose and started to run away when Wilson shot him from behind, then finished him off at close range, execution style.His chillingly vivid account spurred nationwide protests, including the looting and torching of dozens of businesses. Civil rights leaders embraced Johnson. So did Holder.But then, piece by piece, his story started to fall apart.First came the release of a video from a liquor store surveillance camera showing Johnson involved in a robbery with Brown just moments before the shooting. A police report ID'd Johnson as a suspect (though charges were mysteriously dropped as federal authorities stepped in to investigate the case).Then came the family autopsy showing Brown was not, in fact, shot from behind.Next, a friend of Wilson described in a radio interview how Johnson and Brown pushed Wilson back into his patrol car as he opened the door to question them.And now we know Johnson has a habit of lying to authorities. His arrest record should sink his credibility as a key witness before the grand jury.

1428,ABC,"Mideast: Iraqi Christian and Yazidi representatives are urging the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights to call for a special HRC session on the plight of their communities at the hand of jihadists.After the U.S. airstrikes and airdrops to relieve the Islamic State's siege of Mt. Sinjar in Iraq, where the Kurdish-speaking sect known as the Yazidis had fled, President Obama noted on Aug. 14: ""The bottom line is that the situation on the mountain has greatly improved and Americans should be very proud of our efforts.""But shortly before the president spoke, according to ABC News, a spokesman for a U.N. relief agency said the situation on Mount Sinjar remained ""dire"" despite our efforts. Kieran Dwyer, communications chief for the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, warned, ""The situation on the mountain is not over.""The situation facing Iraqi Christians and the Yazidis, followers of a sect partly influenced by Christianity but borrowing from other religions as well, is certainly not over. Nor is the plight of non-Muslims throughout the Middle East.Not long after the president spoke, Fox News reported that Islamic State forces slaughtered 80 Yazidis in a northern village.""(Militants) arrived in vehicles, and they started their killing this afternoon,"" Fox News says senior Kurdish official Hoshiyar Zebari told Reuters. ""We believe it is because of their (Islamic State's) creed: convert or be killed,"" he added.Breen Tahseen, an Iraqi diplomat whose father, Prince Tahseen Saeed Bek, is the leader of the Yazidi minority, has made a plea to the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, Navi Pillay, to hold a special session of the U.N. Human Rights Council (HRC) on the plight of the Yazidis and Iraqi Christians. He says Islamist militants have killed at least 3,000 Yazidi men and kidnapped some 5,000.""On behalf of Prince Tahseen and the Yazidi people, we appeal to High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay to lead the call for the U.N. Human Rights Council to hold an emergency session in order to focus world attention on the desperate plight of the Yazidi people,"" read the Aug. 20 statement by Tahseen, as reported by the monitoring group U.N. Watch.Iraqi Christian and Yazidi representatives gathered at the HRC headquarters in Geneva to hold a meeting on the plight of Iraq's besieged minorities.In a letter to Pillay, a coalition of human rights groups and parliamentarians from countries such as Britain, Canada, the Netherlands, Australia and Estonia also pleaded for such a special session as the one held on Darfur in 2006.""It is unconscionable for the world's highest human rights body — which is pledged, under UNGA Resolution 60/251 (the U.N. resolution that created the HRC) to prevent human rights violations and respond promptly to human rights emergencies — to continue turning a blind eye to the massacre, abuse and intimidation of Iraqi civilians,"" the group wrote in the letter.Whether it be Coptic churches in Egypt, Christian schools in Nigeria or Yazidis in Iraq, non-Muslims are in the cross hairs of Islamists worldwide. The percentage of Christians in the Middle East has been cut in half, down from 10% in 1900 to just 5% as of 2010, according to the Pew Research Center.British Prime Minister David Cameron, bucking the winds of political correctness and a rising Muslim population, noted during his annual Easter reception at 10 Downing Street that Christianity is now ""the most persecuted religion around the world.""""We should stand up against persecution of Christians and other religious groups wherever and wherever we can, and should be unashamed in doing so.""Perhaps our U.N. ambassador, Samantha Power, can give Ms. Pillay a nudge.

1430,ABC,"Benghazi Cover-Up: The administration's tangled web of deceit now includes lying about prior lies as the White House press secretary tries to cover up its cover-up of why four Americans died in a terrorist attack.No, that was not Winston Smith, the rewriter of history working for the Ministry of Truth in George Orwell's classic novel ""1984,"" tap-dancing once again before a no-longer-sycophantic White House press corps. Rather, it was that master storyteller, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney.Carney shamefully continued to insist that when then-U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice went on five Sunday talk shows days after the 2012 attack to offer an untrue story that Benghazi was the result of an inflammatory video, she was acting on the best intelligence offered by the intelligence community.Carney said this knowing that Mike Morell, CIA deputy director two years ago, testified before Congress and said the video story did not come from CIA analysts.As for the emails that showed the administration's motives for the story were political, to protect a president running for re-election and a secretary of state that wanted to be his successor, Carney offered his entry for 2014 Lie Of The Year: The emails obtained by the watchdog group Judicial Watch in a lawsuit specifically seeking Benghazi documents weren't really about Benghazi.Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton said in an interview on TheBlaze TV that the newly released emails bring questions about the slaughter ""into the White House, and it shows that the idea that the CIA created the talking points that Susan Rice was using is a big fat lie.""In an argumentative exchange between Carney and ABC News' Jon Karl, Carney insisted that ""if you look at the document in question here, it is not about Benghazi; it is about the protests around the Muslim world outside of U.S. embassies"" and it was the general situation in the Middle East that Rice was being prepped for.To his credit, Karl asked all the right questions in response to Carney's song and dance: ""Why were you holding back this information? Why was this email not turned over to the Congress? Why was it not released when you released all the other emails?"" and, of course, if what Carney was saying is true, why did it take a court case to get the unredacted email released?Days before Rice's TV tour, four Americans were murdered in the terrorist attack — including the first U.S. ambassador killed in three decades. Now Carney would have us believe Rice was sent to five Sunday talk shows, all of which consented to give her the time, just to talk about the ""general situation"" in the Middle East?Rice was sent to lie about Benghazi, and she was prepped by the White House to promote the false narrative of an inflammatory video as part of a pants-on-fire damage control effort.As the emails said, her mission was to promote a lie agreed upon, ""to underscore that these protests are rooted in an Internet video, and not a broader failure or policy.""It would be a lie that would be repeated by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and President Obama in the days and weeks after the attack, a lie told to the parents of the dead as they stood in front of their sons' caskets that were brought back from Benghazi.Charles Woods, whose son Tyrone died in the massacre, told Fox News' Sean Hannity Wednesday night: ""When I was approached by Hillary Clinton at the coming-home ceremony of the bodies at Andrews Air Force Base, and she said, 'We're going to go out, and we're going to prosecute that person that made the video,' I knew that she wasn't telling the truth, and I think the whole world knows that now.""Have they no shame?

More on that shortly.Some people say we praise Obama too much. Well, there's more today. Remember Trayvon Martin and before that, the beer summit?

For those of us who can remember ""Colored"" restrooms and drinking fountains as far north as Tennessee in our youth, America has made remarkable racial progress over the years.

Sterling, for Don's sakes, is 80, older even than Joe Biden or Hillary Clinton.Anyway, at a news conference in Malaysia Sunday (the one that produced the latest POTUS selfie), Obama predictably was asked about Sterling's offensive remarks. Not much news on this junket, so trouble-making media must poke around for something, anything to send home to justify those expense accounts in four different currencies.Obama could have taken the bait, waded in again, made the day's news about him once more.He could have pulled a classic Al Sharpton or Jesse Jackson and seen in one old man's stupid tirade at his bimbo a condemnation of America's stubbornly ugly racist culture. Proof that we need such divisive leaders to prolong the 'national conversation' that keeps their organizations financially-fueled.But Obama didn't. The chief executive, who resorted to ""stinkburger"" just the other day, spoke plainly and clearly this time. No one could doubt his feelings. But he poured no jet fuel on the passing drama. He dismissed it as the ignoble incident it is. Here's what Obama said:""When ignorant folks want to advertise their ignorance, you don't really have to do anything, you just let them talk. That's what happened here.""Obama also observed, rightly, that Sterling's alleged comments show how ""the United States continues to wrestle with the legacy of race and slavery and segregation."" True enough. Good job, sir. Next question.The next topic concerns a new ABC News/Washington Post Poll. It shows that after a minor tick up during the recent long winter of global warming, Obama's job approval has sunk a full five points since March to its lowest point ever, 41%.Obama's lost ground among his core support groups, possibly growing impatient with his promised economic recovery that's been just around the corner now for four years. Fifty-two percent of adult Americans now disapprove of his job performance, and strong disapproval exceeds strong approval by a bruising 17 points.The Democrat can claim the economy is improving all he wants. Only 28% buy that line now, down nine points since Mitt Romney was not elected president.The unaffordable Affordable Care Act has lost support too, down five points in one month to 44%.Since he's been overseas a lot this year and this month, maybe foreign affairs remain Obama's forte. Well, actually not. For example, on Ukraine, which drew new administration sanctions on Russia Monday, Obama's job approval is barely one-third, 34%.Perhaps most ominously for Obama's second-term agenda -- whatever that is -- a majority of Americans now prefer a Congress completely controlled by Republicans.As poll director Gary Langer puts it:""Registered voters by 53-39 percent in the national survey say they’d rather see the Republicans in control of Congress as a counterbalance to Obama’s policies than a Democratic-led Congress to help support him. It was similar in fall 2010, when the Republicans took control of the House of Representatives and gained six Senate seats.""Another six-seat gain on Nov. 4 gives the GOP control of the Senate. And Obama can finally focus on his presidential library.RELATED:Residents of these 2 states live happier than youObama, Holder to pardon thousands of drug dealers, addicts

"
1458,ABC,"By the late 1990s, Walt Disney shareholders could have whistled toward work — or retirement.
"
1459,ABC,"The company stood atop the entertainment world, growing strongly as its animation division churned out hits, its live-action films flowered, and its dusty video library turned into content gold.
"
1460,ABC,"Shares surged 8,943% from their 1984 low to their March 2014 peak, with the biggest run from '84 to '98.
"
1461,ABC,"But in the spring of 1984, all of that was far off.
"
1462,ABC,"A few years after the death of the visionary founder Walt in 1966, Disney (DIS) foundered under weak leadership and little sense of direction. Once the company's crown jewels, the animated movies had fallen by the wayside, and its live-action films — think of ""Escape to Witch Mountain"" (1965) and ""Tron"" (1982) — weren't much better.
"
1463,ABC,"In fiscal 1982, net income plunged 18% and fell 7% again the following year. The next year, corporate raider Saul Steinberg targeted Disney, which eventually paid him $32 million to go away.
"
1464,ABC,"The Disney board knew that it needed change. In September of 1984, Michael Eisner started as CEO and chairman, and Frank Wells as president.
"
1465,ABC,"""It was a fabulous management team. People were at their absolute best,"" said Chris Dixon, who covered Disney as a PaineWebber analyst at the time. ""Eisner was terrific in terms of imagination and energy, and Frank, because of his long-term experience, added a little gray hair.""
"
1466,ABC,"""The '80s were golden,"" said Hal Vogel, a long-time entertainment industry analyst and investor who wrote ""Entertainment Industry Economics."" ""It was a very positive change and a very fruitful period.""
"
1467,ABC,"One of the team's first smart moves, analysts say, was to recognize the cash potential of Disney's assets. By the early 1980s, the theme parks were generating 70% of company income, according to the website Funding Universe.
"
1468,ABC,"""They sensed correctly that they could raise ticket prices and not affect demand for the parks,"" Vogel said.
"
1469,ABC,"In fact, raising ticket prices by just $1 would yield $30 million more per year, wrote Kim Masters in ""The Keys to the Kingdom: The Rise of Michael Eisner and the Fall of Everybody Else.""
"
1470,ABC,"Disney got lucky with demographics, says Vogel, as children of baby boomers got old enough to appreciate the theme parks. But it was a stroke of genius, not luck, that led Eisner to see Disney's existing film stock as an asset to be tapped.
"
1471,ABC,"""Such a bounty has fallen into my lap. Every day a new asset falls out of the sky,"" Eisner said in Masters' book. Wells was said to have quipped, ""Every time I open a door at this company, there's money behind it.""
"
1472,ABC,"No company had thought of marketing videocassettes cheaply enough that parents could buy them for children to watch over and over, Masters wrote, and that brainstorm made video a ""staggering source of revenue"" for Disney. Its video library, more than those of most studios, was easily distributed overseas because the films didn't require a lot of sophisticated translation.
"
1473,ABC,"Eisner's recognition that old content had value changed the face of entertainment. It helped cable fill empty channels and gave rise to new business models such as Netflix (NFLX) and Roku.
"
1474,ABC,"Again, Disney was in the sweet spot. Consumers weren't the only ones looking for videocassette content; scores of new TV channels also needed it, and Disney had family-friendly films galore.
"
1475,ABC,"To create new movie and TV content, Eisner and Wells hired Jeffrey Katzenberg, who'd worked under Eisner at Paramount, as Disney Studios chairman.
"
1476,ABC,"Under Katzenberg's direction, Disney revitalized its animation division, turning out hits like ""The Little Mermaid,"" which won two Oscars and grossed a record-setting $85 million; ""Beauty and the Beast,"" the first animated film to be nominated for a best-picture Oscar; and ""The Lion King,"" which took in a staggering $423 million in theatrical box-office revenues according to the website BoxOfficeMojo.
"
1477,ABC,"Katzenberg ""lit a fire under people,"" said Bill Cotter, author of ""The Wonderful World of Disney Television."" Cotter worked for that Disney medium for years.
"
1478,ABC,"Thomas Sito, who helped animate many of the hit films of the Disney renaissance, including ""Little Mermaid"" and ""Aladdin,"" believes another manager was also key to that revival: Roy Disney, Walt's nephew, who became head of the animation division in 1984.
"
1479,ABC,"Roy was personally invested in the revival of animation, which had been the Disney Co.'s heart and soul. Sito told IBD that when it came to making decisions about the quality of the products, Roy used to growl, ""I have to care. My name's on the damn door.""
"
1480,ABC,"The entire management team focused on bringing that sense of quality back to Disney films, Sito says. That was partly due to outside competition; former Disney animator Don Bluth had left and was producing popular animated films such as 1986's ""An American Tail.""
"
1481,ABC,"Katzenberg used to liken Disney's status as synonymous with quality family entertainment just as the Kleenex brand is to tissues.
"
1482,ABC,"""It was very exciting at the time, because as artists we always had faith in the art of animation and its ability to entertain,"" Sito said.
"
1483,ABC,"Disney's new successes also showed Hollywood that animation could be big business again. The Lucasfilm spinoff Pixar had enormous hits with ""Toy Story,"" ""Finding Nemo"" and other films before being bought by Disney in 2006. And Katzenberg had hits like the ""Shrek"" films at DreamWorks Animation (DWA) after leaving Disney.
"
1484,ABC,"Eisner, who was president of Paramount Pictures when Disney tapped him for the CEO job, also knew that there was value in live-action, non-G-rated movie fare. Disney had established Touchstone Films in 1983, before Eisner started, and had even had a hit with the Tom Hanks comedy ""Splash.""
"
1485,ABC,"Eisner gave Touchstone lots of attention, and Touchstone hits such as ""Outrageous Fortune,"" ""Ruthless People"" and ""Pretty Woman"" were box-office gold.
"
1486,ABC,"Eisner also expanded the moneymaking theme parks. He broadened Walt Disney World in Orlando, Fla., via a partnership with MGM for a studio-themed entertainment park, which opened in 1989.
"
1487,ABC,"But Eisner thought even bigger. Tokyo Disneyland had opened in 1983, and while it did well, it was considered a missed opportunity because Disney had leased its characters and name to a local concessionaire rather than owning everything in the park outright. Still, Vogel said, ""It was quite lucrative, and Europe was the next logical decision."" Eisner began working on establishing a Disneyland in Paris: Euro Disney, which opened in 1992.
"
1488,ABC,"Vogel lauds the decision to pursue global expansion. It spread Disney products to consumers around the world and reinforced the brand's iconic status.
"
1489,ABC,"More than that, Eisner's long-distance shift meant that every interaction that a consumer had with Disney sparked another. A theme-park vacation would remind children of a love for Disney films, and re-viewing an old favorite movie could send a parent to buy a toy with a character's likeness. Some 22% of Disney's revenue came from international operations by 1991.
"
1490,ABC,"All of those ventures were a prelude to one of Eisner's biggest steps: buying ABC/Capital Cities in 1996 for $19 billion. ""Once they were successful in being able to expand and demonstrate they could take the company to the next level and scale it, the next step was buying ABC,"" Dixon said.
"
1491,ABC,"The acquisition got Disney a broadcast network along with TV and radio stations — plus ESPN, which at the time had 95 million worldwide viewers. ""ESPN was the crown jewel,"" Vogel said.
"
1492,ABC,"The purchase was especially bold because it guaranteed Disney a network for its programs, Masters notes.
"
1493,ABC,"ABC could air new Disney programming, which could be resold as reruns to cable. Yet Disney remained focused on quality entertainment rather than on churning out lots of content to dump on the network, says Cotter.
"
1494,ABC,"The sense of rebirth touching the film animators reached the TV division as well, Cotter said: ""The more you keep a feeling of fire and ambition under a creative crowd, the more they're going to rise to the occasion.""
"
1495,ABC,"Disney's market cap increased from $2 billion to $53 billion from 1984 to 1996. Eisner could point to 18 new businesses into which he'd led the company since taking the reins, including professional sports teams, live Broadway shows and Disney stores.

"
1523,ABC,"A month has gone by since the last earnings report for AmerisourceBergen Corporation (ABC  -  Free Report). Shares have added about 1.5% in that time frame.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is ABC due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Recent EarningsAmerisourceBergen posted adjusted earnings of $1.55 per share in the first quarter of fiscal 2018, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.35 and improving 14% year over year.The upside can be attributed to strong growth in the company’s Pharmaceutical Distribution Segment and World Courier business.Revenues improved almost 6% to $40.47 billion in the reported quarter. Revenues also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $40.37 billion.Segmental AnalysisPharmaceutical Distribution SegmentRevenues in the segment were $38.94 billion, up 5.8% on a year-over-year basis. Operating income was $388.2 million, up 2.4% year over year.However, the segment was affected by lower-than-expected production at PharMEDium's Memphis 503B outsourcing facility.

1524,ABC,"The grocery and drug store industries are about to witness further consolidation with the country’s largest grocer Albertsons Companies proposing to buy the distressed drugstore retailer, Rite Aid Corporation (RAD  -  Free Report). This deal can be Albertsons’ and Rite Aid’s latest effort to dispel the fear of competition from Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report).Though Rite Aid’s shares reacted positively to the news in the pre-market trading session on Feb 20, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has declined 11.8% in the last two days. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Overall, Rite Aid has gained 19.5% in the last three months, against the industry’s decline of 0.8%.The DealPer the deal, Rite Aid shareholders have the choice to opt for Albertsons’ shares and cash or only the company’s shares. For every 10 Rite Aid shares, shareholders can get one Albertsons share and $1.83 in cash or 1.079 Albertsons shares. Consequently, Rite Aid shareholders will own about 28-29.6% stake in the combined company, subject to the outcome of the cash elections. Further, Albertsons’ shareholders will own nearly 70.4-72% stake in the combined company.Depending on the results of the cash election, Rite Aid is likely to be valued at $1.30-2.65 per share under the sale agreement. The combined company is expected to generate annual revenues of about $83 billion. Further, the new entity anticipates delivering annual run-rate cost savings of $375 million in three years. Of these, the companies expect to realize nearly 60% of the cost synergies in the first two years after closing the transaction. Additionally, the companies anticipate identifying about $3.6 billion of potential revenue opportunities. Albertsons’ proposal is backed by investments from Cerberus Capital Management, L.P., along with Kimco Realty Corporation; Klaff Realty, L.P.; Lubert-Adler Partners, L.P. and Schottenstein Stores Corporation.Following the completion of the merger, the combined company will be steered by John Standley as the Chief Executive Officer (CEO). He is currently the Chairman and CEO of Rite Aid. Further, Albertsons’ current Chairman and CEO, Bob Miller will serve as the Chairman of the new company. With leadership from executives of both companies, the combined entity will have dual headquarters at Boise, Idaho and Camp Hill, Pennsylvania. The name for the new company will be decided as the transaction nears closure. Further, the new company will be listed on the New York Stock Exchange later this year.Albertsons currently operates about 2,300 supermarket stores and nearly 1,800 pharmacies. Meanwhile, Rite Aid has 2,569 drug stores in operation, following the sale of 1,932 pharmacies to Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (WBA  -  Free Report) for $4.38 billion.Together, the new company will operate about 4,900 locations including 4,350 pharmacy counters and 320 clinics across 38 states and Washington D.C. The company will serve more than 40 million customers per week. The companies plan to re-banner most of the Albertsons pharmacies to Rite Aid Stores following the completion of the transaction, while Rite Aid will continue to operate its stand-along pharmacies.The merger has been approved by the board of directors of both companies. Further, it is expected to be closed by the second half of calendar year 2018, conditioned upon receipt of approval from Rite Aid shareholders and other regulatory and customary closing conditions.Industry Background & Threat of AmazonMajority of the recent consolidation in the grocery and drugstore industries has been trying to fend off rising competition due to the entry of Amazon in these segments. While Amazon’s entry in the grocery industry was marked by the recent acquisition of Whole Foods, the company recently teamed up with Berkshire Hathaway, Inc.  and JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM  -  Free Report) forming a non-profit company providing healthcare solutions to its employees. This has perked up the drugstore industry’s concerns regarding the e-commerce giant’s entry in the healthcare business.Further, this threat comes at a time when the drug industry is dealing with challenges like weak reimbursement rates and lower generic drug prices. As the industry players look to cut down costs, the industry continues to witness soft traffic and sales at front-end stores for the last several years. The consequences of these challenges are clearly visible in Rite Aid’s tepid profits in the last two years.A few more instances of recent consolidation in the drugstore industry are CVS Health Corp’s (CVS  -  Free Report) deal to acquire Aetna, Inc. (AET  -  Free Report) in January 2018, as well as Walgreens’ bid to buy AmerisourceBergen Corp. (ABC  -  Free Report), a leading drug wholesale company.More Stock News: This is Bigger Than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

1527,ABC,"Per a report in The Wall Street Journal, Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (WBA  -  Free Report) is in early-stage talks to buy the remaining stake in the leading pharmaceutical services company, AmerisourceBergen Corporation (ABC  -  Free Report). Soon after the takeover rumor surfaced on Feb 12, shares of AmerisourceBergen gained 15.7% in after-hours trading and subsequently, closed with a 0.3% rise. However, the stock price of Walgreens remained unchanged.In this regard, we remind investors that the drugstore retailer and pharmacy-led, health and wellbeing enterprise already holds a 26% stake in AmerisourceBergen, which is part of their long-term strategic relationship, formed in 2013. That relationship comprises a 10-year pharmaceutical distribution contract with AmerisourceBergen.Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. Price Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. Price | Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. Quote We believe, Walgreen’s latest decision to acquire AmerisourceBergen’s remaining stake, comes close on the heels of its rival CVS Health’s (CVS  -  Free Report) gigantic $69-billion acquisition deal of health insurer, Aetna Inc (AET  -  Free Report). According to a Reuters report, the Walgreens-AmerisourceBergen integration, similar to the CVS-Aetna deal, is likely to move toward a vertical consolidation, combining all members of a supply chain.This apart, some analysts believe that this move may be in response to Amazon’s latest decision to step into the multibillion-dollar pharmaceutical industry. Notably, in December 2017, Amazon.com, Inc (AMZN  -  Free Report) had acquired pharmacy licenses in a dozen states.As far as the news revolving around Walgreens-AmerisourceBergen agreement is concerned, many market researchers view this takeover rumor to be strategic, although the companies themselves have remained silent on this speculative issue.Significantly, Walgreens has a market capitalization of $67.82 billion while the same for AmerisourceBergen remains at $19.65 billion.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

1528,ABC,"With externalities impacting stock markets every second day, investors with varied risk appetite prefer to go for value investing. In the event of a market crash,  investors often end up to selling their holdings in a panic. But Warren Buffett advises investors to grab the opportunity and buy bargain stocks at cheap prices. However, this apparently simple-to- understand investing discipline has historically shown dangerous outcomes owing to people’s oversight of the basics.Warren Buffett believes that proper understanding of the “intrinsic value” of a stock will make the task easier. Yardsticks such as dividend yield, the ratio of price to earnings or to book value are the most common forms of intrinsic value calculation, which can easily single out the stocks that the market is currently undervaluing. However, these ratios fail to consider the future potential of a stock. And here comes the importance of a not-so-popular value investing metric, the PEG ratio. This ratio with earnings growth component in it may help to determine the prospects of a stock.The PEG ratio is defined as: (Price/ Earnings)/Earnings Growth RateA lower PEG ratio is always better for value investors.While P/E alone fails to identify a true value stock, PEG helps to find the intrinsic value of a stock.Unfortunately, this ratio is often neglected due to investors’ limitation to calculate the future earnings growth rate of a stock.There are some drawbacks to using the PEG ratio though. It doesn’t consider the very common situation of changing growth rates such as the forecast of the first three years at a very high growth followed by a sustainable but lower growth rate in the long term.Hence, PEG-based investing can turn out to be even more rewarding if some other relevant parameters are also taken into consideration.Here are the screening criteria for a winning strategy:PEG Ratio less than X Industry Median(P/E Ratio (using F1) less than X Industry Median (For more accurate valuation purpose.)Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) (whether good market conditions or bad, stocks with a Zacks Rank #1, #2 and #3 have a proven history of success.)Market Capitalization greater than $1 Billion (This helps us to focus on companies that have strong liquidity)Average 20 Day Volume greater than 50,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.Percentage Change F1 Earnings Estimate Revisions (4 Weeks) greater than 5%: Upward estimate revisions add to the optimism, suggesting further bullishness.Value Score of less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a Style Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential. Here are five of the 12 stocks that qualified the screening:Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria, S.A. (BBVA  -  Free Report): BBVA Compass ranks among the top 25 largest U.S. commercial banks based on deposit market share and ranks among the largest banks in Alabama (2nd), Texas (4th) and Arizona (5th). The stock also can be an impressive value investment pick with its Zacks Rank #2 and Value Score of A.

1529,ABC,"Thomson Reuters Corporation (TRI  -  Free Report) is slated to report fourth-quarter 2017 results before the market opens on Feb 8. In the previous quarter, the company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 10 cents.Notably, the company topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters with a positive earnings surprise of 14.3%. However, it remains to be seen if Thomson Reuters will be able to keep its earnings surprise streak alive this time.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors Influencing Q4Thomson Reuters continues to benefit from greater operating leverage and is likely to record higher revenues and margins in the quarter on the back of its simplification initiatives. Management remains optimistic about the company’s future performance, given its constant endeavors to implement core strategies and achieve financial goals. We believe that its cost-containment efforts, share buyback plan and impressive performance of the underlying subscription revenues bode well.The company’s core subscription businesses continue to perform well and it is encouraging to see its Financial & Risk business — the largest revenue generating segment — reporting strong revenue growth. The company has been working to achieve its earnings target for 2017. It also intends to keep improving its free cash flow per share.Thomson Reuters expects its underlying fundamentals to improve in the last quarter of 2017. The company also expects to benefit from its integrated technology system that takes structured and unstructured information and turns it into a structured taxonomy with a focus on the financial services industry. However, adverse currency fluctuations may play a spoilsport in the to-be-reported quarter.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Thomson Reuters is likely to beat earnings this quarter as it does not possess the key components. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here as you will see below:Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is 0.00%.

1530,ABC,"DENTSPLY SIRONA Inc. (XRAY  -  Free Report) is expected to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 16, before the market opens.The company is expected to see sluggishness in the Ex Precious Metal Segment — one of the major revenue components. This is expected to dampen fourth-quarter results, which might be compensated by improving revenues in other segments.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for U.S. revenues at the Ex Precious Metal Segment is $348 million, down 3.9% from the last quarter. Not just in the United States, the segment is likely to put up an unimpressive show in Europe and Rest of the World. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues from the segment in Europe is pegged at $404 million, showing a 6.3% drop from the figure reported in the previous quarter. Further, the consensus estimate for revenues in the segment from the Rest of the World is pegged at $274 million, showing a 6.2% decline from the reported figure in the last quarter.DENTSPLY SIRONA Inc. Price and Consensus  DENTSPLY SIRONA Inc. Price and Consensus | DENTSPLY SIRONA Inc. Quote Moreover, DENTSPLY has been performing unfavorably compared with the broader industry over the last year. The stock has gained 2.4% compared with the industry’s rally of 21.5%.However, DENTSPLY delivered a positive average earnings surprise of 0.93% in the trailing four quarters. In the previous quarter, the company reported earnings of 70 cents per share, topping the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4 cents. Earnings also rose 6.1% on a year-over-year basis.Why Dull Estimates for Ex Precious Metal Segment?Sales of the company’s precious-metal dental alloy products, which are used by third parties to construct crown and bridge materials, are subject to risks from fluctuations of precious metal prices.In the last quarter, revenues in Europe and Rest of the World at the Ex Precious Metal segment deteriorated on a sequential basis. In Europe, revenues declined 3.8% to $380 billion, while revenues in Rest of the World fell 0.4% to $258 million. The lackluster trend is likely to persist in the to-be-reported quarter as well.To avoid the impact of fluctuating prices, DENTSPLY reports net sales with and without precious metal content to show actual performance, independent of precious metal price volatility.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayConsistent Efforts to Achieve Operational Excellence: DENTSPLY is poised to become one of the best operators in the dental industry in terms of cost, quality and overall efficiency. Management consistently focuses on operational expenses and is contemplating to cut an additional $100 million of costs in 2018 and 2019. Apart from plans of expense control, the company intends to drive revenue synergies well beyond this target. We believe that the company’s cost-control efficiencies will be accretive to fourth-quarter results.View for Q4 and 2017: The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter revenues is pinned at $1.06 billion, indicating year-over-year growth of 6.05%.While reporting its third quarter, DENTSPLY narrowed its adjusted earnings per share guidance for 2017 to the range of $2.65 to $2.70 from the earlier $2.65 to $2.75. Further, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 earnings is pegged at $2.65, reflecting a year-over-year decline of 4.68%. However, for the fourth quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for adjusted earnings per share is 81 cents, showing year-over-year growth of 20.9%.Debt Dependence: DENTSPLY exited the third quarter with long-term debt of $1.6 billion. Large amounts of debt are likely to hamper the company’s prospects, in terms of product innovation.Plagued by the above headwinds, DENTSPLY is unlikely to deliver an earnings beat in fourth-quarter 2017.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively indicate earnings beat for DENTSPLY in this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: DENTSPLY has an Earnings ESP of +0.58%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.

1532,ABC,"AmerisourceBergen Corp.’s (ABC  -  Free Report) first-quarter fiscal 2018 results, scheduled for release on Feb 6, are expected to show steady growth in the pharmaceutical distribution segment, a significant contributor to revenues.Last quarter, the company posted a positive earnings surprise of 0.8%. AmerisourceBergen has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all of the preceding four quarters, the average beat being 4.6%. Let’s take a look at how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.AmerisourceBergen’s earnings in the preceding quarter surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate, courtesy of strong growth in Consulting Services, MWI Animal Health and World Courier businesses. Revenues rose almost 4.2% from the year-ago quarter.AmerisourceBergen Corporation (Holding Co) Price and EPS Surprise  AmerisourceBergen Corporation (Holding Co) Price and EPS Surprise | AmerisourceBergen Corporation (Holding Co) Quote The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Pharmaceutical Distribution segment stands at $38.74 billion for the quarter under review. This reflects an improvement of almost 5.9% from the year-ago quarter.Other Factors to ConsiderAmerisourceBergen’s Specialty Group performed impressively over the recent past with revenues rising 10.3% year over year in the last-reported quarter. The upside can be attributed to strong oncology product sales and solid performance by third-party logistics businesses. These factors are expected to play a pivotal role in boosting the segmental revenue in the first quarter as well.Other segment (this segment includes AmerisourceBergen Consulting Services, World Courier and MWI Veterinary Supply) also performed well in the last quarter. Revenues at the segment were up 12.2% on a year-over-year basis, driven by a record number of shipments in World Courier and strong volume and revenue growth at MWI. This segment is expected to maintain the performance in the quarter to be reported.Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for AmerisourceBergen’s first quarter earnings stands at $1.35 per share, down a penny year over year. The company expects EPS growth in the second half of fiscal 2018 to be much better than the first half, courtesy of benefits from the gradual onboarding of the Walgreens Rite Aid stores.The company also expects a slight rise in tax rate in fiscal 2018 as it had seen one-time benefits from R&D tax credits in fiscal 2017.Although generic inflation has been nominal, the rate of deflation is rising gradually. These factors, combined with an anticipated shift in product mix toward lower-margin and higher-priced specialty and branded drugs along with lack of generic inflation, will affect the company’s bottom line.The temporary slowdown in the PharMEDium segment is expected to mar AmerisourceBergen's bottom line in the first quarter. Notably, the company aims to boost its investments to enhance PharMEDium's quality assurance (QA) and quality control (QC) systems in terms of product quality and patient safety.

1533,ABC,"Diversified conglomerate, United Technologies Corporation (UTX  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2017 results before the opening bell on Jan 24. The company is likely to report higher revenues in the impending quarter owing to a favorable macroeconomic environment.Whether this can translate to bottom line growth of the company remains to be seen.Top-Line GrowthRevenues of the company are largely affected by spending in the U.S. military and commercial aviation industries. An increase in demand for the company’s products in these industries is likely to favorably impact its financial performance in the quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues of fourth quarter of 2017 for United Technologies is $15,400 million, significantly higher than reported revenues of $14,659 million in the prior-year quarter. Revenues across Otis, Pratt & Whitney and Aerospace Systems segments are expected to increase year over year to $3,112 million, $4,157 million and $3,858 million, respectively from $3,063 million, $3,992 million and $3,598 million.  In September 2017, United Technologies announced its plans to acquire Rockwell Collins, an Iowa-based avionics firm. Post the acquisition, United Technologies is expected to emerge as one of the world’s largest aircraft equipment manufacturers. The acquisition, slated to be completed by the third quarter of 2018, will provide a huge competitive advantage to the company and increase its bargaining power. The resultant operating synergies and lower operating costs will help it create complementary products that will help it serve evolving global customer needs.The merger is expected to be a huge boost to the company’s revenues and adjusted earnings per share after the first full year of combined operations with synergies to the tune of more than $500 million. Although the transaction will not have any direct impact on the earnings in the quarter, it is likely to attract similar lucrative deals for the company that in turn could augment overall revenues in the quarter.Other Key FactorsThe strong aftermarket business that sells spare parts and offers related services to keep the primary products running is also likely to record a healthy growth momentum with uptick in the economy. Furthermore, continued focus on four key priorities to fuel its growth momentum, namely flawless execution, innovation for growth, structural cost reduction and disciplined capital allocation is likely to translate to improved performance in the quarter.Our proven model does not conclusively show that United Technologies is likely to beat earnings this quarter as it does not possess the key components. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here as you will see below:Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is 0.00%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.United Technologies Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  United Technologies Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | United Technologies Corporation QuoteZacks Rank: United Technologies has a Zacks Rank #3. While this increases the predictive power of ESP, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise.Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing a negative estimate revisions momentum.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some companies that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Apple Inc.

1534,ABC,"Industrial goods manufacturer General Electric Company (GE  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2017 results before the opening bell on Jan 24. The company is likely to report lower industrial segment profit in the quarter owing to higher operating costs and charges from the legacy insurance business.Whether this will hurt the bottom line of the company remains to be seen.Higher ExpensesGE recently revealed that it expects to record $6.2 billion in the fourth quarter as charges from the legacy insurance business. Estimates reveal that GE will require capital contributions to the tune of $15 billion over seven years due to an increase in the life expectancy of the aging population. These long-term care policies usually date back to decades and have grossly underestimated projected healthcare costs and life spans, hurting the exchequer of companies like GE.This has severely impaired CEO John Flannery’s plans to script a turnaround in the company, with 2018 being termed as a “reset year”. Flannery had earlier disclosed his plans to focus on just three core segments — power, aviation and health-care equipment — and gradually exit all other businesses to plug the downtrend. The company is now seriously contemplating to spin off its operations to maximize shareholder returns.Amid this backdrop, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Industrial segment profit in the to-be-reported quarter is currently pegged at $4,954 million compared with year-ago profit of approximately $5,842 million. Almost all the sub-segments within the segment are likely to record leaner profits on a year-over-year basis except Healthcare. Total Industrial segment’s revenues are likely to be marginally up to $31,570 million from $31,236 million in the year-earlier quarter, although total corporate revenues are expected to be down to $32,693 million from $33,088 million.Other Key FactorsGE Power, one of the largest business segments of the company in terms of corporate revenues, has been a drag on earnings in the last few quarters as global demand waned with increasing popularity of renewable energy sources, overcapacity, lower utilization and fewer outages. Industry experts opine that the acquisition of Alstom’s assets for $10 billion in 2015 compounded the problems for GE, as it increased the employee count by approximately 65,000 with the addition of several field offices and manufacturing sites across the world. It seemed that GE had erred in its judgment about market demand and gambled on an industry that was on a decline.The company intends to lay off 12,000 employees across the globe in its GE Power business, as part of its corporate objective to lower operating costs and improve profitability. In addition, GE aims to reduce overhead costs by $2 billion in 2018, majority of which is likely to come from the beleaguered power segment that sells electrical generation equipment. The company further intends to sell assets worth $20 billion to improve its liquidity. At the same time, the company has halved its quarterly dividend to 12 cents per share — the first dividend cut since 2009 at the peak of the recession. For 2018, the dividend allocation will be $4.2 billion, down from more than 100% of free cash flow to 60-70% while the dividend yield will be trimmed from 4.7% to 2.3%.Despite all these efforts, GE’s fourth-quarter earnings are likely to be hit by high overall expenses. Our proven model does not conclusively show that GE is likely to beat earnings this quarter as it does not possess the key components. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here as you will see below:Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is 0.00% with both pegged at 28 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.General Electric Company Price and EPS Surprise  General Electric Company Price and EPS Surprise | General Electric Company QuoteZacks Rank: GE has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) or 5 going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing a negative estimate revisions momentum.   Stocks to ConsiderHere are some companies that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Apple Inc.

1536,ABC,"McKesson Corporation’s (MCK  -  Free Report) first-quarter fiscal 2019 earnings are scheduled to release on Jul 26, before the market opens. While the quarterly results are likely to drive growth at the core Distribution Solutions segment, its strategic initiatives might boost the bottom line.However, McKesson’s performance in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 lacked luster, with adjusted earnings of $3.49 per share missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Revenues came in at $51.63 billion, slightly below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $51.64 billion but increased 4% at constant currency (cc).The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter revenues stands at $53 billion, reflecting year-over-year growth of 3.9%. The same for earnings is pegged at $2.78, mirroring a year-over-year improvement of 13%.Notably, McKesson has delivered a positive average earnings surprise of 5.2% in the trailing four quarters.Let’s delve deeper.McKesson Corporation Price and EPS Surprise McKesson Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | McKesson Corporation QuoteDistribution Solutions to Drive RevenuesDistribution Solutionsis one of McKesson’s key segments, which is engaged in the distribution of branded and generic pharmaceutical drugs along with other healthcare-related products.In the last reported quarter, the segment was the sole contributor to the company’s worldwide revenues. Total sales from the segment totaled $51.63 billion, up 5% at cc. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fiscal first quarter revenues is pegged at $52.37 billion, reflecting a 1.9% rise from the prior-year quarter.Coming to the geographical analysis of Distribution Solutions, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for North America Pharmaceutical Distribution and Services revenues stands at $44.09 billion, up 2.5% from the year-ago quarter. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, revenues from North America Pharmaceutical Distribution and Services summed $42.73 billion, up 5.1% from a year ago.Strong Player in the Distribution MarketMcKesson is a major player in the pharmaceutical and medical supplies distribution market. Despite weak pricing trends and customer consolidation, the company’s distribution solutions segment has consistently performed well in fiscal 2018. We expect the trend to continue in the quarter to be reported as well.Notably, this Distribution Solutions segment caters to a wide range of customers and businesses. It stands to benefit from increased generic utilization, inflation in generics driven by several patent expirations in the next few years, and an aging population.At the end of fiscal 2018, revenues at this unit grew significantly and contributed to the company’s total revenues. This upside was driven by increase in market share and strategic acquisitions.Upbeat View/GuidanceMcKesson declared preliminary results for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 in June. The company projects adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $2.85-$2.95 in the quarter to be reported.Furthermore, the company reaffirmed its fiscal 2019 guidance. McKesson expects adjusted earnings per share to be in the $13.00-$13.80 band. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $13.33, which lies within the guidance. Per management, the fiscal 2019 outlook represents mid- to high-single digit percentage growth year over year, indicating stable market conditions.Free cash flow is expected at around $3 billion. The guidance projects full-year adjusted tax rate in the range of 21-23%, which may vary from quarter to quarter (read more: McKesson Issues Strong Preliminary Results for Q1).Earnings WhispersPer our proven model, a stock needs to have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the fiscal first quarter.

1537,ABC,"Varian Medical Systems Inc. (VAR  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter fiscal 2018 earnings on Jul 25, after the market closes. Favorable revenue opportunity from its Oncology and Imaging Component products, growing adoption of Proton Therapy and strong overseas presence are likely to drive the company’s earnings in the to-be-reported quarter.In the last reported quarter, the company’s adjusted earnings came in at $1.15 per share, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.06. The metric also improved 27.8% on a year-over-year basis. Revenues of $729.9 million outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $659.6 million.Currently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter revenues stands at $666.3 million, reflecting a rise of 0.6%. The same for adjusted earnings is pegged at a penny per share, mirroring a 3.9% decline.Let’s delve deeper to find out the factors that are likely to impact Varian Medical’s upcoming quarterly results.Varian Medical Systems, Inc. Price and Consensus Varian Medical Systems, Inc. Price and Consensus | Varian Medical Systems, Inc. QuoteOncology to Boost GrowthWe are upbeat about Varian Medical’s oncology business that accounted for around 95.6% of the company’s total revenues in the second quarter. In the said quarter, oncology revenues totaled $698 million, up 6% at cc on a year-over-year basis.Notably, Varian Medical’s solid performance in the Oncology business, margin expansion and the launch of Halcyon radiotherapy treatment system have been the key highlights of the fiscal third quarter. Moreover, the company has been addressing the tier 1 and mid-tier markets through its Edge, Truebeam and VitalBeam products and winning international contracts in the oncology space.Varian Medical also inked an AUD 1.6 billion deal to acquire Sirtex, an Australian-based company, which is focused on interventional oncology therapies. This latest agreement expanded Varian Medical's addressable market into interventional oncology.Per management, Varian Medical leverages its capabilities in treatment planning and delivery, image guidance, processing, oncology practice management software and radiation safety unit on Sirtex's interventional oncology platform. We expect this buyout to be accretive to the company’s third-quarter results.In Varian 360 Oncology care management platform, Varian Medicalacquired Evinance Innovation — a small, privately-held Montreal-based company specializing in clinical decision support software — earlier this year.Streak of Other Favorable DevelopmentsOn Jun 19, Varian Medical announced the installation of a Varian ProBeam cyclotron at the proton beam therapy center at University College Hospitals London NHS Foundation Trust in London.In fact, the California-based provider of cancer care has already started consolidating its global foothold in providing proton therapy solutions (read more: Varian Medical's ProBeam Platform Gains Foothold in UK).

This will enable the company to increase its customer base in Brazil and across Latin America (read more: Varian Medical Merges With Brazil MOH to Fight Cancer).Meanwhile, in Korea, Varian Medical’s flagship HyperArc High Definition Radiotherapy (HDRT) will be used to treat patients with brain cancer. HyperArc is a high-definition radiotherapy technology, which provides an intracranial radiosurgery solution, by capitalizing on the unique capabilities of Varian Medical's TrueBeam and EDGE treatment systems. It is supported by the company’s Eclipse treatment planning software.On Apr 25, Varian Medical has signed an agreement with the Stockholm City Council for providing equipment and related services to the radiation therapy department of the New Karolinska Solna (NKS) hospital in Stockholm, Sweden with eight TrueBeam radiotherapy systems for advanced cancer treatment.Earnings WhispersPer our proven model, a stock needs to have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the fiscal third quarter.

1538,ABC,"Putting an end to speculations, Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report) has finally stepped into the high-potential pharmaceutical industry. In line with this, the online retail behemoth recently announced a definitive acquisition agreement with PillPack. Although the terms of the deal have been kept under wraps, a few market experts estimate the value of the transaction at $1 billion.This news was heavily cheered by investors, sending Amazon’s share price 2.5% higher on the day of the announcement.Does Amazon’s Entry Spell Doom for Pharmacies?Although Amazon’s entry into the pharmacy business was well speculated, it still came as a shocker for industry bigwigs. Let’s take a closer look at the reactions of some of the behemoths.Amazon.com, Inc. Price  Amazon.com, Inc. Price | Amazon.com, Inc. QuoteBeginning with, Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (WBA  -  Free Report), which has been basking in the glory of being added as the youngest member to the Dow Jones Industrial Average Index, saw a 9.9% decline in stock price on the day of the buyout announcement. The company also saw a rating downgrade by a number of analysts.Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. Price  Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. Price | Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. QuoteThe stocks of other big retailers like Rite Aid Corporation (RAD  -  Free Report) and CVS Health Corporation (CVS  -  Free Report) also slipped around 11.1% and 6.1% on the same day.CVS Health Corporation Price  CVS Health Corporation Price | CVS Health Corporation QuotePer reports, three of these bigwigs collectively lost about $12.8 billion in market value on the day.Rite Aid Corporation Price  Rite Aid Corporation Price | Rite Aid Corporation QuoteMajor drug distributors like Cardinal Health, Inc. (CAH  -  Free Report), AmerisourceBergen Corporation (ABC  -  Free Report) and McKesson Corporation (MCK  -  Free Report) also panicked, with stocks falling a respective 4.8%, 4.1% and 6.1%.How Rational is the Deal for Amazon?In an era where brick and mortar set ups are being challenged by online sellers, though Amazon’s entry into the prescription drug industry is welcome news for consumers, it is also fraught with challenges.Coming back to the buyout, PillPack is an online pharmacy that pre-sorts medications into different doses and handles both refills and renewals. It also holds pharmacy licenses in all 50 states and has URAC and VIPPS accreditation. It is an in-network pharmacy with most pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) along with major Medicare Part D plans.Per an article on STAT, the integration of PillPack will help Amazon become a major player in the $370-billion drug business.Some analysts believe that with PillPack, which is working with Medicare plans, Amazon will be able to see an increase in its Amazon Prime membership of the rapidly-growing age group of 65 and above. There are high chances that 100 million Prime subscribers with Amazon will choose the company for their prescription drug needs.However, the deal has come with its own set of challenges. Per an article published on PYMNTS.com, PillPack sources products from AmerisourceBergen and Walgreens Boots. Further, per the same article,  there were rumors in the recent past about Walgreens Boots’ plans to buy AmerisourceBergen, which might pit Walgreens Boots against Amazon in the space.PillPack’s in-network membership with Express Scripts is also subject to renewal at the end of July. It is being speculated that if Amazon appears to be a formidable threat to the PBMs they might start refraining from renewing the in-network memberships in future (per an article published on PYMNTS.com). With regard to this, Amazon had to let go of its 40% stake in Drugstore.com as PBMs denied to include Drugstore.com in their networks. This  eventually resulted in Drugstore.com exiting the prescription business (per an article published on AXIOS).How Bad is the News for Pharmaceutical Giants? ""You've got to keep reinventing. You'll have new competitors. You'll have new customers all around you.""Nothing could more aptly sum up this situation than this remark by Ginni Rometty, IBM CEO. The incumbent players in the drugstore industry don’t seem to be in a mood to give up and lose their turf. To counter competition, CVS Health, Walgreens Boots and others have started to add more digital and customer-friendly programs. These companies have incorporated mail order pharmacy models to their stores with same day/one day to two days delivery programs.Further, CVS Health’s deal with United States’ third-largest health insurance company, Aetna, will fortify its position in the industry.In a bid to ensure availability of specialty brand drugs, Walgreens Boots has tied up with Express Scripts and has announced plans to expand existing group purchasing efforts. Per reports, Walgreens Boots is also collaborating with a number of healthcare businesses, including health insurers like Humana and UnitedHealth Group.The company is also partnering with lab testing provider Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings to expand the range of health services at its stores.Further, some analysts believe those preferring cash payments are expected to opt more for Amazon’s pharmacy services. The percentage of this population is quite nominal. Moreover, patients with the need for immediate drugs will approach stores over waiting for online delivery.Considering these factors, major analysts believe there is enough scope left for these behemoths to maintain a competitive edge in the space.Summing UpAmazon’s entry has definitely created an upheaval in the prescription drug industry with major players struggling to keep afloat. However, in business, bankable human resource and strong financial position matter the most. And Amazon has an adequate amount of of both. So, the following quote from Neil Saunders, the managing director of GlobalData Retail, Reuters suitably sums up the current scenario — “Amazon’s acquisition of PillPack is a warning shot in what is about to become a major battle within the pharmacy space.”Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

1540,ABC,"Maintaining its streak of positive earnings surprises, AmerisourceBergen Corporation (ABC  -  Free Report) posted adjusted earnings of $1.94 per share in the second quarter of fiscal 2018, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 6% and improving 9.6% year over year.The upside can be attributed to strong growth in the Pharmaceutical Distribution segment and World Courier business.Revenues improved almost 10.5% to $41.03 billion in the reported quarter.

Operating income was $489.1 million, up 0.9% year over year.Pharmaceutical Distribution witnessed favorable results in the quarter, courtesy ofsolid expansion in revenues and gross profit, including the acquisition of H.D. Smith.However, lower sales in the PharMEDium and the operating loss in the Profarma unit partially offset growth. AmerisourceBergen Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  AmerisourceBergen Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | AmerisourceBergen Corporation Quote Other SegmentThis segment includes AmerisourceBergen Consulting Services (“ABCS”), World Courier and MWI Veterinary Supply.Revenues in the segment came in at $1.6 billion, up 12.6% year over year. Growth in the segment was driven by consolidation of the specialty joint venture in Brazil and revenues from MWI, ABCS's growth in its Canadian operations and World Courier business.However, operating income in the segment was $97.1 million in the quarter, down 6.3% year over year. The downside was primarily caused by lackluster performance at ABCS’s Lash Group.Margin AnalysisIn the quarter under review, AmerisourceBergen registered gross profit of $1.3 billion, up 9.2% on a year-over-year basis. As a percentage of revenues, gross margin was 2.8%, down 4 basis points (bps) from the prior-year quarter. Increase in gross profit in Pharmaceutical Distribution Services boosted the company’s margins in the second quarter.Operating expenses were $691.5 million, up 18.9% year over year.  The upside was caused by H.D.

Adjusted operating income growth is expected to be flat year over year.In ConclusionAmerisourceBergen ended the second quarter of fiscal 2018 on a solid note with strong growth in the Pharmaceutical Distribution Segment. AmerisourceBergen's strong guidance instills investors’ optimism on the stock. Further, joint venture in Brazil, strength in MWI unit, ABCS's growth in its Canadian operations and prospects in the World Courier business are key positives at the moment. Further, the recent takeover of H.D. Smith, the largest independent wholesaler in the United States, is also a positive.On the flip side, sluggishness in ABCS’s Lash Group is a concern. AmerisourceBergen faces headwinds, thanks to the slowdown in hepatitis C revenues and conversion of branded drugs to the lower price generics.Further, a temporary slowdown in PharMEDium's growth is expected to mar the company’s bottom line. In this regard, the company faced lower-than-expected production at PharMEDium's Memphis facility.Q1 Earnings of MedTech Majors at a GlanceA few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space, which reported solid earnings this season are, Baxter International Inc.

1542,ABC,"On Dec 11, we issued an updated research report on Cardinal Health, Inc. (CAH  -  Free Report). The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Cardinal Health follows an acquisition-driven strategy and focuses on investing in key businesses to gain traction and boost profits. In line with this, the company recently entered into an agreement to buy the radioactive diagnostic drug Lymphoseek from Navidea Biopharmaceuticals.We are also encouraged to note that Cardinal Health is pursuing growth via joint ventures and long-term supply agreements. The company entered a long-term agreement with Henry Schein, under which the latter purchased Cardinal Health’s medical supplies for physician practices. The collaboration is expected to drive Cardinal Health’s earnings over the long haul. Meanwhile, Cardinal Health's Pharmaceutical segment has been gaining on solid client retention, with the loss of only a few key customers like Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (WBA  -  Free Report) and Express Scripts Holding Company (ESRX  -  Free Report).Recently, Cordis, a Cardinal Health company, and Medinol announced the receipt of FDA approval of the EluNIR drug-eluting stent (DES) for treating narrowing of or blockage in coronary arteries. Cardinal Health also recently launched the Opioid Action Program.Cardinal Health’s share price movement over the last year has failed to impress. The stock has lost almost 18.3%, comparing unfavorably with the broader industry's gain of around 17.4%. Cardinal Health faces the risk of losing considerable business in case of loss of a major customer, which in turn will severely impair revenues.Also, Cardinal Health faces tough competition in each of its business segments. For instance, its pharmaceutical supply chain business faces competition from the likes of McKesson and AmerisourceBergen (ABC  -  Free Report) as well as several smaller medical-surgical distributors such as Henry Schein and Owens & Minor.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

1544,ABC,"The U.S. Medical Product industry has lately been a highly profitable investment space, courtesy of an ageing populace, changing market dynamics, robotic surgeries, big-data applications, upbeat consumer sentiment, abolition of medical-device taxes, R&D innovations and higher consolidation.Various reports claim that it is the largest Medical Device market in the world, raking in with over more than $180 billion in revenues.In view of these trends, the Medical-Products industry has returned 3.7% year to date, in stark contrast to the S&P 500’s loss of 0.3%. Meanwhile, the first-quarter earnings season has also taken center stage, with already 267 members of the elite S&P 500 index having reported financial numbers so far.Per the latest Earnings Preview, performances of these index participants indicate a 25.1% increase in total earnings on 10% higher revenues. The beat ratio has been impressive as well, with 76.8% companies surpassing bottom-line expectations and 73.8%, outperforming on the top line. The Medical sector(one of the 16 Zacks sectors) has delivered a strong performance. The sector is expected to rise 12.9% on 7% higher revenues.Given the above trends, it would be rather interesting to see how the major Medical Product companies are placed ahead of the reporting cycle. Let’s take a look at four major companies that are set to release results on May 2.Cerner Corporation’s (CERN  -  Free Report) first-quarter 2018 release is likely to show strong performance in the System Sales segment. Per management, the upside can be attributed to growth in licensed software. However, improvement in other segments should also lead to better results (read more: Can Higher System Sales Drive Cerner's Q1 Earnings?).Lately, the company witnessed a slew of developments in its Electronic Health Record (“EHR”) platform. The Cerner Millenium EHR has been chosen to be implemented through the new Cerner Integrated Behavioral Health deployment model by Texas-based The Menninger Clinic.For the first quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 59 cents, while the same for revenues is $1.34 billion, reflecting year-over-year growth of 6%.Cerner has an Earnings ESP of -0.77% and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Per the Zacks quantitative model, stocks with the advantageous combination of a solid Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 and a positive Earnings ESPhave higher chances of beating estimates.

1545,ABC,"AmerisourceBergen Corporation’s (ABC  -  Free Report) second-quarter fiscal 2018 results, scheduled for release on May 2, are expected to show steady growth in the Pharmaceutical Distribution segment, a significant contributor to revenues.In the last reported quarter, the company posted adjusted earnings of $1.55 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.35 and improving 14% year over year. The upside was attributed to strong growth in the company’s Pharmaceutical Distribution Segment and World Courier business. Revenues improved almost 6% to $40.47 billion in the previous quarter and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $40.37 billion.For the quarter to be reported, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $40.49 billion, reflecting a rise of 9% year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at $1.83, indicating an increase of 3.4% year over year.Let’s dig deeper to analyze how things are shaping up before the earnings announcements.Pharmaceutical Distribution to Boost Q2 ResultsPharmaceutical Distribution accounted for 96.2% of total revenues in the last quarter. Revenues in the segment were $38.94 billion, up 5.8% on a year-over-year basis. Operating income was $388.2 million, up 2.4% year over year.For the upcoming quarterly results, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Pharmaceutical Distribution segment is pegged at $38.88 billion. The figure reflects an increase of 9.5% from the year-ago figure.Strong organic growth rates in the U.S. pharmaceutical market, improving patient access to medical care, improved economic conditions and population demographics, introduction of new innovative drugs like hepatitis C drugs along with a consistent good brand-pricing environment should drive growth for AmerisourceBergen in the quarter to be reported.AmerisourceBergen Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  AmerisourceBergen Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | AmerisourceBergen Corporation QuoteMoreover, the company’s focus on specialty drugs bodes well. Per the IMS, pharmaceutical sales are estimated to grow approximately 7.1% annually over a five-year period through 2020, courtesy of strong demand, favorable pricing and new product introductions.The deals signed by AmerisourceBergen look encouraging, which are likely to boost the top line. The company entered into a strategic agreement with Walgreen Boots Alliance. The deal includes a 10-year pharmaceutical distribution contract, under which the company will distribute branded and generic pharmaceutical products to Walgreens.However, the segment is likely to be affected by lower-than-expected production at PharMEDium's Memphis 503B outsourcing facility. Notably, operations in the facility were voluntarily suspended by the company in the last quarter following a few inspections by the FDA.Other Factors to ConsiderGenerics & Product Launches to Drive Growth: We believe that AmerisourceBergen will benefit from generics growth in the long run. In the last quarter, AmerisourceBergen marked its 16th consecutive quarter with 10% or greater revenue growth in the business. Management confirmed that its strategic and focused effort is driving generic product volume growth to offset historic deflation rates.However, it's important to highlight that AmerisourceBergen will have about a 25% increase in quarterly interest expense beginning from the second quarter.Operational Efficiencies: The recent U.S. tax legislation has enhanced AmerisourceBergen’s ability to invest in business, innovate and deliver value to its shareholders. Over the long term, this enables AmerisourceBergen to boost its U.S. business.Recently, the company made strategic investments in IT systems to realize greater operational efficiency and increase operating leverage. This is likely to boost the company's results in the second quarter.In fact, AmerisourceBergen also announced its plans to roll out eight new IT systems and a new e-commerce platform at MWI. These should enhance the company’s results in the quarter to be reported.Guidance: Based upon the expectations from the recently legislated U.S. tax reform, AmerisourceBergen raised guidance for fiscal 2018. Notably, AmerisourceBergen’s strong guidance for fiscal 2018 indicates that the company expects to deliver solid results from the second quarter itself.The company expects adjusted earnings per share in the range of $6.45-$6.65, up from the previously range of $5.90-$6.15. Revenue growth for fiscal 2018 is expected in the range of 8-11%, up from the previous band of 7-9%.PharMEDium Slows Down: Recently, AmerisourceBergen received a grand jury subpoena from the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Western District of Tennessee for documents about its lab testing of a certain type of syringe made at its PharMEDium lab in Memphis, which is the company’s largest highly automated production facility. As a result of the subpoena, AmerisorceBergen suspended operations and recalled all of the products that had yet to expire. In fact, the FDA also visited this facility for the same reason. Sluggishness in this unit is likely to hamper the company’s specialty distribution segment in the quarter to be reported.In the last reported quarter, the segment's results were negatively impacted by PharMEDium, wherein the company had lower-than-expected revenues and profit contribution.Per management, because of the time and certain ongoing incremental expenses required to perform remedial measures, PharMEDium's contribution to adjusted EBIT and EPS in the second quarter will be lower than anticipated.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not show an earnings beat for AmerisourceBergen in the second quarter. This is because a stock needs to have a positive Earnings ESPand a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: AmerisourceBergen has an Earnings ESP of -1.55%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: AmerisourceBergen carries a Zacks Rank #3.Here are a few medical stocks worth considering as they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.The Cooper Companies, Inc.

1546,ABC,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put AmerisourceBergen Corporation (ABC  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, AmerisourceBergen has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of nearly 14.0, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 stands at about 20.0. If we focus on the long-term PE trend, AmerisourceBergen’s current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years. Moreover, the current level is fairly below the highs for this stock, suggesting it might be a good entry point.Further, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with the industry’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 19.4. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that AmerisourceBergen has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 13.4, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for AmerisourceBergen stock in the near term too.P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, AmerisourceBergen has a P/S ratio of about 0.1. This is significantly lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.3 right now. Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.If anything, ABC is in the lower end of its range in the time period from a P/S metric, suggesting some level of undervalued trading—at least compared to historical norms.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, AmerisourceBergen currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of A, putting it into the top 20% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes AmerisourceBergen a solid choice for value investors, and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too.For example, the PEG ratio for AmerisourceBergen is just 1.3, a level that is lower than the industry average of 1.8. The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock’s earnings growth rate. Additionally, its P/CF ratio (another great indicator of value) comes in at 10.9, which is far better than the industry average of 17.0. Clearly, ABC is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles.What About the Stock Overall?Though AmerisourceBergen might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of C and a Momentum score of B. This gives ABC a Zacks VGM score—or its overarching fundamental grade—of A. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have not been encouraging. The current fiscal quarter as well as the fiscal full year has seen zero estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to two lower.As a result, the current fiscal quarter consensus estimate has fallen by 2.7% in the past two months, while the fiscal full year estimate has inched lower by 0.5%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:AmerisourceBergen Corporation Price and Consensus  AmerisourceBergen Corporation Price and Consensus | AmerisourceBergen Corporation QuoteThis negative trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) despite strong value metrics and why we are looking for in-line performance from the company in the near term. Bottom LineAmerisourceBergen is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. Moreover, a strong industry rank (Top 21% out of more than 250 industries) further supports the growth potential of the stock.However, with a Zacks Rank #3, it is hard to get too excited about this company overall. In fact, over the past two years, the industry has underperformed the broader market, as you can see below:So, value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first, but once that happens, this stock could be a compelling pick.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.See This Ticker Free >>

1547,ABC,"President Donald Trump on Friday unveiled his plans of lowering drug prices, in keeping with promises he made in the run-up to the Presidential elections. Pharmaceutical companies and the broader industry had been anticipating that Trump would come down heavily on them, as he had long criticized drugmakers of “getting away with murder” by charging way too much for their products. However, these fears were dispelled as Trump’s proposal will actually not directly hamper the profitability of drug companies. Instead, the reforms are aimed at increasing competition for medicines, cutting list prices and reducing patients’ out-of-pocket costs. This pleasant surprise gave stocks of pharmaceutical companies a boost.Long-Standing CommittmentLowering drug prices was one of Trump’s presidential campaign promises. He had committed to take on the big drug companies, which was also supported by Trump’s Democrat opponent Hillary Clinton. Since then, Trump has time and again criticized drug manufactures and pharmaceutical companies for charging too much for their products. This had kept the pharmaceutical companies reeling under pressure for quite some time, as they had feared that Trump’s pharma plan could hurt their profits. The broader pharma sector SPDR S&P Pharmaceuticals (XPH) has declined 6.3% year to date. And the industry had feared further losses, apprehending harsh measures from Trump on Friday.Raising Competition on the AnvilThe twist in the tale came when Trump stressed on increasing competition for medicines. This was one of the highpoints of his speech on Friday. Framing his plan as the “most sweeping action in history to lower the price of prescription drugs for the American people” and describing it as “American Patients First,” he laid out a policy that intends to increase pharmaceutical competition and the power of negotiations while lowering patients’ out-of-pocket costs. Trump’s policy also aims at creating incentives to lower list prices of prescription drugs. The reforms certainly are a ray of hope for American patients for whom the rising cost of healthcare is a nagging concern. The American Patients First plan will have both immediate actions as well as future opportunities for both lowering out-of-pocket costs faced by patients and reducing drug prices. Interestingly, Trump refrained from raising direct Medicare price negotiations on Friday, although this was one of his agendas during his presidential campaign.Pharma Stocks Rally on Trump’s ReformsClearly, Trump’s American Patients First plan doesn’t seem to be a threat to pharmaceutical companies and their profits. In fact, it is very much in line with the financial interest of drugmakers and health insurers and will no way hamper their profits. These fears, which had often resulted in shares of pharma companies taking a hit in the last few months, finally saw them bouncing back on Friday. Although the sector declined initially on Friday, stocks started rallying by the time Trump had finished his speech. Shares of Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (REGN  -  Free Report) increased 6.2%. Also, shares of CVS Health Corporation (CVS  -  Free Report), Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK  -  Free Report), Pfizer Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report), and Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (WBA  -  Free Report) were up3.2%, 2.8%,1.3% and 0.3%, respectively. Merck & Co has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Trump Spares DrugmakersThe biggest reason behind this rally is that Trump’s plan actually doesn’t hurt U.S. pharmaceutical companies at all. In fact, the administration keeps in place, and in a few cases, extends the role of drug middlemen, who have been often been blamed for spiking drug costs. Trump’s plan calls for drug companies to display prices in ads and restrict “gag clauses” for pharmacists. This proposal comes because some pharmacies and pharmacy benefit managers (PBM) have contracts that donot allow pharmacists from letting patients know if a drug on the cash counter would be cheaper than if it was purchased usingtheir insurance.However, Trump’splan gives the companies new powers in Medicare Part D, the U.S. program under which seniors get drug coverage. This would allow Medicare to change the list of covered drugs midyear in order to push back against price hikes of some generic drugsthat donot actually have so much competition. This led to shares of healthcare service companies like McKesson Corporation (MCK  -  Free Report), Express Scripts Holding Company (ESRX  -  Free Report), AmerisourceBergen Corporation (ABC  -  Free Report) and Cardinal Health, Inc. (CAH  -  Free Report) rising 2%, 1.8%, 1.4% and 1%, respectively.Summing UpTrump’s American Patients First, which comes with a set of reforms, had sparked fears among pharmaceutical companies for quite some time. However, the fears seem to have subsided somewhat, as the new plan doesn’t hurt drugmakers and their profits. This saw investors’ confidence finally getting reinstated and pharma and biotech stocks rallying.   5 Medical Stocks to Buy NowZacks names 5 companies poised to ride a medical breakthrough that is targeting cures for leukemia, AIDS, muscular dystrophy, hemophilia, and other conditions.

1549,ABC,"Industrial goods manufacturer, Honeywell International Inc. (HON  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2017 results before the opening bell on Jan 26. The company is likely to report higher Aerospace segment revenues in the quarter owing to improved market dynamics.Whether this will benefit the bottom line of the company remains to be seen.Top-Line ExpansionWith a flexible yet disciplined focus on cost and productivity, Honeywell aims to increase its presence in high-growth regions. The company’s balanced mix of long- and short-cycle businesses along with decent organic growth are likely to lead to improved performance in the quarter. Population growth, urbanization and infrastructure development continue to create attractive opportunities across its entire portfolio. Additionally, the company is building a robust pipeline of new products by divesting non-core operations and focusing on core businesses.Honeywell's Aerospace segment develops innovative technologies designed to make aircraft safer and more fuel-efficient and accounts for the lion’s share of total revenues. Over the years, Honeywell has developed a rich expertise in the areas of aircraft component exchange and repairs. The company intends to leverage this strength to provide comprehensive repair and maintenance services to lower cost of ownership and increase the lifespan of aircraft components.The airline industry is also fiercely competitive and each player in the market strives to incorporate all possible options to reduce operating costs. Fuel consumption usually accounts for 20-40% of an airline’s operating costs and even a single-digit percentage improvement can reportedly save millions for an airline company.Amid this backdrop, the Zacks Consensus Estimate the Aerospace segment’s revenues in the to-be-reported quarter is currently pegged at $3,873 million, which is relatively higher than the year-ago tally of $3,666 million. The higher revenue expectations can be primarily attributed to an uptick in demand of Aerospace’s products and services by aircraft manufacturers, airlines and the U.S. military.Revenues from Performance Materials and Technologies segment are likely to be $2,866 million, up from $2,228 million. Total revenues for the company are expected to be $10,689 million compared with $9,985 million in the prior-year period.Other Key FactorsHoneywell remains susceptible to material price inflation, which in turn is expected to affect its operating profit and bottom-line growth for the fourth quarter. Further, high dependency on supply chain to scale production and adjusting delivery of long lead-time products during times of volatile demand remains matters of concern. High operating risks in one of the key ingredients of its business might reflect poorly on the upcoming quarterly results.Given its international presence, the company often faces unfavorable foreign currency movements, impacting its top-line growth. Any slowdown in the global economy, particularly after the Brexit referendum or the manufacturing industry as a whole, will have an adverse impact on its business and would affect earnings. A geopolitical impasse due to various conflicts and disruptions may further affect its international operations in key markets. In order to fend off competition, Honeywell has to continually develop and maintain competitive products by adding innovative features that differentiate its products and prevent commoditization. These increase R&D expenditure and have often resulted in margin contraction and reduced bottom-line growth.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Honeywell is likely to beat earnings this quarter as it does not possess the key components. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

1550,ABC,"Diversified industrial goods manufacturer 3M Company (MMM  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2017 results before the opening bell on Jan 25. A favorable macroeconomic environment is likely to boost the revenues for the company in the quarter.Whether this can translate into bottom-line growth remains to be seen.Top-Line ExpansionWith primary focus on organic growth, 3M has continually invested in infrastructure and commercialization capability. Moreover, substantial investments in R&D coupled with the ability to convert such high R&D spends into up-cycle market share gains and strong pricing powers determine the company’s success.In October 2017, the company decided to divest its Communication Markets business for $900 million in order to focus on its core businesses. Since 2012, 3M has done significant portfolio restructuring — divesting assets that no longer fit in its strategy and making newer investments in more lucrative markets. The objective of this endeavor is to improve customer relevance and productivity through a leaner operating structure.Such concerted efforts by the company to augment its leading position in the market are expected to favorably impact its revenues in the quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 3M’s fourth-quarter revenues is $7,878 million, significantly higher than reported revenues of $7,329 million in the prior-year quarter. Higher revenues are expected across all the segments of the company. The Industrial segment, which had grossed more than 33% of the company’s revenues in the third quarter of 2017, is expected to generate $2,682 million, higher than the reported figure of $2,524 million of the prior-year quarter.Safety and Graphics, Electronics and Energy, Health Care and Consumer segments are expected to generate revenues of $1,455 million, $1,260 million, $1,488 million and $1,135 million, respectively, up from $1,301 million, $1,208 million, $1,379 million and $1,094 million reported in the prior-year quarter.Other Key FactorsAt present, the company is focused on three key levers namely, portfolio management, investment in innovation and business transformation. For portfolio management, 3M intends to concentrate on its most profit-making and fastest-growing businesses. To this effect, the company has taken steps to prune its businesses from 40 to 24. In 2018, 3M plans to increase investments in research and development to $1.9 billion or about 6% of sales for continued focus on the second lever. The third lever is enabling the company to better serve customers with even more agility and efficiency.Moreover, 3M is standardizing its business processes through a new, global ERP system. The company expects these efforts to result in $500-$700 million in annual operational savings by 2020, and an additional $500 million through reduction in working capital requirements.Our proven model conclusively shows that 3M is likely to beat earnings this quarter as it possesses the key components.

The Government solutions segment is expected to generate revenues of $26.7 million compared with $23.4 million reported in the year-ago quarter.However, due to the introduction of Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in 2017, the company is expecting an adverse impact on its earnings in the impending quarterly results.Earnings WhispersOur proven model conclusively shows that KForce is likely to beat earnings this quarter as it possesses the key components.

1553,ABC,"Leading packaging and paper manufacturer International Paper Company (IP  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2017 results before the opening bell on Feb 1. The company is likely to report higher revenues in the quarter across most of the operating segments due to healthy growth dynamics.Whether this could result in higher earnings for the quarter remains to be seen.Top-Line ExpansionInternational Paper is continuing with its restructuring initiatives to transform itself into a core packaging company. The company is investing considerably to improve its North American containerboard mill system, enhance product quality and reduce manufacturing and delivery costs. These projects are expected to have a collective internal rate of return of 20%. At the same time, International Paper is divesting its non-core businesses to focus more resources on high-return capital projects in its core businesses that can drive additional earnings growth.Mergers and acquisitions also remain a key strategy for International Paper to strengthen its business in the long term. In North America, the company envisions a large opportunity within its Industrial Packaging business, which continues to generate the best margins in the industry. It is further taking initiatives to drive margin expansion across the business through inorganic growth.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues from the Industrial Packaging segment, which accounts for the lion’s share of total revenues, is currently pegged at $3,774 million, up from $3,559 million generated in fourth-quarter 2016. Revenues from Consumer Packaging segment are expected to be $483 million compared with $464 million in the prior-year quarter. Total corporate revenues for the quarter are likely to be $5,942 million, up from $5,381 million in the year-earlier quarter.Other Key FactorsInternational Paper has huge pension obligations for substantially all U.S. salaried employees hired prior to Jul 1, 2004 and largely all hourly and union employees regardless of the hire date. Pension plan assets are primarily made up of equity and fixed income investments. Fluctuations in actual equity market returns, changes in general interest rates and in the number of retirees are likely to increase pension costs and reduce its cash flow, thereby limiting its earnings growth potential.

These involved printed rewriteable memory labels paid through an up-front payment plus an earn-out based on the existing agreed-to royalty schedule. Recently, there has been a swift rise in demand for printed rewriteable memory labels by users, particularly in North America and Europe. This is due to the myriad advantages that the product offers over any other electronic verification solution. The attempt by Xerox to capitalize on this rising market demand may augment its revenues and strengthen its market position.Xerox is reprioritizing investments and accelerating its restructuring actions and services to improve revenues and margins. As part of the restructuring efforts, it has also decided to execute a three-year strategic transformation program which will target incremental savings of $600 million across all segments. When combined with savings from cost streamlining actions currently in process, Xerox is attempting to realize cumulative cost reduction of $2.4 billion over the next three years.The company also remains committed to its five-plank strategy that is centered on portfolio management, global growth, cost transformation, operational excellence and analytics. With sustained investments to expand geographical footprint and build its services capabilities in areas that provide significant customer value, Xerox expects to reap benefits in the long run.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Xerox’s fourth-quarter revenues is $2,645 million, slightly lower than reported revenues of $2,734 million in the prior-year quarter.Advancements in IT have resulted in the replacement of the traditional means of sending and storing information with the digital media. As a result, Xerox is grappling with decreased demand for paper-related systems and products while its attempts to leverage the business process outsourcing market failed to lend growth momentum.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Xerox is likely to beat earnings this quarter as it does not possess the key components.

1556,ABC,"Diversified electronics manufacturer Amphenol Corporation (APH  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2017 results before the opening bell on Jan 24. In the last reported quarter, the company’s adjusted earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 9 cents. Over the trailing four quarters, it delivered a positive average earnings surprise of 8.9%, beating estimates in each.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Key Factors in the QuarterAmphenol’s top-line growth is benefiting from improved end-market demand, new product rollouts and market share gains. Demand continues to be strong in automotive, industrial and military markets. The diversification in end markets, with consistent focus on technology innovation and customer support through all phases of the economic cycle has enabled the company to post solid results over the past few quarters. A sustained drive for geographic and market diversification has further helped Amphenol to expand its customer base and develop new applications.In addition, Amphenol remains encouraged by its expanding presence in the fast-growing commercial aerospace market and is well positioned to capitalize on the proliferation of electronics content in next-generation planes. These advanced electronic systems require new advanced technology interconnect solutions to enhance fuel efficiency and improve passenger experience, all of which create excellent opportunities for the company.Moreover, Amphenol generates solid cash flow, which allows management the opportunity to invest in product innovations, acquisitions and business development. Also, it has historically returned significant cash through a combination of share repurchases and dividend to reward shareholders with risk-adjusted returns. A balanced organic and inorganic growth model, a lean and flexible cost structure, and an agile and entrepreneurial management team is likely to translate into relatively higher revenues in the quarter.Amphenol also has bullish revenue and earnings expectations. The ongoing revolution in electronics has enabled the company to capitalize on the opportunities and strengthen its position in the market. It further expects to leverage on the solid growth potential of the acquired companies to drive robust performance in the future.For 2017, Amphenol expects sales in the range of $6,828 million to $6,868 million, representing a year-over-year increase of 9%. The company estimates adjusted earnings per share in the range of $3.19 to $3.21, an increase of 17-18% year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter revenues is currently pegged at $1,788 million.Earnings WhispersOur proven model conclusively shows that Amphenol is likely to beat earnings this quarter as it possesses the key components.

1557,ABC,"Rite Aid Corporation (RAD  -  Free Report) is progressing well toward the completion of its pending merger with the grocer, Albertsons Companies, Inc. The progress of the deal became evident, after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) made the previously filed registration statement on Form S-4 effective.Following this, Rite Aid is now urging its shareholders to vote in favor of the merger deal. Voting, regarding the proposed transaction, will be carried out in the Special Meeting of Rite Aid shareholders, which is scheduled for Aug 9, 2018. Rite Aid’s shareholders, with record as of Jun 22, 2018, are entitled to cast votes in connection with the proposed deal.Though Rite Aid’s shares haven’t witnessed much positive momentum lately, we believe that the deal, after the completion, can begin a new chapter to its story. Shares of Rite Aid have declined nearly 6.9% on Jun 26. However, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has surged 17.4% in the last three months, driven by optimism stemming from the completion of store sales to Walgreens (WBA  -  Free Report) and the aforementioned merger developments. The company has outperformed the industry’s increase of 6.9%.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The BackgroundRite Aid had agreed to merge with the largest grocer in the country, Albertsons, on Feb 18, 2018. The merger will not only help revive the distressed business of Rite Aid but also help in dispelling the fear of competition from Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report). Per the deal, Rite Aid’s shareholders have the choice to opt for Albertsons’ shares and cash, or only its shares.For every 10 Rite Aid shares, shareholders can get one Albertsons share and $1.83 in cash, or only 1.079 Albertsons shares. This will leave shareholders of Rite Aid with about 28-29.6% stake in the combined company, subject to the outcome of cash elections. Meanwhile, Albertsons’ shareholders will own a 70.4-72% stake in the combined company.The combined company is expected to generate annual revenues of about $83 billion. Further, the new entity anticipates delivering annual run-rate cost savings of $375 million in the next three years. Of these, the companies expect to realize nearly 60% of the cost synergies in the first two years after closing the transaction. Additionally, the companies anticipate identifying about $3.6 billion of potential revenue opportunities.The new company will operate about 4,900 locations, including 4,350 pharmacy counters and 320 clinics across 38 states and Washington D.C. It will serve more than 40 million customers per week. The companies’ plan to re-banner most of Albertsons’ pharmacies to Rite Aid Stores, following the completion of the transaction while Rite Aid will continue to operate its stand-alone pharmacies.The merger is approved by the boards of directors of both companies. Further, it is expected to be closed by the second half of calendar 2018, conditioned upon the receipt of approval from Rite Aid’s shareholders, and other regulatory and customary closing conditions.The drugstore industry, in general, has been witnessing increased consolidation lately. After the failed merger between Walgreens and Rite Aid, the industry has seen CVS Health Corp. (CVS  -  Free Report) enter a $69-billion deal to acquire Aetna, Inc. (AET  -  Free Report) in January 2018. While the CVS-Aetna deal is on track, Walgreens’ bid to buy AmerisourceBergen Corp. (ABC  -  Free Report) seems to have cooled off in the early stages.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

1558,ABC,"With a market capitalization of approximately $20.26 billion, AmerisourceBergen Corporation (ABC  -  Free Report) has been benefiting from consistent solid organic revenue growth, World Courier Business, H.D. Smith acquisition and deal with Walgreens. A temporary PharMEDium slowdown, declining dollar, generic inflation, cutthroat competition in the niche space and lower-than-expected contribution from generic launches are denting growth.For fiscal 2018, AmerisourceBergen expects revenue growth in the range of 8-11% on a year-over-year basis. Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is currently pegged at $167.94 billion, reflecting an increase of 9.7% year over year.The company expects adjusted earnings per share in the range of $6.45-$6.65 for fiscal 2018. Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is currently pegged at $6.46 per share, which falls within the guidance.However, the fiscal 2018 earnings estimates declined 0.3% in the last two months. Buoyed by the above mixed trends, the stock has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).AmerisourceBergen Corporation Price and Consensus AmerisourceBergen Corporation Price and Consensus | AmerisourceBergen Corporation QuoteSo, here we take a quick look at the major factors that have been plaguing AmerisourceBergen, and also the brighter prospects that indicates of a near-term recovery.Factors Plaguing AmerisourceBergenAmerisourceBergen has recently received a grand jury subpoena from the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Western District of Tennessee for documents about the testing of a certain type of syringe made at its PharMEDium lab in Memphis. Memphis is the company’s largest highly automated production facility.Consequently, AmerisorceBergen suspended operations and recalled all products from there that had yet to expire. Recently, the FDA also visited this facility for the same reason. Sluggishness in this unit is likely to hamper the company’s specialty distribution segment over the long haul.In the second quarter of fiscal 2018, the segment's results were negatively impacted by PharMEDium, with the company witnessing lower-than-expected revenues and profit contribution. Per management, contribution to adjusted EBIT and EPS in fiscal 2018 will be lower than anticipated due to the time and certain ongoing incremental expenses required to perform remedial measures,.Why Should You Hold?Despite adversities in PharMEDium, AmerisourceBergen’s World Courier unit is likely to be the key driver of revenues. The unit is a global leader in specialty logistics that designs and executes world-class logistics processes.Per management, World Courier’s position as the leader in global specialty logistics services propelled volume growth and overall performance for the company in the last couple of quarters as well.Recently, the company announced the designation of its flagship World Courier unit as the first logistics company to obtain global Good Distribution Practices (GDP) certification against three major standards.The business posted impressive results in the second quarter of fiscal 2018. At the end of the quarter, World Courier’s company-owned offices were spread across more than 50 countries, with 14 investigational drug depots located in emerging markets worldwide. Solid volume growth and expanding operating margins have favored World Courier unit in the quarter.Price PerformanceAmerisourceBergen outperformed its industry in a month's time. The company’s shares have gained 10.3% compared with the industry's rise of 5.1%. The current level is also higher than the S&P 500 index’s return of 1.7% . Key PicksA few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Genomic Health (GHDX  -  Free Report), Abiomed (ABMD  -  Free Report) and Stryker Corp. (SYK  -  Free Report).Genomic Health has an expected earnings growth rate of 187.5% for the current quarter. The stock sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

1559,ABC,"AmerisourceBergen Corporation’s (ABC  -  Free Report) board of directors has approved a 4% hike in cash dividend per share. The revised dividend of 38 cents will be paid on Dec 4, 2017 to shareholders of record as of Nov 20, 2017.Further, we believe that AmerisourceBergen will benefit from generics growth in the long run. We note that the company is well positioned to ensure that products will reach the market and that patients will have access to traditional and complex new therapies.  Strong organic growth rates in the U.S. pharmaceutical market, improving patient access to care, improved economic conditions and population demographics, introduction of new innovative drugs like hepatitis C drugs, and a persistent brand pricing environment should drive growth. Moreover, the company’s focus on specialty drugs bodes well.On the flip side, cutthroat competition in the niche space is an additional concern. AmerisourceBergen operates in a highly competitive pharmaceutical distribution and related health-care services market. The company’s primary competitors are national generic and regional distributors. The space is witnessing consolidation of customers and manufacturers, globalization and increasing quality along with regulatory challenges. The company also faces threats from manufacturers, chain drugstores, specialty distributors and packaging and health care technology companies.The company, based in Chesterbrook, PA, is one of the world’s largest pharmaceutical services companies, which focuses on providing drug distribution and related services to reduce health care costs and improve patient outcomes.Zacks Rank & Key PicksAmerisourceBergen currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked medical stocks are PetMed Express, Inc.

1561,ABC,"Q3 earnings season has taken center stage, with 272 S&P 500 members, which account for 64.2% of the index’s total market capitalization, having reported their numbers. Per the latest Earnings Preview, total earnings for these companies are up 8.7% from the same period last year on 6.7% higher revenues, with 75.7% beating earnings and 66.2% surpassing revenue estimates.With 134 S&P 500 members lined up to release their quarterly results this week, we are decidedly bullish on the equity market, which is gradually demonstrating an improvement sequentially. Needless to say, the ongoing week is a crucial one for this season as by the end of it we will have results from more than 80% of the S&P 500 bigwigs.Medical, one of the broader sectors among the 16 Zacks sectors, is expected to put up an impressive show this quarter. For the third quarter, the expected earnings growth rate for the sector is 5.2% on 4.8% revenue growth. In comparison, the reported earnings growth rate from the second-quarter 2017 was quite impressive at 7% on 4.4% revenue growth.Let us take a look at the major factors that are likely to influence the earnings results of MedTech companies within the broader Medical universe.Factors Influencing MedTech in Q3Hurricanes Wreak Havoc Various reports suggest that hurricanes at the end of the third quarter are likely to mar revenues and earnings of several MedTech companies, primarily in Florida, Texas and Puerto Rico. MedTech major Ecolab (ECL  -  Free Report) expects the impact of the hurricanes on full-year sales and costs to be approximately 8 cents per share. In fact, Medtronic (MDT  -  Free Report) acknowledged the impact of Hurricane Maria on its quarterly metrics. The company expects an almost $250 million impact on revenues and earnings.Apart from the natural factors, a rise in unemployment (though short lived) and decline in consumer income, coupled with increasing aggregate spending, are likely to deal a heavy blow to MedTech numbers.Political ConundrumWhile the overall investment world has been gaining prominence, investors in the MedTech industry are unfortunately seeing a reverse trend. Stocks tumbled and things got riskier when the Graham-Cassidy bill to retract Obamacare failed to gain support again. And, President Trump’s latest executive order has already become a serious threat to the healthcare community at large.In this regard, let’s not forget the tax-reform pledges that Trump has taken to abolish the infamous 2.3% medical device sales tax. Although investor confidence trends upwards with the hope of ‘enactment of new tax reforms,' we believe the market has not got a whiff of it due to the lack of favorable developments on the regulatory front.Favorable Consumer Behavior Despite the political issues in the healthcare space, the change in consumer demand and market dynamics led to a dramatic transformation in the entire U.S. healthcare system over the last couple of years. This is evident from the growing prevalence of minimally-invasive surgeries, rising demand for liquid biopsy tests, use of IT for ensuring quick and improved patient care along with the shift of the payment system to a value-based model.Let’s take a look at the major Medical Product stocks slated to release their quarterly reports on Nov 2:Becton, Dickinson and Company (BDX  -  Free Report)Becton, Dickinson is scheduled to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results before the opening bell.For fiscal 2017, revenues are anticipated to increase 4.5% to 5.0%. Looking at quarterly estimates, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the BD Medical segment is at $2.105 billion for the fourth quarter, signifying sequential growth of 2.8%. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Medical Surgical Systems is pegged at $908 million, up 4.4% from last quarter's reported number.The company’s innovative product pipeline is a key catalyst in our view. A plethora of regulatory approvals in the United States and international markets are helping the company to rapidly expand its product portfolio.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment stands at $38.34 billion. This reflects an improvement of almost 6.5% from the year-ago quarter.On the flipside, although generic inflation has been nominal, the rate of deflation is rising gradually. Furthermore, an anticipated shift in product mix toward lower-margin and higher-priced specialty and branded drugs will affect the company’s bottom line (read more: AmerisourceBergen Q4 Earnings: Will it Disappoint?).Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for AmerisourceBergen’s earnings stands at $1.32 per share, up 1.8% year-over-year.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment’s revenues stands at $47.4 million, up 6% from the year-ago reported number. The company’s strong focus on High Flow Nasal Cannula Therapy (HFNCT) is likely to lend it a competitive edge in the niche space.Solid growth in the preloaded anti-microbial and anti-thrombogenic VPS PICCs platform is likely to strengthen the vascular platform. In the surgical segment, new products like EFx and Ae05 products fortify the company’s foothold.

1562,ABC,"On Oct 3, we issued an updated research report on Chesterbrook, PA-based AmerisourceBergen Corporation (ABC  -  Free Report) – one of the world’s largest pharmaceutical services companies. The company focuses on providing drug distribution and related services to reduce health care costs and improve patient outcome. The company currently has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).AmerisourceBergen had an unimpressive run on the bourse in the last three months, trading below the industry in terms of price performance. A glimpse at the price movement reveals that AmerisourceBergen’s shares have lost 13.0%, comparing unfavorably with the 3.7% gain of the industry it belongs to.The unfavorable performance was led by pricing pressure in the generic drug space and lackluster guidance for the full year. AmerisourceBergen expects fiscal 2017 revenue growth in the range of 5.5% to 6.5%, significantly lower than the previous range of 6.5% to 8% band. The company expects brand drug inflation in the range of 7% to 9%.AmerisourceBergen took over PharMEDium Healthcare Holdings for $2.58 billion back in 2015. We believe that the temporary slowdown in PharMEDium growth will mar AmerisourceBergen's bottom line in the coming quarters. Notably, the company aims to boost its investments to enhance PharMEDium's quality assurance (QA) and quality control (QC) systems in terms of product quality and patient safety. Although this lends the company a competitive advantage in the long haul, this might result in a bottom-line headwind for the business in fiscal 2017.Lackluster performance in the hepatitis C revenue segment is another concern. AmerisourceBergen witnessed a negative revenue impact from declining sales at the segment in the last reported second quarter. Revenues improved only 4% to $37.1 billion in the quarter, which might have been around 5.5% without the adverse impact of the hepatitis C segment.Cutthroat competition in the niche space is an additional concern. AmerisourceBergen operates in a highly competitive pharmaceutical distribution and related health care services market. The company’s primary competitors are national generic and regional distributors.The generic industry is witnessing consolidation of customers and manufacturers, globalization and increasing quality along with regulatory challenges. The company also faces competition from manufacturers, chain drugstores, specialty distributors and packaging and health care technology companies.Key PicksA few better-ranked medical stocks are IDEXX Laboratories, Inc (IDXX  -  Free Report), Luminex Corporation (LMNX  -  Free Report) and Masimo Corporation (MASI  -  Free Report), each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here.IDEXX Laboratories has a positive earnings surprise of 9.3% over the last four quarters.

1563,ABC,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put AmerisourceBergen Corporation (ABC  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, AmerisourceBergen has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 14.1, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 compares in at about 20.5. If we focus on the stock’s long-term PE trend, the current level puts AmerisourceBergen’s current PE ratio considerably below its midpoint (which is 18.9) over the past five years.Further, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with the industry’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 19.5. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that AmerisourceBergen has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 13.8, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for AmerisourceBergen’s stock in the near term too.  P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, AmerisourceBergen has a P/S ratio of about 0.1. This is significantly lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.2 right now. Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is somewhat below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.If anything, this suggests some level of undervalued trading—at least compared to historical norms.   Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, AmerisourceBergen currently has a Value Style Score of A, putting it into the top 20% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes ABC a solid choice for value investors, and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too.For example, the PEG ratio for AmerisourceBergen is just 1.5, a level that is noticeably lower than the industry average of 2.2. The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock’s earnings growth rate. Additionally, its P/CF ratio (another great indicator of value) comes in at 10.9, which is considerably better than the industry average of 12.8. Clearly, ABC is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles.What About the Stock Overall?Though AmerisourceBergen might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of F and a Momentum score of D. This gives ABC a VGM score—or its overarching fundamental grade—of C. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best. The current quarter has seen five estimates go lower in the past sixty days, compared to none higher, while the full year estimate has seen six upward and one downward revisions in the same time period.This has had a noticeable impact on the consensus estimate, as the current quarter consensus estimate has fallen about 2.2% in the past two months, while the full year estimate has inched up 0.2%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:AmerisourceBergen Corporation (Holding Co) Price and Consensus  AmerisourceBergen Corporation (Holding Co) Price and Consensus | AmerisourceBergen Corporation (Holding Co) QuoteThis somewhat mixed trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and why we are looking for in-line performance from the company in the near term.Bottom LineAmerisourceBergen is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. However, with a sluggish industry rank (bottom 32% out of more than 250 industries) and a Zacks Rank #3, it is hard to get too excited about this company overall. In fact, over the past one year, the sector has clearly underperformed the broader market, as you can see below:So, value investors might want to wait for estimates, analyst sentiment and broader factors to turn favorable in this name first, but once that happen, this stock could be a compelling pick.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest Strategies It's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +18.8% from 2016 - Q1 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +157.0%, +128.0%, +97.8%, +94.7%, and +90.2% respectively.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - Q1 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 11X over. Maybe even more remarkable is the fact that we're willing to share their latest stocks with you without cost or obligation.See Them Free>>

1564,ABC,"AngioDynamics Inc. (ANGO  -  Free Report) is set to report first-quarter fiscal 2018 (ending Aug 31, 2017) results on Sep 28. Last quarter, the company reported earnings of 19 cents per share, which exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 16 cents.We note that on an average, AngioDynamics has delivered a positive earnings surprise of 23.74% in the last four quarters.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayAngioDynamics enjoys leading market share in several of its operating segments including angiographic products and thrombolytic catheters and products. The market served by the company is in excess of $1 billion and continues to grow.AngioDynamics’ broad array of products like AngioVac, BioFlo and NanoKnife significantly enhances market opportunities. Notably, the peripheral vascular (PV) sales business has also built a strong momentum for the company.For fiscal 2018, the company expects adjusted earnings per share in the band of 64 cents to 68 cents. The company projects fiscal 2018 revenues in the range of $352 million to $359 million. Furthermore, free cash flow is expected to be over $35 million. The earnings growth rate is expected to be higher than growth in sales, primarily because of cost curtailment initiatives.However, declining sales in the Oncology, Vascular Access, Non-BioFlo products and NanoKnife businesses may hurt quarterly sales.AngioDynamics, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  AngioDynamics, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | AngioDynamics, Inc. QuoteEarnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that AngioDynamics is likely to beat earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You may uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter. That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: AngioDynamics currently has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 16 cents.Zacks Rank: AngioDynamics carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, an ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 and 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revision momentum.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:  Aetna Inc (AET  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +2.78% and carries a Zacks Rank #2.

1566,ABC,"A month has gone by since the last earnings report for AmerisourceBergen Corporation (ABC  -  Free Report). Shares have lost about 8.7% in that time frame.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is ABC due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Recent EarningsMaintaining its streak of positive earnings surprises, AmerisourceBergen posted adjusted earnings of $1.94 per share in the second quarter of fiscal 2018, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 6% and improving 9.6% year over year.The upside can be attributed to strong growth in the Pharmaceutical Distribution segment and World Courier business.Revenues improved almost 10.5% to $41.03 billion in the reported quarter. The figure surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $40.48 billion.Segmental AnalysisPharmaceutical Distribution SegmentRevenues in the segment were $39.5 billion, up 10.4% on a year-over-year basis. Operating income was $489.1 million, up 0.9% year over year.Pharmaceutical Distribution witnessed favorable results in the quarter, courtesy of solid expansion in revenues and gross profit, including the acquisition of H.D. Smith.However, lower sales in the PharMEDium and the operating loss in the Profarma unit partially offset growth.Other SegmentThis segment includes AmerisourceBergen Consulting Services (“ABCS”), World Courier and MWI Veterinary Supply.Revenues in the segment came in at $1.6 billion, up 12.6% year over year. Growth in the segment was driven by consolidation of the specialty joint venture in Brazil and revenues from MWI, ABCS's growth in its Canadian operations and World Courier business.However, operating income in the segment was $97.1 million in the quarter, down 6.3% year over year. The downside was primarily caused by lackluster performance at ABCS’s Lash Group.Margin AnalysisIn the quarter under review, AmerisourceBergen registered gross profit of $1.3 billion, up 9.2% on a year-over-year basis. As a percentage of revenues, gross margin was 2.8%, down 4 basis points (bps) from the prior-year quarter. Increase in gross profit in Pharmaceutical Distribution Services boosted the company’s margins in the second quarter.Operating expenses were $691.5 million, up 18.9% year over year.  The upside was caused by H.D. Smith buyout and duplicate costs from the implementation of new information technology systems.AmerisourceBergen registered operating income of $586.3 million, up 0.4% year over year. As a percentage of revenues, operating margin contracted 15 bps to 1.4%.GuidanceFor fiscal 2018, AmerisourceBergen expects revenue growth in the range of 8-11% on a year-over-year basis. Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is currently pegged at $167.5 billion, up 9.4% year over year.      The company expects adjusted earnings per share in the range of $6.45-$6.65. Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is currently pegged at $6.54 per share, which falls within the guidance.  AmerisourceBergen expects adjusted operating expenses to increase in the range of 8-10%, up from the previous range of 6-8%. Adjusted operating income growth is expected to be flat year over year.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates. There have been six revisions lower for the current quarter.AmerisourceBergen Corporation Price and Consensus  AmerisourceBergen Corporation Price and Consensus | AmerisourceBergen Corporation QuoteVGM ScoresAt this time, ABC has an average Growth Score of C, though it is lagging a bit on the momentum front with a D. The stock was allocated a grade of A on the value side, putting it in the top quintile for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of B. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.Our style scores indicate that the stock is more suitable for value investors than growth investors.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. Notably, ABC has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.

1567,ABC,"AmerisourceBergen Corporation (ABC  -  Free Report) has underperformed the industry in a year's time. The company’s shares grew 1.8% compared with the industry’s rally of 8.9%.Also, sluggishness in the AmerisourceBergen Consulting Services (“ABCS”) segment is a concern. AmerisourceBergen continues to witness headwinds, thanks to the slowdown in hepatitis C revenues and conversion of branded drugs to the lower price generics. Further, a temporary slowdown in PharMEDium's growth is expected to mar the bottom line.Consequently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 adjusted earnings slipped 0.5% to $6.48 per share in the past two months. The company has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), which indicates expectations of underperformance in the near term.Thus, here we take a detailed analysis on the factors that have been plaguing AmerisourceBergen.What’s Plaguing AmerisourceBergen?Recently, AmerisourceBergen received a grand jury subpoena from the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Western District of Tennessee for documents about its lab testing of a certain type of syringe made in its PharMEDium lab in Memphis.The Memphis-based lab is the company’s largest highly-automated production facility. As a result of the subpoena, AmerisorceBergen suspended operations and recalled all of the products from the facility that had yet to expire. In fact, officials from FDA also visited this facility for the same reason, recently. Sluggishness in this unit is likely to hamper the company’s specialty distribution segment over the long haul.In the first quarter of fiscal 2018, the segment's results were marred by PharMEDium, wherein the company reportyed lower-than-expected revenues and profit contribution. Per management, PharMEDium's contribution to adjusted EBIT and EPS in fiscal 2018 will be lower than expected, due to certain ongoing incremental expenses.AmerisourceBergen operates in a highly-competitive pharmaceutical distribution and related health care services market. The company’s primary competitors include Cardinal Health, McKesson along with national generic distributors and regional distributors.Time to Offload?Considering these headwinds, investors might find it to be the right time to dump AmerisourceBergen.In this regard, our VGM Style Score model can turn out to be helpful. This is a comprehensive tool that helps investors screen winning stocks from the broader sectors. Further, the score highlights the determining elements in a stock that can drive it higher.Unfortunately, AmerisourceBergen has a VGM Style Score of D, indicating it as one of the worst performing stocks in the MedTech space, at least for now.In fact, our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), offer the best upside potential.Key PicksA few better-ranked players in the broader medical sector are Bio-Rad Laboratories (BIO  -  Free Report), Abaxis, Inc. (ABAX  -  Free Report) and Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (EW  -  Free Report).Bio-Rad Laboratories sports a Zacks Rank of #1. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.

The stock has a Zacks Rank of #2.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

1568,ABC,"Rite Aid Corporation (RAD  -  Free Report), following the completion of transferring stores to Walgreens (WBA  -  Free Report),  revealed that the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 has expired on Mar 28, 2018, satisfying one of the conditions for its merger with Albertsons Companies, Inc.Though Rite Aid shares did not react much to this announcement, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock declined 20.4% in the last three months. This marks an underperformance from the industry’s fall of 12%. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Rite Aid had agreed to merge with the country’s largest grocer, Albertsons Companies, in February 2018. The merger will not only help revive the distressed Rite Aid’s business but also aid in dispelling the fear of competition from Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report). Per the deal, Rite Aid shareholders have the choice to opt for Albertsons’ shares and cash or only the company’s shares.For every 10 Rite Aid shares, shareholders can get one Albertsons share and $1.83 in cash or 1.079 Albertsons shares. This will leave Rite Aid shareholders with about 28-29.6% stake in the combined company, subject to the outcome of the cash elections. Meanwhile, Albertsons’ shareholders will own a 70.4-72% stake in the combined company.The combined company is expected to generate annual revenues of about $83 billion. Further, the new entity anticipates delivering annual run-rate cost savings of $375 million in the next three years. Of these, the companies expect to realize nearly 60% of the cost synergies in the first two years after closing the transaction. Additionally, the companies anticipate identifying about $3.6 billion of potential revenue opportunities.The new company will operate about 4,900 locations including 4,350 pharmacy counters and 320 clinics, across 38 states and Washington D.C. The company will serve more than 40 million customers per week. The companies plan to re-banner most of the Albertsons pharmacies to Rite Aid Stores following the completion of the transaction, while Rite Aid will continue to operate its stand-along pharmacies.The merger is also approved by the board of directors of both companies. Further, it is expected to be closed by the second half of calendar year 2018, conditioned upon receipt of approval from Rite Aid shareholders, and other regulatory and customary closing conditions.The drugstore industry in general has been witnessing increased consolidation lately. After the failed merger between Walgreens and Rite Aid, the industry has seen CVS Health Corp. (CVS  -  Free Report) enter a deal to acquire Aetna, Inc. (AET  -  Free Report) in January 2018.  Additionally, Walgreens has bid to buy AmerisourceBergen Corp. (ABC  -  Free Report), a leading drug wholesale company.Can Hackers Put Money INTO Your Portfolio?Earlier this year, credit bureau Equifax announced a massive data breach affecting 2 out of every 3 Americans.

1571,ABC,"The tax-repeal saga has been dominating the headlines of the U.S. MedTech industry since the last couple of months.While numerous reports are expecting it to be a solid buffer, the Congressional Budget Office (“CBO”) forecasts rather ominous implications of this tax relief on the nation’s economy.The ‘Alarming’ CBO ReportA report published by the CBO projects that the two-year tax suspension will cost the federal government about $3.7 billion during that period, and $310 billion to federal-budget deficits over the next decade. In this regard, the federal budget deficit has already reached $228 billion in the first three months of the current fiscal, almost $18 billion more than the deficit in the first quarter of fiscal 2017.However, Republicans spurned these concerns with the belief that tax cuts will drive faster growth.In fact, the right-wing conservatives are of the opinion that America’s unparalleled purchasing power, massive demand for medical services, and opportunity for innovation has lent it a competitive edge in the global space.So, despite the CBO’s assumptions, continuous technological and strategic advancements, especially in the MedTech sector, should help the nation in increasing its gross domestic production (GDP), and minimize the deficits over the long haul.In this regard, per Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services report published by Advisory Board, U.S. health care spending is estimated to reach approximately $5.5 trillion by 2025, representing 19.9% of GDP.Consequently, here we take a sneak peek on how the U.S. MedTech space is gearing up to counter the unsettling CBO projections, and which are the major companies that would lead the process.MedTech Advancements to Minimize DeficitsBig-Data Trends to Aid MedTechThe future of MedTech is embedded in artificial intelligence, virtual reality and Big data.Apart from GoogleFlu and HealthMap, the latest trend of Electronic Health Records has been gaining prominence in the Big-data market. A research report by Fact.MR expects the global big data analytics in healthcare market to multiply at a double-digit CAGR by 2026. In fact, companies banking on big-data analytics would save over 25% in annual costs in the upcoming years.Of the major companies, Cerner Corporation (CERN  -  Free Report) has been hogging the limelight, courtesy of its consistent efforts to digitize electronic health record systems.Increasing ConsolidationM&A activity in the MedTech space surged 50% in 2017, increasing the value of aggregate M&A to more than $200 billion (Data provided by BioSpectrum Asia).The latest trend of rising consolidation in the healthcare space has led to a reduction in the number of players, greater market concentration and reduced competition. It has also fortified the industry against new entrants. The companies will benefit from higher market cap, which will put them in a position to negotiate with suppliers.The latest buyout of Express Scripts by Cigna ($67-billion deal), which follows just three months after drug chain and pharmacy giant CVS Health Corp announced plans to acquire the nation's third-largest health insurer Aetna ($69 billion-deal), deserve a mention.Market DynamicsThe MedTech industry has been favored by a massive change in consumer behavior lately. This along with changing market dynamics led to a dramatic transformation of the U.S. healthcare system over the last couple of years.This is evident from the rise in minimally-invasive surgeries, higher demand for liquid biopsy tests and use of IT for quick and improved patient care along with the shift of the payment system to a value-based model.3 ‘Value’ Stocks to Gain TractionWhen the market is full of mixed sentiments, value investment trick can easily work. This is because most of the fundamentally good stocks are often found lying within the discounted range due to the volatility.Thus, here we take a look at three stocks that are currently available at a cheaper rate and have been gaining prominence in the MedTech markets on the back of above trends. Notably, these stocks have Value Score of A or B.Apart from having favorable price performances, these stocks have a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and have witnessed strong margin expansion in the last couple of years. Although no single metric can determine the profitability of a business accurately, investors can count on net margin to get a fair idea of the amount of profit a company is making.AmerisourceBergen Corporation (ABC  -  Free Report)The stock has a Value Score of B and returned 86.8% in the last five years, much higher than the S&P 500’s growth of 12.7%.Consolidation has been one of the major catalysts behind the company’s growth. In January 2018, AmerisourceBergen declared that it has completed the acquisition of H.D. Smith, the largest independent wholesaler in the United States, for $815 million in cash. The deal was initiated back in November 2017. Coming to net margins, the company’s net margin has expanded significantly in the last couple of years. The company invested nearly $1 billion in capital expenditures to create operational efficiencies, leverage scale and provide best-in-class customer service in the last two years alone.The company is now well positioned to realize long-term benefits from these. Further, the recent U.S. tax legislation enhances the company’s ability to invest in business, innovate and deliver value to its shareholders. Fresenius Medical Care (FMS  -  Free Report)Fresenius Medical has had a solid price performance over the past year, returning 25.9%. The stock has a Value Score of B.Acquisitions have been a key catalyst for the company. In an initiative to boost its long-term strategy or the ‘Growth-Strategy 2020’, Fresenius Medical has signed an agreement to acquire all outstanding shares of NxStage Medical for $30 a share.  The transaction has been valued at $2 billion and is subject to close by 2018, following approval from NxStage stockholders and other customary conditions.Fresenius Medical expects the buyout to prove accretive to earnings within three years from deal closure. Furthermore, the deal is anticipated to provide annual pre-tax cost savings of $80-$100 million over the next three to five years. The company also expects integration costs of about $150 million over the next three years from the time of announcement in 2017.Fresenius Medical’s expanding net-margin trends hold promise. Further, the company has launched the second phase of its Global Efficiency Program (GEP II) in 2018. The program’s aim is to identify and realize further efficiency potential and enhance the overall competitiveness of Fresenius Medical. Starting in 2018, GEP II targets to achieve sustained cost improvements of EUR 100 to 200 million per annum by 2020. Olympus Corp. (OCPNY  -  Free Report)The stock has a Value Score of B and returned 9.9% in the last year.Headquartered in Tokyo, Japan, Olympus manufactures and sells precision machineries and instruments worldwide. The company has a long-term expected earnings growth rate of 9.4% and holds considerable promise in the long haul.With solid growth in North America, the company’s net-margin trends have been solid in the last couple of years. The company is expected to witness strong growth in Japan and Europe, courtesy of VISERA ELITE II and impressive energy device performance.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

1573,ABC,"TransUnion (TRU  -  Free Report) is slated to report fourth-quarter 2017 results before the opening bell on Feb 13.Last quarter, the company reported revenues of $498 million, comfortably beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $474 million. TransUnion delivered an impressive average positive surprise of 10.3% in the trailing four quarters, beating estimates in each.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors at PlayTransUnion’s attractive business model with diversified revenue streams, significant operating leverage, low-capital requirements, and strong and stable cash flow have produced consistent operating results in the recent times.During the quarter, the acquisition of Factor Trust — one of the fastest growing companies specializing in the field of alternative credit data, analytics and risk scoring information — was a strategic move by TransUnion. We anticipate the buyout to have a favorable impact on the company’s results.Top-Line ExpansionThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for TransUnion’s fourth-quarter revenues is $488 million, higher than reported revenues of $436 million in the prior-year quarter. Higher revenues are expected across all the segments of the company.The U.S. Information Services segment — the largest revenue-generating segment of the company — is expected to generate $297 million, higher than the reported figure of $268 million in the prior-year quarter.Also, the International and Consumer Interactive segments are expected to generate revenues of $97 million and $105 million, respectively, up from $86 million and $97 million reported in the prior-year quarter.Higher consumer awareness of the risks of identity theft propelled by a greater frequency of cyber-attacks are driving demand in TransUnion’s Consumer Interactive segment.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that TransUnion is likely to beat earnings this quarter as it does not possess the key components. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here as you will see below:Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is -0.12%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.TransUnion Price and EPS Surprise TransUnion Price and EPS Surprise | TransUnion QuoteZacks Rank: TransUnion has a Zacks Rank #3. While this increases the predictive power of ESP, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise.Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing a negative estimate revisions momentum.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some companies that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Zendesk, Inc.

1574,ABC,"DaVita HealthCare Partners Inc. (DVA  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 13, after the market closes.In the third quarter, the company reported adjusted earnings of 81 cents per share, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 94 cents. Earnings deteriorated 14.7% on a year-over-year basis. Further, revenues in the last quarter improved 5.1% year over year to $3.92 billion, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.89 billion. However, the company reported an average negative earnings surprise of 1.9% in the trailing four quarters.Over the last year, shares of DaVita have outperformed the broader industry. The stock has returned 13.3% against the industry’s decline of 5.5%. DaVita HealthCare Partners Inc. Price and Consensus  DaVita HealthCare Partners Inc. Price and Consensus | DaVita HealthCare Partners Inc. Quote Let’s take a look at how things are shaping up prior to the announcement.Factors to ConsiderAcquisition-driven Growth: Acquiring dialysis centers and businesses that own and operate similar centers as well as other ancillary services is DaVita’s preferred business strategy. These strategies have bolstered the company’s top line.In 2017, DaVita announced that HealthCare Partners, a unit within its medical group, has entered into a strategic partnership with Cigna, a global health insurance service company that offers health, dental, supplemental insurance and Medicare plans to individuals, families and businesses.While the acquisitions are expected to widen the company’s client base in the fourth quarter, the merger augmented its primary care and specialty physician services as well as hospital and other healthcare services.Overseas Growth: DaVita is steadily expanding in the international markets. In the past few years, the company has strengthened its position in the emerging and developing markets of Brazil, China, Colombia, Germany, India, Malaysia, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal and Saudi Arabia through strategic alliances as well as acquisitions of dialysis centers. These are expected to help DaVita deliver efficient patient care.View for Q4 and 2017: The company expects adjusted operating income in the Kidney Care segment in the range of $1.57-$1.6 billion compared with the previous range of $1.565-$1.625 billion. The range has been tightened as hurricanes are likely to have negative impact on earnings in the fourth quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter is pinned at $3.9 billion, reflecting year-over-year growth of 4.9%. However, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 91 cents for adjusted earnings per share, shows year-over-year decline of 7.1% in growth.Consequently, management is not upbeat about earnings in the upcoming quarter.Labor Union Woes: In California, labor unions proposed a ballot initiative that is likely to alter DaVita’s footprint in the state. If they proceed with the initiative, the company might have to incur significant onetime costs in 2018 to support their advocacy efforts. This is likely to dampen the company’s top-line growth in the fourth quarter.Debt Dependence: Debt refinancing continues to keep DaVita’s financial leverage at high levels. The company depends upon future borrowings to pay debt and fund other liquidity requirements. Additional debts in connection with the HealthCare Partners’ transaction have elevated the outstanding debt levels and are expected to increase borrowing costs.Plagued by the above headwinds, DaVita is unlikely to deliver an earnings beat in fourth-quarter.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not indicate earnings beat for DaVita HealthCare in this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: DaVita has an earnings ESP of -2.2%%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: DaVita carries a Zacks Rank #2. Nevertheless, an unfavorable Earnings ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.Stocks Worth a LookHere are a few medical stocks worth considering as they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.AmerisourceBergen (ABC  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +1.40% and a Zacks Rank #3.Centene (CNC  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.92% and sports a Zacks Rank #1.

1575,ABC,"The fourth-quarter earnings season has taken center stage, with 251 S&P 500 members having reported their numbers. The season has turned out to be favorable so far, especially on the revenue front. A sturdy revenue momentum was witnessed in the season, above-average proportion of positive surprises along with favorable revisions trend for the present and the upcoming quarters.Per the latest Earnings Preview, total earnings for the companies that have reported their results, are up 16% year over year on 10.5% higher revenues. Of the total companies, 80.5% beat earnings and 78.1% surpassed revenue estimates. With 92 S&P 500 members lined up to release their quarterly results this week, we are decidedly bullish on the equity market, which is gradually demonstrating a sequential improvement.Medical, one of the 16 Zacks sectors, is expected to fare impressively. For the fourth quarter, the expected earnings growth rate for the sector is 6.6% on 5.7% revenue growth. Let us take a look at the major factors that are likely to influence the earnings results of Medical Product companies within the broader Medical universe.Factors Influencing MedTech in Q4Tax BenefitsAs part of the tax overhaul, corporate tax rates have been slashed to 21% from 35%, providing a huge relief for all sectors. Needless to say, the medical device companies cheered the legislation as well.Further, the news of Congress delaying the 2.3% medical-device tax for another two years was a huge boost for industry players and investors. Manufacturers appreciate the delay as it is likely to favor the companies’ R&D activities.Favorable Consumer BehaviorDespite political issues in the healthcare space, the change in consumer demand and market dynamics led to a dramatic transformation in the entire U.S. healthcare system over the last couple of years. This is evident from the growing prevalence of minimally-invasive surgeries, rising demand for liquid biopsy tests, use of IT for ensuring quick and improved patient care along with the shift of the payment system to a value-based model.Let’s take a look at four major Medical Product stocks slated to release their quarterly reports on Feb 6:Becton, Dickinson and Company (BDX  -  Free Report)Becton, Dickinson is scheduled to report first-quarter fiscal 2018 results before the opening bell.Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter revenues is pegged at $3.05 billion, up 4.2% year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter earnings is $2.40, up 3% on a year-over-year basis.The quarter is expected to show sluggishness in BD Medical — one of the major revenue components. While this can majorly dampen earnings in the first quarter, an expected improvement in revenues in other segments will help the company generate solid results. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for BD Medical revenues is pegged at $2.03 billion. This indicates a decline of 3.9% from the year-ago quarter.The company’s innovative product pipeline is a key catalyst. A plethora of regulatory approvals in the United States and international markets are expanding the company’s product portfolio.

Meanwhile, the acquisition of PharMEDium enhanced the company’s ability to provide market-leading services and solutions to its health system customers, a segment that is playing an increasingly important role in the healthcare market in the United States.We believe that AmerisourceBergen will benefit from generics growth in the long run. The first quarter of fiscal 2018 marked the company’s 16th consecutive quarter with 10% or greater revenue growth for this part of its business. At the end of the first quarter, management confirmed that the company’s strategic and focused effort is driving generic product volume growth to offset historic deflation rates.Notably, the company is well-positioned to ensure that products reach the market and that patients can access traditional and complex new therapies across all sites of care. Strong organic growth rates in the U.S. pharmaceutical market, improving patient access to care, improved economic conditions and population demographics, introduction of new innovative drugs like hepatitis C drugs as well as a consistent brand pricing environment should drive growth.Also, the company’s World Courier business has been faring well. Notably, at the end of first-quarter fiscal 2018, World Courier’s company-owned offices were spread across in more than 50 countries, with 14 investigational drug depots located in emerging markets worldwide.Other Key PicksA few other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are Bio-Rad Laboratories (BIO  -  Free Report), athenahealth, Inc. (ATHN  -  Free Report) and PerkinElmer (PKI  -  Free Report).Bio-Rad Laboratories sports a Zacks Rank of 1. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.

1577,ABC,"On Nov 17, we issued an updated research report on Chesterbrook, PA-based AmerisourceBergen Corporation (ABC  -  Free Report), one of the world’s largest pharmaceutical services companies. The company focuses on providing drug distribution and related services to reduce health care costs and improve patient outcome.AmerisourceBergen had an unimpressive run on the bourse in the last three months, trading below the industry in terms of price performance. A glimpse at the price movement reveals that AmerisourceBergen’s shares have returned only 1.0% compared with the industry’s rally of 4.9%.The unfavorable performance was a result of pricing pressure in the generic drug space and lackluster guidance for the full year. AmerisourceBergen expects fiscal 2018 adjusted earnings per share for fiscal 2018 in the band of $5.90-$6.15. Revenue growth for is expected in the range of 7-9%.AmerisourceBergen expects adjusted operating expenses to increase in the range of 4-6%, while adjusted operating income growth is estimated in the band of 3-5%.Meanwhile, operating income growth at the pharmaceutical distribution services segment is projected in the range of 3-5%.AmerisourceBergen acquired PharMEDium Healthcare Holdings for $2.58 billion back in 2015. We believe that the temporary slowdown in PharMEDium growth will mar AmerisourceBergen's bottom line in the upcoming quarters. Notably, the company aims to boost investments to enhance PharMEDium's quality assurance (QA) and quality control (QC) systems in terms of product quality and patient safety. Although this lends the company a competitive advantage in the long haul, this might result in a bottom-line headwind in fiscal 2018.Lackluster performance in the hepatitis C revenue segment is another concern. Recently, AmerisourceBergen witnessed a negative revenue impact from declining sales in owing to the adverse impact of the hepatitis C segment.Cutthroat competition in the niche space is an additional concern. AmerisourceBergen operates in a highly competitive pharmaceutical distribution and related health care services market. The company’s primary competitors are national generic and regional distributors.The generic industry is witnessing consolidation of customers and manufacturers, globalization and increasing quality along with regulatory challenges. The company also faces competition from manufacturers, chain drugstores, specialty distributors and packaging and health care technology companies.Zacks Rank & Key PicksAmerisourceBergen carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1579,ABC,"AmerisourceBergen Corp.’s (ABC  -  Free Report) fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results, scheduled for release on Nov 2, are expected to show steady growth in pharmaceutical distribution segment, a significant contributor to revenues. While this could majorly drive fourth-quarter earnings, let us take a look at the broader factors that are expected to influence the quarterly release.AmerisourceBergen’s earnings in the preceding quarter surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate, courtesy of strong growth in Consulting Services, MWI Animal Health and World Courier businesses. Revenues rose almost 4.9% to $38.7 billion in the quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Pharmaceutical Distribution segment stands at $38.34 billion for the quarter under review. This reflects an improvement of almost 6.5% from the year-ago quarter.AmerisourceBergen Corporation (Holding Co) Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  AmerisourceBergen Corporation (Holding Co) Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | AmerisourceBergen Corporation (Holding Co) QuoteOther Factors to ConsiderMeanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for AmerisourceBergen’s earnings stands at $1.32 per share, up 1.8% year over year. The company should benefit from continued solid organic revenue growth, MWI and PharMedium acquisition. The consensus estimate for net revenues is pegged at $40.1 billion, signifying growth of 6.7% on a year-over-year basis.On the flipside, although generic inflation has been nominal, the rate of deflation is rising gradually. These factors, combined with an anticipated shift in product mix toward lower-margin and higher-priced specialty and branded drugs and lack of generic inflation, will affect the company’s bottom line.The temporary slowdown in the PharMEDium segment is expected to mar AmerisourceBergen's bottom line in the fourth quarter. Notably, the company aims to boost its investments to enhance PharMEDium's quality assurance (QA) and quality control (QC) systems in terms of product quality and patient safety. Although this lends the company a competitive edge, it might affect the bottom line in fourth-quarter fiscal 2017.However, our quantitative model does not conclusively show an earnings beat for AmerisourceBergen this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to be able to beat estimates. This is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP for AmerisourceBergen is -0.54%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: AmerisourceBergen currently carries a Zacks Rank #3.

Operating income was $388.2 million, up 2.4% year over year.However, the segment was affected by lower-than-expected production at PharMEDium's Memphis 503B outsourcing facility.

Revenues at the segment came in at $1.54 billion, up 11.6% year over year. Operating income in the segment was $100.3 million in the quarter, down 6.4% year over year.Despite strong performance in the World Courier unit, sluggishness in the ABCS dampened segmental growth in the first quarter.Margin DetailsIn the quarter under review, AmerisourceBergen registered gross profit of $1.1 billion, up 4.5% on a year-over-year basis. As a percentage of revenues, gross margin was 2.8%, down 4 basis points (bps) from the prior-year quarter.Operating expenses in first-quarter fiscal 2018 were $626 million, up 8% year over year.AmerisourceBergen registered operating income of $488.1 million, up 0.4% year over year.

Smith, the largest independent wholesaler in the United States, for $815 million in cash. The deal was initiated in November 2017.  The acquisition is expected to be slightly accretive to adjusted earnings per share in fiscal 2018. Further, the deal is expected to return 15 cents to adjusted earnings per share in fiscal year 2020. It is expected to strengthen the company’s support to community pharmacy and drive long-term, durable value.Our TakeAmerisourceBergen ended the first quarter of fiscal 2018 on a solid note, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate on both the counts. A strong guidance instills investor’s optimism on the stock. Strong performance in the Pharmaceutical Distribution Segment and World Courier business holds promise. The recent takeover of H.D. Smith, the largest independent wholesaler in the United States, is a positive.On the flip side, AmerisourceBergen faces headwinds, thanks to the slowdown in hepatitis C revenues and conversion of branded drugs to the lower price generics. Further, a temporary slowdown in PharMEDium's growth is expected to mar the company’s bottom line. Cutthroat competition in niche space adds to the company’s woes.Key PicksA few better-ranked stocks that reported impressive earnings this season are PetMed Express (PETS  -  Free Report), PerkinElmer (PKI  -  Free Report) and Accuray (ARAY  -  Free Report).

1581,ABC,"Information technology services provider Gartner, Inc. (IT  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2017 results before the opening bell on Feb 6. The company’s Research segment, which accounts for nearly 79% of total revenues, is likely to report higher revenues due to improved demand for its products. Whether this could result in higher earnings for the quarter remains to be seen.Top-Line ImprovementWith diligent execution of operational plans, Gartner has recorded double-digit growth in key metrics for more than a decade. In addition, this performance-driven firm has a strong cash flow and a healthy balance sheet position. It has a vast, untapped market opportunity worth an estimated $61 billion. The acquisition of CEB, an industry leader in providing best practice and talent management insights, further reinforces Gartner’s market strength. The combination of its analyst-driven, syndicated research and advisory services with CEB’s expertise is likely to provide a comprehensive and differentiated suite of services portfolio across the globe.Gartner has a recurring revenue stream with 75% of its total revenues generated through subscription and long-term contracts. In addition, the company has a large and diverse addressable market with low customer concentration that mitigates operating risks. Operating in an industry with low barriers to entry, Gartner has an integrated research and consulting team designed to best serve client needs. This enables it to have a competitive advantage against its rivals. Leveraging its intellectual capital, Gartner creates and distributes proprietary research content as broadly as possible via published reports, interactive tools, facilitated peer networking, briefings, consulting and advisory services, and events. These facilitate a steady improvement in the company’s revenue stream.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Research segment’s revenues is currently pegged at $721 million, up from $479 million reported in the year-ago quarter. Revenues from the Event segment are expected to be $169 million compared with reported revenues of $136 million in the year-earlier quarter. However, revenues from the Consulting segment are anticipated to be marginally down to $86 million from $88 million generated in the year-ago quarter.Other Key FactorsGartner is relatively immune to the vagaries of the market due to secular growth of information technology spend and its increasing market penetration rate. However, some of its services are cyclically sensitive. In addition, revenues from the federal government business are exposed to lengthy approval times and other austerity measures, which often increase operating risks. These factors undermine the long-term growth potential of the company to some extent.Our proven model conclusively shows that Gartner is likely to beat earnings this quarter as it possesses the key components. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is perfectly the case here as you will see below:Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and Zacks Consensus Estimate, is +0.62%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Gartner, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Gartner, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Gartner, Inc. QuoteZacks Rank: Gartner has a Zacks Rank #2. This increases the predictive power of ESP and makes us reasonably confident about an earnings surprise.Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing a negative estimate revisions momentum.Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are some other companies that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Zendesk, Inc. (ZEN  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +9.91% and a Zacks Rank #3.AmerisourceBergen Corporation (ABC  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +1.28% and a Zacks Rank #3.

1582,ABC,"Centene Corporation (CNC  -  Free Report) will release fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 6, before the market opens.Centene has been witnessing consistent growth in its membership over the past few quarters that has significantly boosted the top line.  This uptrend is expected to continue in the fourth quarter as well. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total membership is currently pegged at 12.2 billion, reflecting 7% year-over-year growth.Centene’s membership has been continuously increasing on the back of its solid Medicaid expansion. The company’s intention to continue with its public exchange business while other health insurers are exiting it, has boosted its Medicaid membership. The trend is expected to continue in the fourth quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Medicaid membership stands at 5.9 billion, reflecting year-over-year growth of 4%.In addition, Centene’s cost saving initiatives are likely to aid the margins in the fourth quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total general and administrative expense ratio is currently pegged at 0.10 compared with 9.00 in the third quarter of 2017.Other FactorsThe company’s growing Medicare beneficiaries are also likely to boost the top line in the fourth quarter.Centene expects its exchange business to perform well in the to-be-reported quarter, continuing the previous trend.We also expect Centene’s international business to boost the top line in the quarter.The company’s share repurchase programs intended to enhance shareholders’ value might impact margins positively by reducing the outstanding share count.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that Centene has the right combination of two key ingredients to beat estimates this quarter.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is +1.24%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate of 95 cents is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 94 cents. The positive ESP is a leading indicator of a likely earnings beat.

Shares have lost about 1.8% in that time frame, underperforming the market.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to the stock's next earnings release, or is it due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.AmerisourceBergen Beats on Q3 Earnings, Revenues LagAmerisourceBergen Corporation posted adjusted earnings of $1.43 per share in the third quarter of fiscal 2017, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.37 and increasing 4.4% on a year-over-year basis. The upside was primarily driven by strong growth in its Consulting Services, MWI Animal Health and World Courier businesses.Revenues improved almost 4.9% to $38.7 billion in the reported quarter. However, reported revenues were lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $39.3 billion.Revenue SegmentsPharmaceutical Distribution segment: In the reported quarter, revenues at the segment increased 4.7% to $37.0 billion. Within the segment, AmerisourceBergen Drug Corp. revenues were up 4.5%, primarily on the back of solid organic sales growth.The AmerisourceBergen Specialty Group unit in the segment performed impressively during the quarter, with revenues rising 10.3% year over year. The increase can be attributed to strong oncology product sales and solid performance by the third-party logistics business.Other segment: This segment includes AmerisourceBergen Consulting Services (ABCS), World Courier and MWI Veterinary Supply. Revenues at the segment came in at $1.7 billion, up 10.6% on a year-over-year basis.Operating PerformanceOperating expenses, as a percentage of revenues, in the third quarter were 2.35% compared with 1.57% in the year-ago quarter.Operating income, as a percentage of revenue, contracted 99 basis points (bps) to 0.44% in the quarter under review.As a percentage of revenues, gross profit declined 21 bps in the reported quarter on a year-over-year basis to 2.79%.GuidanceAmerisourceBergen expects fiscal 2017 revenue growth in the range of approximately 5%, significantly lower than the previously provided band of 5.5% to 6.5%.The company expects adjusted diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2017 in the band of $5.82 to $5.92, up from the previously provided $5.77 to $5.92.The company expects brand drug inflation in the range of 7% to 9%.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?

1584,ABC,"On Aug 11, we issued an updated research report on Chesterbrook, PA-based AmerisourceBergen Corporation (ABC  -  Free Report) – one of the world’s largest pharmaceutical services companies. The company focuses on providing drug distribution and related services to reduce health care costs and improve patient outcome. The company currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).AmerisourceBergen had an unimpressive run on the bourse over the last one month, trading below the industry in terms of price performance. A glimpse at the share price movement reveals that AmerisourceBergen’s shares has lost 13.9%, comparing unfavorably with the 5.4% decline of the broader industry.The unfavorable performance was led by pricing pressure in the generic drug space and lackluster guidance for the full year. AmerisourceBergen expects fiscal 2017 revenue growth in the range of 5.5% to 6.5%, significantly lower than the previous 6.5% to 8% band. The company expects brand drug inflation in the range of 7% to 9%.AmerisourceBergen took over PharMEDium Healthcare Holdings for $2.58 billion back in 2015. We believe that the temporary slowdown in PharMEDium growth will mar AmerisourceBergen's bottom line in the coming quarters. Notably, the company aims to boost its investments to enhance PharMEDium's QA and QC (quality assurance and quality control) systems in terms of product quality and patient safety. Although this lends AmerisourceBergen a competitive advantage over the long haul, this might result in a bottom-line headwind for the business in fiscal 2017.Lackluster performance in the hepatitis C revenue segment is another concern. In this regard, AmerisourceBergen witnessed a significant negative revenue impact from the declining sales at the segment in the second quarter. Revenues improved only 4% to $37.1 billion in the quarter, which might have been around 5.5% without the adverse impact of the hepatitis C segment.Cutthroat competition in the niche space is an added concern. AmerisourceBergen operates in a highly competitive pharmaceutical distribution and related health care services market. The company’s primary competitors include Cardinal Health (CAH  -  Free Report) and McKesson (MCK  -  Free Report) along with national generic and regional distributors.The generic industry is facing consolidation of customers and manufacturers, globalization and increasing quality along with regulatory challenges.

1585,ABC,"It’s been a tough week for generic drugmakers which saw their shares tumbling following the release of disappointing second quarter results from Israel-based Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited (TEVA  -  Free Report). Teva not only missed on earnings and revenue expectations, the company also slashed its 2017 outlook and announced a 75% cut in its dividend.Teva’s shares plunged 34.1% in the two trading sessions following the release of second quarter results reflecting concerns about the company’s business and debt burden which triggered a few analyst downgrades. Year-to-date (YTD), Teva has lost 43.2% of its value versus the 12% decline of its industryChallenging Generic Pricing EnvironmentA key reason for Teva’s dismal performance was generic pricing erosion. The sharp decline in generic drug prices, while a blessing for patients, is proving to be a major challenge for generic drugmakers as well as drug distributors.On its second quarter conference call, Teva said that the ongoing consolidation of customers has led to increasing price erosion and decreasing volume. The consolidation in the industry has increased the ability to negotiate lower prices for generic drugs. Moreover, the FDA is speeding up the approval of generic drugs which means more competition, increasing price cuts and decreasing volume. Generic drugs are basically cheaper versions of branded drugs which have gone off patent.Teva said that price erosion was around 6% in the second quarter and is expected to increase to high-single digits over the remainder of the year.And it’s not just Teva that was affected by the tough generic pricing environment in the U.S. AmerisourceBergen Corporation (ABC  -  Free Report), which reported a mixed quarter, saw its shares decline 11.4% over the two trading sessions following the release of third quarter fiscal 2017 results. The company mentioned that generic deflation remains a headwind and is yet to ease from the high single digits, where it's been for about three quarters. Generic deflation is expected to remain a headwind for the remainder of fiscal 2017 in the range of -7% to -9%. The situation may continue in fiscal 2018 as well.Cardinal Health, Inc. (CAH  -  Free Report) too mentioned that generic drugs pricing was a material headwind for the company’s Pharma Distribution business in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. The company expects generic deflation in mid-single digits in fiscal 2018.Stocks in FocusFollowing the release of Teva’s second quarter results, companies with a presence in the generics market saw their shares declining on concerns that these companies too will be affected by the generic drug pricing environment. Companies like Mylan NV (MYL  -  Free Report), down 10.8%), Lannett Company, Inc. (LCI  -  Free Report), 10.9% down), Perrigo Company plc (PRGO  -  Free Report), down 6.5%) and Impax Laboratories, Inc. , down 10.7%) were down over the last two trading sessions. This week, investors will be focused on Mylan’s second quarter results including the company’s take on the generic pricing situation. Impax and Perrigo will also be reporting results this week. While Mylan, Perrigo and Impax are all Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stocks, Lannett is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock.

With the FDA focusing on speeding up the generic drug approval process, the market will continue to witness additional competition and escalating generic price erosion.5 Trades Could Profit ""Big-League"" from Trump PoliciesIf the stocks above spark your interest, wait until you look into companies primed to make substantial gains from Washington's changing course.Today Zacks reveals 5 tickers that could benefit from new trends like streamlined drug approvals, tariffs, lower taxes, higher interest rates, and spending surges in defense and infrastructure.

1588,ABC,"AmerisourceBergen Corp. (ABC  -  Free Report) is set to report third-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Aug 3, before the opening bell.AmerisourceBergen’s track record has been quite impressive, with the company comfortably beating estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. In the last reported quarter, it delivered a positive earnings surprise of 3.51%, bringing the four-quarter average to 7.12%. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this release.Factors at PlayAmerisourceBergen’s pharmaceutical distribution segment continues to face headwinds in the form of contract renewals and lower generic inflation. The AmerisourceBergen Drug Corporation (“ABDC”) business is also being hurt by several factors, including accelerating deflation of generic drugs and lower contribution from generic launches.Although generic inflation has been nominal, the rate of deflation is rising gradually. These factors, combined with an anticipated shift in product mix toward lower-margin and higher-priced specialty and branded drugs and lack of generic inflation will adversely impact bottom line.However, the company renewed its relationship with the largest health systems customer and has been making persistent efforts to address the headwinds in the ABDC segment. This can boost the top line to some extent in the fiscal third quarter.The company’s estimate revision trend is mixed. For the current quarter, AmerisourceBergen saw one upward and downward estimate movement over the last one month. Current quarter estimate for earnings per share is pegged at $1.37.Also, the company is apprehensive about its earnings and revenue growth expectations for fiscal 2017 due to the uncertainty surrounding drug pricing trends. The company currently expects revenue growth in the range of 5.5% to 6.5%. The company expects adjusted diluted earnings per share in the range of $5.77 to $5.92. Meanwhile, AmerisourceBergen expects brand drug inflation in the range of 7% to 9%.AmerisourceBergen Corporation (Holding Co) Price and EPS Surprise  AmerisourceBergen Corporation (Holding Co) Price and EPS Surprise | AmerisourceBergen Corporation (Holding Co) QuoteEarnings WhispersOur quantitative model doesn’t point to an earnings beat this quarter.
