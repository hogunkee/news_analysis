2,ROP,"As General Electric (GE) steps up efforts to cut costs and boost profits, the industrials giant may sell a stake in the industrial software unit that served as a linchpin of ex-CEO Jeff Immelt's ""digital industrial"" vision but proved a drag on GE stock.XNew chief executive John Flannery is contemplating expanded partnerships and the possible sale of some equity in the unit, Reuters reported, citing people familiar with the business.Immelt — who bowed out of the Uber leadership race in a Sunday tweet — reportedly spent six years and poured more than $4 billion into efforts to infuse GE's core industrial businesses with technology. But revenue and returns fell short of expectations, and the Predix industrial software platform was dogged by problems this spring, according to Reuters.I have decided not to pursue a leadership position at Uber. I have immense respect for the company & founders — Travis, Garrett and Ryan.— Jeff Immelt (@JeffImmelt) August 27, 2017But those problems have now been fixed, the report added, and GE will focus on sales to existing customers in its energy, aviation and oil-and-gas businesses, while paring back sales efforts to new customers in other sectors.IBD'S TAKE: GE is a laggard among Dow stocks this year. But the Dow's top stock may be offering a new entry point.""Our resources will go to our fastest-selling markets,"" GE Digital Chief Executive Officer Bill Ruh told Reuters in an interview.Additionally, to help investors better understand Predix and avoid double-counting, GE has redefined digital revenue to shut out certain hardware sales and emphasize ""pure"" software sales.As a result, GE officials now anticipate $12 billion in digital revenue in 2020 vs. $15 billion earlier.The Predix platform — a cloud-based operating system for what GE calls the industrial internet — outfits turbines, jet engines wind farms and medical equipment with data-collecting sensors and then analyzes that data to analyze performance, cut costs or create new businesses for GE customers.GE estimates the market could be worth $225 billion market by 2020.Shares were unchanged at 24.49 in morning trade on the stock market today.

Earlier this week, Dollar General (DG) announced it will open 1,000 stores and two distribution centers.Steel was the day's top-performing industry group.

The study didn't meet its primary endpoint of improving retina damage (retinopathy), but it did bring a 53% reduction in the incidence of the lung disease severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and a 44% reduction in severe intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), a type of brain injury, compared with the control group.Shire said this warranted further testing.""For severe complications related to the lung and brain, there are no approved treatment options, and these data support our commitment to further investigate the potential systemic benefits of SHP607 in this population where the unmet patient need is substantial,"" Shire R&D head Philip Vickers said in a statement.Shire stock ended up 1.9% at 184.04 on the stock market today, regaining its 50-day line.Leerink analyst Jason Gerberry noted that Shire referred to the lung and brain results as ""clinically relevant"" rather than ""statistically significant,"" suggesting that the study was too small (121 infants total) to achieve significance for those endpoints. Shire will likely design its phase-three trial around this after consulting with the FDA, he wrote.""With Shire now focusing on BPD and brain injury as primary endpoints, we believe the drug, if successfully developed, would continue to be positioned as a prophylactic agent in extremely premature babies,"" Gerberry wrote in his research note. ""Shire estimates 60,000 babies are born prematurely globally with complications that include ROP (retinopathy of prematurity), BPD, and IVH,"" adding that he saw the market opportunity as largely unchanged.

14,ROP,"The managers of $2.1 billion Columbia Mid Cap Growth Fund spun their wheels a bit in a difficult third quarter, but have kept their mutual fund on course. After outperforming the broad stock market and peer group tracked by Morningstar in the first and second quarters, the mutual fund lagged its peers in Q3. Some of that underperformance came from holdings in the energy sector.To cope, the fund has cut its energy weighting. It also saw energy holdings lose value. Its energy weighting of 1.56% as of Sept. 30 was more than 5 percentage points lower than a year earlier.In the case of trims, proceeds were recycled into stocks where the managers see better risk-reward opportunities for investors, says lead manager George Myers. ""We invest in growth companies, but we aren't willing to overpay,"" Myers said.The approach has worked long-term as well as recently. The fund's 7.09% gain this year going into Tuesday topped 94% of its peers. The S&P 500 was up 3.27%.The fund carries a B+ 36-month Performance Rating from IBD, having performed among the top 20% of all mutual funds in that period.One stock they added to in Q3 was Signature Bank (SBNY), which is on IBD's Leaderboard. ""We like this bank because, unlike big bank competitors, they offer customers a single point of contact,"" Myers said. ""You don't get passed from one person to another. And the bank continues to take market share.""Myers said the bank's pay package attracts talented employees, who bring their books of business.And Signature stands to benefit from any Federal Reserve interest rate hike.All-Weather StocksThe fund aims for growth stocks that are able to grow earnings no matter where we are in an economic cycle. To do that, a company needs a unique or at least superior product or service.""For example, higher interest rates won't impact people's need to buy products from Incyte (INCY), the oncology (and rheumatoid arthritis) company,"" Myers said.The managers like the prospects for Incyte to build on revenue from new products in addition to its cancer treatment Jakafi. It is working to develop a cancer immunotherapy. And Myers says tests have been promising for a rheumatoid arthritis drug it is developing in a partnership with Eli Lilly (LLY).""We think Incyte's product is superior to (AbbVie (ABBV)'s) Humira, which sells for north of $15 billion globally,"" he said.LinkedIn (LNKD) is another stock that the managers like. ""Our long-term thesis is that the talent solution segment, which is 60% of the business, will be better than people expect,"" said co-manager Brian Neigut. ""The marketing solution segment, which was under pressure in 2015, will also continue to do better than Wall Street expects based on new product updates and ancillary products.""Roper Technologies (ROP) is another favorite that the fund shifted money into. Co-manager William Chamberlain likes the company's knack for making accretive acquisitions such as legal software firm Aderant, in October. He also likes its wide variety of products.Chamberlain calls Roper an industrial firm that he increasingly thinks of as a tech stock.Ultimate Software Group (ULTI) is another fund favorite. The company benefits from an ongoing shift of payroll services to the cloud. ""In 2016 we expect accelerating revenue growth, which will set them apart from many other tech companies, Myers said.

16,ROP,"Aggressive growth investors know that betting against the the stock market trendis a bad idea.Yet sometimes aggressive investors will snub a fine-performing sector because it just doesn't sound growthy enough.This too is a bad idea. When the market is rewarding conservative names, savvy investors adjust.Consider four stocks from the Diversified Operations industry group. The names will prompt groans from aggressive investors. But get past the initial emotions. These stocks are outperforming the market.Diversified manufacturer 3M (NYSE:MMM) has gained 24% since mid-October, when the market pegged a short-term bottom. (During the same period, the major indexes gained 12% to 14%.) Big-cap 3M grew earnings 11% to 15% in the past four quarters. The last time the company delivered double-digit earnings in any quarter was in 2010.Pretax margin has stayed in a 20% to 23% range for at least nine years.The strong U.S. dollar could provide some headwinds for 3M. In Q3, 3M estimates that currency effects decreased quarterly income by $10 million.The company has shifted strategies since Inge Thulin became CEO in 2012. Thulin has increased spending on research and development and is pushing international growth.Honeywell (NYSE:HON), also a big cap, gained 20% from mid-October to now. Earnings growth has accelerated from 6% to 8% and 19% in recent quarters. Pretax margin in 2013 was 14%, the best in at least nine years.CEO David Cote said in a recent news release that Honeywell can deliver higher organic growth and expand margins in 2015 despite ""only modest GDP growth in most regions around the world.""Carlisle Companies (NYSE:CSL), a midcap, rose 19% since mid-October. Quarterly earnings grew 19%, 17%, 16% and, most recently, 28%. Revenue growth was 13% in Q3, the best in 11 quarters.Carlisle jacked up sales outside the U.S. from 12% in 2009 to 23% in 2013. The company has been growing through acquisitions.Roper Industries (NYSE:ROP) gained 14% since mid-October, narrowly topping the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq. Quarterly earnings growth dropped to 9% in Q3, ending a long streak of double-digit growth.All four stocks have Composite Ratings of 92 or better.The stocks also are housed in IBD's Miscellaneous sector, which was No. 1 among 33 sectors in Tuesday's IBD.Of the four stocks, three are extended from proper buy zones. Carlisle, though, appears to be working on a flat base and has found support at the 50-day moving average. The potential buy point is 91.99.Honeywell and Roper are barely extended from first-stage bases.Given the moderate growth these stocks offer, investors who play the conservative stocks should lower their price targets and lower their cut-loss figure.

82,ROP,"General Electric (GE) announced several executive changes late Friday, another in a raft of measures that it's taking to cut costs, restructure the portfolio and streamline operations.XJamie Miller, CEO of GE Transportation, takes over as chief financial officer Nov. 1, replacing Jeffrey Bornstein, who is also a vice chair at the industrials giant.Bornstein leaves GE Dec. 31 after 28 years of service. Two other vice chairs and longtime GE veterans, John Rice and Beth Comstock, depart at the same time.Under new CEO John Flannery, GE is showing it's serious about trimming $2 billion in costs by the end of 2018.

The move affects roughly 700 execs, and a GE spokeswoman confirmed the report.In September, the Dow component eliminated the use of GE-owned business jets for company executives to get to meetings around the globe. They will take charter and commercial flights instead.GE plans to eventually sell those aircraft, revealing last month that it had spent $258,000 on personal jet travel for former CEO Jeff Immelt in 2016, and another $75,000 on travel for other top executives.Shares of GE dipped 0.6% to 24.39 on the stock market today and are down 24% year to date. GE earns an IBD RS Rating of 11, meaning it has underperformed 89% of stocks over the past 12 months.

136,ROP,"For the current quarter, Wall Street forecasts Honeywell's EPS will rise 8.8% vs. the same quarter last year, to $1.11, on a 2.7% advance in revenue to $9.57 billion.Honeywell (HON) shares fell hard after a top executive for the diversified manufacturer said demand for its products in the U.S. and China has been better than expected the last couple of months, but that it's feeling a pinch as Europe's debt crisis and economic weakness lingers.But it's hard to know whether investors reacted to the comments by CFO Dave Anderson or whether Honeywell fell in synch with the market, as the Dow crashed through its 200-day average, falling more than 220 points early on a disappointing employment report.""The U.S. ... has really been terrific, and across the board really better than we expected,"" Anderson said. But, in Europe, ""we're seeing the challenges now in terms of the commercial impact of the stresses showing up in our numbers.""In remarks at an industry event Friday morning, Anderson said his company is seeing improved demand from customers in the Middle Kingdom.Regarding China, Anderson said: ""We've seen some pickup ... a modest improvement, but not something that you would say is back to normal growth.""Shares for the Fortune 100 component, which makes products ranging from systems for cars and the aerospace industry to military equipment and automation systems for big buildings, fell 2.8% Friday morning to 54.12 after Anderson's comments.Others in the Diversified Manufacturing group, including General Electric (GE), 3M (MMM) and United Technologies (UTX), earlier said they're seeing lower sales in China as the country's growth rate contracts.GE slid 2.2% to 18.67 and 3M fell 1.4% to 83.21 in midday trade. United Tech was down 1.9% to 72.67.Even top-rated companies in the Diversified Operations group felt the heat as Swiss electronics, valves, pipes and fire protection products maker Tyco (TYC), whose shares sport an 84 Relative Strength rating of a best-possible 99, fell 3.3% to 51.42. Roofing, tires and kitchen products maker Carlisle (CSL), with a Composite Rating of 91, fell 4% to 49.90, and energy and scientific systems company Roper Industries (ROP), which has a Composite Rating of 88, fell 3% to 98.19.Honeywell's profit and sales growth have shrunk in the past year, partly because comparisons against strong growth numbers it put up post-recession are getting harder to match.In the past five quarters, earnings per share grew 320%, 41%, 18%, 25% and 21% in its most recent quarter. Sales during that period grew 15%, 15%, 14%, 8% and just 7% last quarter.For the current quarter, Wall Street forecasts Honeywell's EPS will rise 8.8% vs. the same quarter last year, to $1.11, on a 2.7% advance in revenue to $9.57 billion.
