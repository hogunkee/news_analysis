16,FTV,"JPMorgan Mid Cap Growth Fund (HLGEX) has heated up this year thanks to leading-stock holdings like electronic parts maker Amphenol (APH), electronic payments processor Global Payments (GPN) and hotels-resorts-timeshares operator Hilton Worldwide (HLT). Their gains year to date range from 22% for Amphenol to 36% for Global.XAnd to help keep the good times rolling, the $3.2 billion fund is betting on top new buys as of its latest disclosure such as IPG Photonics (IPGP), a maker of fiber-optic lasers for industrial and medical applications; Linux operating system distributor Red Hat (RHT); and semiconductor test-equipment maker Teradyne (TER).Year-to-date gains by those newcomers ranged from 45% by Teradyne to 87% for IPG. On Tuesday, Red Hat gapped up 4% the day after reporting a 40% jump in adjusted fiscal second-quarter earnings per share, which topped analysts' expectations. It also raised its guidance for revenue and profit for the full year.The company's software runs computer servers in corporate data centers. Red Hat's cloud-computing revenue is mainly from customers using software-as-a-service.IBD'S TAKE: Red Hat is the No. 1 ranked stock in IBD's Computer Software-Desktop industry group.

That's one of several premium IBD features you can take for a test drive for free through Oct. 8. Other popular premium offerings include exclusive stock lists and The Big Picture, a daily update of what's driving the market.For the fund, all of that good news translated into a 21.64% gain this year going into Thursday. That outperformed 87% of the fund's midcap growth peers tracked by Morningstar Direct and easily topped the S&P 500's 13.66% return.The fund produced a three-year average annual gain of 9.13% vs. the big-cap bogey's 10.43% pace and the fund peer group's 8.59%.One reason the three-year tempo lags year-to-date gain is the three-year average includes the fund's paltry 2016 gain of 0.19%, which lagged 91% of its direct rivals.That makes this year, so far, the poster child for the fund's approach, which aims for capital growth through midcap- stocks with above-average growth. As the fund's latest fact sheet puts it, the fund's managers seek companies that are industry leaders, with business models that hold up in a variety of markets and whose executives know how to steer their charges to outsized growth.Timothy Parton just notched his 13th anniversary at the helm of the fund. Felise Agranoff has been a manager for about a year and nine months.Take a closer look at some of the fund's leading stocks. Portfolio newcomer Teradyne has IBD's next-to-highest-possible Composite Rating of 98. Scored on a scale of 1 to 99, stocks poised to move higher often have a Comp Rating of 95 or higher.The maker of automated test equipment for the chip industry also has an A SMR Rating, which means it is in the top 20% of stocks in terms of sales growth, profit margins and return-on-equity ratios, based on IBD's proprietary formula.The chip-testing systems firm serves the automobile, computing and game markets.In addition, Teradyne is in IBD's 85-85 index. The index tracks stocks whose EPS and Relative Strength Ratings are 85 or greater, and whose prices are above $15, are within 15% of their 52-week high and whose average daily trading volume is 10,000 shares or more.In July, the company's second-quarter report showed earnings per share up 64%. The 31% jump in revenue was the biggest jump in at least 19 quarters. Teradyne said results in the first half of the year were driven by strength in mobility, automotive, analog, microcontroller and memory end markets.Bright Horizons (BFAM) is another top new buy. Earnings per share growth has accelerated, having climbed 14%, 19%, 20% and 21% the past four quarters. The firm provides child care, early education and other services.It sports a 95 Comp Rating and an A SMR Rating.The rise in Q2 revenue and EPS growth was driven by both new full-service child-care centers and improved results from existing ones, the company said. Price increases averaged 3% to 4%. In addition, sales of backup dependent care and educational advisory services expanded.Fortive (FTV), a newcomer to the portfolio, makes equipment for testing and measurement, many for field instruments. EPS rose 13% and 11% the past two quarters, up from 1% the prior stanza.A spinoff from Danaher (DHR), Fortive was held by 1,388 mutual funds as of June 30. That was up from 1,305 funds as of Sept. 30, 2016. Funds' collective stakes rose to 148.3 million shares, up from 135.1 million shares.RELATED:Looking For Winning Stocks?

Which stocks were some of their big drivers?Applied Materials (AMAT), a recent top holding of Select Electronics, is up 34% off its post-Brexit closing low. It's up 60% so far this year.The company supplies fabrication equipment to semiconductor, LCD and solar PV cell manufacturers.Earnings per share growth is speeding up. It went from -4% three quarters ago to 17% and 52% in the past two frames.And the stock has a 99 Composite Rating from IBD.The Composite Rating, which starts at 1 and runs to 99, combines IBD's five performance ratings, including EPS and Relative Price Strength Ratings. Stocks poised to move higher often have a high Comp Rating. You should look for stocks whose rating is 95 or higher, which means that they've outperformed 95% of all other stocks in terms of their Composite Rating.IBD'S TAKE: You can see what makes Applied Materials the No. 1 stock in the electronics-semiconductor equipment industry group with IBD's Stock Checkup.Victory RS Science & Technology was among the funds that held Facebook (FB) as of its latest disclosure. In fact, 3,328 funds of all stripes held the social media giant as of June 30. That was up from 2,950 as of Sept. 30, 2015.Facebook is up 16% off its post-Brexit closing low. EPS grew 16%, 33%, 46%, 83% and 94% the past five quarters.It has a 99 Comp Rating.IBD's TAKE: Is Facebook perfect? Colleague Paul Whitfield takes the mystery out of the popular stock's many ups and downs in this IBD report.Fidelity Select Brokerage & Investment Management (FSLBX) was the top financial services stock since Brexit. It gained 13.47%.Cohen & Steers (CNS) is a top-20 holding. The asset manager specializes in high-income securities, focusing on U.S. REITs, global real estate, preferred securities and large-cap value stocks.In a yield-starved world, that makes Cohen & Steers mutual funds and other investment vehicles popular. Shares are up 8% since the Brexit closing bottom. They've drifted lower since mid-July, but have round technical support at their 50-day moving average line. The stock is up 37% so far this year.Cohen & Steers, which has IBD's 81 Comp Rating, finally returned to positive EPS growth in Q2 with a 26% increase. That followed four quarters of EPS declines.The $604 million Fidelity Advisor Industrials (FCLAX) was one of the top industrials sector funds.Among its top holdings was Danaher (DHR), which is up 11% since Brexit. It's up 16% so far this year.The company makes water treatment and vapor recovery systems. EPS grew 13%, 19% and 17% the past three quarters.Danaher is the No. 2 stock in IBD's electronics-scientific measuring industry group. But the group is now ranked 74 out of 197. Its ranking is down from the 34th position it held eight weeks ago.It has a solid 95 Comp Rating.The maker of instruments last month completed the spinoff of its industrial products businesses. That company is now called Fortive (FTV). That left Danaher with environmental and health care instrumentation.Jeff James, manager of $314 million Driehaus Micro Cap Growth (DMCRX), which is a U.S. diversified stock mutual fund, says the post-Brexit rally occurred amid an improvement in U.S. macroeconomic data after a soft patch earlier in the year. The outlook for corporate earnings was also improving, and a growing number of investors felt earnings were likely to be stronger in the second half of the year.James' own outlook is fueled in part by the fact that much of the post-Brexit gains were in smaller stocks. And smaller stocks tend to be less followed by institutional investors and Wall Street analysts. That makes it relatively easier to find underappreciated stocks among small caps, especially micro caps, says micro-cap manager James.RELATED:Stock Outlook Shines For Managers of Top Post-Brexit Mutual FundsTop Stock Holdings Of Hottest Growth Mutual Funds Since BrexitTop Stocks Held By The Hottest Mutual Funds Since BrexitInvestors Jump On Buy Opportunities Opened By Brexit

22,FTV,"For eight years, TTT Moneycorp Ltd. regularly took Dariusz Suchicki to dinner and soccer matches, all while selling him, as the head of finance of a U.K.-based importer of Polish foods, a series of complex currency derivatives.When the pound started moving sharply against the zloty, those instruments became toxic: They began costing Suchicki's company, Best Foods, tens of thousands of pounds a month, the company said in court filings last year. Now, as Britain prepares for Brexit, blow-ups of this type of complex financial instrument are surging.About a quarter of all U.K. small and midsize enterprises routinely use hedging tools to manage currency risk, broker Afex Markets found in a survey carried out in 2015. Many of these instruments are highly leveraged, and can result in magnified losses for companies hit by big currency swings.Since the pound plummeted 12% after the U.K. voted to leave the European Union, lawyers say they have been inundated with inquiries from companies that claim they were cajoled into buying similar esoteric products. The concerns come as British firms are already bracing for economic headwinds likely to accompany a future outside the European Union.Like Best Foods, many of those companies claim they were pressured into buying products they didn't fully understand and whose risks weren't properly explained -- so-called misselling. The derivatives sold to Best Foods were so numerous and of such ""exceptionally high complexity,"" the firm said, that Suchicki lacked the expertise and equipment to evaluate them.In the court documents, Moneycorp said that by entering the contracts, Best Foods acknowledged and understood that ""trading in options, even when used to cover a commercial position, may involve a high degree of risk and is appropriate only for persons who are able to withstand the risk of loss."" The firms settled out of court this year. Both declined to comment for this article.""It's not until the tide goes out that you discover the hidden risks of some derivatives products,"" said Alberto Thomas, a founding partner of Fideres Partners, a consultancy that works with law firms to bring misselling claims. ""We have seen a rise in cases of less sophisticated investors who were sold highly structured products which turn out to be of little or no use as hedging instruments,"" said Thomas, who wasn't involved in the Best Foods matter.The story of the unsophisticated investor buying complicated financial products and later facing costs they can't bear is a familiar one. Thousands of public authorities, from Jefferson County, Alabama, to Saint-Etienne, France, have paid millions of dollars to terminate swaps that soured. In the U.K., nine banks, including Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc and HSBC Holdings Plc, paid 2.2 billion pounds ($2.9 billion) in response to claims they missold interest-rate swaps to 18,000 customers.The difference this time is that many of these instruments are sold by lightly regulated brokers, because bigger banks have grown fearful of getting embroiled in another potential scandal, said Robin Henry, a partner at London law firm Collyer Bristow LLP, which advised Best Foods on its case. These brokers cold-call prospective customers, offer their services in newspaper advertorials and motivate their sales people with fat commissions, lawyers said.The derivatives subject to misselling claims have names like ""seagull"" and ""two-times leveraged accelerated knock-out, knock-in forward."" Most follow a standard format: The company agrees to buy a certain amount of currency each month based on the foreign exchange rate at the time.In the short term, it gets a better deal than it would get in the spot market or by using simple forwards. However, if exchange rates fall outside a given range -- after Brexit or the Swiss government's 2015 decision to ditch its currency peg, for example -- covenants are triggered that force the company to purchase much more currency than it needs or buy at unattractive levels.""We've seen examples of companies who need to swap $50 million worth of currency a year but, because of the leverage, they end up being obliged to buy $500 million,"" Collyer Bristow's Henry said. ""That's where you get these losses of $10 million or $15 million, which are completely unsustainable and take these companies completely by surprise.""Suchicki's problems started in early 2013, when the pound, spurred on by a buoyant U.K. economy and a series of Polish rate cuts, began a two-year ascent versus the zloty. Ordinarily, such moves would have helped the bottom line of Best Foods, which imports Polish meats and vegetables into the British market. Instead, according to the legal filings, the company suffered heavy losses. At one stage, the company said it was paying as much as 16 times more than it would have in the market to transfer pounds into zlotys.It's unclear just how many companies are struggling with soured contracts like these. Vedanta Hedging Ltd., a firm that provides financial expertise for lawyers who bring misselling cases, has helped its clients settle seven currency product cases, and says it has received 18 inquiries since the June 23 Brexit vote. Collyer Bristow is currently working on about half a dozen cases.Few are likely to make it to court, according to Clive Zietman, a partner at Stewarts Law. ""We are seeing more of these types of claims, but we are talking about small businesses, and it's prohibitively expensive to bring action,"" said Zietman. ""They are complicated, there's a lot of evidence work, and banks and other sellers will fight them.""The total market for foreign exchange derivatives is close to $3 trillion globally, according to the Bank of International Settlements' most recent review, but most of that is made up of transactions among large financial institutions, funds and sophisticated multinationals.Still, the money to be made from the small and midsize companies market has attracted big players. In August 2014, Bridgepoint, one of the U.K.'s biggest private equity firms, acquired Moneycorp in a deal worth 212 million pounds. The previous year, World First UK Ltd. sold a 40 percent stake to U.S. private equity firm FTV Capital for an undisclosed sum.A spokesman for Bridgepoint declined to comment. World First and FTV Capital didn't reply to e-mails seeking comment.The U.K.'s Financial Conduct Authority has seen little evidence of widespread misselling and doesn't view it as a significant problem, according to a person at the regulator, who asked not to be cited by name. The FCA declined to comment.So far, at least, many brokers have been willing to work with companies to find a solution behind closed doors -- either through restructuring, delaying payments or increasing credit limits.The situation could change if the pound continues its Brexit-spurred descent because most buyers of the derivatives haven't posted enough collateral to cover the losses they would face, according to Collyer Bristow's Henry. The currency is currently on track for its longest losing streak in three weeks versus the dollar. If enough businesses are affected, it would be the brokers' profits that ultimately get slammed.

24,FTV,"We issued an updated research report on Altra Industrial Motion Corp. (AIMC  -  Free Report) on Jul 5.This machinery company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Its market capitalization is approximately $1.3 billion.Let’s delve deeper and discuss company’s potential growth drivers and possible headwinds.Factors Favoring Altra IndustrialGrowth Projections: Altra Industrial reported off better-than-expected results in the three of the last four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 5.06%. Notably, the company’s earnings in the first quarter of 2018 came in at 66 cents, topping the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 61 cents by 8.20%. Currently, the consensus estimate is pegged at 66 cents for second-quarter 2018, $2.47 for 2018 and $2.70 for 2019, representing year-over-year growth of 15.8%, 20.5% and 9.3%, respectively.In 2018, Altra Industrial anticipates gaining from solid bookings in the majority of the end markets, acquired assets and healthy industrial economy. It anticipates sales to come within the $910-$930 million range, higher the previous forecast of $895-$915 million and $877 million generated in 2017. Non-GAAP earnings are expected to be $2.36-$2.49 per share, up from $2.30-$2.43 expected earlier and $2.05 earned in 2017.Over the long run, Altra Industrial anticipates revenue growth to be in excess of the GDP while it aims to improve its operating margin by 150 basis points (bps) on strategic pricing.Strategic Initiatives: Altra Industrial has been working on certain restructuring and cost-saving initiatives to keep costs under control and align its business operations with the current demand levels. Over the long term, the company intends to lower the number of its facilities by 20-30%, and improve its supply chain worldwide.Strengthening Portfolio Through Acquisitions: Over time, acquired assets have played an important role in expanding Altra Industrial’s business. For instance, Stromag (acquired in December 2016) has expanded the company’s product offering for various end-markets through its clutches and brakes, flexible couplings, limit switches and friction discs. Also, the company’s business combination with Automation and Specialty business of Fortive Corporation (FTV  -  Free Report), when completed, will create a global leader in motion control and power transmission. The combined business will have revenues of approximately $1.8 billion. Earnings per share accretion is anticipated immediately.Factors Working Against Altra IndustrialWind Market Weakness, Share Price Performance: Downturn in one or more markets served — mining, wind, construction, general industrial, aerospace and water infrastructure — by Altra Industrial will have an adverse impact on its financials. For instance, double-digits fall in the sales generated from the wind business affected the company’s top-line performance in first-quarter 2018. Weakness in the wind business also had more than 80 bps adverse impact on operating margin.Year to date, the company’s shares have lost 14.2%, wider than 9.9% fall of the industry.Adversities Arising From Rising Costs: Altra Industrial is dealing with adverse impact of rising cost of sales. Notably, the company’s cost of sales in the last five years (2013-2017) jumped 18.6% while its selling, general and administrative expenses increased 26.4% and research and development expenses surged 95%. Notably, in first-quarter 2018, the company’s cost of sales increased 11.3% from the year-ago period while selling, general and administrative expenses jumped 16.7%. We believe that unwarranted rise in costs and expenses will prove detrimental to the company’s margins and profitability.Weak Cash Position: Altra Industrial’s cash position has weakened in the last five years (2013-2017). Its cash and cash equivalents have declined 18.8% over the period while its cash ratio has fallen from 0.45 in 2013 to 0.36 in 2017. Notably, the company’s cash and cash equivalents decreased 10.8% sequentially in the first quarter of 2018, with its cash ration slipped to 0.32. Cash ratio below 1 indicates the company’s inability to pay off its short-term liabilities while a falling ratio seems to be worsening the situation.Stocks to ConsiderTwo better-ranked stocks in the industry are Twin Disc, Incorporated (TWIN  -  Free Report) and Kadant Inc. (KAI  -  Free Report). While Twin Disc sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Kadant carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

29,FTV,"Momentum investing calls for a continuous appraisal of stocks, which ensures that an investor does not pick a beaten-down name and overlook a thriving one. Momentum investors buy high on the anticipation that the stock will only ascend further in the short-to-intermediate term.We believe the recent stock market upsurge presents an ideal buying opportunity for momentum investors. The market is highly anticipated to continue its bullish run driven by an improving macro-economic scenario. Notably, the Conference Board Leading Economic Index for the United States increased in January, which supports continuing economic growth.Moreover, positive impact of recent tax-reform on company earnings, which will be more prominent in the current quarter, is expected to provide a significant boost to the bull market.Technology Momentum ContinuesTechnology has been one of the most lucrative sectors for investors, year to date.

Powershares QQQ ETF (QQQ) has also increased 9%.The sector is benefiting from increasing demand for cutting-edge technology such as cloud computing, Big Data, Internet of Things (IoT), wearables, AR/VR headsets, drones, self-driving cars and artificial intelligence (AI).Although technology stocks will benefit less from the corporate tax cuts, they hoard huge cash overseas and are poised to benefit the most from Trump's repatriation policy. Moreover, higher domestic cash level will make the technology stocks less susceptible to an anticipated interest rate hike in 2018.Further, improving liquidity level will allow these companies to spend more on the emerging technologies like ADAS, IoT and AR/VR.Spending to Grow ExponentiallyBlackRock expects ADAS market to grow at least 20% each year through 2025, creating significant growth opportunity for manufacturers of camera lenses, sensors and other items.Per market research firm IDC, global spending on robotics and drones solutions will increase 22.1% year over year to $103.1 billion in 2018. This spending is projected to grow at a CAGR of 25.4% over 2018-20121 time frame to $218.4 billion.Moreover, global spending on IoT will grow 14.6% year over year to reach $772.5 billion in 2018. IDC predicts global spending on IoT to surpass $1 trillion mark in 2020 and reach $1.1 trillion by 2021.In addition to these positive data, IT spending is expected to grow. Gartner now projects global IT spending for 2018 to rise 4.5%, up from 3.8% in 2017.Our PicksThe trick to achieve success in momentum investing is based on the risk-appetite of the investor.

31,FTV,"On Mar 7, we issued an updated research report on Itron, Inc. (ITRI  -  Free Report). The company is poised to benefit from the Silver Spring acquisition, backlog strength, expansion of the OpenWay Riva technology and focus on restructuring plan. However, elevated expenses due to restructuring are expected to affect results.Let’s illustrate these growth factors in detail.Silver Spring Acquisition to Boost ResultsItron’s acquisition of Silver Spring Networks will strengthen the former’s ability to deliver a broader set of solutions, accelerate pace of growth and innovation in the smart city and industrial IoT markets. The integration of Silver Spring is progressing well and Itron has confirmed $50 million of run-rate cost synergies by the end of 2020. It also anticipates achieving $20 million on a run-rate basis by the end of this year, which will drive approximately $10 million of realized operating expense savings in 2018. These savings will ramp up in the second half of the year.Backlog Strength a Boon for ItronItron witnessed a steady backlog growth in 2017 driven by a number of new customer contracts. The company secured several notable contracts in fourth-quarter 2017. Notably, Itron expanded its project with Duke Energy to install an additional 3 million smart meters. It also signed a four-year distributed energy management contract extension with Pepco Holdings to manage its demand-response program. In addition, Itron booked a five-year contract with NV Energy to implement Itron IntelliSOURCE.Itron’s contracts with Consumers Energy, Cascade Natural Gas Corporation and Questar Gas in North America as well as new business at Sanepar in Brazil, and with SUEZ and Veolia in France will also provide support to the company’s backlog.  Thus, the rising backlog will drive its organic revenue growth.Itron to Gain From OpenWay RivaOver the past five years, Itron’s total backlog has increased 13% on a compounded annual basis and 12-month backlog has risen 15%. These growth trends reflect strong industry demand for new technologies, and an expanding group of OpenWay Riva adopters across electricity, gas and water utilities. The company has been awarded $325-million contracts which are not yet reflected in the backlog. Including the $325 million of business, it has $5-million OpenWay Riva endpoints committed by customers, including Avista, Vectren, National Grid, Public Service of New Mexico and others. Additionally, AVANGRID and Eletrobras are installing OpenWay Riva.Focus on Restructuring to Drive PerformanceThis February, Itron’s board of directors approved a new restructuring plan to optimize its global supply chain in manufacturing operations, product development, and sales and marketing organizations. This plan will result in an estimated annualized savings in the range of $45-$50 million after completion, which is expected by the end of 2020. The restructuring plan also supports the company's goals to drive profitability beyond near-term mid-teens EBITDA target.Elevated Expenses to Mar ProfitIn 2018, Itron anticipates to witness pre-tax restructuring charges in the range of $100-$110 million for the new restructuring plan, primarily for severance and other one-time termination benefits. The company expects to record majority of this charge in the first quarter. Of the total estimated charge, approximately 95% will result in cash expenditures.Further, Itron will incur approximately $60 million of one-time severance, professional fee and facility cost to achieve synergies from the Silver Spring acquisition. Most of these costs will be accrued in the first half of this year.Share Price PerformanceItron has underperformed its industry with respect to price performance in a year’s time. The stock has gained around 25%, while the industry has recorded growth of 37% during the same time frame.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderItron currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Better-ranked stocks in the same sector are Teradyne, Inc. (TER  -  Free Report), AMETEK, Inc. (AME  -  Free Report) and Fortive Corporation (FTV  -  Free Report).

The buyout of Stromag in December 2016 is worth mentioning here. Also, in March 2018, the company agreed to combine its operations with four companies of Automation and Specialty business of Fortive Corporation (FTV  -  Free Report). The combined business will be a global leader in motion control and power transmission, and will have greater access to end-markets, solid product offering for customers and better technological expertise.

48,FTV,"In order to strengthen its presence in the Internet of Things (IoT), Itron, Inc. (ITRI  -  Free Report) recently signed a definitive agreement to buy the smart-grid products specialist Silver Spring Networks  for $830 million.The Deal in DetailPer the agreement, Itron will acquire all outstanding shares of Silver Spring for $16.25 per share. This represents a premium of 25% to Silver Spring’s closing share price on Sep 15. The transaction has been approved by the boards of directors of both companies.Itron plans to finance this deal through cash and around $750-million incremental new debt. The transaction, expected to close in late 2017 or early 2018, is subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals as well as the approval of Silver Spring’s shareholders.Why Silver Spring?Headquartered in San Jose, CA, Silver Spring generated more than 20% of its revenues of $311 million in 2016, primarily through recurring managed services and SaaS solutions. To date, it has delivered more than 26.7 million network-enabled devices across five continents.The IoT MarketThe IoT concept foresees billions of connected devices and systems, with applications ranging from sensors and mobile devices to home appliances and cars. It allows objects to be sensed or controlled remotely across the existing network infrastructure, resulting in improved efficiency and accuracy.According to the latest market research of International Data Corporation (""IDC""), worldwide spending on IoT is projected to be up 16.7% year over year in 2017. Also, the global spending is expected to total nearly $1.4 trillion by 2021.Silver Spring’s IoT Offering to Aid ItronThe buyout of Silver Spring will help Itron continue with its multi-vendor offerings for the smart utility and smart city sectors. Further, Silver Spring will bring more capability to Itron’s offerings by delivering highly secure, value-generating solutions for critical infrastructure.Through the deal, Itron will merge the best of both companies’ complementary technologies to provide streamlined solutions on standard-based platforms. This will enable the combined company to optimize industrial networks and deliver more solutions which enhance value for customers.With more than 90 million smart end-points globally from the combined customer bases, Itron will be able to offer more outcome-based solutions to consumers, creating a large recurring revenue opportunity in the high-growth software and services segment. Also, the combined company’s engineering expertise, technology and deep data-domain know-how will drive greater innovation and support for customers.Buyout SynergiesItron anticipates the deal to generate annualized cost synergies of $50 million within three years of closing the transaction. This acquisition will also be accretive to the company’s gross margin in the first year after the deal closes and add to its adjusted earnings per share in the second year.Further, the buyout will pump Itron’s long-term growth and also assist it to boost its profitability beyond the mid-teens EBITDA margin target. In addition, the deal is likely to create additional revenue synergy potential for the company.Acquisitions to Stoke Itron’s GrowthAcquisitions are part of Itron’s growth strategy to supplement the top line over the long run. The company is making efforts to enhance its existing portfolio and acquire businesses.In June 2017, Itron closed the acquisition of Comverge. Following the Comverge acquisition, demand response in energy management solutions fit very well within Itron. Combining these solutions under the Itron brand will simplify customer sales, service and deployment, and expand the portfolio of outcome-based services. Though the Comverge buyout will not have a material impact on the company’s earnings per share in 2017, it will be fully accretive in 2018.Our TakeConsidering the growing need for industrial technology, Itron’s peers in the same industry are also advancing for acquisitions. Beginning this month, Fortive Corporation (FTV  -  Free Report) — provider of industrial technology and professional instrumentation solutions — has agreed to acquire Landauer Inc.  to enhance the former’s field solutions portfolio.Further, Teradyne, provider of automated test equipment, solidified its presence in the fast-growing wireless testing market post the LitePoint buyout. The company has also expanded into the collaborative robots space with the acquisition of Universal Robots.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions. Apple sold a mere 1 billion iPhones in 10 years but a new breakthrough is expected to generate more than 27 billion devices in just 3 years, creating a $1.7 trillion market.Zacks has just released a Special Report that spotlights this fast-emerging phenomenon and 6 tickers for taking advantage of it.

50,FTV,"Fortive Corporation (FTV  -  Free Report) recently announced that it has agreed to acquire Landauer Inc. , a leader in radiation science and services. The deal is valued at approximately $770 million, including debt and net of acquired cash.The deal is subject to regulatory approval and expected to close by the end of this year. It has been unanimously approved by Landauer's Board of Directors.Following the announcement, Fortive’s share price increased 1.30% to $65.57. However, its shares have returned 22.3% year to date, underperforming the industry’s gain of 33.9%.More Into the HeadlinesLandauer Inc. is the world's leading provider of analytical services to determine occupational and environmental radiation exposure. Its services include manufacturing various types of radiation detection monitors, distribution and collection of the monitors to and from clients, and analysis and reporting of exposure findings.In 2016, the company generated annual revenues of $143 million.Post acquisition, Landauer will become part of Fortive’s field solutions platform. This platform includes Fortive’s Fluke and Qualitrol businesses, which make test and measurement tools and precision equipment for utilities, power companies and other industries.In the last reported second quarter, Field Solutions’ core revenues were up mid-single digits with both Fluke and Qualitrol posting strong core revenue growth.The deal is in sync with the company’s strategy to strengthen its teams with advanced talent and technology.The acquisition will further strengthen Fortive’s field solutions portfolio and compliment its customer base.Fortive’s String of AcquisitionsFortive has been on a buyout spree to increase its penetration into existing markets, expand in others and also fight competition.In July, Fortive agreed to acquire Industrial Scientific Corporation, a leading provider of portable gas detection equipment and a safety-as-a-service pioneer. The deal is expected to close by the end of 2017.The acquisition is expected to enhance the company’s digital strategy, thereby creating a stronger platform for connected solutions. These solutions can be used for applications in maintenance and safety.Last year, the company strengthened its position in the IoT space through eMaint Enterprises. It also added some important transportation technologies through the acquisition of GTT, a global leader in priority traffic control technology for public transit and emergency vehicles.ConclusionWe believe that the company’s Transportation Technologies platform, ongoing margin expansion owing to the Fortive Business System and acquisitions will drive Fortive’s growth, going forward.However, foreign exchange risks, increased investments, increasing competition across geographies and end-market cyclicality remain risks.Fortive Corporation Price and Consensus  Fortive Corporation Price and Consensus | Fortive Corporation QuoteZacks RankFortive currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

62,FTV,"Itron, Inc. (ITRI  -  Free Report) recently partnered with a leading provider of intelligent residential energy storage systems, sonnen group to maximize grid efficiency. The collaboration will allow both utilities to effectively control and manage their stored energy resources.Per the deal, both companies will work together for the integration of the sonnenBatterie eco with Itron's IntelliSOURCE Enterprise demand response management system. The deal will augment the wide smart grid solution portfolio of Itron offering utilities. It will also help to better manage the distributed energy resources (“DER”) of both firms.Notably, Itron aims to partner with several other DER vendors to optimize grid efficiency. In fact, Itron is already working with sonnen on a project in California for increased deployment of DER. Additionally, the project will help customers, utilities and other energy service companies to monitor the impact of DERs by forecasting them in advance.Itron, Inc. Price  Itron, Inc. Price | Itron, Inc. Quote Thus, Itron’s alliance with sonnen reflects its attempt to offer solutions enabling electric and gas utilities for developing smart grids to manage assets and lower operational costs. In sync with this, Itron recently teamed up with Utilidata, Inc., a global software company to help electric utility companies modernize electric grid.Of late, GTM Research, a leading market analysis and advisory firm, recognized Itron among The Networked Grid Top 10 Smart Grid Vendors in the submarket of advanced metering infrastructure (“AMI”). According to its latest report, Itron has shipped the highest automated meter reading and AMI communications modules quarter over quarter in North America.Moreover, Itron remains committed to strengthen its ability by delivering a broader set of solutions and innovation in the smart city. Hence, the company’s differentiated software and services offerings, combined with ongoing operational discipline, will drive its the top line.However, Itron stock has gained around 15%, underperforming its industry’s growth of 31% due to elevated expenses and intense competition in the AMI space.  Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderItron currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the same sector are Badger Meter, Inc.

63,FTV,"Itron, Inc. (ITRI  -  Free Report) has been experiencing high demand for its OpenWay Riva solutions.  Also, focus on restructuring, acquisitions and backlog strength are other vital growth drivers for the company. However, elevated expenses and competition in the AMI space remain headwinds.This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has an estimated long-term earnings growth rate of 21%.Below, we briefly discuss the company’s potential growth drivers and possible headwinds.Factors Favoring ItronValue Growth Momentum (VGM) ScoreItron currently has a Zacks VGM Score of A. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum. Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners. The VGM Score of A, along with some other key metrics, makes the company a solid choice for investors.Positive Earnings Surprise HistoryItron has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three out of the last four quarters, with an average beat of 2.93%.Price PerformanceThe company has outperformed the industry it belongs to over the past three months. The stock has gained 7.1%, while the industry recorded growth of 6.6%.Higher Inventory Turnover RatioOver the trailing 12 months, the inventory turnover ratio for Itron has been 6.9% compared with the industry’s level of 4.9%. A higher inventory turnover than the industry average implies that inventory is sold at a faster rate, suggesting inventory management effectiveness. Growth Drivers in PlaceIn February 2018, Itron approved a new restructuring plan to optimize its global supply chain in manufacturing operations, product development, and sales and marketing organizations. This plan will result in estimated annualized savings of $45-$50 million, post completion, which is expected by the end of 2020. The restructuring plan also supports the company's goals to drive profitability beyond the near-term mid-teens EBITDA target.Further, Itron’s acquisition of Silver Spring Networks will strengthen its ability to deliver a broader set of solutions, accelerate pace of growth, and innovation in the smart city and industrial IoT markets. The integration of Silver Spring is on track and Itron has confirmed $50 million of run-rate cost synergies by the end of 2020.Again, Itron witnessed a steady backlog growth in 2017 backed by a number of new customer contracts. The company secured several notable contracts in fourth-quarter 2017. Notably, Itron expanded its project with Duke Energy to install an additional 3 million smart meters. It also signed a four-year distributed energy management contract extension with Pepco Holdings to manage its demand-response program.In addition, Itron booked a five-year contract with NV Energy to implement Itron IntelliSOURCE. Itron’s contracts with Consumers Energy, Cascade Natural Gas Corporation and Questar Gas in North America, as well as new business at Sanepar in Brazil, and with SUEZ and Veolia in France will also be conducive to the company’s backlog.Notably, Itron’s total backlog has increased 13% on a compounded annual basis and 12-month backlog has risen 15% over the past five years. These growth trends reflect strong industry demand for new technologies, and an expanding group of OpenWay Riva adopters across electricity, gas and water utilities. The company has been awarded $325-million contracts which are not yet reflected in the backlog. This apart, it has $5-million OpenWay Riva endpoints committed by customers, including Avista, Vectren, National Grid, Public Service of New Mexico and others.Headwinds for ItronIn 2018, Itron anticipates to witness pre-tax restructuring charges in the $100-$110 million band for the latest restructuring plan. The company expects to record majority of this charge in first-quarter 2018. Further, Itron will incur approximately $60 million of one-time severance, professional fee and facility cost to achieve synergies from the Silver Spring acquisition. Most of these costs will be accrued in the first half of this year.Itron’s liquidity might be affected by competitive pressure, changes in estimated liabilities for product warranties and litigation, future business combinations, and capital market fluctuations. The company will be under margin pressure due to heightened competition in the AMI space, particularly in North America, which could drag down meter prices.Bottom LineInvestors might want to hold on to the stock, at present, as it has ample prospects of outperforming peers in the near future.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the same sector are Teradyne, Inc. (TER  -  Free Report), AMETEK, Inc. (AME  -  Free Report) and Fortive Corporation (FTV  -  Free Report).

89,FTV,"With the Q2 earnings cycle in full swing, a number of tech companies are slated to report their quarterly numbers over the next few days. So far, the earnings scenario for the overall sector has been pretty impressive.Per the latest Earnings Outlook, 37% of the sector’s market cap in the S&P 500 index has already reported, as of Jul 25. According to the article, approximately 90.9% of the companies delivered positive earnings surprises, while 81.8% beat top-line expectations. Earnings of these companies are up 13.2% from the same period last year, while revenues increased 11.1%.Technology is one of the three sectors contributing significantly to second-quarter earnings. The other two are Finance and Energy. Technology giants such as Facebook (FB  -  Free Report) and Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) are scheduled to report quarterly numbers this week.We note that the technology sector has been a strong performer on a year-to-date basis. The sector is benefiting from increasing demand for cloud-based platforms, growing adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) solutions, Augmented/Virtual reality devices, autonomous cars, advanced driver assisted systems (ADAS) and Internet of Things (IoT) related software.However, this does not ensure earnings beat for all companies in the space.

It has an average four-quarter positive surprise of 5.90%.The company's shares have returned only 17.56% year to date, underperforming the industry’s gain of 29.64%.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that Fortive is likely to beat on earnings because it has the right combination of the two key ingredients.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, stands at +2.90%. This is a meaningful indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. Please check our Earnings ESP Filter that enables you to find stocks that are expected to come out with earnings surprises.Zacks Rank: Fortivecarries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Note that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 or 3 (Hold) have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings estimates. Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement. The combination of Fortive’s favorable Zacks Rank and positive Earnings ESP makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.What is Driving the Better-Than-Expected Earnings?Fortive Corporation is a diversified industrial growth company. It provides industrial technology and professional instrumentation solutions on a global basis.We remain encouraged by the company’s diversified product portfolio which consists of professional and engineered products, software and services. Also, growth in the company’s Transportation Technologies platform is a positive.Also, Fortive’s expansion into the Cloud computing segment is quite encouraging. The acquisition of eMaint Enterprises by Fortive’s subsidiary, Fluke, and the buyout of Global Traffic Technologies have allowed the company to enter into the rapidly growing cloud computing market. The deal is expected to expand its SaaS and cloud capabilities within its portfolio, most likely through M&A.Moreover, Fortive’s restructuring actions have been helping the company in lowering the cost structure. The company has also been focusing on products which generally carry higher margins.

92,FTV,"Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL  -  Free Report) will report second-quarter 2017 earnings on Jul 24 after the closing bell.The surprise history has been decent in Alphabet’s case. The company missed estimates once in the last four quarters and has an average four-quarter positive surprise of 5.74%.Coming to the price performance, in the last one year, shares of Alphabet have steadily treaded higher. The stock has returned 31.1% compared with the Zacks categorized Internet Services industry’s gain of 21.6%.What Happened in the Last Reported Quarter?Alphabet’s first-quarter earnings exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate. A surge in ad click aided growth in the quarter. Also, revenues grew year over year, driven primarily by the boom in Mobile Search, with the ongoing strength in YouTube. Also, strength in programmatic advertising and Play aided revenue growth.Factors at Play in Q2The main drivers of the Google business haven’t changed. Pricing remains under pressure, both on account of the ongoing FX concerns as well as continued strength in mobile and TrueView. Volumes are however encouraging, as total paid click grew a reassuring 44% in the last quarter.Google has gained strength in the mobile platform. Management is focused on driving mobile experiences and the company is well positioned to pick up strong intent-to-buy signals as a result of studying mobile searches from its huge database. As a result, revenue from mobile platform is expected to increase in the to-be-reported quarter.YouTube remains a strong contributor, benefiting from the increase in online video consumption. More than a thousand creators are currently engaged in the platform, bringing in a thousand subscribers every day.Also, Google’s cloud business trails Amazon’s AWS, Microsoft’s Azure and IBM. The company’s cloud business is expected to do well in the to-be reported quarter. And finally, Google platforms like Android, Chrome and Daydream continue to help it draw more users and sell more ads.On a cautionary note, Google’s troubles in the EU are mounting. Despite attempts of appeasing authorities by investing in the region, EU might prove to be more expensive for the company. Google is not providing for this outflow, which means it still has a reasonable chance of emerging victorious. But the developments are worth keeping an eye on, as these are the main reasons for the overhang on the company’s shares.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not show that Alphabet will beat on earnings in the second quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below.The company’s Zacks Rank #4 and Earnings ESP of -24.02% make surprise prediction difficult.

93,FTV,"KLA-Tencor Corporation (KLAC  -  Free Report) is set to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Jul 27 after the bell.The company has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and an Earnings ESP of 0.00%, a combination that complicates surprise prediction. This is because per our proven model, a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 or 3 (Hold) to beat estimates.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they are reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.However, KLA-Tencor’s surprise history has been pretty impressive. It surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 11.55%.KLA-Tencor’s shares have returned only 26.96% year to date, underperforming the industry’s 41.92% rally.What Happened in the Second Quarter?The company’s earnings per share (EPS) and revenues exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Revenues and earnings grew 28.4% and 43.8% year over year, respectively, driven by strong demand in wafer fab equipment market and customer acceptance for the company’s new products.Expectations for the Fiscal Fourth QuarterWe expect strong demand for more efficient manufacturing processes and preference for mobile to work in favor of the company. The technical complexity of manufacturing semiconductors and increasingly challenging yield issues remain revenue drivers for this leading manufacturer of process control equipment.Given that each system is high valued, customer concentration is obviated, which results in significant fluctuations in revenue/orders in times of uncertain demand.For the fourth quarter, KLA expects shipments of $890–$970 million. Quarterly revenues are expected between $885 million and $945 million.

However, revenues increased year over year driven by continued strength in the company’s Watch segment and in emerging markets, partially offset by weakness in the Buy segment.Moreover, Nielsen is partnering with big companies to extend its TV ratings service beyond the Nielsen Local TV Ratings Service. Recently, Nilesen signed a multi-year agreement with Tennis Channel, providing its National TV Ratings service to the latter.  Earlier, it also renewed its agreement with CBS Corporation’s CBS Radio to deliver its local market insights and currency ratings to the broadcast media operator across all the Portable People Meter (PPM) metros.These partnership and agreements will help Nielsen to expand its client base and boost its Watch segment revenues in the upcoming quarter.Also, regular dividend payment and share-repurchase programs reflect Nielsen’s financial strength and commitment to return value to shareholders. The company's new products are doing well and should drive revenues in the to-be-reported quarter.However, continued investments in technology and infrastructure could weigh on margins and profitability in the to-be-reported quarter.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Nielsen is likely to beat on earnings this quarter.
