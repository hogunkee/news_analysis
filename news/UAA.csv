4,UAA,"Nike (NKE) earnings and sales are due after the close Thursday, and the world's dominant athletic apparel brand will be expected to address the question of whether its primacy in North America is under any threat.Sales in the U.S. and Canada have declined, year over year, for the last three straight quarters. On the most recent Nike earnings call in March, Chief Executive Mark Parker pointed to a ""reversal of trend"" happening in the fourth quarter (the period to be reported on Thursday), an expected inflection point that comes as Nike rethinks its retail distribution and focuses on online commerce.Analysts polled by Zacks Investment Research expect Nike earnings to grow 7% to 64 cents, on an 8% increase in revenue to $9.39 billion.Within the North America segment, footwear sales have been leading declines. Nike has expressed confidence in its new products, however, including the VaporMax, Air Max 720 and Epic React, as it looks to fend off Adidas' (ADDYY) resurgence in recent years.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseAs Nike pulls itself away from ""undifferentiated, mediocre"" retail outlets, Adidas sees an opportunity, says Piper Jaffray analyst Erinn Murphy.""Overall, management sees the (North American) marketplace cleaner in 2018 and anticipates their growth in the region to be led by shelf-space expansion within existing distribution (12k doors vs. >24k for NKE) as the brand is fully distributed in about 10% of its footprint,"" she wrote last week. ""Adidas sees any proactive Nike distribution reduction as a windfall for them.""Shares were down 1.5% at 72.35 on the stock market today amid a broad market retreat sparked by fears of a spiraling trade war. Nike is now back in buy range after clearing a 70.35 entry point from a flat base and rising into extended territory by early June. Adidas dropped 1.8%, while Under Armour (UAA) dipped 0.3%.Still, even if U.S. sales are sluggish, Nike earnings may not see much downside. At its investor day last October, Parker said he expects nearly 75% of the company's growth to come from outside the U.S., and maintained that the company would hit $50 billion in revenue within its five-year target. Nike's greater China segment has been outperforming other units, and sales in Europe are solid.""Outside the U.S., while growth remains strong, Nike is likely taking share in Europe while sustaining (positive double-digit) growth in China,"" wrote Wedbush analyst Christopher Svezia on June 14.He raised his price target to 82 from 75 on the expectation that Nike will exceed estimates throughout fiscal 2019 due to accelerating growth in North America and possibly abroad, among other factors.But Nike's exposure to China also represents a risk, as President Trump escalates a trade war with the world's No. 2 economy.While Beijing's use of retaliatory tariffs on the U.S. may not affect Nike's Asia-based production, the government can still make business difficult via regulatory moves.Government officials also could call for a boycott of U.S. goods, for example, impacting companies like Nike, Starbucks (SBUX) and Disney (DIS), which have a big presence in the country.Meanwhile, Nike is likely to field questions about its slew of executive departures, which number close to a dozen, in the wake of its #MeToo moment and reports of a ""boy's club"" working environment.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN: Nike, Marijuana Earnings Due; Big Bank Payouts: Investing Action PlanFIFA Fever: It's Really These Two Teams Vying For The World CupNike Rival Adidas Says This 'Massive Category' Is Growing The FastestAdidas' U.S. Boss Talks Amazon, Retail Strategies, And Kanye's Real ImpactStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth StocksLooking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch?

5,UAA,"Goldman Sachs thinks Brazil's in line for the throne. UBS analysts have their money (well, maybe not literally) on Germany. As the 2018 FIFA World Cup approaches on Thursday, 32 teams are vying to win it all in Russia. But on their jerseys, the competition is much less broad. Adidas (ADDYY) and Nike (NKE) are once again going head to head for brand dominance on the field.Adidas has a more official presence, being a World Cup sponsor and all, not to mention the provider of the match ball, the new ""Telstar 18.""And with 12 teams wearing its kits, the No. 2 global athletic brand is outfitting the most teams in the tournament, including Spain, Colombia, Argentina, Mexico, Egypt, Sweden, Japan, host country Russia and defending title holder Germany.Domestically, soccer (aka football everywhere else) is a bit of a snoozer Stateside — the Americans were shut out of the World Cup. That means more muted interest this time around.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseBut as the world's favorite sport, it remains a driver of growth for Adidas. The Germany-based company said in early May that its running, football, training and Adidas Originals categories each grew by double digits, helping to drive an overall 11% revenue increase within its Adidas brand.Meanwhile, Nike has 10 teams on its World Cup roster: Brazil, England, France, Australia, Saudi Arabia, Croatia, Nigeria, Poland, Portugal and South Korea. CEO Mark Parker is ""excited about the impact of the upcoming World Cup"" on its Europe, Middle East and Africa segment, he told analysts on the call in March.The tournament hasn't even begun yet, but it is not without controversy. Nike said last week that it would not provide cleats to Iran's national soccer team amid renewed U.S. sanctions against the country. Jersey-wise, the Iranian players will wear Adidas; the Three Stripes is not an official sponsor, but sold uniforms to the team at a steep discount, according to CNBC.A handful of smaller Adidas and Nike rivals (some much smaller) will also be on the pitch. Puma is outfitting Switzerland, Serbia, Senegal and Uruguay. Panama and Costa Rica are wearing New Balance. Peru and Tunisia's teams will take the field in Umbro and Uhlsport, respectively. Denmark's jerseys are made by Hummel, and Iceland's by Errea.Making a mark on the world stage doesn't come cheap, though the expenses are no doubt familiar and seemingly necessary for any athletic brand that wants to maintain its presence in the sport. Adidas plunks down a reported $70 million per World Cup for the honor of official sponsorship. Both major players are on a marketing tear, with Nike rousing the fans in Brazil and Adidas blasting out a star-studded commercial featuring soccer stars Lionel Messi, David Beckham and others.The ultimate question, of course, is to what extent their efforts will drive more sales of kits and footwear. Four years is a long time between events, and technology has changed the way people shop, even since 2014.""The speed of change with consumers has accelerated over the last four years,"" said Susquehanna analyst Sam Poser. It's not just about what the message is, he said, but how the message is delivered — and ultimately how that translates to the cash register.Bloomberg says both brands together sold nearly $5 billion in soccer gear in 2016. Adidas has lower expectations for this World Cup vs. the previous one.""There is no doubt that the Russian event or the World Cup in Russia does carry lower financial opportunities than the similar event four years ago in Brazil,"" said Adidas CEO Kasper Rorsted on the company'st most recent earnings call. ""At the same time, we're looking forward to it, it's going to be a fantastic way of bringing our brand to life globally.""Still, he told Bloomberg that he expects Adidas shirt sales, which hit 8 million in 2014, to be even greater this time around.And analysts at HSBC expect the World Cup to be a positive for Nike, Adidas and Puma.""Even if soccer is not a dominant category for any, the upcoming World Cup in two months will likely provide a halo impact on the sector,"" said analyst Erwan Rambourg in an April note.Nike shares fell 0.4% on the stock market today.

""In a performance-driven athleisure environment Adidas is less well positioned while Nike and Under Armour are best positioned.""Adidas said its online sales were its fastest-growing business, up 27%. Gross margin rose 1.5% despite being up against a ""significant currency headwind"" during the quarter.Reebok remains a weak spot, sliding 3% overall in Q1.Management reiterated its fiscal 2018 guidance for 10% currency-neutral sales growth, ""driven by double-digit growth in North America and Asia-Pacific,"" and 12%-16% gains in basic per-share earnings from continuing operations.Adidas sank 5.35% in the stock market today, to 117.37, closing below the 50-day moving average but above the prior 116.94 buy point.

12,UAA,"Lululemon (LULU) — for now anyway — appears to have hit upon this recipe for retail success: Make good products and figure out how to use the internet.XThe yogawear maker and Leaderboard stock is a bright spot in an often volatile retail environment besieged with worries about Amazon's (AMZN) market munching and the whims of younger consumers.Cowen analyst Oliver Chen agrees with Lululemon's management (presently without a permanent CEO) that its ""exceptional product innovation, solid omnichannel strategy with an improved website, and investments in marketing (both digital & brand)"" helped to drive gains. He hiked his price target to 96 from 90.In North America, where peers like Nike (NKE) have been struggling to show positive comparable growth, Lululemon's same-store sales and store traffic rose in low single digits year over year. Nike, too, is focused on its direct-to-consumer strategy, reining in products at third-party retail stores.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseE-commerce sales popped 42% in constant currency, on top of its 12% growth in the prior-year Q4, with traffic up by double digits, said the company. Lululemon has been investing in website improvements to drive conversion rates (i.e. how many site visitors actually wind up buying something), and like many of its peers is expanding its ability to ship from store and offer ""buy online, pick up in store"" options.Q4 results topped forecasts, and management's full-year earnings guidance was also bullish.Shares jumped 9.2% to 85.96 on the stock market today, retaking their 50-day average after testing that support level for nearly two months. Shares hit a record 87.98 intraday. But while the bounce higher off the 50-day line is typically a buy signal, the poor market makes new purchases exceedingly risky.Nike, which an analyst said last week is ""back in business"" in the key North America market, fell 1.1%, continuing to hit resistance at its 50-day.

13,UAA,"Athletic apparel chain Finish Line's (FINL) acquisition by U.K. retail giant JD Sports may benefit Nike (NKE), Adidas (ADDYY) and Under Armour (UAA), while creating a savvy new threat to Foot Locker (FL), analysts say.XHaving expanded overseas in recent years, entering markets like France, Spain and South Korea, JD Sports had been eyeing an entry into the U.S., and the $558 million Finish Line deal announced Monday will bring the British firm's expertise in operating successful sportswear outlets to the lucrative market.And as prices for athletic gear have been hit by the highly competitive environment lately, companies like Nike could see an improvement with JD in the U.S.""Having JD operate the Finish Line stores could strengthen the overall operating performance, thus providing incremental full-priced selling opportunities for the brands especially if JD were to accelerate U.S. store openings of its own banner and the remodeling of FINL stores,"" said Baird Equity Research senior analyst Jonathan Komp in a note.The JD takeover also means Foot Locker will face a more formidable global competitor operating in its home market, Komp added.""Note that JD also indicated plans to open a number of JD branded stores in the U.S. and to accelerate reimaging of the Finish Line store fleet, both of which may be competitive threats for FL,"" he pointed out.B. Riley FBR senior analyst Susan Anderson believes the deal will give Finish Line better access to high-end products.And while there may be short-term benefits for Foot Locker, as JD Sports intends to follow through with Finish Line's plans to close under-performing stores, in the long run it could create a stronger company that will be more of a threat, she added.Shares of Finish Line soared 31% to close at 13.83 on the stock market today, topping JD Sports' per-share takeover price of 13.50.

15,UAA,"Under Armour (UAA) may have bested the Street's consensus in the first quarter of the year, but it gave surprisingly bad current-quarter targets, and some experts are raising flags about what they call the sportswear brand's ""out of control"" inventory situation.The rival of Nike (NKE) and Adidas (ADDYY) posted a break-even quarter, up from a penny-per-share loss in the prior-year quarter and surprising analysts who expected a per-share loss of 5 cents. Revenue ticked up 6.1% to $1.185 billion, better than views for $1.122 billion.But ""the quality of the results is low and brand issues will not go away quickly,"" wrote Wedbush analyst Christopher Svezia early Tuesday.

By contrast, Adidas' North America sales surged 31% in its most recently reported quarter.But Nike sees revenue on its home turf coming in flat in the current fiscal Q4, then returning to growth in the following two quarters.Chief Executive Mark Parker expects a ""reversal of trend"" in Q4 in the U.S. and Canada, and called out the success of certain footwear styles, such as the Epic React, AirMax 270 and Vapormax.

23,UAA,"Analysts are seeing good things ahead for Under Armour (UAA) and Michael Kors (KORS), while withholding their usual enthusiasm for Lululemon (LULU).Under Armour's valuation is ""in the eye of the beholder,"" but first-quarter and full-year guidance seems within reach and international growth looks pretty good, a Deutsche Bank analyst said Monday.Analyst Paul Trussell gave the Nike (NKE) and Adidas (ADDYY) rival an upgrade to hold from sell, calling out ""robust"" growth abroad, less discounting, and a push to reduce costs.Under Armour's wholesale trends in North America are still seen facing pressure — Nike too has struggled in the key region in recent quarters — but that has been partly offset by Kohl's (KSS) and DSW's (DSW) new partnerships with Under Armour, according to Trussel.Even as Deutsche Bank sees a return to mid-single-digit to high-single-digit EBIT margin, the bank is ""not quite bullish"" on the athletic brand.Risks include ""lost shelf space in U.S. sporting good stores, fierce brand competition for the consumer's attention and wallet, execution risk of strategy both domestically and internationally and perhaps most importantly the need to create product that is functional while also resonating with consumer from a fashion standpoint,"" wrote Trussell.Shares of Under Armour were up 4% at 16.75 in the stock market today, forming a bottoming base with an 18.85 entry and retaking support at the key 50-day moving average.

24,UAA,"""Back To The Future"" foresaw an era of video phone calls and personal drones. Now another prediction from the movie series could soon become part of daily life: smart clothing that can self-adjust to its wearer's needs.While an auto-drying jacket like Marty McFly's is some way off, smart clothes are already here. They can heat up, cool down, change color or even size themselves. In fact, the U.S. team at the Winter Olympics in South Korea wore self-heating jackets made by Ralph Lauren (RL).Companies ranging from Nike (NKE) and Under Armour (UAA) to Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) and Microsoft (MSFT) are developing smart clothing technology. As apparel makers hunt for tech know-how and tech nerds look for some fashion sense, the clothing trend is stitching together unlikely partners — and could reshape the apparel industry.A partnership between Alphabet's Google and Levi Strauss could be a sign of things to come. They have brought to market the $350 Commuter X, a denim jacket that lets the user control a phone through the use of gestures alone.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe coming years will see a variety of ""really wacky partnerships"" between fashion companies and tech specialists, said International Data Corp. analyst Ramon Llamas.""The first time you saw Google and Levi's you probably said to yourself, 'How did this happen?' "" he said in an interview. ""But over time it came to make sense and was a natural fit.""In addition to self-adjusting clothes, smart clothing includes internet-connected clothing. Juniper Research estimated last month that connected clothing is the fastest-growing segment of the wearable technology sector.For now, smartwatches like the Apple (AAPL) watch and activity trackers like the Fitbit (FIT) dominate the overall wearables market. Juniper sees shipments of those devices hitting 137 million this year, with compound annual growth over the next two years projected at 31% for smartwatches and 6% for activity trackers.Meanwhile, Juniper sees 102% compound annual growth in connected clothing, estimating it will be a $1 billion industry in 2020 with 7 million shipments. Just two years later, they will more than quadruple to 30 million shipments.Smart clothes also differ from today's wearables in that they will have longer ranges and more accuracy. They also won't be limited to a small touch point at the wrist.Developers are trying to keep smart clothes practical too. Google and Levi's Commuter X jacket is machine washable and can go in a tumble dryer. But a ""snap tag"" that contains tiny electronics and a battery must first come off.Google is developing a system that weaves technology into the very fabric of clothing as part of its Project Jacquard. Project leader Ivan Poupyrev says Google isn't planning to make its own apparel and instead aims to ""empower existing apparel makers.""Loup Ventures managing partner Doug Clinton believes successful synergies between tech and apparel companies will be a key to success. That will help the smart clothes market be worth several billion dollars in the next few years, he estimates.""I think we are going to see a lot of partnerships like that, and that's what is going to push the market forward,"" he said. ""This combination of design and technology is a really important part of the story.""Perhaps the most famous example of self-adjusting smart clothing on the market is Nike's HyperAdapt shoes, which boast ""Back To The Future""-inspired self-tying laces. Stars such as tennis champion Serena Williams and soccer icon Cristiano Ronaldo promoted the first edition. Initially priced at $720, the highly coveted shoes are being sold on the secondhand market for more than $2,000 per pair.A second version is in the works that will offer upgraded technology at more accessible prices. Nike's vice president for design and special projects, Tinker Hatfield, says the HyperAdapt 2.0 will be a performance basketball sneaker.""We don't really know when it's going to hit the market or be in the NBA, but it will be there for sure,"" he said last September.Microsoft has also explored the technological applications. Researchers previously unveiled a prototype smart scarf that users can heat up using a smartphone app.South Korean electronics giant Samsung has a myriad of offerings, including a golf shirt that can warn wearers of the weather conditions and a solar-powered bag that can charge cellphones.Meanwhile, Under Armour has brought to market shoes that track a runner's data through GPS. Shoes from the Under Armour Hovr line start at $110 and go as high as $140. The company also sells ""athletic recovery sleepwear,"" pajamas that beam infrared radiation onto the wearer's body to boost recovery.And Ralph Lauren looks to use the Winter Olympics publicity as a springboard to launch new smart clothes with smaller battery packs and controls linked to a mobile app. They could arrive on the market as early as this winter.If Ralph Lauren's self-heating jacket is any indication, the new offerings will feature crisscrossing partnerships. The Olympic jacket's conductive ink came from DowDuPont (DWDP). Precision printing company Butler Technologies applied the ink. Apparel maker 99Degrees attached the heating system to the lining. Design and engineering firm Key Tech made the battery pack. Principled Design's ConnexI/O e-textile connector interface linked the battery to the jacket. And Better Team USA made the jackets.That approach can be seen in New York-based Loomia, which started four years ago and makes flexible circuitry that can emit heat and/or light, as well as sense and track data.It has worked with companies such as Google, Singapore-based circuit maker Flex (FLEX), British retailer TopShop and apparel maker VF Corp. A key part of Loomia's business plan is that it is not manufacturing individual pieces of clothing. Instead, it is providing products to commercial partners, such as apparel makers, on a mass scale.Designer Julianna Bass collaborated with Loomia to develop a color-changing textile used in two dresses for her Spring/Summer18 collection. They were showcased on the catwalk at New York Fashion Week.Loomia has also solved one of the great challenges for the technology: creating e-textiles that are machine washable. While the details are secret intellectual property, Loomia's breakthrough comes from the way its textile circuitry is patterned and the fact the fabric itself is a circuit. The custom insulation adds further protection.Over the next year, heated jackets and boots with Loomia's technology will be coming to market. The materials are also seen as being useful for furniture.""There was a three-year process finding the core technology in our lab, finding domestic partners who would be willing to try these processes to scale in the production of these textile circuits, and working through growing pains with our suppliers and manufacturers,"" Loomia CEO Janett Liriano said. ""Now we're at the point where we are getting to market and selling these textile circuits B2B (business-to-business) to brands to integrate into their products.""For mass adoption to occur, consumers will have to overcome a few anxieties. For one, battery-powered clothes, like phones, will carry the risk of exploding. But given the ubiquity of smartphones, wearables, and other personal gadgets, consumers have shown they can live with that risk.Also, smart clothing will not be cheap. Ralph Lauren's self-heating jackets first went on sale for $2,500 and were later auctioned on eBay for $6,000. But consider that wildly successful Canada Goose (GOOS) sells parkas that aren't self-adjusting or laced with circuitry for $1,000.Google's Poupyrev believes smart clothing technology trends make ""ubiquitous connectivity"" an attractive feature for consumers, who might see connected clothing as a practical investment. And Loup's Clinton thinks that a decade from now smart apparel products will be ""almost the standard.""""Over the next few years it will be more experimental, getting consumers comfortable with the idea of having smart apparel,"" Clinton said. ""There's always a bridge where you have to integrate the consumer into the new world. But I think once people see the benefits of the clothes, the demand for them will be pretty significant.""A spokeswoman for Julianna Bass said their color-changing clothes were well received at New York Fashion Week. Demand is expected to grow going forward.""Color-changing offers the ability to extend the life of a garment and allows more flexible identifications,"" said Carolyn Thomas, a spokeswoman for the fashion house.But even before smart clothes catch on with consumers, the path to mass adoption may begin with industry.In the next five years, sectors like health care, pro sports, the military and emergency services like firefighting will adopt intelligent clothes, predicts scientist Pekka Tuomaala. He leads the Smart Clothes 2.0 project at the VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland. The scientist adds that companies have signaled particular interest in self-heating features.""We human beings tend to be lazy,"" he said. ""If our clothing would be able to help us we would most likely use such products and services.""IDC's Llamas also sees heavy industry putting connected clothes to use. For example, supervisors will be able to track the heart rate of workers and know if a break is necessary.The military is another obvious candidate for such technology. British defense giant BAE Systems has developed an alternative use for e-textiles. Its Broadsword Spine is a power and data network built into clothes using conductive fabrics instead of wires and cables.The technology allows electronic devices to be plugged straight into a vest, jacket or belt. Custom-built connectors hook directly into power and data sources via a USB port. It saves an estimated 40% of weight, a major benefit for infantrymen already loaded down with gear.Circling back to the world of Marty McFly and Doc Brown, Clinton believes the future is bright for smart clothes. He says future inventors will use both the science and the fiction of the past to inspire smart clothing designs.""I think a lot of our movies in the past got the future pretty right. Even with 'Back To The Future,' Nike released self-tying sneakers so that became a reality,"" Clinton said. ""In lots of ways fiction and entertainment inspire entrepreneurs to create the products they think are really cool when they see movies as kids.""As the next generation thinks about what they can build on top of these products, innovation will just compound.""YOU MAY ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Amazon Vs.

26,UAA,"Nike (NKE) VP of Footwear Greg Thompson is the latest executive leaving his role at the company amid an internal review spurred by concerns of hiring and pay inequities, as well as workplace misconduct. Where this leaves the future of leadership at the world's largest athletic brand is unclear.The wave of exits began with Nike Brand President Trevor Edwards, once seen as a potential successor to CEO Mark Parker, who stepped down from his role in March. His lieutenant Jayme Martin, VP and general manager of global categories, was reportedly forcibly ousted around the same time.Antoine Andrews, VP of diversity, has also stepped down, per Monday reports. And two more have been ousted in recent days. The Wall Street Journal, citing people familiar with the matter, reported late Tuesday the departures of Vikrant Singh, a Nike Basketball senior brand director in North America, and Daniel Tawiah, a VP of global brand digital-marketing innovation.The reasons for their forced exits are unclear. Female employees reportedly circulated a survey discussing inappropriate behavior, pay levels and gender imbalances at the company. A ""boy's club""-like environment is said to pervade the sportswear titan.""We became aware of some behavioral issues that are inconsistent with Nike's values of inclusivity, respect and empowerment,"" said Parker in the company's earnings call in mid-March. ""I'm committed to ensure that we have an environment where every Nike employee can have a positive experience and reach their full potential.""But he also said in that same call that Nike has a ""deep leadership bench,"" and did not appear at the time to be outwardly concerned about replacing talent, though those comments only followed the departures of Edwards and Martin.Nike shares closed down 0.7% at 65.73 on the stock market today, after losing 1.9% Wednesday. Under Armour (UAA) dipped 0.1%, and Adidas (ADDYY) sold off 1.8%.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseYet to be seen is whether Parker's initiative to restructure leadership and transform company culture will have any impact on Nike's sales. The company has in recent years been focused on growing its women's segment of the business, and said in 2015 that it sees the that division growing to $11 billion — over 20% of its overarching $50 billion revenue target — by fiscal 2020.Meanwhile, other concerns are dogging the company. Rival Adidas continues to climb in popularity in the U.S. and Canada while Nike logs year-over-year revenue declines in the key North America market.

27,UAA,"Sportswear behemoth Nike (NKE) stock has exploded to new highs after the Dow Jones athletic apparel and shoe giant crushed earnings and revenue estimates late Thursday and announced a $15 billion stock buyback.The mix of fresh products, increasing demand at home and abroad, and accelerating digital innovation could drive Nike's stock price even higher, according to Wedbush Securities footwear analyst Christopher Svezia. Indeed, he was so impressed with the Dow Jones firm's results he claimed that 2018 is shaping up to be ""the Year of Nike.""""Improved design and technologies and sufficient quantities (are) being brought to market with better speed (boosted by Express Lanes), whether with React (expanding more into Sportswear now as well), the Air Max platform (with 270s, Vapor Max, and more), or NBA,"" Svezia said in a research note. ""Jordan will also return to global growth this year and women's is a material opportunity as well.""Nike's Express Lanes initiative is part of its overall Consumer Direct Offense strategy, which aims to make its offerings more appealing and accessible to the consumer.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseNike CEO Mark Parker says Express Lanes cuts down the time between a product's design and its appearance on the shelves from months to a few weeks.The wider Consumer Direct Offense strategy aims to make Nike the leader in innovation, speed to market, and direct connections with customers through digital systems, membership and personalization.Nike stock vaulted 11% to 79.68 on the stock market today. Old rival Adidas (ADDYY) rose 2% and new pretender Under Armour (UAA) sank 3.9%. Among other footwear stocks Skechers (SKX) climbed 0.7% and Deckers Outdoor (DECK) sank 2.7%.Nike's continued innovation is leading to even more growth, further bolstering its profits.""Digital is also accelerating (+34%), aided by the SNKRS app and more, while helping drive margins,"" Svezia said.Nike is certainly continuing to pursue this space aggressively. In April Nike acquired body-scanning software firm Invertex, as it continues to beef up its digital technology, including its artificial intelligence capabilities. And in March it bought consumer data analytics company Zodiac for an undisclosed sum.Parker cited Nike's earnings as a harbinger of good things to come, and prove that his strategy is working.""Our new innovation is winning with consumers, driving significant momentum in our international geographies and a return to growth in North America,"" Parker said in a press release. ""Fueled by a complete digital transformation of our company end-to-end, this year set the foundation for Nike's next wave of long-term, sustainable growth and profitability.""Meanwhile Svezia believes Nike is underplaying its hand with its outlook. He sees great opportunities in foreign markets, as well as at home. While North American sales grew 3% in the most recent quarter, that followed three straight quarters of declines.""There is opportunity in China and Europe in addition to accelerating growth in North America (on greater product availability and favorable comparisons) while gross margin should be supportive,"" he said.Nike is the footwear market leader in China and Cowen managing director John Kernan has said the current boom in popularity in the NBA will disproportionately benefit Nike over other brands.The sunny picture is in stark contrast to 2017, a tough year for the footwear industry in North America. This was despite collective sales of more than $74 billion, according to Euromonitor.Top brands including Nike and Under Armour struggled, while retailers had their own woes due to heavy price promotion.

28,UAA,"Adidas (ADDYY) posted double-digit growth across all regions in Q4 and hiked its 2020 profitability target, as an emerging category helps growth in Nike (NKE)-dominated North America.The No. 2 sportswear brand's North America sales jumped 31% in constant currency last quarter. But its resurgence in the U.S. in recent years, once built on the back of retro classics like the Superstar and popular newer lines like the NMD, is now powered by a ""balanced product portfolio,"" Adidas North America Brand President Mark King told Investor's Business Daily.""A year ago it was primarily Originals driving the success, and although Originals still had a great year in '17 and is still doing well, our training apparel — primarily or specifically with Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS) — is really growing at a very rapid rate, and that's a big opportunity for us,"" he said, adding that Adidas has also ""about tripled"" its market share in running over the last three years.On Tuesday, Dick's topped profit estimates but disappointed on sales and comps with its Q4 report.But Adidas' top growth driver is the entry-level ""core footwear"" category, which includes styles like Cloudfoam and is sold at stores such as Kohl's (KSS), DSW (DSW) and Famous Footwear.""We were really nonexistent there a few years ago,"" he said. ""(But) it's probably our fastest-growing category right now, and it's a massive category.""But fulfillment of online orders continues to challenge Adidas in North America, Cowen analyst John Kernan noted Wednesday, though distribution expansion will help drive growth in the U.S.""We heard several times from (management) on its Q4:17 earnings call that they believe the brand remains under-distributed in N. America and will look to expand further in the family footwear channel,"" wrote Kernan.Overall, revenue of 5.06 billion euros fell short of consensus views. The company earned 0.17 euro per share, minus the impact of tax reform. Margins also pleasantly surprised analysts.Management now expects an average 22%-24% annual growth in net income from continuing operations between 2015 and 2020, up from prior guidance for 20%-22% gains. It reaffirmed currency-neutral revenue growth of 10%-12% during that time frame.IBD'S TAKE: By learning to use call options, investors can significantly reduce risk and capitalize on basing stocks that are making breakaway gains caused by earnings reports.Nike remains the leading athletic apparel brand both at home and globally, and King admits that Adidas has struggled in basketball, an area in which Nike dominates.As it elbows out a now-less-powerful-looking Under Armour (UAA) from the American spotlight, Adidas sees room to grow.""We're now about a 10% market-share brand in North America, and we really believe at some point in our future, we should be 15%,"" said King, pointing to growth opportunities across categories. ""We're three times better than we were three years ago but we've got a long way to go.""Adidas sees currency-neutral sales growth of 10% in 2018, with double-digit growth expected in North America and Asia-Pacific.

30,UAA,"Under Armour (UAA) had a crummy 2017 as the stock lost half its value. Shares have been showing some signs of life in recent weeks, retaking both their 50-day and 200-day moving averages. But Under Armour's status as a cool-kid brand isn't doing so hot, particularly with women and teens.B. Riley FBR's annual athleticwear poll, first published in March, reveals signs that ""Under Armour's resonance with consumers has waned across both genders and in key age groups.""Nike (NKE) and Under Armour are both focused on courting female shoppers. But Under Armour has lost the most favor with women, B. Riley analyst Susan Anderson said on Thursday. That is a ""double negative"" for the brand, since the survey also found that a higher number of women plan to do more shopping for athletic clothes and shoes this year.(Nike has its own problem with women at the moment, and an internal Nike human resources memo, obtained by the Wall Street Journal on Wednesday, said that the company needs to do better to represent women and people of color at higher levels of the company.)Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseB. Riley's survey also said that millennials — a core demo for Under Armour — might be shifting their allegiances. The Baltimore-based brand still comes in No. 3 behind Nike and Adidas, notes Anderson, but Lululemon (LULU) and Gap's (GPS) Athleta are ranking higher with 18- to 34-year-olds these days, as ""we believe these consumers are migrating to higher-quality, athleisure-like brands.""And where Adidas has ridden the fashionable wave of nostalgia footwear, Under Armour appears to be suffering. As a running and casual shoe brand, Under Armour ""dropped significantly"" in the poll, sliding to sixth place from third, which Anderson attributes to Under Armour's lack of casual and retro footwear options.Separately, Susquehanna's Sam Poser reviewed a number of Under Armour's 10-K filings and said Wednesday that he believes that its international business may be growing fast but is ""heading down a similar path as North America given optimistic targets (which were missed in 4Q17), elevated inventory and deteriorating margins.""Poser called Under Armour's brand and inventory position ""precarious."" Trying to sell athletic shoes and clothes in the U.S. and Canada has been a tough business in recent years, and Nike has spent some time tightening its supply to match demand as it sees a reversal of its fortunes in North America.Both Anderson and Poser said Under Armour is losing shelf space at retailers like Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS).Under Armour shares fell 2.35% to finish at 17.47 in the stock market today, but are still up sharply this week. Shares have been trying to definitively regain support at the longer term 200-day after retaking the 50-day on earnings on Feb. 13. Prior to that, the stock hadn't come up for air above its 200-day since the fall of 2016.But the recovery comes as other athletic apparel stocks run to the front of the market.Nike shares advanced 1.7% to 69.59, approaching a 70.35 buy point.

(Gigi and Bella have endorsement deals with Tommy and Calvin, respectively.)This reads as good news for PVH (PVH), one of the biggest players in the apparel space, and the parent of both '90s sweethearts.Tommy Hilfiger alone makes up 44% of the company's sales. Together with fellow '90s staple Calvin Klein, the two brands account for over 80% of PVH's revenue and 90% of PVH's earnings before interest and taxes, according to the company's latest figures.

The shoe line ""continues to find traction across all demographic/socioeconomic groups and categories.""From the fall of 2016, Vans' share of upper-income teens' favor has grown to 16% — a new peak — from 9% and remains No. 2.VF Corp. stock rose 2.4% to 77.92, back above its 50-day line in a flat base.While retaining its monster lead, Nike (NKE) has lost turf over that time, slipping to 42% from 51%. But Vans is increasingly popular with teen girls, and Piper Jaffray notes that Vans ""appears to be taking mindshare from NKE's Converse brand in canvas.""Adidas (ADDYY), another purveyor of throwback footwear fashion, is sitting pretty in third place with gains of its own, now up to 14% from 6% just a year and a half ago.Nike stock fell 0.3%, but found support at its 50-day line in a flat base. Adidas climbed 1.8% to a new high.The nostalgia train isn't picking up everyone. Ralph Lauren (RL) lost its place in the survey's top 10 among upper-income teen boys, a first since Piper Jaffray started issuing the poll in 2002.And the '90s are eating into modern-day brands. In a separate survey, B. Riley FBR analysts found that Under Armour (UAA), a stock which halved its value in 2017, is waning in popularity, particularly with women and teens.Piper Jaffray, for its part, said Under Armour is being ""boxed out by resurgent Adidas and retro-category growth.""Perhaps the most striking example: once-popular athletic-sweats maker Champion, in the midst of its own '90s comeback, jumped from No. 44 to No. 10 among upper-income teen boys over the last half year. It managed to nab two votes from upper-income teen girls naming their favorite clothing brands.Under Armour, by contrast, received but one.Still, Under Armour stock rose 1.1%.

Revenue was $3.65 billionStock: Shares fell 11% to 74.63 on the stock market today, plunging below their 50-day moving average in the heaviest volume since October 2016. Aside from a 1-day dip in September, VF Corp hadn't closed below its 50-day since last June.

Revenue was seen flat at $1.308 billion.Results: Under Armour broke even in Q4. But revenue climbed 4.6% to $1.365 billion.Outlook: Under Armour sees 2018 EPS of 14-19 cents, below views of 21 cents but perhaps not as bad as some had feared. Net revenue is expected to be up at a low single-digit percentage rate reflecting a mid-single-digit decline in North America and international growth of greater than 25%. Analysts had expected sales of $5.149 billion vs. the actual of roughly $5 billion.Stock: Shares shot up 17.5% to 16.72 in the stock market today. The stock is well off its all-time highs of nearly 53 a share from late 2015, and Under Armour hasn't peered above its 200-day moving average since Sept. 2016.IBD'S TAKE: Buying or holding a stock can be risky heading into an earnings report.

37,UAA,"President Trump is preparing to unveil a plan to hit China with at least $30 billion worth of tariffs, and possibly twice that amount, as soon as Thursday.News reports say the announcement could be delayed and that the tariffs won't take effect immediately, largely because the White House is still settling on its approach.Yet the news leaves little doubt that Trump is preparing to make China the central front in his trade war to punish intellectual-property infringement by Chinese companies, abetted by strong-arm tactics from Beijing.By comparison Trump's steel and aluminum tariffs that sent financial markets into a tizzy last month were relatively minor — amounting to $9 billion a year, even before he  started handing out exemptions to Mexico, Canada and potentially other trading partners.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseAs Trump prepares to direct relatively heavy economic fire toward China, trade groups representing Walmart (WMT), Apple (AAPL), Best Buy (BBY) and other retailers warned that tariffs would raise prices for American consumers, whether or not tariffs prove effective in shrinking the trade deficit. Under Armour (UAA), Nike (NKE) and other shoe companies echoed similar concerns.Trump's economic advisors are reportedly focused on taxing U.S. imports that are key to Beijing's Made in China 2025 initiative aimed at achieving global technology leadership.Yet, in some respects, taking on China in this way makes more sense than via steel and aluminum tariffs. While China is the biggest source of global steel overcapacity, it represents only about 2% of U.S. steel imports.Even though candidate Trump often directed nearly as harsh rhetoric at Mexico, the White House clearly doesn't want to fight a two-front trade war at this juncture. The Trump administration gave Mexico and Canada indefinite exemptions from the steel and aluminum tariffs while the countries renegotiate Nafta, despite halting progress in the talks to date. Mexico and Canada are both big importers of U.S. steel as well amid the fluid North America supply chains. So hitting them with steel tariffs makes little sense.Still, it's looking likely that Trump will be engaging in trade-related skirmishes — and U.S. companies will be at risk of collateral damage — on multiple fronts.On Wednesday, the European Union proposed a 3% tax on digital revenue, hitting U.S. tech giants such as Apple, Facebook (FB), Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) and Amazon (AMZN).The proposal to raise about $6 billion in tax revenue per year will need all 28 EU members for approval but could be adopted on a country-by-country basis. The idea precedes Trump's election and is justified based on the companies' low tax rates in the EU, yet the move could contribute to growing trade tensions between the U.S. and European allies.In preparation for Trump's steel and aluminum tariffs that are set to take effect on Friday if no exemption is granted, the EU has detailed a list of $3.4 billion worth of American products that could face retaliatory tariffs, including Harley-Davidson (HOG) motorcycles, Jack Daniels whiskey and Florida orange juice. European officials plan to challenge Trump's tariffs at the World Trade Organization and up the ante in retaliation if the ruling goes their way.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:'Vigilant' Fed Is About To Shift The Rate-Hike Goal PostsNo. 1-Ranked IPO Stock Breaks Out, Expects Big Q1 Earnings GrowthIs Amazon Just Toying With Idea Of Buying Toys R Us Retail Stores?These 5 Top Stocks Stood Out Monday
"
38,UAA,"President Donald Trump made punishing China for trade misdeeds official U.S. policy on Thursday, imposing tariffs of 25% on up to $60 billion of imports, with a focus on high-tech goods. While not as hostile as the $60 billion worth of tariffs floated in recent days, the move signals the beginning of a fractious era for China-U.S. economic relations as the two countries vie for technological supremacy.Trump said Thursday's tariffs were ""the first of many,"" while China's U.S. ambassador said Beijing is ""not afraid"" of a trade war.The tariffs would apply to ""appropriate products,"" said U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, as the U.S. strikes back at China's ""policy of forced technology transfer"" and cybertheft. Those products will reportedly include robots, aerospace, high-speed rail, biotech and other categories.Once the list of some 1,300 products is made official, U.S. companies will have a window to comment and potentially seek relief. Trump, who signed a ""memorandum targeting China's economic aggression,"" according to the White House, characterized the tariffs not as the start of a trade war, but part of ""a very large negotiation"" with Beijing.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseBut Trump said Thursday's action will be the ""first of many"" to tackle the ""out of control""  U.S.-China trade gap.China signaled it was ready for a trade war.""We don't want a trade war with the United States, or with anybody else. But we are not afraid of it. If somebody tries to impose a trade war on us, we will fight,"" Ambassador Cui Tiankai said in a video posted on the Chinese embassy's Facebook page. He said China ""would fight to the end..with all necessary measures.""But he added that China will continue to work to ""manage our possible differences in a constructive way."" He also said allegations that China is abetting intellectual property theft are ""groundless.""The Dow Jones industrial average, the S&P 500 index and the Nasdaq composite initially pared losses somewhat after the announcement, but sold off into the close, with all the major averages closing down at least 2.4%. The Dow tumbled 2.9%.Even as U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum imports start to kick in on Friday, Trump is making China the central front in his trade war, aiming to punish intellectual-property infringement by Chinese companies, abetted by strong-arm tactics from Beijing. That became clearer after Lighthizer said that the European Union, Brazil, South Korea, Argentina and others would get at least temporary exemptions from the steel and aluminum tariffs as negotiations proceed. Exemptions already had been granted to Mexico and Canada.The tariffs aimed against China aren't enough to have a noticeable impact on economic growth, and it's not yet clear how China will respond in the short term. But the stock market fallout on Thursday may reflect an understanding by investors that U.S. has begun confronting China in what will be a long-term conflict with major ramifications for economic relations.""The damage will be real, it will probably be substantial, and it will mount over time,"" wrote Brad McMillan, Chief Investment Officer for Commonwealth Financial Network. ""For companies that sell to China, or indeed any country outside the U.S., the effects are likely to be negative — which is why markets are reacting again.""Boeing (BA), which China has previously said could be targeted for reprisals if Trump starts a trade war, helped lead the Dow Jones lower early Thursday. Caterpillar (CAT), another Dow Jones component that could see exports suffer and also could face collateral damage if China retaliates against U.S. agricultural imports, also traded lower. Boeing was off 5.3% and Caterpillar 5.7% on the stock market today.Ahead of the announcement, Best Buy (BBY) told Reuters on Wednesday that it will stop selling mobile phones from China's Huawei. Apple (AAPL), which contracts out global iPhone production in China and sells a lot of phones in the country, is also potentially vulnerable in a trade war. But Beijing has no incentive to make it harder for tech firms to use China as a manufacturing base. Shares of Apple, yet another Dow Jones component, fell 1.4% after sliding below the 50-day line Wednesday.Stock market reaction will depend on the scale and timing of U.S. trade restrictions, and on China's response. So far, China seems to be emphasizing plans to respond by targeting soybeans and other agricultural imports, and halting progress on greater access to China's financial sector and other markets.While China is expected to strike back, it may do so in a relatively limited fashion as it challenges Trump's actions at the World Trade Organization. That would initially limit the scope of the conflict.That also would mirror the European Union's plan to retaliate if Trump's steel and aluminum tariffs go into effect, as they could as soon as Friday. The EU has detailed a list of $3.4 billion worth of American products that could face retaliatory tariffs, including Harley-Davidson (HOG) motorcycles, Jack Daniels whiskey and Florida orange juice, but it plans to double down if the WTO ultimately finds Trump's tariffs justified on national-security grounds to be illegal.Trump's authority to hit China with tariffs comes from section 301 of the 1974 Trade Act, which has seen little use since the WTO came on the scene. The act gives the president power to impose tariffs or other restrictions when a trading partner ""engages in discriminatory or other acts or policies which are unjustifiable or unreasonable and which burden or restrict United States commerce.""The Trump administration has asked China to propose ways of narrowing the $375 billion U.S. goods deficit with Beijing by $100 billion, but it's not clear that a confrontational approach will yield progress.Hitting China with massive tariffs may be difficult to do without hurting American consumers and American brands produced in China. As Trump prepares to direct relatively heavy economic fire toward China, trade groups representing Walmart (WMT), Apple, Best Buy and other retailers warned that tariffs would raise prices for American consumers, whether or not tariffs prove effective in shrinking the trade deficit. Under Armour (UAA), Nike (NKE) and other shoe companies echoed similar concerns. (Walmart and Nike are both Dow Jones components, with Nike reporting earnings late Thursday.)Trump's economic advisors are focused on taxing U.S. imports that are key to Beijing's Made in China 2025 initiative aimed at achieving global technology leadership. Tariffs are expected to go hand-in-hand with investment restrictions that blunt China's ability to acquire American technology. Among the possibilities would be restricting the ability of Chinese companies to list on U.S. stock indexes.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Stock Futures Fall On New Trump Headlines; 2 Hot Memory Plays Crush ViewsSteel Stocks Dive On Trump Tariff Exemptions As China Trade Is Top PriorityFed Rate Hike Is No Surprise, But Stock Market Weakens On Powell, 2019 OutlookAI Stock And Alibaba IoT Partner With 217% Growth Enters Buy Zone

39,UAA,"The S&P 500 index, Dow Jones industrial average and Nasdaq composite continued to rebound, despite rising inflation pressures and Treasury yields, triggering a shift from market correction to confirmed uptrend. Cisco Systems (CSCO) reported strong earnings, along with Weibo (WB) and other China internets as well as several other top-rated tech stocks. Top-rated hotels were mixed after their reports. Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) hired Taco's chief to be its next CEO. Facebook (FB) showed signs of losing more young users to Snap (SNAP)-owned.X After plunging in the prior two weeks, the S&P 500 index, Dow Jones and Nasdaq composite surged in the latest week, shrugging off rising prices and the continued rise in Treasury yields. The market is back in an uptrend. Cisco hit a 17-year high on a bevy of good news. Shopify (SHOP), Hubspot (HUBS) and Weibo (WB) also had good results. But Arista Networks (ANET) and LogMeIn (LOGM) fell Friday on guidance.Cisco Systems (CSCO) announced a $25 billion stock buyback, topped earnings forecasts, reported its first revenue gain in eight quarters and guided March quarter views higher. Aside from the new $25 billion buyback, Cisco plans to use some of the $67 billion in repatriated cash for a dividend hike. Cisco would have around $30 billion, including domestic cash on hand, for acquisitions. Cisco shares rose to a 17-year high.Track Top Stocks And Market Trends With Free IBD NewslettersArista Networks handily beat Q4 earnings views with a 64% jump but revenue only edged estimates and its sales outlook for the March quarter and 2018 disappointed. Shares dived 19% Friday after a 200% run-up the past year. Management forecast a sequential revenue decline in the March quarter, with the mid-point of revenue guidance implying 37% growth to $459 million, just above estimates of $457 million. Analysts said Arista set the expectation for ""mid-20s"" revenue growth in 2018 which is below the Street's 27.5%. The guidance could reflect stiffer competition from Cisco.Shopify (SHOP) earned 15 cents a share in Q4, up from no profit a year earlier, vs. estimates of 5 cents. Revenue jumped 71% to $222.8 million, topping consensus estimates of $208 million. The e-commerce software firm forecast Q1 and 2018 revenue above expectations.

Shopify surged 15% through Thursday.RELATED:New America: Shopify Is Killing It By Making Businesses Win OnlineFacebook (FB) is losing younger users to Snap (SNAP)-owned Snapchat at an even faster pace than previously expected, said research firm eMarketer. It said Facebook is still adding monthly users overall, but older age groups are mainly responsible for the increase. Facebook will lose 2 million users under 25 in the U.S. this year while Snapchat will add 1.9 million, eMarketer predicts. Facebook's Instagram will still add teens and young adults.Shares of China internet companies Weibo (WB) and parent Sina (SINA) both reported fourth-quarter results that largely topped estimates. Weibo is a social media company that has a Twitter (TWTR)-like platform, while Sina offers a popular internet portal. Internet search leader Baidu (BIDU) also jumped on a fourth-quarter report that topped views, thanks to upside from online video and news feed advertising.RELATED:These Top China Names Are Trying To Form BasesDiamondback Energy (FANG) and Occidental Petroleum (OXY) reported Q4 results above Wall Street estimates and plan to boost production this year as the International Energy Agency said U.S. crude output will overtake Saudi Arabia ""soon"" and ""catch up to Russia by the end of the year."" The Energy Information Administration said domestic oil production edged up to 10.27 million barrels per day from 10.25 million the prior week. OPEC sees global demand growth increasing by 60,000 bpd to 1.59 million, but expects U.S. production growth to outpace demand growth. Saudi Arabia called for production cuts by OPEC and Russia to continue through 2018. That, along with a stock market revival and a weak dollar, helped lift crude by 4.2% to $61.68 a barrel.The consumer price index and core CPI rose more than expected, pushing the 10-year Treasury above 2.9%, hitting fresh four-year highs. But core inflation is still just 1.8%. Markets priced in greater certainty of three Federal Reserve rate hikes in 2018, but still only about a 25% chance of a fourth hike. Meanwhile, January retail sales fell 0.3%, leading economists to mark down expectations for first-quarter GDP growth.Bitcoin continued on its upward trajectory, moving just above $10,000 afterfter briefly undercutting the $6,000 mark in the prior week. Meanwhile, Litecoin vaulted  as anticipation builds for the launch of payment processor LitePay and an upcoming fork of its blockchain. Meanwhile IBM (IBM) warned Congress about overregulating digital currencies in case it has ""unintended consequences"" on blockchain technology.LogMeIn (LOGM) reported adjusted Q4 earnings that beat estimates while pro forma revenue topped views. For 2018, LogMeIn forecast profit of $5.48 a share, well above estimates of $4.90 a share but its March quarter and full-year revenue outlooks were a bit light. LogMeIn sold Xively, its Internet of Things business for web-connected devices, to Google for $50 million. LogMeIn completed a reverse merger with the GoToMeeting business of Citrix (CTXS) on Feb. 1, 2017. Shares, which had broken out earlier in the week, fell 8.5% on Friday, undercutting its buy point.Chipotle Mexican Grill said Brian Niccol, CEO of Taco Bell, would become the fast-casual chain's chief executive in March. Shares sprinted higher on hopes Niccol — known for helping bring hits like Nacho Fries and Doritos Locos Tacos to Taco Bell's menu — might revive Chipotle's sales and traffic following food-safety issues.Meanwhile, Restaurant Brands International (QSR) said Burger King turned out strong Q4 sales, and the company more than doubled its dividend.

40,UAA,"The S&P 500 index and other major averages hit record highs as Congress finally passed the $1.5 trillion Trump tax cut plan. Chevron (CVX) was one of several oil and commodity stocks to moved past buy points. Bitcoin fell sharply as CME futures launched and more companies joined the blockchain craze. Micron Technology (MU), Red Hat (RHT), Nike (NKE), Darden Restaurants (DRI) and Winnebago (WGO) were notable earnings reports while economic data were generally upbeat.X The S&P 500, Dow industrials and Nasdaq set all-time bests on Monday ahead of Congress' approval of tax cuts on Wednesday, then moved sideways. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq rose 0.3% for the week and the Dow 0.4%. Energy stocks, which could be big winners under the new 21% corporate tax rate, were leaders, with Chevron, Diamondback Energy (FANG) and several other oil plays to hit buy zones. There were several notable earnings reports as companies got ready for the post-Christmas week.Bitcoin futures from CME Group (CME), the world's biggest futures exchange, launched on Sunday with an opening trade at $20,650, but tumbled to just under $14,000 Friday, in sync with Cboe (CBOE) Bitcoin futures. Spot prices tumbled intraday below $11,000. Meanwhile, Bloomberg reported that Goldman Sachs (GS) was developing a trading desk for cryptocurrencies, with a possible debut in June, which would make it the first big bank to be a cryptocurrency market maker. And amid a growing market fixation on anything blockchain, Long Island Iced Tea Corp. vaulted a cool 183% Thursday after the iced-tea seller said it was rebranding itself as Long Blockchain (LTEA) to focus on ""the exploration of and investment in opportunities that leverage the benefits of blockchain technology.""Diamondback Energy (FANG) broke out in strong volume Wednesday, with Chevron (CVX), Concho Resources (CXO) among those clearing buy points on Thursday. BPBP, Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) were among those breaking out in less-impressive trade. Energy stocks are seen as big winners from the tax cuts, while crude prices are holding at two-year highs. U.S. crude inventories fell in the latest week but production hit yet another high. Saudi Arabia reportedly is looking at buying natural gas shale assets in Texas. Meanwhile, several mining stocks, including Vale (VALE) and Rio Tinto (RIO), also broke out.Memory-chip maker Micron Technology (MU) beat Wall Street's targets for its fiscal first quarter and guided much higher than views for the current quarter. Micron earned an adjusted $2.45 a share in the quarter ended Nov. 30, up nearly eight times the 32 cents reported in the year-earlier period. Sales rose 71% to $6.8 billion. Analysts expected Micron to earn $2.20 a share on sales of $6.39 billion. For the current quarter, Micron expects to earn an adjusted $2.58 a share on sales of $7 billion, based on the midpoint of its guidance. Wall Street had been modeling $1.95 and $6.08 billion. Shares rose 4%.Consumer spending and the housing market turned it up a notch in November as the economy fires on pretty much all cylinders. Third-quarter GDP growth was revised down a tick to 3.2%, still the best pace since the first quarter of 2015, as business investment extended its recent strength. Consumer spending rose 0.6% on the month, while wages rose 0.4%. Consumers saved just 2.9% of income in November, the weakest in a decade, which is probably a reflection of greater optimism in the economic outlook. Existing-home sales surged 5.6% to a 5.81 million annual pace, the best in 11 years, as the supply of homes for sale got even tighter. New-home sales skyrocketed 17.5%.Nike (NKE) reported a 5% sales drop in North America, its second straight quarterly decline. But the No. 1 sports brand comfortably topped expectations as Q2 profit fell 8% to 46 cents a share and revenue rose 5% to $8.55 billion vs. views for 39 cents EPS and $8.39 billion. China sales rose 15%. Adidas (ADDYY), Under Armour (UAA) and Puma are creeping on Nike's tail, but a recent Cowen survey said Nike is still the top sports footwear present expected under Christmas trees this year.

FedEx Express revenue rose over 8%, Ground segment revenue grew 12%, and Freight sales rose 10%. Shares rose 4.15%. The report come as FedEx and UPS (UPS) are in peak holiday delivery season, having beefed up staffing to meet delivery goals. UPS has encountered some delays in getting packages to customers.Red Hat (RHT) reported Q3 profit that edged views while revenue, operating margin, and billings also topped estimates. The open source Linux software company is ramping revenue from new products — OpenShift and OpenStack — for hybrid cloud computing, analysts said. For the current quarter Red Hat estimated revenue in the range of $758 million to $763 million, above the consensus of $755 million. It projects adjusted earnings of 81 cents, topping the consensus estimate of 75 cents. Full-year revenue guidance was raised by $21 million at the midpoint to $2.906 billion. But shares sank 4.55%.Olive Garden parent Darden Restaurants (DRI) reported adjusted second-quarter earnings of 73 cents, up 14%, while revenue rose 14.6% to $1.88 billion, both beating views. Same-restaurant sales rose 3.1% overall. Darden also raised its full-year guidance. Meanwhile, Jack in the Box (JACK) agreed to sell its Qdoba burrito chain to Apollo Global Management (APO), the latest private-equity buyout of a restaurant chain in 2017.RV icon Winnebago (WGO) on Wednesday trounced Q1 earnings views. Shares fell 4.6% Wednesday amid concerns about creeping costs in its motor home segment, but closed up 0.7% for the week. REV Group (REVG), which sells RVs along with an array of specialty vehicles missed quarterly estimates. But the recent IPO rebounded from a steep Wednesday morning loss soar 11% for the week, hitting record highs.Stitch Fix (SFIX) topped estimates in its first-ever earnings report. Analysts said they were impressed with the online tailor's performance, with revenue of $295.6 million, up 25%. Concerns were raised, however, about the Stitch Fix's declining gross margin amid heavy capital expenditures. The recent IPO fell 9.8% on Wednesday but rose 5.6% for the week.Accenture (ACN) reported fiscal first-quarter earnings and revenue that topped expectations. The Dublin-based global tech consulting and services said it earned $1.79 a share, up 13%, with revenue rising 12% to  $9.5 billion.Biogen (BIIB) reported that a much-followed experimental Alzheimer's drug did not meet success criteria after 12 months in a Phase 2 trial. The study will continue to 18 months. Shares fell 3.3% on Thursday.Cintas (CTAS) saw earnings climb 14% to $1.31 in its fiscal second quarter. Revenue rose 24% to $1.61 billion. Both beat estimates.

41,UAA,"Now that the haze of nostalgia is starting to settle, it's becoming clearer that Adidas' (ADDYY) American resurgence isn't just a one-off fad built on the back of fashion geeks, but perhaps a more permanent comeback to the spotlight.XAdidas' currency-neutral revenue rose 12% to 5.677 billion euros, missing estimates for 5.86 billion and sending shares down 4.55% Thursday. But the company earned 526 million euros ($610 million) in Q3, topping views for 512 million, according to Thomson Reuters, and reaffirmed full-year guidance.Where Nike (NKE) and Under Armour (UAA) have recently struggled, Adidas is tearing through North America, growing currency-neutral revenue 23% to 1.1 billion euros in the quarter.""In all, Adidas continues to outperform in key markets like (North America) and Greater China despite a slowdown in (Western) Europe,"" wrote Wedbush analyst Christopher Svezia, who has a neutral rating on and 195 euro price target on the stock.""It was another very good quarter for us,"" Adidas' head of North America, Mark King, told Investor's Business Daily ahead of the late Wednesday earnings release. ""And I think it was driven, really, in multiple categories, which is really, I think, one of the exciting things about the progress of our business here in North America.""Originals, the segment that includes the now-cool-again Superstar and Stan Smith footwear, did ""a lot of the heavy lifting"" in 2016 and continues to sell well this year, he said. The NMD, Tubular and EQT lines are ""just really, really good franchises for us in '17.""But Adidas has also more than doubled its U.S. footwear market share in running over the last year, thanks to its UltraBoost, PureBoost and AlphaBounce collections, said King, who's been at the helm of the region since 2014. Growth in the training apparel category merited a shout-out, too; he noted the push to get more products on display in Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS) stores.According to Matt Powell, NPD Group's sports industry analyst, Adidas leapfrogged Nike's Jordan Brand over the summer to reach the No. 2 spot domestically, less than a year after reclaiming its lead over once-impressive Under Armour.Adidas has overtaken Jordan as the #2 brand in U.S. sport footwear. This is an achievement I never thought I would see in my lifetime.— Matt Powell (@NPDMattPowell) September 18, 2017Year-to-date, Adidas' U.S.-shares are still well ahead of the game, up 36.5% through Wednesday. That's much better than Nike, which is up 10%, and Under Armour, which has plunged 59%.Like Adidas, Nike is looking to differentiate itself at the retail level with special in-store displays and strategic partnerships. Both companies are focusing on their own direct-to-consumer shops both online and off, as they look to keep pace with the way modern consumers shop. And both are directing their energies at certain major cities. Adidas announced late Wednesday the opening of a 31,000-square-foot office and ""open source collaboration hub"" in downtown Los Angeles.But Nike, the world's No. 1 athletic apparel player, has promised to trim and curate its inventory, indicating that it would pull back from stores that don't highlight its gear in favor of featuring products only on Nike.com and investing in same-day deliveries in certain cities.""Undifferentiated, mediocre retail won't survive,"" said Nike Brand President Trevor Edwards at its investor day conference late last month.King's remarks pointed to a different strategy, however, one that segments Adidas products by type of retailer — sports performance products at Dick's, for example, and more fashion, running and Originals at the mall — which offers up a whiff of exclusivity.""In terms of bringing it (exclusively) to our own retail stores — probably not. I don't see that,"" he said. ""I see us telling branded stories, with really new exciting products at our retail stores.""Similarly, Adidas' attitude toward Amazon (AMZN) splits with the Swoosh. Nike only recently announced a test run to sell its products directly through the e-commerce behemoth. But Adidas is three years into its relationship with Amazon in the U.S., calling it ""a very good customer of ours,"" even as Amazon reportedly develops a private-label sportswear collection of its own.King appeared to throw a little shade Nike's way.""We're looking and exploring opportunities not only with them but (with) everybody,"" he said, ""so any announcement by anyone else to me is a little strange, to be honest, because I don't know how you would do business and not include Amazon.""IBD'S TAKE: Amazon is moving in on traditional retail's turf, in more ways than one. Read our recent cover story on how e-commerce giant's private label lines are giving clothing kings a run for their money. Lastly, for those with a score to settle, there's this.NPD analyst Powell, which GQ recently called ""the best-credentialed Yeezy hater in the sneaker world,"" has repeatedly brushed off the idea that rapper Kanye West or any other celebrity is the force behind Adidas' current momentum, a notion that infuriates sneakerheads in the Twittersphere.Lucky for Adidas that neither are that important to success— Matt Powell (@NPDMattPowell) November 9, 2017So we asked King to weigh in.""My take is this: I think if you really understand what's happened to the brand in North America, it's honestly quite remarkable, and to point to any one thing would be a mistake,"" he said.Adidas' products in North America are ""much better than they were in '14,"" said King, highlighting Adidas' investments in retail and professional sports.""You throw on top of that the impact of Kanye West a couple of years ago, the Yeezy, wearing the UltraBoost — did it help? Absolutely, it helped,"" he said. ""Did it create what we have today? I don't think so.""West's influence is ""just one piece of many things that we've been able to do successfully over the last three years,"" he said. ""So I think it's a pretty easy answer, I don't think it's that complicated. . . It definitely helps, but certainly it's not what's defined our success.""RELATED:'Undifferentiated, Mediocre Retail Won't Survive': Nike Rolls Out Retail RevampUnder Armour Reportedly Mulls Getting Out Of These CategoriesHow Private Labels Are Looking To Be Amazon, Target's Next Cash CowRetail And E-Commerce News And Stocks To Watch

44,UAA,"Vertex Pharmaceuticals snapped up 2%, to the top of the Nasdaq 100, after the Food and Drug Administration approved the company's Symdeko to treat cystic fibrosis. Vertex said it would begin shipping the drug this week. Vertex shares had pulled back more than 8% below a 167.95 buy point, triggering the automatic sell rule. Shares have been testing support at their 10-week moving average.Drug wholesaler AmerisouceBergen spiked 11% in premarket action, after news reports said the company was in talks with Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) regarding a possible takeover. Walgreens owns 26% of the company, which holds a market capitalization of more than $19 billion. During the market sell-off, AmerisourceBergen had pulled back 9% below a buy point at 94.54. That triggered the automatic sell rule.  The stock opened back above that entry on Tuesday, but the market's correction means the move is not a valid breakout.Walgreens shares rose 2% in early trade. Its shares are trading deep in a yearlong consolidation. AmerisourceBergen competitors Cardinal Health (CAH) and McKesson (MCK) dropped 4% and 2%, respectively, in early trade.Under Armour (UAA) grabbed a 16% gain, despite a mixed fourth-quarter report, as revenue came in stronger than expected.

45,UAA,"Despite continued softness in the U.S. and Canada — and challenges from the likes of Adidas, Under Armour and Puma — Nike (NKE) nevertheless topped expectations during its fiscal second quarter.X Estimates: A 22% profit decline to 39 cents a share on a sales gain of 2.6% to $8.39 billion. Expect North America sales figures to be scrutinized — revenue for the region fell 3% in Q1 and management already cautioned over the summer to expect another sales decline in Q2.Results: EPS only fell 8% to 46 cents on nearly 5% revenue growth to $8.55 billion, topping expectations.North America sales, excluding currency changes, fell 5%. Europe, Middle East and Africa revenues grew 14%. Greater China sales popped 15%. Asia Pacific and Latin America sales gained 8% during the quarter.""This quarter, led by our Consumer Direct Offense, we accelerated international growth and built underlying momentum in our domestic business,"" said Nike CEO Mark Parker in a statement. ""For the back half of the fiscal year, NIKE's innovation line-up is as strong as it's ever been and we'll continue to actively shape retail through new differentiated experiences.""Stock: Shares of the Dow component were down 0.2% in late trade after closing up 1.8% to 64.77 in the stock market today, buoyed earlier Thursday by Finish Line's (FINL) earnings report.Nike is extended from a 57.35 buy point. Under Armour shares rose 2.2%.The rundown: Nike reassured Wall Street types at its investor day in late October that the brand's innovation, international sales and direct-to-consumer strategy would help it reach its goal of high-single-digit revenue growth and midteens profit growth over the next five years.Expect to see more of those ""differentiated experiences"" in the near future as Nike looks to set its products apart, likely through special displays, in brick-and-mortar stores.Reigniting sales in the U.S. and Canada is expected to take a while.""While we don't doubt Nike's potential to reaccelerate over time with new innovation on board, the market is still in turmoil in (North America) and we'd expect a reset in its home market to extend beyond the back-half of this year,"" wrote Piper Jaffray analyst Erinn Murphy last week, raising her price target on the stock to 58 from 50.Challenging Nike at home is Adidas (ADDYY), whose multiyear comeback has surprised some people with its endurance. The No. 2 sports brand in the world, Adidas also delivered a shocker Stateside, claiming the second-place spot in U.S. sport footwear over the summer and  bumping down Nike's classic Jordan Brand, according to NPD Group sports industry analyst Matt Powell.IBD'S TAKE: By learning to use call options, investors can significantly reduce risk and capitalize on basing stocks that are making breakaway gains caused by earnings reports.Citing SportScan data (which does not include all distribution channels, providing a partial picture of Nike's sales), Wedbush analyst Christopher Svezia said last week that Nike shoe sales had ""weakened as the quarter progressed, reflecting significant (average selling price) pressure particularly for the Nike brand.""Concern about weakness in Nike's North America sales has largely been offset by mid- to high-single digit growth in its markets abroad, led by China.But just as Adidas crept up on the Swoosh, so could Puma start to give Nike a run for its money in Europe.""Internationally, we still see growth in China but note the competitive landscape in Europe has been even steeper, with Puma's reacceleration as illustrated in our model,"" said Murphy.Rihanna, Kylie Jenner, The Weeknd and Selena Gomez are all high-profile celebrity endorsers of Puma.""We believe Puma is becoming an increasing source of pressure on Nike mindshare and continue to monitor its brand development,"" she said.At least for now, Nike shoes will still dominate the space under the Christmas tree this season, outshining Adidas and Under Armour as the sports brand that Americans love to gift, according to recent Cowen poll numbers.RELATED:Adidas' U.S. Boss Talks Amazon, Retail Strategies, And Kanye's Real ImpactHow Private Labels Could Be Amazon, Target's Next Cash Cow

Amazon (AMZN), the e-commerce giant with whom both Nike and Adidas have started to partner, gained 1.75% for a new high of 1,402.05.IBD'S TAKE: Amazon is moving in on traditional retail's turf in more ways than one. This smart move from the e-commerce giant is giving apparel companies a run for their money. Ackman's Pershing Square, with roughly $9 billion in client money, has suffered three years of losses and some high-profile defeats.

But Wall Street is still worried about brick-and-mortar retailers' long-term prospects in the age of Amazon.Wal-Mart Stores (WMT) hasn't given a holiday sales update, but is generally seen as a viable challenger to Amazon.

48,UAA,"Under Armour (UAA) slashed full-year estimates after the Nike (NKE) rival reported mixed third-quarter results early Tuesday, sending shares plunging.Estimates: Profit was expected to tumble 34% to 19 cents a share on a 1.4% sales gain to $1.49 billion, according to Zacks Investment Research.Results: Earnings fell 24% to 22 cents as sales unexpectedly sank 5% to $1.406 billion.Outlook: Under Armour now sees full-year EPS of just 18-20 cents vs. the consensus for 37 cents. Along with Q3's 3-cent beat, that implies the holiday Q4 will be break-even to a 2-cent loss vs. analysts' expectations for 21 cents. Under Armour now forecasts full-year sales up at a low single-digit percentage rate, citing North American weakness.""While our international business continues to deliver against our ambition of building a global brand, operational challenges and lower demand in North America resulted in third quarter revenue that was below our expectations,"" said Under Armour Chief Executive Kevin Plank in a statement. ""Based on these issues in our largest market, we believe it is prudent to reduce our sales and earnings outlook for the remainder of 2017.""FBR Capital Markets analyst Susan Anderson reiterated her sell rating and 14 price target.IBD'S TAKE: Amazon's (AMZN) private-label push is encroaching on a number of areas, including sportswear. Here's a primer on how in-house brands could be Amazon's next cash cow. Stock: Shares crashed 23.7% to 12.52 in the stock market today, hitting a four-and-a-half-year low. The stock's been on a downturn since July, spending almost all of the past several months below its key 50-day moving average, and not a single day in 2017 above its longer-term 200-day line.Nike's recently unveiled retail plans — for ""pant studios"" and strategic in-store partnerships that highlight Nike products — illuminate the obstacles that retailers face today. The major players, including Nike and Adidas (ADDYY), have been developing manufacturing methods to get products to store shelves faster.Meanwhile, Under Armour has reportedly been thinking about pulling out of a number of categories, including tennis, outdoor gear and fishing, according to the Wall Street Journal.Dow component Nike eased 0.5% to 54.99.

49,UAA,"The major indexes looked poised to end October on a frighteningly good note, led once again by the tech-dominated Nasdaq composite.XAt 3:15 p.m., the Nasdaq composite held on to decent gains Tuesday, up 0.5% in late afternoon trading; it  traded as high as 6,729 intraday, good for a 3.6% lift for the month.Alphabet (GOOGL) certainly helped the cause, rising as much as 9.2% in October with the help of a post-earnings blast higher on Friday. On Tuesday, shares wiped away a small intraday loss and are up fractionally to 1,034.42 in thin volume. The Google search engine operator, which makes up nearly 6% of the total market value of the Nasdaq, is now up 2.5% from a new 1,006.29 buy point in a well-formed flat base and thus still in buy range.The proper buy zone, based on IBD's time-tested buy rules, goes up to 1,056.60.IBD's proprietary ratings in Alphabet have improved markedly since Jan. 1. At that time, IBD Stock Checkup showed Alphabet sporting a mediocre 76 Composite Rating, a 93 EPS, and a lowly 45 for Relative Price Strength. Today, those rankings are now at 97, 94 and 77.The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average continued lagging the Nasdaq, up between 0.1% and 0.2%. At 2577, the S&P 500 is up 2.2% for the month.At 23,400, the Dow shows a 4.4% month-to-date gain, but still lags the Nasdaq since a rare Day 3 follow-through that was noted in the June 30, 2016, edition of IBD's The Big Picture. That follow-through noted a possible tradeable market rally getting underway.The Nasdaq has risen 39% since the close of the June 30 session, vs. a 30.5% advance by the Dow industrials over the same time frame.Small caps outperformed after selling off hard on Monday; the S&P SmallCap 600 rallied more than 1%.Volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq was running mildly lower vs. the same time Monday. Winners are beating losers on the NYSE by a nearly 2-1 ratio.Apple (AAPL) helped the cause, rising another 1.2% to 168.69 and getting further past a new cup-with-handle buy point of 160.97. The 5% chase zone goes up to 169.02.The consumer electronics and digital services giant, which is seeing strong orders and good media reviews for the iPhone X, is now also up nearly 43% since surpassing the first base that it completed in early January 2017, a 13-week cup with handle that sported a 118.12 buy point.Apple had been featured numerous times in Stock Market Today reports from October through that Jan. 6-9 breakout.As noted in Stock Market Today on Monday, Apple stands to gain from an ongoing turnaround in both the top and bottom lines.Back to Apple, earnings had dropped 10% in the fiscal year ended in September 2016, on an 8% slump in revenue. However, Apple has been staging a classic turnaround in fundamentals lately.In the past three quarters, the iMac maker's earnings rose 2%, 11% and 18% vs. year-ago levels, following a three-quarter slump. And in Q4 (ended in September), earnings are seen increasing 12% to $1.87 a share, which would mark a third quarter in a row of mild double-digit gains. It's slated to report Q4 results on Nov. 2 after the market close.For fiscal year 2019, the Street sees earnings accelerating 24% to $11.16 a share.Another positive for Apple shareholders: a respectable annualized dividend yield of 1.5%, with plenty of potential for  further increases in that cash payout. Apple tends to raise its dividend in the spring. But William O'Neil + Co. calculates that the company has a long-term annual dividend growth rate of 24% in recent years.Going back to Alphabet, institutions are clearly deploying more capital into the megacap internet-based entertainment and advertising play. Among three fundamental reasons, one is the fact that EPS growth is back on an accelerating path.Earnings per share jumped 32% to $9.57 a share, pounding the Wall Street consensus view by nearly 15%. It was the biggest year-over-year increase in five quarters and marked a faster rate of increase vs. gains of 7%, 28% and 27% in the prior three quarters.Two, Alphabet is showing stronger profit margins, which may indicate that the company's tighter control on expenses over the past few years may be paying off. Net margin in Q3 hit 24.2%, up 170 basis points vs. a year ago and the highest since a 25.3% level seen in the first quarter of 2013.Three, revenue growth has seen a mildly faster pace.From the fourth quarter of 2014 to the first quarter of 2016, the top line saw increases of 11% to 18%. But since Q2 of 2016, the top line has grown 21%, 20%, 22%, 22%, 21% and 24% vs. year-previous levels.Two more reasons why Alphabet could rally another 20% to 25%:One, fund sponsorship may be stabilizing. Mutual and hedge funds owning Alphabet fell to 4,350 funds in Q3 vs. 4,408 in Q2, but the total shares owned was unchanged at 131.6 million. That total represents less than 19% of 694 million total shares outstanding.Two, some top-rated funds have increased their stake, including Fidelity OTC Portfolio (FOCPX) and Fidelity Magellan (FMAGX) in the second quarter, according to data from William O'Neil + Co.IBD research has found that many top-rated companies have the potential to rally 20% to 25% past a proper buy point before undergoing a new pullback or significant correction in price. On Jan. 6 this year, Alphabet propelled out of a shallow cup-with-handle base at 824.40 and rose 22% before peaking near 1,008 on June 6.While sports-apparel firm Under Armour (UAA) dropped more than 18% in massive volume and commanded the negative headlines after posting disappointing Q3 results (EPS down 24%, sales off 4% to $1.41 billion), not all apparel firms are wilting.Despite a negative reversal on Tuesday, Canada Goose (GOOS) has been building the right side of a new cup-type base. For now, watch to see how the small-cap stock handles upside resistance near 22. At 21.43, Canada Goose is still trading nearly 12% off its all-time peak of 24.32.The ultrapremium outerwear and cold-weather knitwear marketer went public at 12.75 a share on March 16. The stock quickly goosed up a 31% gain after a late-May breakout past an 18.50 IPO base, then peaked at 24.32.The current base shows a normal decline of 30%, within the normal range for a solid cup with handle.Keep in mind that Canada Goose's business is highly cyclical, with the bulk of its sales and profits coming during the holiday quarter. That said, the luxury-brand play looks set to go well into the black in fiscal year 2018 (ending in March next year) as analysts on consensus see profit of 43 cents, then 54 cents in FY 2019, up 26%.Sales grew 39% to $404 million in FY 2017 (ended in March), notching a third year in a row of 30%-plus gains.On Canada Goose's e-commerce site, a women's red Canada Coat full-length parka currently sells at $1,695.00. Many other women's parkas range from $795.00 to $1,295.00 each.Under Armour, meanwhile, had posted a shocking first year-over-year top-line decline in at least four years. The closing of numerous brick and mortar chain stores and stiff competition from the likes of Nike, Adidas and other athletic brands has dented its business model of being virtually ubiquitous in the retail landscape.The right time to have sold the stock was when it failed to complete a new base in the summer of 2016. That base featured a left-side high of 47.94. On the right side, Under Armour got as high as 44.68 before reversing sharply lower.The stock then cracked on Aug. 31, falling nearly 5% to 39.63 and taking out both its 50-day and 200-day moving averages in heavy turnover.Elsewhere in the market today, building and construction stocks rallied sharply.Decking products expert Trex (TREX) gapped up more than 24% to 108.79 and reached as high as 112.39, stretching its gain from an August breakout past 76.59 in an elongated double-bottom base to more than 46%. The stock headed the upside of IBD's ""Stocks On The Move"" table, which is a great hunting ground for snagging breakouts and building a good watch list.Trex reported robust Q3 results (EPS up 42% to 68 cents a share, revenue up 32% to $140.2 million, the strongest increase since Q3 2014).  Analysts are forecasting mild double-digit profit growth for full-year 2017 (up 17% to $2.99 a share) and 2018 (up 14% to $3.41).Thinly traded William Lyon Homes (WLH) cleared resistance near 25 and rolled past a 25.28 flat-base buy point, rising nearly 9% to 27.18. Volume is running nearly triple its average pace. The buy zone goes up to 26.54. The Newport Beach, Calif., single-family homebuilder posted a 109% leap in Q3 earnings to 71 cents a share on a 43% jump in revenue to $490.3 million.William Lyon trades on average 394,000 shares a day, roughly equivalent to $11 million in trading volume. That's thin, but Lyon also gets a respectable 91 Composite Rating from Stock Checkup, and that rating is likely to climb.IBD's TAKE: Using stock charts correctly can help you time your purchases in leading stocks so that you can maximize your gains and minimize losses within a relatively short period of time. Watching for breakouts from key chart patterns during earnings season is especially helpful. In addition to the flat base and the saucer base, the cup with handle stands out as one of the most critical patterns of human psychology; it visualizes investor fear and greed, hope and denial.

50,UAA,"Nike (NKE) shares popped Wednesday after the athletic apparel and shoe giant reassured at its investor day that it still expects solid revenue growth over the next five years and sees a way out of the retail labyrinth that has confounded so many other brick-and-mortar-based brands.XOver the next five years, half of Nike's growth will come from ""new innovation concepts,"" digital sales will rise from 15% to 30% of revenue, and nearly 75% of its growth will come from outside the U.S., said Nike Chief Executive Mark Parker from the company's headquarters in Beaverton, Ore.He is ""very confident"" that Nike's strategy, which focuses on speed to market, tighter product selection and a digital-focused consumer experience, will help drive high-single-digit revenue growth and midteens profit growth over that time frame.ICYMI: NIKE says at investor day that it sees high-single-digit revenue growth and mid-teens EPS growth over the next 5 years $NKE pic.twitter.com/VsocqIHQ3c— Elaine Low (@IBD_elow) October 25, 2017Meanwhile, CNBC reported that Nike is ""on track"" to hit $50 billion within five years, which presumably means 2022. At its prior investor day in 2015, Nike had forecast it would hit $50 billion by the end of fiscal 2020.Mark Parker confirms to @CNBC that @Nike is on track to hit $50B in five years. $NKE— Jess (@JGolden5) October 25, 2017Adidas' (ADDYY) current surge of popularity has been stronger than some expected, and Nike execs attempted to soothe any concerns that the Swoosh was losing its edge among teens.""Consumers tell us that we are the No. 1 cool brand and the No. 1 favorite footwear and apparel brand for today's youth,"" said Nike Brand President Trevor Edwards, citing Nike's third-party tracking studies.And amid a rough brick-and-mortar retail landscape, Nike outlined a few ways it intends to fight to stay the No. 1 athletic apparel and shoe brand in the world.""Make sure that nothing stands in the way of getting that consumer the exact product they want at the exact moment they want it,"" said Edwards.That includes Nike.com exclusive products, same-day deliveries in certain major cities, and pulling away from ""undifferentiated"" retail outlets, which appear to be stores that do not have stand-alone Nike-centered displays.""Undifferentiated mediocre retail won't survive,"" said Edwards.The massive impact that Amazon and online shopping as a whole has wrought on retail is not lost on the brand. Management emphasized throughout the presentation that its focus now is making sales on Nike.com, Nike brick-and-mortar stores, and through strategic wholesalers. Currently 40% of the brand's wares are in what it terms ""differentiated"" spaces. It plans to take that up to 80% over the next five years.Execs also highlighted strategic partnerships with Foot Locker (FL), and online team-ups with marketplaces such as Zalando and Amazon (AMZN), adding that Nike would be launching more pilots with online marketplaces internationally in the coming months.The iconic brand is also integrating with WeChat, owned by Tencent (TCEHY), weaving  its Nike+ membership program with the popular China-based messaging platform.Nike shares rose 2.9% to 54.94 on the stock market today, closing just above their 200-day moving average. Nike edged higher in late trading, despite implying it would hit the $50 billion sales in 2022, not 2020.Nike hit a 2017 low of 50.35 earlier this month on concerns about high inventory and clearance sales. Nike hit an 18-month high of 60.53 in August.RELATED:Nike Flash Sale 'Unprecedented' As Teens Ditch Iconic BrandWhy Nike's Weak U.S. Sales May Be A Bigger Warning Than You Think

51,UAA,"Black Friday spending shot up nearly 17% to $5.03 billion, according to Adobe Analytics data, and early results for Cyber Monday shopping point to an even bigger day than expected.X Adobe had expected record online Cyber Monday sales of $6.6 billion, which would mark a 16.5% gain from the prior year. But as of 10 a.m. ET today, $840 million had been spent online, representing growth of 16.9%.Overall web traffic is up 12%, with mobile traffic representing a record high 53.3% of visits plus 39.7% of revenue, Adobe added. Growth was also up sharply from Saturday and Sunday, which brought in a total of $5.12 billion online, up 10.1%.So which stores are racking up major sales, and which ones are desperate for shoppers?Toys and gadgets were predictably hot on Black Friday: the Nintendo (NTDOY) Switch, Hatchimals and Colleggtibles, PJ Masks, L.O.L. Surprise Dolls, Ride On Cars, and Google (GOOGL) Chromecast and Roku (ROKU) streaming devices were top sellers, said Adobe.Computers, TVs and toys were the most discounted products on Friday, and shoppers looking to complete their holiday shopping will likely find great deals on toys again today, as toys are expected to get the biggest price cuts on Cyber Monday. Piper Jaffray said Build-A-Bear Workshop (BBW) was the busiest store its analysts visited in both Minnesota and Texas over the weekend.""Overall, we think (Thanksgiving/Black Friday) was strong even though it continued to be diluted by online sales and earlier sales that began in early November and heightened the weekend before (Black Friday),"" wrote B. Riley FBR analyst Susan Anderson. ""However, given the cold spurt in early November we believe outerwear was a big purchase early on which left room for apparel purchases over BF, particularly given the new fashion cycle.""At the mall, American Eagle (AEO) (and its Aerie brand), Build-A-Bear Workshop, L Brands' (LB) Pink and Gap (GPS) chain Old Navy came out on top on Black Friday, she said, ""managing sales/promos that should lead to good top lines and bottom lines.""Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF) and Abercrombie-owned Hollister also merited callouts from Anderson, although traffic at both stores was lower than that of the top performers. The firm's analysts spotted mall visitors toting Victoria's Secret, Build-A-Bear, American Eagle, Macy's (M), Forever 21 and Lululemon (LULU) bags more than any others.""Fashion apparel looked to be the key items over TG/BF, while activewear continued to be challenged and even though athletic footwear appeared strong it was mainly driven by discounts,"" wrote Anderson.IBD'S TAKE: If you want to understand the state of the market, pay attention to the major averages and leading stocks. Read IBD's Stock Market Today columns throughout the market day, and the end-of-day The Big Picture (take a free trial) for timely market analysis and highlighted growth stocks breaking out of proper bases.Struggling Under Armour (UAA) offered 50% discounts at its factory outlets, noted analysts, a contrast to Nike's (NKE) 25%-off promotion at outlet stores and Adidas' (ADDYY) more-modest promotions.But even as shoppers hit the registers this past weekend, the American mall continues to suffer. Brick-and-mortar traffic fell over 7.5% on Black Friday, and same-store retail traffic fell over 3%, according to Cowen, citing national traffic devices. And stores like Sears (SHLD) are doing the best they can to reclaim foot traffic as the heyday of department stores looks to be permanently in the rearview mirror.Gordon Haskett analyst Chuck Grom called out Wal-Mart (WMT), Kohl's (KSS), Amazon (AMZN), and Dollar Tree (DLTR).""Looking ahead, roughly 85% stated they intend to make a purchase on Cyber Monday – so taking all of it together ... the weekend looks like it was a winner for most,"" he wrote.Macy's shares climbed 0.7% on the stock market today. Gap shares rose 1.3% to 21.21, retaking a 20.87 buy point. Wal-Mart was unchanged. Amazon advanced 0.8%, hitting fresh highs.RELATED:Stocks At Record Highs; Amazon Hits 1,200 As Holiday Sales Lift RetailRetailers Push TVs, Smart Speakers, Apple Devices For HolidaysWhy Black Friday Wireless Promotions Lacking For Apple iPhone X

52,UAA,"On any given morning, you could smooth out your Pinzon Egyptian cotton sheets before tossing on a Goodthreads poplin dress shirt, Franklin Tailored sharkskin-gray suit and a pair of Franklin & Freeman penny loafers. Breakfast might be a bowl of 365 Everyday Value organic quick oats and Wickedly Prime dry-roasted almonds with a cup of Happy Belly organic Fair Trade coffee, as you lean back into your Strathwood chaise lounge.XDespite not bearing Amazon's (AMZN) signature arched arrow, they're all part of an army of more than 30 private labels that belong to the increasingly ubiquitous e-commerce behemoth, a bounty waiting to be innocently discovered online as modern shoppers ditch old-school name brands and seek out stuff that's cool but cheap.Meanwhile, Wal-Mart (WMT), Target (TGT) and other Amazon rivals also have been rushing out new, re-imagined house brands, as a flurry of private-label innovation and a shift in consumer habits challenge the value of a traditional name brand. For chains that find the right balance between their own labels and outside ones, long-moribund shares could see life again. But while private labels have been hiding in plain sight for decades, the current surge could deliver another jolt to the retail sector, if national brands lose ground and prices fall further.""With the advent of Amazon and the 'everything store,' you can pretty much get a national brand that you want, anywhere,"" said Kantar Retail analyst Tiffany Hogan. ""So I think we're seeing another swell in private-label development, being used less as a fill-in strategy, which is how many of them probably started,"" and more of an offensive play.It's already a massive business for supermarkets, drug chains and mass-merchandise stores, with sales hitting a record high of $118.4 billion in 2015, according to the Private Label Manufacturers Association. And so far in 2017, private-label manufacturing sourcing has grown 26% vs. the prior-year period, according to ThomasNet data, with notable pops in cosmetics and pharmaceuticals.Today, what might have once prompted mockery at a school cafeteria is emerging from a makeover. Back in the day, store brands were meant to emulate well-known national names, offering what was perceived as a lower quality but cheaper option, rather than a distinct alternative on par with the bigger brands. Instead of red-and-white soda cans plastered with knockoff-style logos, there are now a lot more products like Whole Foods' 365 brand cola, proudly crafted with pure cane sugar and filtered carbonated water.For a retailer, owning a brand means margins are higher, prices are more competitive, and customers can't get the products anywhere else. At Amazon alone, the private-label market represents a $1 billion gross-profit opportunity, Morgan Stanley has estimated. Plus, there's greater control over product creation and speed to market, said Hogan.And companies are taking advantage of that control, crafting unique images meant to resonate with consumers' hearts and not just their wallets.""I am not a person who has or probably would ever get a tattoo, but if I were going to get one, I would want it to be the design on our coffee bag,"" says Liza Landsman, president of Jet.com, the e-commerce player acquired last year by Wal-Mart. ""I just think it's really beautiful.""She's talking about the creature on the cover of one of Jet.com's newly launched Uniquely J in-house products, an intricately inked Peruvian tiger. And it's not hard to see why: It looks more like a hipster's sleeve tattoo than a coffee container.Uniquely J's slim-but-growing collection of 50 or so items — salsa, avocado oil, sandwich bags, toilet paper — don't all sport edgy tigers. Some have cartoon bears and walruses. All are aimed at consumers of the ""metro-millennial lifestyle,"" and mark a pivot from the private-label game plan of old.""Over the last few years, the attitude toward private label among consumers has really evolved, and I think that's in response to the fact that it's not your father's private label anymore, that so much innovation and product and packaging and design is happening in that space that there (are) ample opportunities to bring really interesting offerings to market,"" said Landsman.Attitudes were much different in the early 1980s. Back then, high-end designer Halston inked a billion-dollar deal to create a lower-priced version of its apparel for J.C. Penney (JCP). But brand dilution was so frowned upon back then that Bergdorf Goodman expelled the Halston brand altogether from its upscale stores.In the 1990s, Target launched brands like Archer Farms and teamed up with architect Michael Graves for an exclusive designer partnership. Those efforts, plus in-house brands like Merona and Mossimo, which are now being retired, were better received and earned Target a devoted following among shoppers looking for reasonably fashionable but affordable items.""That was cool,"" said Jim Holbrook, CEO of private-label retail services firm Daymon. ""It was exclusive, you could only get it at Target; it was well designed, and at an affordable price. And to me that was sort of the advent of the differentiating strategy.""Target now wants to win back customers who knew and loved the ""Tar-zhay"" of yesteryear. It's in the process of debuting no fewer than a dozen brands, all either clothes or furnishing, including A New Day (womenswear), Goodfellow (menswear), Project 62 (home décor), Joylab (athleisure) and Hearth and Hand with Magnolia, a home and lifestyle label created in conjunction with HGTV stars Chip and Joanna Gaines.They hope to replicate the success of Cat & Jack, the company's shining example of what a good private label can accomplish. The cheery, on-trend kids clothing raked in $2 billion just in its first year, a remarkable feat for a debut in a home and apparel category that brings in $26 billion annually for Target — over a third of its total revenue.""Target kind of lost their way for a couple years, but (CEO) Brian Cornell's done a great job refocusing them on kids' apparel, home and launching of all these"" private-label brands, said Edward Jones analyst Brian Yarbrough of Target's chief, who took the helm in 2014.And Macy's (M) — which has a well-regarded stable of 20 or so exclusives like the Martha Stewart Collection — plans to grow its private and exclusive brands to 40% from 29% of the business by 2020, saying they help stem store traffic losses at its department stores.But Kohl's (KSS) recent private-label venture offers a warning. The department store had pushed its private labels but upset the balance between major brands and in-house offerings, weighing on sales. That showed management that national brands still matter, Yarbrough said. The department store has since focused more in the other direction, partnering with Under Armour (UAA), for instance.""Now, the risk is, for some retailers, you don't want to go too far,"" he said.In other words, shoppers like a healthy smattering of unique store brands, so long as they can still find household names like Nike (NKE) or Coca-Cola (KO) on shelves.For 20- and 30-somethings who came of age during the Great Recession, however, brands may matter even less than ever, amid their existential hunt for authenticity and uniqueness.The online store Brandless, for example, is a curated selection of groceries, household and personal care items that sell for a straightforward $3 apiece but come without what the startup's CEO, Tina Sharkey, has termed the ""Brand Tax,"" i.e. marketing costs and the ""false narrative of cartoon characters and actors"" on packaging.Brandless doesn't sell any Starbucks. Instead, it offers a chocolate-colored bag of organic, fair-trade cold brew, simply labeled ""Cold Brew Coffee Bag."" Other items are similar. No Kleenex, just ""Facial Tissue."" No Chapstick, only ""Lip Balm.""They could be mistaken for cheap generics, but the company proudly touts merchandise that is carefully sourced and ""non-GMO, sometimes organic, fair trade, kosher, gluten-free, no added sugar and more.""""I think people would tell you that millennials are exponentially more open to buying brands they didn't grow up with and trying things that speak to their values, are affordable, are not wedded to things that were necessarily at their table for years,"" said Sharkey. ""So I think there's a huge openness (to new brands) and openness to private label.""Therein lies a challenge to companies' exclusive offerings, however. Modern millennial shoppers aren't brand loyal, so they're game to skip big-name labels in favor of private brands. But companies are banking on the hope that their unique products will cultivate some modicum of loyalty, or at least one or two return trips.Loyalty is what Amazon knows well as it tries to lure more subscribers to its Prime ecosystem with its own house brands, which includes a number of womenswear lines, not to mention its popular Amazon Basics and Amazon Essentials for tchotchkes around the house.Of Amazon's estimated 34 private-label brands, 19 are clothing collections. That there's an industrywide rise in interest in store-brand apparel manufacturing comes as no surprise to ThomasNet CEO Tony Uphoff, who pointed to store closures at Gap and Abercrombie & Fitch and the decline of traditional brands.But success, even for Amazon, is not guaranteed. Paris Sunday, its fashion-forward casual line of dresses and other clothes, is reportedly being phased out, according to a recent WWD story.Still, it's early days, and as department stores are waning in influence, Amazon's access to massive amounts of data means it wields gargantuan power.""Way back in the day, it would take several months to figure out what a trend was and what people wanted and analyze the data,"" said Daymon CEO Holbrook. ""And then the data got more available with point of sales scanner data and loyalty card data, so that would take several weeks. And now, Amazon's true competitive advantage is they know, real time, minute by minute, what people want.""In the first half of 2017, the young women's apparel line, Lark & Ro, made an estimated $1.9 million for Amazon — chump change — but AmazonBasics has become a $210 million business, according to 1010data estimates.And sales of Amazon's in-house children's apparel, Scout & Ro, grew fivefold over that same time frame, said the research firm.""The brick-and-mortar retailers who get good at marketing and good at telling those stories and get good at the human touch, I think, can beat Amazon,"" said Holbrook. ""But at this point, Amazon's trying a lot of different things in the private brand space. And they're going to figure it out.""

53,UAA,"Although it is plausible to suspect this, it is not true that the Credit Mobilier scandal of the late 1860-early 1870s (financial shenanigans by politicians and others surrounding construction of the Union Pacific Railroad) and the 1920s Teapot Dome scandal (shady dealings by politicians and others concerning government oil leases) were entangled with Division One college basketball programs. Back then, there were no such programs. About the 1970s Watergate scandal, however, suspicions remain.The college basketball season has begun under two odiferous clouds, making it reasonable to wonder why this athletic appendage of higher education seems so susceptible to smarminess. Here is a hint: This season will culminate in the March Madness tournament, for which the National Collegiate Athletic Association reaps, for its well-compensated self and its members, more than $700 million annually from various television entities whose coverage of the student-athletes (the NCAA's cherished locution) will be interspersed with commercials for beer and pickup trucks.In September, an ongoing FBI investigation produced 10 indictments, including those of four Division One assistant basketball coaches (from Arizona, Auburn, Oklahoma State and Southern California), and an executive of Adidas  (ADDYY), one of the shoe and apparel companies that spend princely sums to have their merchandise worn by college teams. (Under Armour (UAA) pays UCLA $18.7 million per year.) One assistant coach is charged with accepting bribes to connect an amateur ""blue chip"" recruit — presumptively NBA material — with a financial advisor.Seventeen days after these indictments, the NCAA's anemia was displayed when it said it could do nothing seriously punitive after its seven-year investigation of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, last season's NCAA basketball champion. UNC administered, for almost two decades, a ""shadow curriculum"" of 188 fake classes in the formerly named African and Afro-American Studies Department. Taken disproportionately (about half) but not exclusively by athletes, the classes required no attendance and only a minor paper. The NCAA — what is its purpose? — concluded that this was beyond its purview: The fraud was academic, not athletic, because some non-athletes also took the courses.Of the many proposals for fixing, or at least perfuming, the current system, the most common is to pay the players. This might serve equity. (Karl Marx had a piece of a point: Exploitation is depriving workers of the value created by their labor.) Coaches could share their share of the wealth: Kansas' Bill Self's total pay is $4,932,626, Duke's Mike Krzyzewski $5,550,475, Kentucky's John Calipari $7,435,376. Louisville's Rick Pitino made $7,769,200 until he was fired in October. He professed ignorance of goings on upstairs in the bordello: Pitino had been surprised to learn about the prostitutes-for-prospects dimension of Louisville's recruiting. Then he was surprised to land a prized recruit whose family allegedly received $100,000 plus monthly payments from Adidas.XBut paying the players sums commensurate with the value that their talents create would mean a few staggeringly large ""student-athlete"" salaries, and comparative pittances for the rest. It also probably would make the players qualify as university employees — hello, workers' compensation, unionization and other intricacies — and still would leave so much money sloshing through the system that there would be ample incentives to cut corners for competitive advantages.The Wall Street Journal's delightfully acerbic Jason Gay notes that the NBA (an $8 billion business) could afford to have academies where athletic prodigies could hone their skills agreeably free from the higher-education pretense. The NBA's developmental G League already is, for 18-year-olds, an alternative to college.The NBA's minimum age of 19 has produced the ""one-and-done"" travesty of ""blue chippers"" playing one season as cheap rentals (the price of athletic scholarships) at universities, then skedaddling to greener pastures. An NBA rule forbidding teams to sign a college player until three years after he matriculates would lessen universities' importance as incubators of NBA talent.However, no matter how many ameliorative measures are adopted, this truth will remain: There is no way gracefully — without unseemly accommodations — to graft onto universities an enormously lucrative entertainment industry. We have been warned (by the political philosopher Michael Oakeshott): ""To try to do something which is inherently impossible is always a corrupting enterprise."" But to be fair to basketball, the other high-revenue college sport has its difficulties. Twenty-four years ago, The New York Times noted: ""At the University of Washington, Don James resigned as head (football) coach after failing to notice that his quarterback owned three cars.""Click here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

Darrow said La-Z-Boy is in discussions with Amazon and Amazon marketplace, but that a final proposal isn't ready yet.Such a move would align with the strategy Darrow laid out on the call, which includes growing La-Z-Boy's online direct-to-consumer sales, using its supply chain to support other e-commerce brands, and investing in new online companies.Currently, La-Z-Boy products can be found on Amazon, but the retailer does not have an official brand page in the way that Under Armour (UAA) does or Nike (NKE) is planning on testing out.RELATED:From Blimps To Video, Here Are Ways Wal-Mart Is Battling AmazonHP, Lowe's, Williams-Sonoma Top Wednesday's Investing Action Plan

66,UAA,"Shares of Hibbett Sports (HIBB) collapsed Monday after the athletic specialty chain, which has over 1,000 stores, said that ""very challenging sales trends"" are weighing on same-store sales to the tune of a 10% decline in the second quarter.Comps have only crumbled by 10% or more on only one other occasion, said Quo Vadis Capital's John Zolidis — the July quarter of the financial crisis, when same-store sales sank 10.5%.Hibbett said it now expects a per-share loss of 19-22 cents in Q2, while analysts see a profit of 15 cents a share.Birmingham, Ala.-based Hibbett also debuted its new e-commerce site, Hibbett.com, in addition to a ""newly enhanced"" loyalty program. The move to sell products online is a late one in an age in which consumers assume that ""omnichannel,"" or seamless offline-to-online shopping, is a given.Hibbett shares had 33.5% meltdown in the stock market today, closing at 13.10, the lowest since early 2009.Nike, Under Armour and Adidas are all carried at Hibbett, but shoppers looking to buy online can find those brands at Foot Locker (FL) or Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS), or at the brands' own sites.Foot Locker shares fell 4.6%, and. Dick's lost 5.5%.In addition to investing heavily in its own direct-to-consumer efforts, athletic titan Nike (NKE) recently inked a deal to open it own brand shop on Amazon (AMZN). Under Armour (UAA) and Adidas (ADDYY) already have brand shops on Amazon and make products available to purchase on their own sites.But Hibbett executives insist that the company needed time to execute its plan properly.""Launching an e-commerce site has been a key strategic goal for Hibbett, and we took time to invest in our omnichannel infrastructure to do it the right way,"" said Hibbett CEO Jeff Rosenthal in a statement. ""Our main objective is to provide a seamless shopping experience for our customers with a platform that will allow us to significantly expand our assortment over time.""Zolidis said it is ""likely that some company-specific execution issue is behind the magnitude of the miss,"" and put Hibbett's weakness in the context of a slowing athletic trend, Nike's pullback from its wholesale customers as it invests in direct-to-consumer sales, and Hibbett's lack of an online shop until now.""As it turns out, those people living in small towns do have access to smartphones and they like the convenience of a larger selection and not having to drive to the store,"" he wrote. ""HIBB punctuated just how woefully late it is to offering e-commerce by announcing the final launch of this capability in the same press release today with the terrible news on sales and earnings.""RELATED:Nike Spikes To Buy Point After Scoring With Earnings, AmazonNike, Under Armour Retailer Hibbett Sinks On Weak Holiday

67,UAA,"Here's your Investing Action Plan for Tuesday: what you need to know as an investor for the day ahead.XAfter last week's department-store slump, more retailers are gearing up to report. And even though Home Depot (HD), TJX (TJX), Coach (COH), Urban Outfitters (URBN) and Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS) compete in separate categories — home improvement, off-price clothing, handbags, millennial apparel, athletic goods — there's little doubt that online behemoth Amazon and the broader shifting retail landscape are, to some degree, impacting them all.Analysts see the home-improvement retailer's Q2 per-share profit rising 12% to $2.21 on 5% revenue growth to $27.8 billion, according to Zacks Investment Research.Look for possible talk on the earnings call about Sears Holding's (SHLD) recent decision to sell Kenmore appliances on Amazon (AMZN). Home-improvement retailers such as Home Depot and Lowe's (LOW), which are big appliance sellers, sold off initially on that news. The sector generally has been  seen as having more of a buffer from the power of the e-commerce giant — but Amazon's foray into groceries, fashion and a host of other areas are enough to give retailers the jitters every time it makes a move.Shares dipped 0.4% to 154.26 in Monday's stock market trading. Home Depot, a Dow industrials component, is in a flat base with a 160.96 buy point.The T.J. Maxx and Marshalls parent is expected to report flat year-over-year EPS of 84 cents and 6% revenue gains to $8.32 billion.Off-price stores are another group that have, in the past, been labeled ""Amazon-proof"" as department stores struggle to adapt to a digital-first shopping environment. But growth has slowed for TJX and other off-price chains. Look for signs of continued resilience or potential chipping in its report. Off-price peer Ross Stores (ROST) reports later in the week.Shares fell 2.1% to 69.58. The stock is still trying to recover from a sharp sell-off that started in May.Purse and accessories maker Coach is seen growing profit by 9% to 49 cents a share while sales are expected to dip 0.7% to $1.15 billion.Handbag brands are in the midst of expanding their fashion houses, with Coach completing its $2.4 billion acquisition of Kate Spade last month, and competitor Michael Kors (KORS) announcing in late July that it's gobbling up luxury shoe brand Jimmy Choo.Coach, Kors and others have had to tangle with discounting at department stores as they try to maintain an image of accessible luxury.Cultivating demand with millennial and Gen Z consumers also appears to be a priority for Coach: Pop star Selena Gomez is the latest face of the brand.Shares rose 0.7% to 47.90, near three-year highs.Speaking of young people, Urban Outfitters is projected to report a 44% profit decline to 37 cents a share on a 3% sales dip to $864 million.Specialty teen-apparel retailers have been particularly hard-hit in recent years, as younger consumers gravitate toward experiences and clothing sales remain soft. In early June, Urban Outfitters said that its same-store sales for the second quarter, which it is set to report on Tuesday, were then already ""high-single-digit negative.""Cowen has long forecast that Amazon will unseat Macy's (M) as the nation's largest apparel retailer this year.Urban Outfitters shares fell 0.2% to 17.73, still near recent eight-year lows.Consensus is for 23% EPS growth on nearly 11% sales gains to $2.18 billion.The athleticwear and sporting-goods retailer — which carries Nike (NKE), Under Armour (UAA), Adidas (ADDYY) and other popular brands — was just one company whose stock took a hit in late June on news that Nike would be selling some of its footwear on Amazon.Dick's shares rose 2.7% to 34.91, but are near their worst levels since early 2012.Hibbett Sporting Goods (HIBB) and Foot Locker (FL) report later this week.Here's one company reporting Tuesday that's not like the others listed here. Wall Street expects China-based automotive online platform BitAuto (BITA) to post 22 cents EPS on $278.25 million in revenue, according to Yahoo Finance estimates.While still off its 2014 peak, the stock hit a two-year high on Monday, up 6.4% to 39.28.Rival Autohome (ATHM) reported strong results last week.RELATED:Giants Of China's Internet, U.S. Retail Lead Investing Action Plan J.C.

The stock gapped down 2.33 to 33.56  in heavy volume. Analysts at MKM Partners began coverage of Michael Kors with a sell rating and a 26 price target. The price target would suggest a roughly 20% haircut from the current price.The apparel group is in the middle of the pack — No. 97 among 197 industry groups. Not one stock in the industry group has a Composite Rating of 90 or better. The Composite Rating combines all five IBD ratings into a single number. A rating of 90 means the stock is rated in the top 10 percentile among all stocks in IBD's database.Under Armour (UAA) is another former leader that is struggling. The sports apparel company fell 0.62 to 19.98 in fast trade. In September 2015, Under Armour traded above 50.Pretax margins for Under Armour slid in the past two years, from 11.1% in 2014 to 9.8% and 8.1% in 2015 and 2016.Earnings rose 9% in 2016 vs. the previous year, but the Street expects earnings to drop 26% this year and then advance 19% in 2018.In the Nasdaq 100, Ulta Beauty (ULTA) dropped 9.70 to 259.12 in heavy volume. The former leader is 17% off a high marked in June. The specialty retail group is a market laggard.Among IBD's 197 industry groups, the day's top gainers included chip equipment makers and computer-related stocks.On the downside, gold miners and meat products took hard hits.RELATED:Why An Oil Supply Squeeze Looms3 Stocks Poised For Breakouts

70,UAA,"Nike's (NKE) lackluster performance in the key North America market — revenue for the region dropped 3% in fiscal Q1 — will be followed by another drop in Q2, but the greater worry is that weak trends at home could eventually infect its markets abroad.X""While we recognize that (Nike's) international business came in at or above expectations, it is not clear if solid execution overseas bodes well for a U.S. recovery, or if poor U.S. trends will spread to overseas markets,"" wrote Susquehanna's Sam Poser, cutting his price target to 47 from 54 on U.S. softness.""Unfortunately, U.S. performance seems to lead International performance, making a quick U.S. fix even more critical,"" Poser said.Overseas, the Swoosh still enjoys playing power, with China revenue up 9% in Q1, Asia Pacific-Latin America sales up 5% and Europe-Mideast-Africa revenue up 4%.Management sees North America revenue declining again in the current quarter, with international growth pushing up the overall top line by low-single digits. Consensus is for a 4% rise to $8.43 billion, according to Zacks Investment Research.The ""challenging dynamics"" in U.S. retail could hit full-year gross margin by 50 to 100 basis points vs. the prior year, said Nike CFO Andy Campion on a conference call with analysts late Tuesday. Q1 gross margins sank by 180 points due to foreign currency exchange rates and a higher mix of off-price sales.No longer reporting futures orders, a closely watched metric that measures products scheduled for delivery to retailers, Nike is focusing on its direct-to-consumer efforts to rally sales in the U.S. and Canada.""Nike's primary measure of success in North America in the near-term will be driving growth in our Nike Direct businesses and through new Nike consumer experiences with our strategic partners,"" he said.Shares dropped 1.9% to 52.67 in the stock market today, tumbling as low as 51.03 intraday and sinking out of a developing flat base with a 60.63 entry point. Under Armour (UAA) fell 0.7%, and U.S.-listed shares of Adidas (ADDYY) edged up 0.2% after losing 3% Tuesday on reports that an Adidas executive was implicated in a college basketball corruption probe.IBD'S TAKE: With thousands of publicly traded companies to choose from, how can you quickly find the best stocks to buy right now? A good starting point is to regularly review screens that highlight the top-rated equities.Despite the weak North American revenue in Q1, Nike still topped earnings forecasts, but Canaccord Genuity analyst Camilo Lyon dismissed it as a low-quality beat that was driven by taxes.Meanwhile, trouble continues to brew domestically, as an increasingly saturated athletic apparel market, the heated competition from rivals, and a general sluggishness in broader retail aren't helping Nike in the U.S.And, surprising even the experts, Adidas leapfrogged Nike's Jordan brand as the No. 2. athletic shoe brand in the country, said NPD last week.""Overall, until the product pipeline shows more promise, (North American) distribution is reset, promotions normalize, and speed initiatives are able to make a bigger impact, we believe the stock will remain range-bound,"" wrote Canaccord's Lyon.Amid the stock's current softness, however, Morgan Stanley sees an ""excellent 'buy low' opportunity,"" with Morgan Stanley analyst Jay Sole bullish on Nike's plans to re-implement its minimum advertised price policy with retailers; pull back from ""unhealthy"" distribution channels; and maintain the exclusivity of the Jordan brand — as well as its place among athleisure trends.""These courageous and arguably unexpected steps partially explain weak North America guidance,"" wrote Sole. ""Yet, they are critical in our view for Nike to ultimately resume healthy North America growth.""Nike is hosting an investor day on Oct. 25, and will likely offer updated guidance on its road map both at home and abroad.RELATED:Nike Earnings Beat, But Revenue In Largest Market Is Glaring Laggard4 Shoe Stocks In Bases, Buck Nike-Under Armour Slumps: Investing Action PlanEarnings Calendar, Analyst Estimates And Stocks To WatchRetail & E-Commerce Stocks And Industry News

A couple of key factors, say experts.Nike ""appears to have misjudged the appetite for some key marquee basketball product,"" wrote Susquehanna analyst Sam Poser last week, downgrading the Swoosh to neutral from a positive rating. Now there's an ""inordinate amount"" of KDs, LeBrons and Kobe shoes on shelves, according to Poser's recent store checks.""We do not believe the basketball business is dead,"" he said. ""Rather we believe a recovery in the basketball category in North America may take longer than we initially anticipated as excess product is cleared.""Cowen's John Kernan, who has a market perform rating on Nike, said he continues to see risk around the company's basketball business amid increased price-cutting in the category.""We recently saw (Under Armour)'s Curry 3 priced at $75 and see little demand at price points above $120 across the entire category,"" said Kernan, adding that there has also been ""significant"" promotional activity in men's and women's athletic apparel and footwear.Piper Jaffray noted an approximate 40% year-over-year rise in clearance styles on Nike.com through the quarter. Add to that a slowdown in same-store sales and digital trends, and Nike ""has yet to reach a bottom on its home turf,"" wrote analyst Erinn Murphy on Friday. She has a neutral rating on Nike.Nike shares rose 0.9% to 53.70 in the stock market today. The Dow component has been trading below its 50-day and 200-day moving averages after selling off in the wake of terrible results and guidance from athletic shoe retail giant Foot Locker (FL).Under Armour (UAA) dipped 1.4%, and Adidas (ADDYY) fell 3.2% to 110.13, falling below their 50-day line after an executive was implicated in an NCAA basketball scandal.

The company, which recently announced that it had embarked on a pilot test to sell certain products directly on Amazon, has not yet introduced its branded shop on the e-commerce site.Adidas and Under Armour both sell directly on the site through their own branded pages. Nike is currently sold through third-party sellers on Amazon.For the major athleticwear companies, an Amazon team-up raises the possibility of a big sales boost. Amazon indicated that it sold over a million pairs of shoes on Prime Day last year, Freedman said.An official sales agreement with Amazon would also give Nike more control over which products show up on the site, and a way to push back against unauthorized or potentially counterfeit listings, Bloomberg said last month.However, forging a deeper relationship with Amazon also raises concerns that Nike and its rivals could lose control over how those products are actually sold and marketed.""Amazon would be the only customer that Nike wouldn't have significant leverage over given Amazon is about three times larger than Nike from a sales perspective,"" Susquehanna said in a research note quoted last week by MarketWatch. ""So if Nike ever felt that Amazon was not presenting its brand properly, Nike would have very little ability to apply pressure in order to force Amazon to improve presentation.""Nike, Adidas, Hanesbrands (HBI)-owned Hanes and Under Armour are the most frequently bought brands on the site, said Morgan Stanley in April.Nike management made clear on its June earnings call, however, that it would be keeping most of its inventory guarded from the online behemoth.""It's really a small pilot and we have a very tailored assortment for Amazon, so that we can actually learn as we go through this,"" Nike Brand President Trevor Edwards said then.Nike (NKE) slipped 0.9% to 58.18 in the stock market today.

It raised full-year revenue guidance to $2.4 billion to $2.45 billion from $2.3 billion to $2.4 billion. But it slashed its EPS target to $1.67-$1.94 from $1.78-$2.19.Shares: RH dived 23% to 44.10 in after-hours trading. Shares of the upscale home furnishings retailer closed up 2% to 57.25 on the stock market today.RH shares have more than doubled since the retailer's last report, on Feb. 23, even though its fundamentals haven't been particularly strong. But after hitting a 16-month high of 60.11 on May 10, shares slumped the following day after the retailer tweaked its earnings outlook while forecasting a 23% jump in first-quarter net revenue. RH stock has been consolidating since then.Sales are expected to get a boost from the acquisition of Waterworks as well as higher outlet and warehouse sales.The California-based company completed a $300 million share buyback in Q1.RH has been faring far better than department-store retailers such as Macy's (M) and Nordstrom (JWN). The relentless rise of Amazon (AMZN) and e-commerce has been bruising traditional brick-and-mortar stores.Estimates: Consensus estimates call for EPS of 28 cents in Q1, down nearly 7%, on sales of $513 million, up 3.4%.Results: EPS rose to 32 cents while revenue climbed to $520.3 million.Outlook: Lululemon raised its full-year EPS range by 2 cents to $2.28-$2.32 but trimmed its full-year sales target to $2.53 billion to $2.58 billion.Stock: Shares rose 14.7% to 55.80 in after-hours trading.Lululemon closed up 0.8% to 48.67, but that's after hitting a 17-month low on Wednesday.Lululemon stock has tanked since its late March report, in which the Canadian yoga apparel maker and retailer's Q4 results and Q1 guidance both missed expectations.Lululemon faces competition from Under Armour (UAA), Nike (NKE) and others, with Amazon a looming threat. There's also the risk that the athleticwear trend will plateau.RELATED:Why The Stock Formerly Known As Restoration Hardware Sold OffLululemon Slashed On Slowing Sales; Conoco, EOG, CyberArk Raised

95,UAA,"Yet again, an NBA Finals that pits the Cleveland's LeBron James against Golden State's Steph Curry. Thus, yet again, another round of ""But what shoe company will win at the cash register?""Beyond the repeat matchup from last year, some things will still be the same when the Cleveland Cavaliers and the Golden State Warriors square off for Game 1 on Thursday. LeBron's shoes are still Nikes (NKE). Curry still wears Under Armour (UAA), and his signature shoes are still getting roasted on the internet. A ratings boom could translate into a windfall for both companies, even amid concerns about casual footwear chewing away at basketball-shoe sales.Despite this being the third straight championship with the Cavs and Warriors, a few things are different this time around — namely, Kevin Durant, Donald Trump, and increasing alarm out of the retail sector.Last year, the Warriors didn't have Durant, who enters the finals with his own signature-shoe launch from Nike. The new shoe could lend the athletic-footwear giant, which still accounts for far more market share than Under Armour more star power this year and promotional intrigue.About that promotion: A version of the new KDX sneaker, Durant's 10th signature, will be available on Thursday through Nike's SNKRS app starting at tipoff. But they'll only be available for purchase during the minutes when Durant is actually on the court during Game 1.Nomura analyst Simeon Siegel said in a research note that the KDX shoes ""have been sold out on Nike.com, and multiple stores we checked noted they did not receive pairs (although select locations did highlight having some sizes available).""Nike also said the LeBron Soldier 11 Court General would be available on Saturday. That shoe, the company said, was made ""with direct insight from the top scorer in playoff history"" and featured a gold swoosh intended as ""a nod to LeBron's quest for his fourth championship.""What's more, last year, the United States didn't have President Trump, who has presented a PR problem for Under Armour.In February, Under Armour CEO Kevin Plank said Trump was an ""asset"" to the U.S. In response, Curry, who supported Trump's election rival, Hillary Clinton, said that word choice was appropriate ""if you remove the 'et.'""Plank later tried to clarify his comments about Trump, taking out a full-page ad in the Baltimore Sun to say that the company stood ""firmly for equal rights"" and was ""publicly opposing"" Trump's travel ban.Backlash aside, the vacuum in the retail industry has only deepened over the past year. ""Peak athleisure"" for Under Armour has been a concern.Adidas throwback shoes have hurt Nike and Under Armour, but Foot Locker (FL) this month said the demand cycle for retro shoes has also been ""slowing down."" Sluggish sales related to the NBA All-Star Game in February and delayed tax refunds hurt overall U.S. athletic-footwear unit sales, which fell 2% in the first three months of this year, NPD Group said.And Under Armour in April said sales of its Curry shoes were ""sluggish.""Nike shares were up 0.1% at 52.99 on the stock market today, while Under Armour fell 2% to 19.16.IBD'S TAKE: Even as Under Armour struggles, one analyst in March said that the 'bottom' for its stock has formed, making for a possible buy opportunity. Last June, the austere white signatures released under Curry's name were seen as a kind of accidental foray into norm-core, and were likened to the bathtubs in a Cialis ad and photoshopped into a still from ""Forrest Gump.""In April, it happened again. Curry's new line of ""Oxblood Leather"" shoes were compared to ""a PT cruiser for your feet,"" ""the leather seats to an Acura"" and ""what Darth Vader wears when walking on a treadmill in a hotel gym at 6 a.m.""Curry has worn different versions of the Under Armour Curry 3ZERO during the playoffs, while Nike has rolled out new LeBron shoes during that time. Either way, many of Nike's Jordans series led sales in Q1, according to NPD Group.RELATED:Macy's Doesn't Know How To Fix Its Stores, Hopes Something Will WorkJ.C.

96,UAA,"Word on the Street is that Nike (NKE) will start selling its wares directly on Amazon (AMZN). That means shares of sports stores Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS) and Foot Locker (FL) are taking their turn at having an Amazon-induced anxiety attack Wednesday.X ""Our channel checks indicate that NKE could be close to finalizing an agreement to sell directly on Amazon.com as a wholesaler,"" wrote Goldman Sachs analyst Lindsay Drucker Mann in an early Wednesday note to clients.By midday, Bloomberg had reported, citing a source familiar with the matter, that Nike would sell footwear directly on Amazon through a brand-registry program in a bid to combat knockoff Nikes from appearing on the site.Nike, Adidas (ADDYY), Hanes (owned by Hanesbrands (HBI)) and Under Armour (UAA) are the most frequently bought brands on the site, per an April report from Morgan Stanley, which means Amazon is already a hot destination for customers looking for athleticwear.For Nike specifically, that could bring in an extra $300 million to $500 million in wholesale revenue from Amazon alone, estimated Goldman Sachs, which also said that such a partnership could allow Nike better control over its brand and inventory on the site, as well as access to coveted millennial shoppers.But that could mean fewer ring-ups at the cash register for sports apparel and equipment retailers. Foot Locker shares sank 5% to close at 47.82 in the stock market today, hitting a three-year low. Foot Locker is down more than 20% so far in June after crashing 23% in May.Dick's Sporting Goods tumbled fell 3.8% to the lowest in more than a year. Finish Line (FINL) lost 4% and Hibbett Sports (HIBB) shed 4%, with both falling to their worst levels since 2010.Nike did not respond immediately to a request for comment. Its shares finished 2% higher. Under Armour fell 0.8%, and Amazon rose 1%.It is worth pointing out that if such a deal were indeed to happen, it is not clear whether that would open Nike's entire arsenal of popular apparel and footwear brands to Amazon's reach — an important distinction when it comes to discussing the impact of a potential team-up on Nike's brand image and on sporting goods retailers.We do not know the scope here— Matt Powell (@NPDMattPowell) June 21, 2017Morgan Stanley, in a separate note from earlier this month, had already surmised that athletic apparel brands would sell directly to Amazon (instead of avoiding it altogether, like some retailers), but that they would have an ""appropriate-sized presence there,"" with products and price points that ""won't compromise the integrity of the offering elsewhere.""Nike is notably building out its own direct-to-consumer shops and online platform — so much so that it has muted the importance of its retailer-based ""futures"" metric —  and all the major athletic brands are developing their supply chain and manufacturing technology to increase speed to market.""The big athleticwear brands will offer much better product on non-Amazon channels,"" wrote Morgan Stanley analysts on June 6. ""If consumers want the hot fashion or the personalized products, they won't be able to get it on Amazon.""Notably, however, smaller rival Under Armour already sells direct on Amazon and through licensed dealers on Amazon Marketplace, said Goldman Sachs, an aspect which gives the Baltimore-based brand ""a clear edge over (Nike) in how fresh product was presented on Amazon.com.""Some worry about what Nike sales on Amazon would mean for the e-commerce giant's development of its own private apparel labels.Would signal Nike's death as Amazon is launching private labels and Nike would supply them with the data needed to build their athleisure.— Chris Burns (@archbyccb) June 21, 2017But Morgan Stanley's analysts said — at least, prior to Wednesday's chatter — that ""no private label maker will likely have a supply chain as fast that can deliver as much fashion newness, and this would be a major roadblock for Amazon because it too aims to move to a fast fashion model.""RELATED:Nike To Shrink Workforce As Stores Seen 'Canceling' Under ArmourNike, Adidas Have This 'Major Roadblock' Against Amazon 
"
97,UAA,"Nike (NKE) and Adidas (ADDYY) are in a heated race to evolve their supply chains and manufacturing technologies in order to get new product to market faster. But their innovations — digitized design, automated production, 3D printing — could also increase their share gains and create a shield against another rival: brick-and-mortar killer Amazon.com (AMZN).""Essentially, as brands and their retail partners get faster, they basically can offer a service level similar to what Amazon has, so the brands won't need Amazon as much as other vendors will,"" wrote Morgan Stanley analysts, adding that the major athleticwear brands are poised to offer better products on their own sites and non-Amazon channels.Nike and Adidas have each made moves to increase speed to market, shedding the old model in which new shoe styles could take up to 18 months to plod from conception to store shelves. In their deep-dive report, released Wednesday, the analysts pointed to these efforts leading to a 66%-or-more cut in supply chain lead times, reducing the chance of having ""bad"" (read: excessive, slow-moving) inventory and increasing sportswear makers' odds of keeping up with the latest trends. That could add an additional 15% to top-line growth, they said.They also projected almost 20% of Nike and Adidas' production being automated by fiscal 2023, a contrast from, say, Adidas' less-than-0.5% Speedfactory creations this year.The shift means that e-commerce giant Amazon might be the one catching up on nabbing the latest fashion or personalized products.""After the supply chain changes take hold, almost no small brand or private label footwear maker for the foreseeable future will be able to offer comparable quality products to what Nike and Adidas have at similar prices,"" they wrote.""Moreover, no private label maker will likely have a supply chain as fast that can deliver as much fashion newness and this would be a major roadblock for Amazon because it too aims to move to a fast fashion model.""Nike shares inched down 3 cents to close at 53.20 on the stock market today, peeping above its 200-day moving average for the first time in almost a month before giving up gains. U.S.-listed shares of Adidas fell 2.1% to 94.50. Under Armour (UAA) jumped 3% to 21.16, while Amazon ticked up 20 cents to 1,010.27.Plus, image-conscious athletic brands are likely to keep a close watch on what products of theirs are sold on Amazon. Calling brand image the ""biggest and most important asset"" for Nike and Adidas, analysts said they tend to lean toward presentation-friendly retailers like Foot Locker (FL).Aside from Nike and Adidas, Morgan Stanley says it sees Foot Locker and Flex (FLEX) (a high-tech manufacturing partner of Nike's) as winners from these industry changes.""Companies such as Under Armour, Skechers (SKX), and Wolverine World Wide (WWW) are working just as hard as their bigger rivals, but our view is they have a long way to go to catch up to Nike and Adidas,"" said analysts.Morgan Stanley sees sales in the athletic wear industry growing to $355 billion in 2021, which translates to 7% annual global growth from the current $290 billion market.RELATED:Nike Vows To Halve Product Cycle To 'Weeks, Not Months'; Stock Falls On Sales, MarginsVictoria's Secret, Nike Are Great, But Amazon Is Millennials' 'Most-Loved': SurveyFoot Locker Stock Plunges As Q1 Earnings, Sales Fall Short As Nike, Under Armour Stars Face Off Again, Here's What's Different

""We recommend owning Apple due to growing anticipation around iPhone X and a favorable trajectory for services revenue.""Late Tuesday, the iPhone and iPad maker announced results that beat Wall Street's estimates for fiscal third-quarter sales and earnings and guided sales higher for the current quarter.Apple shares climbed 4.7% to 157.14 on the stock market today, clearing a flat base with a buy point of 156.75.

100,UAA,"Nike's (NKE) fourth-quarter earnings and sales topper, as well as confirmation of its deal with Amazon.com, have lifted shares above a buy point Friday.The Swoosh shot up 12% to a 10-month high of 59.71 in afternoon trading on the stock market today, clearing a 59.10 entry from a flat base. Shares closed up 11% at 59, just below that buy point.XBut amid all the excitement about the stock surge, here are three key takeaways from Nike's earnings call late Thursday and analysts' reactions to it.Before the announcement to pilot-test the sale of products directly on Amazon (AMZN), Nike had already been focused on digital and direct-to-consumer selling via its own website and had touted the progress it was seeing.The Amazon deal, which includes certain Nike shoes, clothes and accessories, was reportedly made to guard against counterfeiting and third-party selling on the e-commerce site.Nike CEO Mark Parker said on the earnings call Thursday that the overall aim is to ""elevate the consumer experience by better segmenting and differentiating all of our channels.""That is to say, people like shopping on Amazon, and Nike could only hold out for so long.""NKE's intent is to elevate its brand presentation and storytelling across all channels, and we suspect AMZN will replace the distribution that does not do just that,"" said Canaccord Genuity's Camilo Lyon.For now, don't expect Nike — fiercely protective of its brand image — to start selling all of its merchandise on Amazon just yet.""It's really a small pilot and we have a very tailored assortment for Amazon, so that we can actually learn as we go through this,"" said Nike Brand President Trevor Edwards on the call.The company might want to proceed with caution, since it will still rely on retailers like Foot Locker (FL) and Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS) to sell Nike products.""Two-thirds of NKE's business is still through legacy distribution channels and wholesale arrangements, indicating that the company should move carefully,"" wrote Quo Vadis Capital analyst John Zolidis.Analysts also see Nike sales on Amazon as less of a threat to Foot Locker and more of a threat to department stores, with UBS' Michael Binetti writing, ""... our sense is that product sold on AMZN is more likely to overlap with d-stores/family footwear chains than with FL/FINL.""Growth abroad is strong, but the North American market — where revenue edged up just 1% in Q4 — is still highly competitive.Nike CFO Andy Campion projected ""overall growth"" in North America in fiscal 2018 ""with slight contraction in the first part of the year as we aggressively drive the strategic shift.""For fiscal 2018, the company sees currency-neutral revenue growth in the mid- to high-single-digit range. Consensus is for about 6% revenue growth, according to Zacks Investment Research.Meanwhile, Adidas (ADDYY) continues to steadily nip at Nike's heels. And while Piper Jaffray likes Nike's new initiatives and its team-up with Amazon, ""(we) do not expect them alone to change athletic fundamentals as Adidas is focused on many similar initiatives already,"" wrote analyst Erinn Murphy.""Bottom line, despite initiatives, we worry NKE's embedded 2H recovery is dependent on an Adidas' stumble and near flawless execution given worsening digital/(same-store sales) trajectories,"" she said.Adidas shares were up 2.2%, and Under Armour (UAA) added 2.1%.RELATED:Nike, Micron, Regeneron Get Price Target Hikes; Walgreens Is A BuyNike Deal With Amazon Sends Dow Stock Soaring

101,UAA,"Vince Holdings (VNCE) is having a terrible morning. Shares of the luxury apparel brand are spiraling down nearly 50% after management expressed ""substantial doubt about the company's ability to continue"" as a going concern due to its inability to ""comply with the consolidated net total leverage ratio under its term loan facility.""This follows Bebe (BEBE), which said last week it will shutter all stores by the end of May, and Sears Holding (SHLD) talk of ""substantial doubt"" in late March about its own survival.Other retailers that have filed for bankruptcy in recent months include Wet Seal, BCBG Maxzria and Payless ShoeSource.For the fourth quarter, Vince swung to a 15-cent adjusted per-share loss on a 22% sales tumble to $63.9 million, falling well short of Street forecasts for a 5-cent per-share loss on revenue of $74.6 million.The company, which has over 50 stores, remains hopeful.""Despite these recent challenges, we are encouraged by the improved performance we have seen in our direct-to-consumer channel in the first quarter, led by our e-commerce business as a result of enhancements we have made to the website and the positive response that we have driven with our marketing and social media efforts,"" said CEO Brendan Hoffman in the earnings statement.Shares of Vince tumbled 26% to 1.00 on the stock market today.

But while Wal-Mart closed at two-year highs, the other retailers had a less-positive day.Children's Place (PLCE) delivered a beat-and-raise quarter that has shares shot up initially in the stock market today, as profit grew 48% to $1.95 a share and revenue rose 4% to $436.7 million from the prior-year quarter.That easily beat consensus for $1.64 a share on sales of $422.5 million.Same-store sales rose 6.1%, which the children's clothier said was its highest Q1 comparable-sales figure ""in over a decade."" The highly watched metric is a contrast to the negative slide from department stores last week and from Target (TGT) on Wednesday.Children's Place ""continues to execute extremely well in a tough environment,"" wrote FBR analyst Susan Anderson, ""with strong inventory control, expanding (average unit retail), and margin expansion.""The company upped its full-year outlook to $7.10-$7.20, up from prior guidance for $6.50-$6.65. Analysts are currently looking for $6.66 a share for 2017.Children's Place shares shot up to 124.90 soon after the open, just below Monday's record 125.30, but reversed sharply, closing down 0.45% at 111.10.Ralph Lauren (RL) beat on both the top and bottom lines. Earnings grew 1% to 89 cents a share, beating views for 78 cents; revenue fell 16% to $1.57 billion, but the slide wasn't as bad as expected. Still, Ralph Lauren, apparel retailer and clothier, reversed from early gains to finish off 1.9%.And shares of Victoria's Secret owner L Brands (LB) did manage to close up 2.6% after disclosing Q1 results late Wednesday that did not disappoint, even as same-store sales dropped 9%. The company nudged up full-year profit guidance to $3.10-$3.40 from $3.05-$3.35.Sporting goods retailer Hibbett (HIBB), which carries Nike (NKE), Adidas (ADDYY), Under Armour (UAA) and other popular brands, beat on profit. Hibbett's same-store sales, however, fell 4.9% in Q1. Shares initially ran up to 24.75, but reversed to trade down 0.65% to 22.90.On the flip side, things are pretty bad for Ascena Retail Group (ASNA). The parent of women's apparel brands Ann Taylor, Loft and dressbarn, among others, is tanking in a major way, down 26.8% to 2.07 after slashing Q3 and full-year guidance. Ascena hit 17-year low of 1.65 intraday.Management now expects 10-15 cents in fiscal 2017 earnings, a fraction of its earlier guidance for 37-42 cents. For Q3, it sees 4-6 cents EPS, down from 7-12 cents in prior outlook.Ascena CEO David Jaffe said ""we ... no longer believe it appropriate to expect a stabilization of traffic and resulting normalization of comp sales against softer demand in the year-ago period.""

103,UAA,"X Even TJX (TJX), one of the rare shining gems of the retail sector, is getting munched Tuesday after falling short of revenue, same-store sales and guidance estimates.Investors likely hoped the off-price heavyweight — parent to T.J. Maxx, Marshalls and HomeGoods — and home-improvement chain Home Depot (HD) would offer bright spots for the retail-weary who had had enough of the dismal results coming out of Macy's (M) and its department store brethren last week.Off-price and home improvement, after all, are often highlighted as retail segments that show some resistance to Amazon's (AMZN) viral spread.Home Depot shares rose to a record high intraday after earnings and sales topped views.But, TJX shares, down 4% to 73.81 in the stock market today, are getting shoved around in the same manner as retail peers Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS) and Staples (SPLS).Athletic apparel and equipment retailer Dick's plunged 13.7% to 41.03, hitting its lowest level since June 2016. First-quarter earnings met expectations at 54 cents a share, up 8%, but revenue missed forecasts by a hair (sales rose 10% to $1.83 billion), and same-store sales growth of 2.4% disappointed.Susquehanna analyst Sam Poser remains an advocate for the retail chain, which carries Nike (NKE), Under Armour (UAA), Adidas (ADDYY) and other popular athletic brands.He says Dick's ""has an issue with the 1Q17 calendar, not with Amazon,"" citing calendar shifts, and posits that full-year guidance is ""reasonable, as the noise subsides.""What ails the retail sector is multifold: an overabundance of brick-and-mortar stores, a sluggish apparel space, the continual shift to online shopping and, of course, Amazon.Office-supply giant Staples reported a same-store sales decline of 3% in Q1, as per-share profit met views for 17 cents and revenue sank a more-than-anticipated 19% to $4.15 billion. Analysts were expecting $4.5 billion.Office supplies is another area that Amazon has encroached upon in its rise to the top.Staples shares fell 3.5% to 8.99, tumbling back below their 50-day moving average but closing just above their 200-day line after sinking to 8.81 intraday.Urban Outfitters (URBN) reported weaker-than-expected earnings, revenue and comps after the market close. Earnings per share tumbled to 13 cents a share while revenue was $761 million. Analysts had projected a 36% profit decline to 16 cents a share on less than 1% revenue growth to $768.1 million.Urban Outfitters' same-store sales fell 3.1% more than expected.Shares of the young-adult apparel chain fell initially in late trading, but then reversed higher for a 1% gain. Urban Outfitters shares fell 2.3% to 20.46, hitting a 16-month low intraday.The stock has hardly glimpsed light above their 50-day moving average this calendar year, as teen and youth stores struggle to attract an audience. Aeropostale and Wet Seal have filed for bankruptcy, and Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF) once the hit of the early aughts, confirmed last week that it is in early-stage talks to be bought out.

Cisco shares reclaimed their 50-day line as the stock works on a flat base with a 34.63 entry.On the downside, Caterpillar (CAT) experienced a 1.9% decline, while financial components JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS) fell 1.4% and 1%, respectively. Energy name Chevron (CVX) dropped 1% in conjunction with weakness in oil prices, which fell 2.5%.

105,UAA,"Amazon's (AMZN) Whole Foods (WFM) acquisition, the launch of Prime Wardrobe, and Nike's (NKE) decision to sell directly on the e-commerce site have shaken up the grocery and broader retail space, but recent sell-offs could actually prompt ""more investable"" opportunities in retail, says one analyst.X ""Although it may take time for investors to be willing to re-enter the space, we believe this may actually have made the 'winners' within our retail/brands coverage (which have already been coping through the Amazon threat) more investable,"" wrote Instinet analyst Simeon Siegel on Monday, arguing that apparel ""is no 'deader' than it was two weeks ago.""Who are the Amazon-resistant names on his list? Ulta Beauty (ULTA), TJX (TJX), Ross Stores (ROST), Nike and Signet Jewelers (SIG). Ralph Lauren (RL) is also seen potentially benefiting.""With fewer 'safe havens' across the broader consumer landscape, multiple premiums around anything thought to be 'safe' will likely be reinforced,"" he said.Amazon closed down 1% at 993.98 in the stock market today. Ulta finished 1.8% higher, TJX added 1%, Ross gained 0.7%, Nike rose 0.8%, and Signet climbed 3.2%.And while Amazon's foray into ""try before you buy""-style at-home shopping with Prime Wardrobe treads further onto department store and apparel retailers' turf, Siegel wonders if the offering could actually be a boost for brands, given the number of store closures happening on the brick-and-mortar level.The additional distribution provided by Amazon, of all places, could help offset lost distribution at department stores, he said.IBD's TAKE: Meanwhile, Amazon chief Jeff Bezos and other tech heads met with India Prime Minister Narendra Modi ahead of Modi's meeting with President Trump on Monday. For the latest on FANG stocks, check out IBD's hub on all things Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google. Nike, Under Armour (UAA), Adidas (ADDYY), PVH (PVH), Ralph Lauren, and Hanes Brands (HBI), which have wide wholesale distribution to department stores ""could stand to gain the most from syncing up with the Amazon machine, as the site's success could provide a new form of wholesale distribution, offering some protection from the structural challenges facing the current establishment,"" Siegel added.Furthermore, he said wider apparel distribution on Amazon would actually help to bolster full-price retail and thereby protect off-pricers like TXJ and Ross Stores.RELATED:Wal-Mart Is Not Mulling A Rival Bid For Whole Foods: ReportHere's The Latest Group Having An Amazon-Induced Anxiety Attack

106,UAA,"Wall Street analysts on Tuesday raised their price targets on internet television network Netflix (NFLX), home appliance maker Whirlpool (WHR) and graphics-chip maker Nvidia (NVDA), but lowered their outlook for sports apparel firm Nike (NKE) and chipmaker ON Semiconductor (ON).Guggenheim Securities reiterated its ""best idea"" buy rating on Netflix and raised its price target on the stock to 180 from 175.X""Netflix remains our best idea in the media industry as the company continues to invest in its compelling global content creation and distribution model, and expands its subscriber base,"" Guggenheim analyst Michael Morris said in a note to clients. ""Usage data clearly indicates that people around the world enjoy engaging with Netflix with increasing frequency.""Los Gatos, Calif.-based Netflix is making ""rational investments"" in content (about $8 billion in spending estimated in 2017) and is building a big lead in the subscription streaming video market, he said.Netflix shares closed down 0.9% at 152.05 on the stock market today.Pacific Crest Securities raised its ratings on Marvell Technology (MRVL) and Nvidia, but lowered its rating on ON Semiconductor.Pacific Crest upgraded chipmaker Marvell to overweight from sector weight and set a price target of 22. It also upgraded Nvidia to sector weight, or neutral, from underweight, or sell, while turning negative on ON Semi, lowering its rating to sector weight from overweight.The investment bank likes Marvell because of its pricing power in switches, multiple design wins, and sales momentum in the data-center business.Marvell stock rose 0.4% to 17.52, Nvidia dipped 0.15 to 157.09, while On Semi fell 3.6% to 15.08.Investment bank Cowen kept its market perform rating on Nike, but lowered its price target to 53 from 54.Beaverton, Ore.-based Nike is facing heightened North American competition in an increasingly promotional environment with rivals Adidas and Under Armour (UAA).""Our checks show elevated promotions continue on footwear (basketball, running and lifestyle) and apparel throughout North America (45% of sales) which also coincides with a more promotional cadence from Under Armour and Adidas,"" Cowen analyst John Kernan said in a report.Nike fell 0.9% to 51.56 Tuesday.RBC Capital Markets maintained its ""top pick"" buy rating on Whirlpool and increased its price target to 226 from 216.""We believe that Whirlpool's ability to achieve its long-term financial targets that were outlined at its recent investor day (May 4th) combined with expectations for multiple expansion should translate into share price appreciation,"" RBC analyst Robert Wetenhall said in a report.

107,UAA,"Adidas (ADDYY) is on a tear. Fiscal 2016 saw the athletic footwear and apparel brand raise its guidance four times, and its view-topping first quarter of 2017, reported late Wednesday, shows that momentum in North America is ""break(ing) out,"" according to Piper Jaffray's Erinn Murphy in a Thursday note.And it looks like Adidas is gaining shelf space in stores as market data points to major growth in footwear.In the key North America market, where competition remains fierce, revenue surged 31%, including a 36% jump at the flagship Adidas brand.""We believe this strength is supported by distribution gains across the space including accounts like Journeys, Foot Locker, Dick's,"" said Murphy.That strength is perhaps made more impressive by the fact that sales in the U.S. athletic footwear market dropped 3% in the first three calendar months of 2017, according to new NPD Group data.Adidas footwear sales rose nearly 85% during that period, NPD said, vs. Nike's (NKE) ""high single-digit"" decline. Under Armour (UAA) shoe sales fell in the double digits, ""though the brand's expansion into national chains helped offset significant losses in the athletic specialty/sporting goods channel,"" wrote NPD's Matt Powell.Adidas' U.S. shares rose 1.4% to 100.65 at the close on the stock market today. Nike, a member of the Dow Jones industrial average, dipped 6 cents to 54.47. Under Armour ticked up to 20.42.Still, Nike's remains king of the court in the U.S. The Swoosh has projected $20 billion in North America revenue by 2020, compared to Adidas' previously announced goals for about $5.3 billion within the same time frame.""The clear momentum into 2017 for adidas suggests that its competitor Nike may not be out of the woods yet and Under Armour will have a much tougher time defending its turf in (North America),"" wrote Murphy.Journeys and Lids parent Genesco (GCO) ""remains the best way to play adidas in small cap,"" and Foot Locker ""likely continues to benefit from the strength in the adidas brand,"" she added.IBD'S TAKE: Adidas CEO Kasper Rorsted told IBD in March that its previous strategy ""has given room for a Nike to grow, and also for an Under Armour,"" and is ""still in catch-up mode."" But the company is storming back in the U.S.Genesco fell 1.5%. Foot Locker (FL) shares lost 1%. Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS) dipped 0.3%.Overall in Q1, Adidas' currency neutral revenue grew 16%, or 19% in euro terms, to 5.671 billion euro, fueled by ""double-digit increases"" in the running and outdoor segments, said the company, in addition to its ""originals"" and Adidas Neo units. That included 18% growth at the flagship Adidas brand and 13% at Reebok, excluding currency.Outside of the U.S. and Canada, Greater China revenue led the way with 30% growth, following by 21% gains in Japan and 15% growth in the Middle East, Africa and other Asian markets. Western Europe sales rose 10%. Latin America revenue grew 9%. Russia revenue fell 10% on a currency-neutral basis.E-commerce revenue grew 53% during the quarter.Adidas' management maintained full-year guidance for 11%-13% in revenue growth and a 18%-20% rise net income.RELATED:Victoria's Secret, Nike Are Great, But Amazon Is Millennials' 'Most-Loved': SurveyNike Tanks As Q3 Results Fan Flames Of Adidas' Beast-Mode Comeback

109,UAA,"X Shares of Under Armour (UAA) dropped Monday amid a downgrade to underperform from FBR Capital and lukewarm findings from Piper Jaffray on the athletic apparel brand's performance at Kohl's (KSS) so far.FBR analyst Susan Anderson cut her rating on Under Armour and pulled her price target to 14 from 20. Among other factors, she cited the brand's declining popularity in an FBR poll, dearth of footwear innovation, plus an ""intensifying"" price war between Nike (NKE) and Under Armour following the latter's debut at Kohl's a month ago.At direct-to-consumer channels, Nike outlets have been more promotional, said Anderson, and Under Armour has been discounting ""significantly"" year over year. At the wholesale level, athletic goods outlets such as Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS) and department stores such as Macy's (M) have ""ramped up promos, we believe in response to intensified promos now at Kohl's, particularly in men's/kids',"" she wrote.Piper Jaffray noted separately that both brands have been promotional at Kohl's, though ""Nike still outsells Under Armour,"" despite consumer interest in Under Armour's arrival at the midtier department store. Analyst Erinn Murphy also pointed to Under Armour's sluggishness at Kohl's in the key women's segment, and concern that the brand's debut isn't bringing in incremental customers.""We worry that Kohl's $3.5 billion Athletic & Wellness category cannot sustain (double-digit) growth in 2017 and the addition of UAA will likely have cannibalistic effects on peer athletic brands,"" she said. ""Our concerns about UAA's ability to drive sales as KSS were escalated further when DSW (DSW) announced it will be carrying UAA in time for back-to-school 2017.""Meanwhile, a Barron's report that the stock could ascend by 30% in a year, reportedly on its prospects at Kohl's and room to run abroad.Under Armour shares initially rose in the stock market today, reversed as low as 19.20 before closing at 19.63, off 0.8%.Barron's highlighted Under Armour's investments in collegiate sponsorships and its prominence in the NCAA Final Four after spending $71 million across a decade to become the outfitter of the South Carolina Gamecocks.South Carolina brought home the women's national championship title on Sunday after beating Mississippi State. In the men's division, the Gamecocks lost 73-77 to the Gonzaga Bulldogs on Saturday.North Carolina and Gonzaga will face off in the championship game Monday night.

110,UAA,"Lululemon Athletica (LULU) reported weaker-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings and weak guidance after the closing bell Wednesday, sending shares crashing in late trading. Here's what the maker and retailer of yoga and other athletic apparel delivered.Estimates: Analysts see Lululemon Athletica reporting a 19% EPS rise to $1.01 with revenue climbing 11% to $783.6 million. That would be the third straight quarter of decelerating sales growth.Results: Lululemon earned $1 a share excluding various items. Revenue rose 12% to $789.9 million. Same-store sales, including e-commerce, grew 8%. Direct-to-consumer sales rose 12%.Outlook: The company sees Q1 revenue of $510 million to $525 million with EPS of 25-27 cents, with total same-store sales falling in the mid-single digits. Analysts expected sales of $552.35 million and EPS of 39 cents. For the full year, Lululemon predicts revenue of $2.55 billion to $2.60 billion and EPS of $2.26-$2.36. Wall Street had predicted sales of $2.62 billion and EPS of $2.57.""Although we've had a slow start to 2017, our teams are passionately committed to delivering on our robust plans across product innovation, digital, North America and international as we realize our ambitious vision for the future,"" CEO Laurent Potdevin said in a statement.Lululemon said its Q1 sales slowdown is concentrated in e-commerce, which is not a good sign given how overall clothing sales are growing rapidly online. Store traffic also has been weak.Stock: Lululemon shares plunged 18% to 54.30 in after-hours trading. Lululemon had closed up 4.1% to 66.30 in heavy volume on the stock market today, above its 50-day moving average after largely trading below that key support area for more than a month. The stock is stuck below its 200-day line, and has been not made much headway for the past four years.Lululemon Athletica was at the vanguard of the activewear trend for many years, but then stumbled on its own missteps as well as increasing competition from the likes of Nike (NKE), Under Armour (UAA), with Amazon (AMZN) reportedly mulling a push into that apparel category.Nike reported strong earnings last week, but weak sales, margins and futures orders worried investors, at least initially. Under Armour, which has expanded its women's apparel in recent years, has faltered in recent months.Lululemon, for its part, is trying to expand from its women's apparel origins to appeal to men as well.Nike stock edged 0.1% higher during the regular session as it continues to recoup its post-earnings 7% tumble on March 22. Under Armour rose 3.6% but is less than a week from hitting a 3 1/2-year low.

112,UAA,"Like a pro athlete, Nike (NKE) knows that it needs to tweak its strategy from time to time to stay competitive.XOn its fourth-quarter earnings call on Thursday, Wall Street will likely be looking for more commentary on the athletic footwear and apparel maker's new consumer-focused initiatives intended to keep it in sync with a digitally driven retail environment and ahead of rivals Adidas (ADDYY) and Under Armour (UAA). Nike's recent sales arrangement with Amazon (AMZN)? Expect questions about that too.For the quarter, Wall Street expects flat year-over-year per-share earnings of 49 cents on 4.5% revenue growth to $8.61 billion, according to Zacks Investment Research. That would mark a second flat Q4 for EPS and a slight slowdown in sales growth.The results will come roughly two weeks after Nike announced a new ""consumer direct offense"" alignment. That effort reorganizes Nike's leadership and geographic structure and tightens its focus on a dozen key cities across the world that are expected to account for 80% of its projected growth through 2020.Part of Nike's new game plan also involves what it calls a ""triple double"" goal to double innovation, speed to market and direct engagement with customers. The plan also includes laying off 2% of its global workforce. Nike shares fell more than 3% on June 15, the day of the news.Nike and other major athletic apparel and footwear brands are all developing manufacturing and supply-chain technologies to get on-trend products on shelves faster. Under Armour this week also announced a leadership shuffle of its own, reviving its COO position.The sluggish retail environment has raised questions about how and where individual brands will sell their products, as brick-and-mortar stores like Macy's (M) and J.C. Penney (JCP) struggle to shore up store traffic amid competition from Amazon and off-price chains.Nike will reportedly sell footwear directly on Amazon in an attempt to combat the sale of knockoff goods at the e-commerce giant. That could spell trouble for J.C. Penney and Kohl's (KSS), Gordon Haskett analyst Charles Grom said last week.Shares of Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS) and Foot Locker (FL) immediately took a hit on news of a possible Nike-Amazon team-up — perhaps not without reason. Nike, Adidas, Hanesbrands (HBI)-owned Hanes and Under Armour are the most frequently bought brands on Amazon, Morgan Stanley said in April.As Nike dials down the emphasis on its self-created ""futures orders"" — a metric designed to reflect retailer demand — it is dialing up its own in-house manufacturing and selling capabilities, with aims to halve its product-creation cycle and streamline its brick-and-mortar and online retail experiences.Still, Cowen this month trimmed its price target on Nike to 53 from 54 on increased promotional activity amid its rivalry with Adidas and Under Armour, and JPMorgan downgraded the stock to neutral from overweight.Morgan Stanley analyst Jay Sole said earlier this month that the market is expecting Nike to guide fiscal 2018 profit below consensus for $2.52 per share — Zacks currently puts consensus at $2.44 — but that those expectations have already been priced into the stock. He has an equal-weight rating on the stock.Given ""poor"" sentiment and high short interest in Nike, Sole sees bulls snapping up shares of the athletic brand after the market digests the company's full-year guidance on Thursday.Nike shares closed up 0.8% at 53.36 on the stock market today, hitting resistance on the underside of their converging 50-day and 200-day lines. The stock is up less than 5% so far in calendar 2017, underperforming the S&P 500.

114,UAA,"Mall-based athletic shoe retailer Foot Locker (FL) gave weak earnings guidance for its fiscal first quarter, citing delayed tax refunds, but said same-store sales rebounded in March and have remained strong in April, pushing shares higher.Foot Locker said it expects earnings in its fiscal Q1 ending April 29 to be 1.36-$1.39 a share, flat to down vs. a year earlier and below the analyst estimate for $1.47. Back on the retailer's Q4 conference call on Feb. 24, executives had said this quarter would be challenging.On Thursday, Foot Locker blamed the delay in tax refund checks.""We believe the delay in the issuance of the vast majority of income tax refund checks until after the NBA All-Star Game significantly affected our February comparable store sales, which were down low-double digits,"" said CEO and Chairman Richard Johnson.But Johnson noted that March comps rose in the ""high-single digits"" and said April comps are likely up in the ""low double digits, which we see as confirmation that the customer's appetite for our exciting product assortments has not changed.""Foot Locker shares initially crashed nearly 8% in the premarket on the news, but reversed higher and traded up 5.4% to 76.55 on the stock market today, vaulting above the 50-day moving average. Foot Locker has a potential buy point of 77.80.Nike (NKE), a Dow Jones industrial average component and a key seller via Foot Locker, rose 1% to 56.40.

115,UAA,"Under Armour's (UAA) popularity is fading among teenage boys, said Piper Jaffray on Monday, and new research shows that it might not just be teens that are cooling on the Baltimore-based athletic apparel brand.Google search trends have been ""relatively flat"" so far in the first few months of the year, said FBR in a Tuesday note — except, of course, February's PR kerfuffle after Under Armour CEO Kevin Plank made ill-received comments about President Trump.More notably, Under Armour's Stephen Curry-related search traffic growth has flattened since mid-2016, said the firm, marking a complete reversal from the past two years of ""consistent search growth,"" i.e. increased Googling of the Golden State Warriors MVP during the NBA season.""We believe this shows a continued decline in (Under Armour's) resonance with consumers that could pressure UA at least near term,"" wrote FBR analyst Susan Anderson, who reiterated an underperform rating. ""These search results are consistent with our view that UA is lagging in innovation and in the deep sponsorship roster that drives web traffic.""That appears to echo Piper Jaffray's findings that Under Amour isn't cool — even though athleisure is still hot.""While athletic brands account for 41% of top-teen apparel choices today versus 26% last year, Under Armour is not seeing the incremental benefit (still 2% share or less in upper income group),"" wrote Piper Jaffray analyst Erinn Murphy on Monday. ""What we are seeing, however, is Nike (NKE) continuing to maintain its apparel dominance and Adidas significantly accelerating its share in the category.""Under Armour shares fell 1.6% to 19.42 on the stock market today. Nike shares rose 1 cent to 54.91. U.S.-listed shares of Adidas (ADDYY) dipped 0.65% to 93.46.FBR's Anderson also pointed again to the ""intensifying"" price war between Under Armour and Nike, and the firm's findings that Under Armour shoes aren't as popular with consumers as they used to be.IBD'S TAKE: Nike is no longer the top ""new"" brand for teen boys, said Piper Jaffray. This is. The Google trends are additionally concerning for Under Armour's sales prospects for its line of Curry-branded footwear.""A significant portion of UA's growth over the past year has come from the Curry shoe (we estimate 10% contribution growth to footwear), and while Curry is still popular, we believe the shoe has plateaued for now,"" said Anderson.Curry was recently trending in sports circles on Twitter, however — his new Curry Lux ""Oxblood Leather"" shoe was subject to mockery on the internet. Steph is selling a PT Cruiser for your feet pic.twitter.com/QCfaTeB47W— Zach Harper (@talkhoops) April 9, 2017But there's a chance Steph Curry and Under Armour could get the last laugh despite not being cool or popular.

116,UAA,"Nike (NKE) stayed on top of the collegiate branding game as the North Carolina men's basketball team — with a healthy dose of the company's trademark ""swooshes"" emblazoned on their uniforms — brought home the NCAA championship Monday night.But that doesn't mean Nike can get too comfortable.Argus Research analyst John Staszak downgraded the athletic apparel giant to hold from buy, projecting slowing growth over the next year on increased competition from Under Armour (UAA) and Adidas (ADDYY), according to The Fly.That these two peers are nipping at Nike's heels isn't news, but the race is getting heated in the key U.S. market, particularly as Adidas aims to grow its share in the region.Under Armour was on the receiving end of a downgrade Monday as FBR pointed to an ""intensifying"" price war between the Baltimore-based brand and Nike following Under Armour's debut at Kohl's last month. Piper Jaffray noted Monday that Nike is still outselling Under Armour at the mid-tier department store.Shares of Nike dipped 0.9% to close at 55.04 on the stock market today.Two weeks ago, Nike recorded a big earnings beat but fell short of revenue and gross margin estimates.

117,UAA,"X Nike (NKE), a member of the Dow Jones industrial average, is tanking hard Wednesday in the wake of a third-quarter revenue miss, worse-than-projected gross margin and perhaps most significantly, a rising perceived threat from a once-fading rival at home.Shares fell 7% to 53.92 on the stock market today, gapping below the 50-day moving average and closing below the 200-day line.Nike was the worst performer on the Dow industrials and the S&P 500 index. Blame the Dow's fifth straight loss on Nike, which subtracted 28 points from the blue chip index while the Nasdaq climbed 0.5%. Nike delivered a big earnings beat, largely due to lower sales, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses. But revenue growth of 5% missed estimates and the weakest gain in five quarters. ""Futures orders,"" i.e. products scheduled for delivery to retailers, fell 4% (1% excluding currency), widely below expectations.Still the world's dominant activewear brand, Nike is hard to topple, even amid a lackluster retail environment. But Adidas' re-emergence as a beast of a competitor has the Street paying attention, and it may not be enough for Nike to simply trim SG&A.The Swoosh ""is the most efficient company in global retail (40% ROIC) but SG&A rate declines may not be sustainable as Under Armour and Adidas invest heavily in N. America,"" wrote Cowen analyst John Kernan, who has a market perform rating on the stock.Adidas, under the helm of new leadership, said at its recent investor day that it is aiming for $5.3 billion in revenue in the key North America market in 2020. That's a far cry from Nike's projections for $20 billion in the region in the same time frame, but NPD Group's Matt Powell tweeted last week that that would bring Adidas' U.S. market share to the low teens, its highest in decades.Global No. 2 Adidas has only in recent months taken back the runner-up spot from Under Armour (UAA) in the U.S. market, according to NPD data, but in Tuesday's call, it was Nike that at times sounded like it was playing catch-up.Nike CFO Andy Campion said he was ""pleased"" with Q3 but ""at the same time, we are not satisfied,"" which appeared to echo, or perhaps respond to, Adidas CEO Kasper Rorsted's comments two weeks ago that he was happy with the company's progress in the U.S. but not pleased with the brand's position overall.""Post the call, we see potential for even greater near-term Adidas' share gain in (North America) than before and see shelf-space risk rising for (Under Armour),"" wrote Piper Jaffray's Erinn Murphy, who said Nike's fiscal 2018 guidance was ""unusually vague.""Adidas U.S. shares edged down 0.45%, still close to last week's record high. Under Armour rallied to close up 0.5% after tumbling intraday to its worst levels since September 2013.For 2018, Nike execs projected ""continued revenue growth across all geographies."" For Q4, the current quarter, management said it expects mid-single-digit reported-revenue growth. Analysts presently expect 5% growth to $8.65 billion in sales.Susquehanna's Sam Poser remains bullish, citing Nike's plans to slash 25% of its styles to ""amplify"" the 75% of styles that generate 99% of its sales, in addition to management's ""triple double"" game plan that focuses on innovation, boosting speed to market and engaging consumers directly.""With everything in the hopper for Nike, we believe concerns about near-term gross margin pressure and/or future orders declines are a classic case of not seeing the forest for the trees,"" he wrote.And Instinet's Simeon Siegel continues to ""believe NKE's ability & willingness to spend to grow is a competitive advantage that will drive ongoing outperformance & help best the competition.""RELATED:Nike Vows To Halve Product Cycle To 'Weeks, Not Months'; Stock Falls On Sales, MarginsNike Rival Adidas On U.S. Turf War: Paying The Price For The PastUnder Armour Picks General Motors Vet To Be Chief Innovation Officer

118,UAA,"XNike (NKE) reports third-quarter results late Tuesday, and the dominant global athletic brand is expected to record its first year-over-year earnings decline since late 2012 as rivalries heat up and retail slows down.The Street is looking for a 4% year-over-year decline in profit to 53 cents a share and 5% revenue growth to $8.47 billion for the Dow Jones industrial average component.The bankruptcies of Sports Authority and other sporting goods retailers made their mark on athletic brands last year. The broader brick-and-mortar retail environment continues to adjust to a digital-heavy shopping landscape, though many brands — including Nike — are working on building out stronger direct-to-consumer channels that can circumvent any storefront softness.Now at the forefront of some investor minds is Adidas' (ADDYY) comeback-kid performance after a sluggish period in the U.S. Nike's still No. 1, both globally and at home, but Adidas is looking to recapture share in the key American market.""We believe NKE management continues to grapple with the greater than expected pace and magnitude of Adidas' resurgence — particularly domestically,"" wrote Piper Jaffray analyst Erinn Murphy last week. She sees Nike shares remaining ""range bound over the next year as the durability of Adidas' resurgence becomes clearer."" Murphy has a neutral rating and 51 price target on the stock.Nike's stock was one of the only decliners on the Dow Jones industrial average last year, though shares are up about 14% so far in 2017. By contrast, Adidas shares rocketed 62% last year.Nike shares rose 1.7% to 58.77 on the stock market today. Adidas fell 1.2% to 97.30. Smaller rival Under Armour (UAA) rose 1% to 19.58.Adidas doubled its athletic footwear market share in the U.S. in January to 10%, according to NPD Group data, but that is still a far cry from Nike's 45% share. Under Armour, which has since lost the No. 2 spot back to Adidas in the U.S., had a 2% market share that month.IBD'S TAKE: Under Armour's rising hip-kid image took a major hit last month after CEO Kevin Plank made comments on CNBC that were perceived as being pro-Trump. He's since walked back on those comments and come out against the travel ban, but some say the damage has already been done. ""Conceptually, Under Armour is less of a threat (year over year), particularly in basketball, and Adidas, while still strong, hasn't increased its rate of U.S. share gain,"" wrote Morgan Stanley's Jay Sole, who has an equal-weight rating and 56 price goal on Nike.Susquehanna analyst Sam Poser, who has a positive rating and 64 price target on the stock, said the Swoosh ""remains on its A-game"" and any concerns about Adidas weighing on Nike's growth is ""misplaced.""""The bigger threat from Adidas, in our view, should be to performance based brands, such as Under Armour, that just don't resonate in lifestyle to nearly the same degree,"" wrote Poser.Meanwhile, athletic gear retailer Finish Line (FINL), which reports early Friday, is seen logging a 16% EPS drop to 70 cents a share, on a 6% sales decline to $545.9 million.Retailer earnings can offer a glimpse into brand demand. Foot Locker (FL) reported strong demand for Nike footwear and some Adidas shoes when the sporting goods chain disclosed holiday-quarter results last month, but notably did not mention Under Armour.One last thing: those Nike-specific ""futures orders"" — i.e. the metric that tracks products scheduled for delivery to retailers — will still be closely tracked, though management as of last quarter has begun disclosing that figure during the earnings call instead of in its initial press release.Nike CFO Andy Campion said last fall that the metric isn't as directly correlative to its revenue anymore as its business mix changes, an indication that its direct-to-consumer business is picking up steam.RELATED:Nike Rival Adidas On U.S. Turf War: Paying The Price For The PastUnder Armour Picks General Motors Vet To Be Chief Innovation OfficerFoot Locker Sprints As Earnings Growth Continues To AccelerateUnder Armour CEO Knocks Trump Policy, But Damage To Cool Factor SeenThat Nike Metric That Sank Shares?

119,UAA,"Nike (NKE) shares are falling Thursday after the No. 1 sports apparel brand said it expects to cut about 2% of its global workforce as it implements leadership and organization changes. Separately, Under Armour (UAA) got an estimate cut as one analyst says stores are ""likely canceling"" product orders.The changes are meant to ""streamline and speed up strategic execution,"" said Nike in a press release. Its new ""consumer direct offense"" targets a dozen cities — New York, London, Shanghai, Beijing, Los Angeles, Tokyo, Paris, Berlin, Mexico City, Barcelona, Seoul, and Milan — that are seen accounting for over 80% of its growth through 2020.Nike, a Dow Jones industrial average component, has had its eyes set on reaching $50 billion in revenue by the end of fiscal 2020, with North America making up 40% of that target.Nike shares fell 3.2% to 52.90 on the stock market today, falling back below their 50-day and 200-day moving averages.Nike had more than 70,000 employees at the end of fiscal 2016.Aside from the job cuts, Thursday's announcement includes shuffling around of leadership positions and the creation of new segments.Its previously announced ""triple double"" strategy aims to halve the product-creation cycle, and the company said Thursday that its head of product and merchandising, Michael Spillane, will become President of Categories and Product, a new unit, to ""supercharge this faster pipeline.""More resources will be dedicated to running, basketball, Nike sportswear, men's and women's training, soccer and young athletes, the ""categories with the highest potential to fuel growth.""Its new Nike Direct unit marries its website, direct-to-consumer retail and Nike+ digital offerings.IBD'S TAKE: This follows a recent change in Nike's ""futures"" reporting that indicated a shift in its mix of retail and e-commerce sales: That Nike Metric That Sank Shares? Stop Looking At It, Says NikeAs part of the changes, the company will start divvying up its financial reporting into four geographic areas — North America, Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA), Greater China and Asia-Pacific and Latin America (APLA) — down from six.Meanwhile, Susquehanna reduced its Under Armour profit and sales estimates for fiscal 2017 and 2018 on expectations that stores such as Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS), Hibbett (HIBB), Academy, Modell's and Scheel's ""will shrink their exposure to Under Armour in response to the poor product segmentation and the little progress in fixing the problem.""Analyst Sam Poser said it's ""becoming clear"" that sales of Under Armour products at Kohl's (KSS), DSW (DSW) and Famous Footwear won't be enough to offset lost sales from shuttered sports-apparel retailers, and that stores are beginning to promote Under Armour items to price-match Kohl's, spurring concerns of more promotional activity.""There is also little to no progress being made by UAA to create product that resonates from a fashion perspective,"" added Poser.Under Armour shares fell 4.4% to 21.71.Nike, however, segments its items ""well enough that its customers that shop at (Dick's) have no interest in the product at (Kohl's), regardless of the price, and the Nike brand remains unscathed,"" he said.Adidas (ADDYY), which has revived its brand in the U.S., fell 3.1% to 96.91, backing away from a potential buy point of 102.09.

Sales climbed to more than a $1 billion despite what CEO Kevin Plank described as sluggish sales of Curry basketball shoes.Meanwhile, a resurgent Adidas (ADDYY) has been gaining market share in the U.S. and has seen revenue surge in the key North American market. That contrasts with Nike, which has lost momentum in its home market. On Tuesday, retailer Foot Locker (FL), which relies on Nike for two-thirds of its sales, was downgraded on expectations of slowing sales.From a longer-term perspective, the athletic brands and their retail partners are under pressure from internet juggernaut Amazon (AMZN), but Nike and Under Armour have been streamlining supply-chain operations to protect against that threat by getting new products to market faster.RELATED:Under Armour Loss Less Than Feared; Stock Clears Key HurdleNike, Adidas Have This 'Major Roadblock' Against Amazon

123,UAA,"X The stock market traded mixed in afternoon trade — ranging from minor gains on the Nasdasq to light losses on the S&P 500 — heading into the final hour of the session. The tech-heavy composite moved up 0.2%, while the S&P 500 declined 0.2%.The Dow Jones industrial average inched lower. Volume was tracking slightly higher across both exchanges vs. the same time Monday. Among the other Dow industrials, IBM (IBM) paced the advancers with a 1.2% rise, while Microsoft (MSFT) and Home Depot (HD) followed up with gains of 1.1% and 1.0%, respectively.On the downside, medical components UnitedHealth Group (UNH) and Pfizer (PFE) pulled the Dow into the red, declining 2% and 1.9%, respectively.Among the S&P 500, two chip stocks were among the leaders on the day. Chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) surged over 10%, while chip equipment stock Qorvo (QRVO) followed up on Monday's 5.5% advance with a 3.4% rise. Qorvo surged past a 72.52 flat-base entry, but remains within proper buy range.The S&P 500's laggards were once again retail stocks as they drastically underperformed the general market. Apparel companies Under Armour (UAA) and Hanesbrands (HBI) pierced their 50-day lines, falling 4.2% and 3.2%, respectively, while Ralph Lauren (RL) and VF Corp (VFC) dropped over 2% each.Leading retailer Burlington Stores (BURL) gapped below its 50-day line early Tuesday, down 3.3%. Gains from a 92.77 cup-base entry had been as much as 13% just five days ago, but a four-day losing streak has brought the stock's gains to just 3%.China-based stocks drastically outperformed in the stock market today. Internet portal Sina (SINA) and so-called 'Twitter of China' Weibo (WB) reported early Tuesday, causing them to shoot 18.5% and 25% higher, respectively. Both companies topped analyst estimates. Sina surged out of a long consolidation that featured a 85.34 buy point. Weibo is now up 35% from its 57.57 cup-with-handle entry.Chinese e-commerce giants JD.com (JD) and Alibaba (BABA) moved up 0.9% and 2.1%, respectively.

124,UAA," Nike (NKE) rival Under Armour (UAA) reported first-quarter results early Thursday that were better than expected, sending shares soaring.Estimates: Swing to a 4-cent per-share loss from prior-year quarter profit of 4 cents a share, as revenue rises 6% to just a little under $1.11 billion.Results: Under Armour lost 1 cent a share as sales climbed to $1.17 billion.Under Armour CEO Kevin Plank said that Steph Curry basketball shoe sales are ""sluggish,"" but said that it is already factored into the company's guidance.Stock: Shares jumped 9.9% to 21.67 on the stock market today, moving above their 50-day moving average for the first time since August 2016.Under Armour is well off its all-time high of 52.95 from September 2015. The stock has come under pressure following investor disappointment from the previous quarter's results, CEO Plank's ill-received comments about President Trump, a lukewarm outing at Kohl's (KSS), and a resurgent Adidas, among other factors.Shares of Nike edged 0.6% higher. U.S. shares of Adidas (ADDYY) fell 0.15%.Leading up to the report, Canaccord Genuity analyst Camilo Lyon expressed last Thursday that he remains cautious on Under Armour.""The trifecta of headwinds that plagued (Under Armour) last year (overexposure to sporting goods, overexposure to NA, and overexposure to performance apparel) has not abated, in our opinion,"" he wrote.

"
125,UAA,"XThe Adidas rocket ship shows no signs of slowing: the latest semiannual teen survey from Piper Jaffray says that the resurgent athletic apparel brand has become the No. 1 new label worn by male teens, knocking out Nike (NKE), the Dow Jones industrial average component that has reigned in that category since fall of 2014.And overall, it the third most preferred fashion footwear brand among upper-income teens, ""the highest it has been in 10 years,"" notes Piper Jaffray analyst Erinn Murphy in a separate note, raising her price target to 194 euro from 190. She also notched up full-year estimates on the Three Stripes.That doesn't mean that Nike is anywhere near losing its market share dominance, however. Among all upper-income and average income teens, the Swoosh remains the top athletic clothing brand with 69% of the vote in each segment. Adidas, while still the fastest growing brand in Piper Jaffray's poll, sits in the No. 2 spot with less than 10% of the vote.And in athletic footwear among all teens, Nike holds on tight to its top position with 80% share of the survey.""While (Nike) remains the No. 1 footwear brand, we are seeing strong signs that adidas is gaining back share among males & hitting an all-time high with females,"" said Murphy.Meanwhile, Under Armour (UAA) topped one of the charts in a less stellar way, becoming the No. 1 brand that's no longer being worn by upper-income teenage boys.Under Armour recently was added to midmarket department story Kohl's (KSS), which some analysts wondering if that would undermine the brand. Nike has been at Kohl's and other big-box retailers for years.IBD'S TAKE: Under Armour's first month at Kohl's was considered underwhelming, amid an ""intensifying"" price war between the Baltimore-based brand and Nike.Dow's Nike fell 0.4% to 54.90 in afternoon trade in the stock market today. Under Armour sank 0.65%, stuck in a long downtrend. Adidas' U.S. shares retreated 0.3%.For all three brands, however, the survey confirms a reassuring trend: activewear is still very in.""We have seen the drumbeat for athletic beat louder with every iteration of our Teen Survey,"" wrote Murphy.

126,UAA,"XAmid a retail landscape that ""is not in a steady state,"" Nike (NKE) CEO Mark Parker said late Tuesday that the company is looking to cut its average product cycle in half and get merchandise to market ""in weeks, not months.""""I'm convinced now is the time to rewrite the playbook on retail,"" he said on Nike's third-quarter earnings call.The move is part of what Parker calls a ""triple-double"" game plan that focuses on innovation, supply chain and marketplace strategy. The initiative involves doubling the ""cadence and scale"" of innovation, doubling the speed from product insights to delivery to consumer, and doubling the direct connection to customers through digital and personalization efforts, he said on the call.The dominant activewear brand, a Dow component, fell short of Q3 revenue forecasts but delivered a big earnings beat late Tuesday.Management projects mid-single-digit reported revenue growth for the current quarter.In Q3, diluted per-share earnings rose 24% to 68 cents, topping estimates for a year-over-year decline, but 5% revenue growth to $8.43 billion missed the mark. Consensus was for a 4% EPS decline to 53 cents on 5.5% revenue growth to $8.47 billion.Gross margin shrank 140 basis points to 44.5%, said the company, which said higher average selling prices were nevertheless weighed on by ""higher product costs, unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates and the impact of higher off-price sales."" Inventories rose 7% from the prior year.North America sales, including footwear, apparel and equipment, rose 3% to $3.78 billion in Q3, excluding currency changes. Western Europe revenue grew 10%. In the greater China region, Nike revenue rose 15%.Shares fell 4% in late trading. The stock cleared a 58.52 buy point on Monday but fell 1.1% to 58.01 by the stock market close Tuesday.Nike was the Dow Jones industrial average's worst performer for the calendar year, sliding 19%, but is up around 14.5% so far this year.Some segments of retail are sadder than others. Department stores and teen retailers are flailing, but there are individual brands that are strong enough to withstand the current choppy waters.Last year was rough on brick-and-mortar stores, and the closures of several sporting-goods chains weighed on athletic brands. But the Swoosh remains the No. 1 sports apparel brand in the world, and ""athleisure"" looks still fill the sidewalks.Under Armour's (UAA) star has diminished somewhat, in light of a Q4 miss in January and seemingly pro-Trump comments from its chief executive that were ill-received.Meanwhile, Adidas (ADDYY) has emerged as a beast of a contender, upping its outlook four times last year and setting out to reclaim some turf in the key U.S. market.RELATED:Nike Expected To Log First Earnings Decline In Over 4 YearsNike Rival Adidas On U.S. Turf War: Paying The Price For The PastUnder Armour Picks General Motors Vet To Be Chief Innovation OfficerFoot Locker Sprints As Earnings Growth Continues To AccelerateUnder Armour CEO Knocks Trump Policy, But Damage To Cool Factor SeenThat Nike Metric That Sank Shares?

128,UAA,"Buy ratings were placed on Apple (AAPL), Under Armour (UAA), Adobe (ADBE) and Micron Technology (MU) on Friday, while Macy's (M) was downgraded.A buy rating was reiterated on Apple at Nomura/Instinet, which raised its price target to 165 from 135.  The firm believes the expected introduction of the iPhone 8 later this year will outperform consensus expectations. Apple is preparing to start making iPhones in India to be more competitive in that important market and it just bought a task-automation app that makes its smartphones more useful.Apple stock fell 0.2% to 140.66 on the stock market today.Under Armour was upgraded to a buy from hold by Jefferies, which raised its price target to 27 from 19.Analyst Randal Konik said an updated survey of 2,000 consumers compared to results from three years ago show the UA brand has strengthened and athletic apparel demand is robust.Under Armour has seen its shares lose more than half their value over the past year, which puts the stock at what Jefferies considers a good value.Under Armour stock climbed 3.6% to 19.66.IBD'S TAKE: Under Armour may get a buy rating from Jefferies.

130,UAA,"X Under Armour (UAA) has a stronger brand than three years ago and people still love wearing activewear — those are the main take-aways from Jefferies' upgrade of the Nike (NKE) rival that are sending shares up early Friday.""The bottom has formed,"" declared the report's headline, as Jefferies analyst Randal Konik upgraded the stock to buy from hold and upped his price target to 27 from 19. He also added Under Armour to the firm's franchise picks list.Why? For one thing, athleisure is a trend that's got stamina: The research firm's survey of 2,000 consumers found that about 25% more of those polled are wearing activewear four to five times a week, almost a third are buying more athletic apparel for themselves, and a quarter more are purchasing more such apparel for their kids.Nike's mixed results Tuesday had some on the Street pointing to competition from Under Armour and, in particular, a resurgent Adidas (ADDYY). Jefferies' poll agrees that Adidas ate into Under Armour's market share, ""but gains are moderating"" as the Kevin Plank-helmed company makes inroads with children and finds more popularity.IBD'S TAKE: Under Armour got a buy rating from Jefferies, but the stock is in a long downtrend, hitting a 3 1/2-year low as recently as Wednesday. Sales growth has slowed and Wall Street expects the company to post outright losses in the first half of this year. Focus your attention on top-rated companies with strong, even accelerating growth whose stocks are setting up in bullish bases.""We were guarded on UA during '16 given Adidas, and UA EPS and stock are down 75% and 50%+, respectively, in 6 mo. predominantly due to share transfer,"" wrote Konik.But Street estimates aren't taking into account stabilization in the North America market, flattening gross margins, expansion into international markets and category extensions, he said.Konik said his research indicates that ""an inflection has formed and the buying (opportunity) is now.""Under Armour shares rose 3.6% to 19.66 on the stock market today.

"
131,UAA,"X Athleisure is still a hot fashion trend and strong, loyalty-inducing brands have more buffer room from the brick-and-mortar collapse, meaning Nike (NKE) can't possibly be in a bad spot in retail ... right?Nike has rarely acknowledged the retail climate as weighing on sales. Just three months ago, the No. 1 global athletic brand touted its relative immunity to the choppy waters.""Each and every quarter over the past seven years, Nike has grown despite healthy competition within our industry, extreme macroeconomic volatility, discontinuities in the retail landscape and rapidly evolving trends in consumer preferences,"" said CFO Andy Campion on the Q2 call in December, brushing off any correlation between macroeconomic trends and Nike's growth trajectory.But the tone was noticeably different on Tuesday's call as Campion and CEO Mark Parker both commented during the Q3 call that the North American retail landscape ""is not in a steady state.""And discounting at the brick-and-mortar level appears to have caught them a bit off guard.""Digital disruption and other dynamics are resulting in more aggressive promotional activity than we expected 90-days ago,"" said Campion late Tuesday. ""So we are going to remain tight, with respect to the supply that we are putting into the North America market in the short-term, while aggressively driving the initiatives that will reshape and grow the market, and extend Nike's leadership long-term.""Nike's more ominous tone came just as Sears (SHLD) warned ""substantial doubt"" exists over the iconic department store chain's ability to survive. Meanwhile, other retailers and brands have long brought up the ""challenging retail environment"" in earnings releases as a way to explain or mitigate lackluster results. Michael Kors (KORS), Signet Jewelers (SIG), Express (EXPR) and others all mentioned some variation of the phrase this past quarter.Shares of Nike, a component on the Dow Jones industrial average, tumbled 7% to 53.92 on the stock market today, diving below their 50-day average and 200-day lines. Rival Under Armour (UAA) rebounded to close up 0.5% after falling intraday to its lowest level since September 2013. U.S.-listed shares of Adidas (ADDYY) dipped 0.5%. Sears sank 12.3%.IBD'S TAKE: Mayhem is the antithesis of convenience, when it comes to shopping. But that is the point. No one wants to stand in line outside for hours waiting for laundry detergent.

Is this what will stave off the death of the American mall?""Futures orders,"" or products scheduled for delivery to retailers, disappointed with a 1% constant-currency decline that included a 9% tumble in North America futures.While Nike has been making attempts to play down the relevancy of this metric, given its aggressive push into direct-to-consumer sales at Nike stores and at Nike.com, the number still has the power to cause consternation.Morgan Stanley analyst Jay Sole, in a Wednesday research note, weighed the possibilities.""(U)nprecedentedly weak (North America) futures signal share loss and either a poor retail climate or a radically changing Nike business model,"" he wrote.But for those worried about Nike's retail performance, ""the answer may be the latter,"" wrote Sole. He said that Nike's new supply chain system might mean that retailers don't have to place futures orders ""since Nike can deliver them essentially on demand.""""If true, the futures decline isn't alarming,"" he said.But Nike brand direct-to-consumer revenue grew 13% in Q3, a deceleration from last quarter's 25% growth and the first time in years that the company has not logged DTC growth over 20%.The company, as management likes to say, remains on the offensive.CEO Parker on Tuesday unrolled a new three-pronged attack plan, a ""triple-double"" initiative built to ramp up product innovation, speed to market and consumer engagement.RELATED:Nike Tanks As Q3 Results Fan Flames Of Adidas' Beast-Mode ComebackNike Vows To Halve Product Cycle To 'Weeks, Not Months'; Stock Falls On Sales, MarginsNike Rival Adidas On U.S. Turf War: Paying The Price For The PastFoot Locker Sprints As Earnings Growth Continues To Accelerate

132,UAA,"XIt doesn't take a lot of time learning how to buy a stock using fundamental and technical analysis.Identify a firm showing good earnings and sales growth, and then learn how to tell when mutual funds and other institutional investors, the biggest drivers of a stock's price, are acquiring shares. Bullish chart patterns form when the latter is happening that can lead to powerful upside breakouts, especially in the early stages of a new bull market.After big gains for a stock, though, sell signals often arise. But don't count on the analyst community to tell you when it's happening. When it comes time to sell, they're often late. Sometimes, very late.In June, Deutsche Bank, BofA Merrill Lynch and Needham issued well-timed buys for former leader Acacia Communications (ACIA) just after its IPO. But they haven't issued any sell ratings, even as Acacia has plunged off highs due to bursts of institutional selling by fund managers and other large investors.Acacia quadrupled in price after a breakout from an IPO base with a 32.04 buy point, but signs of institutional selling started to crop up in the stock in early September when shares slumped 6% in higher volume during the week ended Sept. 9 (1). More signs of distribution followed after that.An outright sell signal was triggered in the first half of October when Acacia fell below its 10-week moving average in huge volume (2).The 10-week line is a key support level to watch for a market leader.Meanwhile, in late February, Instinet downgraded shares of Under Armour (UAA) to reduce from neutral after the stock had already fallen more than 50% off its high.But in early May 2016, an IBD story noted a sell signal in Under Armour when the stock fell 8% below a 45.53 cup-with-handle buy point. Since then, shares have fallen another 50%. Cutting bait with a stock when it's not working prevents small losses from spiraling out of control. Sometimes, a stock will rally back after triggering the 7-8% sell rule, but it's a good rule to follow to preserve capital.In late December, an Inside The IBD 50 story noted the sell signals taking place in Nvidia (NVDA). The stock had risen 100% above its 200-day moving average and it had also moved above an upper channel line (seen on a weekly chart by connecting the stock's recent highs since June 2016). Both were signs of a potential climax top seen in past market leaders. Nvidia hasn't completely broken down, but buying demand has dried up as the stock consolidates gains below the 10-week line, about 18% off its high.Stock newsletter writers are known for shelling out a lot of ideas, but after you buy, you're on your own.In the IBD playbook, following sell rules is just as important as following buy rules.Sell signals are annotated on daily and weekly charts in Leaderboard for features like Sector Leaders and the top-10 names in the IBD 50 every day.A break of support at the 50-day moving average (daily chart) or 10-week moving average (weekly chart) in heavy volume as well as cutting losses at 7-8% are annotated when appropriate.IBD also has rules that showcase the time to sell on the way up. For instance, when a stock breaks out and rallies 20%-25% past a buy point, investors will be reminded of an IBD sell rule that says to generally take at least partial profits when a stock's gain hits 20% to 25%, because that's around the time the stock is ready to consolidate gains and perhaps form a new base. Finisar (FNSR) has fallen on hard times lately, but the stock delivered a powerful breakout last summer that yielded a solid gain. It cleared a 19.30 buy point in late July, and then triggered the 20-25% profit-taking rule when the gain hit 20% during the week ended Sept. 9. But shares soared 17% in big volume, fueled by strong earnings.Because of the sign of strength, those with conviction in the stock might've given it a little more room. Those that did were rewarded. The gain hit around 60 in early October just before Finisar settled into a new base.The take-away here is that while taking profits at 20-25% is generally sound strategy, there are some instances where it makes sense to give a potential market leader more room to run.RELATED:When To Sell A Stock I: When The Stock Lives Under Its 10-Week LineWhen To Sell A Stock II: Cutting Losses Fast Is The Best Portfolio DefenseWhen To Sell A Stock III: Get Out When The Leaders In An Industry Group Crumble

133,UAA,"President Trump has visions of a massive Apple (AAPL) factory opening in the U.S. to churn out the latest iPhone. The idea is not completely far-fetched, but one thing seems clear: If it happens, most of the new jobs will go to robots.Even in lower-cost China, Foxconn, which assembles the iPhone there, reportedly replaced 60,000 workers with robots at one facility. That's more than half the facility's workforce. Foxconn says it is adding 10,000 ""Foxbots"" per year.China has seen its cost advantage wither away due to wage gains. It's investing more than $3 billion a year in robots — up from next to nothing before 2009 — to keep from losing its manufacturing base to lower-cost developing nations, Bernstein analysts Michael Parker and Alberto Moel wrote in a December report.Trump has vowed to rewrite or walk away from trade deals and cut corporate tax rates to level the playing field for U.S. companies. He told Congress on Feb. 28 that he'll ""bring back millions of jobs.""Although economists concur that North American Free Trade Agreement and China's admission to the World Trade Organization have taken a toll on U.S. manufacturing jobs, Trump's battle plan seems geared to fight the last war.If China must shrink its costs with a massive deployment of robots, U.S.-based manufacturers that pay much higher wages and benefits will face the same pressures.A 2015 study by Boston Consulting Group found that an automotive industry welder earned about $25 an hour, including benefits, while a robot could do the job for $8 an hour, including installation, maintenance and operating costs. The gap is expected to widen sharply as technology improves.""It is still possible to force the relocation of production"" by restricting trade via tariffs or applying political pressure, wrote Bernstein's Parker and Moel. ""However, if the point of the exercise is to restore well-paying, middle-class jobs in manufacturing in the process, the result is going to disappoint. Mandating a physical task be carried out in a high-cost labor market in 2017 is simply going to increase the chances the task is automated.""Trump relentlessly bashed air conditioning company Carrier during the campaign for its plan to close an Indiana factory and move the work to Mexico. He intervened in December, saving about 800 jobs — for now. But Carrier's parent, United Technologies (UTX), which is getting $7 million in tax incentives from Indiana to stay, said it would invest $16 million to automate the factory ""to drive the cost down.""Like Apple, United Technologies is a member of Dow Jones industrial average.United Technologies CEO Greg Hayes told CNBC that while moving to Mexico would have been cheaper, the company will ""make that plant competitive just because we'll make the capital investments there, but what that ultimately means is there will be fewer jobs.""Mondelez (MDLZ), the maker of Oreos, was another regular Trump campaign target for its decision to cut 600 jobs from a Chicago factory and move the work to Mexico. The company said it considered installing new production lines at its Chicago Nabisco plant but chose to do the work in Salinas, Mexico, because of a $46 million cost differential. Mondelez noted that even if the project had gone forward in Chicago, half the jobs would have been eliminated because of new labor-saving technology.IBD'S TAKE: Since taking office, President Trump has talked less about the sticks he'll use against U.S. trading partners and more about the carrots he'll offer to manufacture in the U.S. via tax reform. But, for now, Trump's economic agenda and his tax cuts for business are stuck in line behind the ObamaCare repeal effort.The food and beverage industry is expected to be among the bigger adopters of industrial robots in coming years, says Boston Consulting Group, with automakers and electronics firms continuing to lead the way. Metals and machinery, rubber and plastics, and pharmaceuticals and cosmetics are also seen ramping up robot use. A 2016 McKinsey & Co. study concluded that 59% of manufacturing activities could be automated.Foxconn said in January that it's mulling a $7 billion highly automated factory for making displays, including flat-panel TVs and monitors, in the U.S. in partnership with Apple. Transportation costs for ever-larger displays, which aren't shipped by plane like the iPhone, are a driving force behind the plan. Foxconn Chairman Terry Gou said March 1 that such plans are on hold as the company waits to see what bills are passed and what incentives are offered.Pegatron, another Apple contract manufacturer that does assembly for Dell and HP Inc. (HPQ) out of plants in California and Indiana, reportedly said after Trump's election that it could expand its U.S. capacity fourfold, relying on automation and with a minimal increase in labor. The tech industry began formulating its response last year in the event that Trump was elected and turned out to be serious about imposing 35% tariffs on imports from China.Trump hasn't threatened such hefty tariffs in recent weeks. The focus has shifted to House Republicans' plan to slash the corporate tax rate to 20% and make export revenues tax-free. The 20% rate would apply to the full value of imports, raising $1 trillion over a decade that would effectively pay for the corporate tax cut. Still, economists who back the idea say that the dollar would rise 25%, offsetting any trade advantage. Major importers like Wal-Mart (WMT) hate the idea and trade experts warn that the WTO would likely find the import tax to be illegal.Some companies haven't needed new tax deals or threats to open factories in the U.S., but automation is key to their strategies.Adidas is a prime example. The maker of athletic shoes, which has long done its labor-intensive manufacturing out of China, Indonesia and Vietnam, last year piloted what it's calling a Speedfactory in Germany, making shoes almost entirely by robots. This year, the second Adidas Speedfactory is slated to open in Atlanta, where it's expected to employ 160 people facilitating the production of a half-million shoes.The high-tech operation, Adidas says, won't just eliminate the drudgery in manufacturing (along with a lot of the workers). It also will enable the company ""to make product for the consumer, with the consumer, where the consumer lives in real time, unleashing unparalleled creativity and endless opportunities for customization.""Meanwhile, Nike (NKE), another Dow industrials component, and Under Armour (UAA) are both developing strategies for manufacturing in the U.S., close to their customers. It's a safe bet that robots will be doing most of the work.The implications for workers are clear, says Boston Consulting Group. ""As U.S. factories adopt advanced manufacturing technologies, demand will surge for higher-skilled, white-collar workers who can quickly adapt to new technologies and processes, and demand will lessen for blue-collar workers who are trained in specific skills.""Despite his vow to bring back millions of jobs, Trump isn't oblivious to the job threat posed by robots. In a postelection interview, the New York Times asked Trump whether he was worried that companies will keep their factories in the U.S. but automate their workers out of jobs.""They will, and we'll make the robots too,"" Trump said. He added: ""Right now we don't make the robots. We don't make anything. But we're going to. I mean, look, robotics is becoming very big and we're going to do that.""Trump is more right than wrong about the U.S. ceding an opportunity, writes Frank Tobe, publisher of the Robot Report. ""Two-thirds of the robotics industry and 100% of industrial robots are manufactured outside of the U.S. by non-U.S. companies.""China's leadership has fully embraced the adoption of robots as part of its ""Made in China 2025"" strategy. The plan reflects not only wage pressures but demographics, as its working-age population shrinks. Whether the U.S. will avoid committing to robots for fear of displacing workers is a real question with serious competitive implications.Academics and industry leaders made the case in ""A Roadmap for U.S. Robotics"" last fall that robots have been a plus for manufacturing jobs. ""Over the last 5-6 years we have seen introduction of 600,000 new jobs in manufacturing. During the same period, we have seen significant growth in adoption of robot systems in industry,"" they wrote.Yet their upbeat predictions come with some uncertainty. The auto industry has been the biggest adopter of robotics, but that's happened as sales rebounded from just 10.4 million in 2009 to a record high 17.5 million in 2016. But if demand has peaked, as industry players suspect, then increasing automation may not be quite so positive for employment in auto manufacturing in the future.RELATED:U.S. Manufacturing Gears Up As 'America First' Trump Takes OfficeThe Top 10 Jobs Robots Could Steal From Humans By 2025Forget The Doomsday Clock, There's Now A Robot Fear IndexThe Trump Economy: Jobs, Regulations, Taxes And Trade

135,UAA,"XBy all accounts, Adidas (ADDYY) had a whopper of a year. The athletic powerhouse ramped up its outlook no less than four times and grew currency-neutral revenue by 18% in 2016.The years ahead are also looking good, and on Wednesday the Nike (NKE) rival raised its long-term sales and earnings guidance.Shares, which trade in the U.S. on the OTC market, leapt as high as 92.31 in afternoon trading on the stock market today, a new all-time high. Adidas' stock gained 62% in 2016.Nike shares, by contrast, tumbled 19% last year, making it the worst performer on the Dow Jones industrial average. Shares edged down 0.1% to 56.51 Wednesday.Despite Adidas' momentum,  Kasper Rorsted — who took over as CEO from Herbert Hainer last fall — nevertheless has his sights set on driving growth even higher, particularly in the key North American market where the brand has until recently dragged.""It's important to understand we've been in the U.S. for many years, but we've not executed appropriately in the U.S.,"" he told Investor's Business Daily via phone from the company's German headquarters. ""And that has given room for a Nike to grow, and also an Under Armour.""Adidas has in recent months recaptured the No. 2 spot by sales in the U.S. from smaller rival Under Armour (UAA), according to NPD Group data, and in January doubled its U.S. athletic footwear market share to 10% from the prior year.Nike held the lead with 45%, while Under Armour had 2% market share in January, said NPD.""While we're happy with the No. 2 spot, we're happy with the progress — we're actually not happy where we are overall as a company,"" said Rorsted. He added that the company is in ""catch-up mode"" despite being the second biggest athletic brand, and ""we should have substantially higher market share and position in the U.S. than we have today.""""But right now, that is the only market where we're paying the price for the past,"" he said.The company, which plans to ""continue to invest over-proportionately into its U.S. business,"" is in the midst of implementing a new long-term ""Creating the New"" strategic initiative. Rolled out two years ago, it includes a focus on speed to market, presence in key metropolitan cities and consumer engagement in order to accelerate growth.Adidas is now looking to shed its hockey business, in addition to its golf brands, as the company focuses on its stronger brands and core segments.Fourth-quarter sales and net income beat consensus figures, according to Piper Jaffray, which has an overweight rating on Adidas and raised its price target on Wednesday to 190 euros.Currency-neutral sales in Q4 grew 14%, including 29% year-over-year growth in North America and 25% growth in its greater China segment.Calling the North America segment a ""bright spot,"" Piper Jaffray analyst Erinn Murphy also noted that Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS), Foot Locker (FL) and Journeys ""are all seeing better Adidas shelf space in 2017.""For 2017, Adidas expects 11%-13% in currency-neutral revenue growth, better than current estimates. Management intends to shed more light on the details at Adidas' analyst day next week.The company said it now expects 10%-12% in average annual sales growth between 2015-2020, up from prior guidance for a high-single-digit rate. It also sees 20%-22% in average annual growth in net income from continuing operations for that period, up from previous outlook for about 15% a year on average.In addition to retro trends riding high in the U.S. — iconic Adidas shoes such as the Stan Smith and Superstar are major fashion favorites right now — Adidas' Boost, NMD and Kanye West-designed Yeezy designs are all enjoying popularity.""Creating the kinds of sneakers American kids want has had a major impact on their business,"" said NPD sports industry analyst Matt Powell. ""I called them brand of the (year) in 2016 and am about ready to do the same in 2017.""

136,UAA,"Storefront retail has become a dreary landscape, and even more littered with dismal news after a trying holiday season.

137,UAA,"The top executive at Under Armour (UAA) is a fan of President Trump. His top athletes aren't. Let the fireworks begin.Three of the clothing company's biggest names spoke out against Chief Executive Kevin Plank after he publicly praised the Republican president, declaring on CNBC that Trump is a ""real asset for the country."" Plank is a member of the administration's American Manufacturing Council.""I agree with that description — if you remove the 'et' (from asset),"" NBA superstar Stephen Curry reportedly said recently. Curry is Under Armour's most prized sneaker pitchman.On Thursday, Misty Copeland, a star ballet dancer prominently featured in Under Armour advertising, came out against Plank's statements in a post on Instagram. Copeland said she spoke at length with the CEO and hoped the company would take public action to promote inclusivity.""I strongly disagree with Kevin Plank's recent comments in support of Trump,"" said Copeland. ""Those of you who have supported and followed my career know that the one topic I've never backed away from speaking openly about is the importance of diversity and inclusion.""Dwayne Johnson, known as ""The Rock"" to wrestling fans, had some strong words to share as well. The actor, who has an apparel line with Under Armour, said yesterday that the CEO's comments trampled the beliefs of many of the company's employees.Leaders are supposed to inspire people, not ""divide and disband,"" he said.""These are neither my words, nor my beliefs,"" Johnson said of Plank's statement. ""His words were divisive and lacking in perspective.""The White House declined to comment on the statements, and Under Armour didn't respond to requests for comment. On Wednesday, a spokesperson for the company did say the clothier engages ""in policy, not politics,"" and that it advocates for fair trade, inclusive immigration, and tax reform.Competition for top athletes is cutthroat among the world's biggest performance wear companies, and star power is a valuable resource in the battle to be cool among teens and other sneakerheads. LeBron James signed a shoe deal with Nike last year reportedly worth more than $1 billion. Curry alone has spearheaded Under Armour's basketball business, with annual footwear sales hitting $1 billion for the first time in 2016.By taking a political stance, Under Armour risks alienating those athletes who view Trump negatively, and at a time when the brand's cool factor is already lackluster. After reporting disappointing earnings in January, Plank said the brand needed to ""become more fashion"" and get off the court and onto the streets. Plank said the brand needs to become a casual lifestyle staple, a segment currently ruled by Nike (NKE).Meanwhile, several members of the New England Patriots have so far vowed to skip the traditional White House visit after having won the Super Bowl on Sunday. Tampa Bay Buccaneers star wide receiver Mike Evans protested Trump's election at a game.High-profile basketball coaches Steve Kerr, Stan Van Gundy, and Gregg Popovich have criticized him, too. So did James and other NBA players, including Luol Deng and Jeremy Lin. One notable exception is Tom Brady, the Patriots quarterback and Under Armour athlete who counts Trump as a friend.Meanwhile, Under Armour's closest rivals, Nike and Adidas, each condemned Trump's executive order banning refugees from seven Muslim-majority countries, an order which was temporarily blocked by a federal appeals court last night. Nike CEO Mark Parker wrote in a memo to employees in January that his company's values were being ""threatened"" by the order.""This is a policy we don't support,"" Parker wrote in the letter. ""We are at our best when we recognize the value of our diverse community.""
"
138,UAA,"Once the cool new kid, Under Armour (UAA) is now sitting solo at the proverbial high-school cafeteria table after being perceived as getting chummy with the school bully.Following high-profile backlash to seemingly pro-Trump remarks in a recent CNBC interview, Under Armour CEO Kevin Plank has since clarified his statement, even taking out a full-page ad in the Baltimore Sun on Wednesday to highlight the company's values, which include equal rights, job creation, and a pro-immigration stance.""We are publicly opposing the travel ban,"" detailed the letter. ""With an anticipated new executive order on immigration set to come out, we will join a coalition of companies in opposition to any new actions that negatively impact our team, their families or our community.""Last week, Plank told CNBC that having a pro-business president was ""a real asset to this country,"" sparking headlines that the Under Armour chief was in favor of Trump, while leaders from Netflix (NFLX), Starbucks (SBUX) and elsewhere have been vocal in criticizing the president's actions, particularly on immigration.Nevertheless, the damage seems to have been done, and according to one analyst, it's going to take a while for the Nike (NKE) rival to shake off its newly acquired bad rap.""Commentary by the CEO in a CNBC interview in a polarized political climate, and pointed response by Stephen Curry, The Rock, and Misty Copeland make it nearly impossible to effectively build a cool urban lifestyle brand in the foreseeable future,"" wrote Susquehanna analyst Sam Poser, referring to the brand's endorsers who have spoken out against Plank's comments.Poser, a longtime bull on Under Armour, has downgraded his rating twice in less than three weeks.Disappointing Q4 results last month spurred Susquehanna's initial cut from positive to neutral, but the latest slash to negative (read: sell) is mostly driven by the ""reputational risk"" that the athletic apparel brand now faces in the wake of those comments.In a report that was written and published prior to seeing Plank's Baltimore Sun letter, Poser also highlighted the high anti-Trump political sentiment at the Grammy Awards on Sunday, noting that Nike and Adidas both ran commercials ""celebrating each brand's relationship to the community.""""It is clear to us and UAA management that Under Armour needs to build its casual and lifestyle business in order to return to historical growth rates,"" said Poser. ""Unfortunately, the brand's cool factor is generally dictated by the style influencers who were likely insulted by CEO Plank's comments, or at least the media's characterization of his comments.""Poser also called for Plank to get ""on air, in person, and fully address the issues facing Under Armour,"" adding that corporate releases lack perceived sincerity.Shares of Under Armour edged up 0.6% to close at 21.89 on the stock market today. Nike shares rose 0.3% to 56.64.IBD's TAKE: Shoppers threatened to boycott Under Armour for Plank's comments. The brand isn't the only retailer finding itself at the center of a Trump-related controversy. Nordstrom and Sears have both made headlines for dropping certain Trump-affiliated items from their product assortments.The Susquehanna analyst also cited challenges in building a lifestyle brand and said Under Armour's $55 hoodies and other items are ""too basic."" He slashed his price target on the stock to 14 from 24.Conversely, Morgan Stanley analyst Jay Sole — a longtime Under Armour bear — on Tuesday upgraded the stock to equal weight from underweight, in light of the lower valuation. He has a 20 price target on Under Armour.""The stock price suggests the market now believes (Under Armour) is a much more mature brand than it previously thought,"" wrote Sole.RELATED:Sears Dumps Some Trump-Branded Goods But Aims To 'Leave The Politics To Others'President Trump Attacks Nordstrom To Defend Daughter's Business

139,UAA,"The office, in lower Manhattan, has all the markings of a tech startup. There are high ceilings and a cool warehouse vibe, craft beer is on tap in the kitchen, and the place is buzzing with twentysomethings.But they aren't trying to make the next hit mobile app. The big idea here is to disrupt another ubiquitous product.""There were so many evolutions in technology, but underwear was stuck in, like, the early 1900s,'' said Tom Patterson, founder of Tommy John, which makes premium skivvies for men. ""It was a very sleepy category.""Tommy John is part of a growing drive by fledgling brands to get men to rethink underwear and pay more for it.It isn't easy. The $8 billion category has long been an afterthought. Many guys restocked only after ridicule from a significant other, or when disintegration could no longer be denied. Thanks to fellow upstarts such as Mack Weldon, guys are giving this everyday item more consideration.Skivvies ranging from $25 to $70 a pair now come with a list of features as long as those that once came with lawnmowers and television sets. They are ""game-changing products,"" with moisture control, cool zones, and stealth waistbands. They can be Swiss-made, breathable, anti-microbial, and anti-odor. Tommy John even reconfigured the front flap and developed a ""Quick Draw"" fly for easier access.All this has boosted spending. In the past three years, the average price for a pair of underwear in the U.S. has risen by a third, while prices for men's apparel overall have declined by about the same amount, according to research by Fung Global & Retail Technology and First Insight. Global sales are expected to increase from $8.4 billion in 2015 to $11 billion by 2020, according to Persistence Market Research.The disruption is a testament to the power of ""premiumization,"" a strategy that over the past decade has swept through many once-mundane categories.While many take it for granted, there was a time when grocery stores didn't have a dozen kinds of coffee. When the only consideration for buying ground beef was price, not what the cows ate. When a workout shirt was a cheap basic, far from the innovation story shoppers pay more for today. People never used to talk about how much they loved such things as water bottles and blenders.Now men's underwear, of all things, is being transformed.Premiumization is all about resetting expectations with additional choices and benefits. Under Armour (UAA) revolutionized workout gear with polyester shirts that made sweat evaporate better than cotton did. Starbucks (SBUX) became a behemoth by introducing a slew of new tastes and styles to America's coffee drinkers, whose choices had stopped at sugar, milk or cream.""Because this happened, it doesn't mean everything will be disrupted,"" said Adam Burgoon, a partner at investment fund KarpReilly, which owns a stake in Mack Weldon. The size of the market for such refashioned underwear remains to be seen, Burgoon said, because many guys are likely to balk at the price. ""But it means probably everything can be disrupted,"" he said.Men's underwear was especially ready for a change. Not only was it largely devoid of innovation, such industry leaders as Calvin Klein were mostly focused on winning over women, because they bought most of the underwear.It was primarily a fashion business with a buffet of patterns and colors. The marketing featured images like Calvin Klein's buff young Mark Walhberg up on billboards, and packaging showing expressionless youngsters with six-pack abs.Yet men were settling down later in life, and so doing more shopping on their own in the interim. Being single longer made them care more about their appearance, which has disrupted other categories, such as skin care and jeans. The underwear startups' marketing is more approachable. Some of it uses middle-aged models and pushes fun and honesty over sexy slickness.""I never really related to traditional underwear advertising,'' said Patterson, the Tommy John founder. ""It was too serious. It was weird. We just say it like it is. We're the first brand to have a no-wedgie guarantee. You're not supposed to talk about wedgies with underwear. The fact of the matter is that 100% of men get a wedgie at some point in their lives.""Patterson got the idea for Tommy John last decade, from a much different place than sexy. While wearing a suit as a medical-device salesman, he found his underwear was even more uncomfortable than usual. He set about to solve a problem, not to go wild with beefcake and polka dots.The early years were difficult. Direct selling on the web wasn't as viable, so he had to pitch department-store buyers, who were mostly women. Patterson's break came in 2009, when he won over Neiman Marcus by getting the woman who ran the underwear department to let her husband and male colleagues test his product.From there, the idea of selling men's underwear to men gained steam and has exploded in recent years. There's been a rush of startups, helped by lower barriers to entry. Sourcing from Asia has never been easier, and the internet has slashed marketing costs. That has allowed brands like Mack Weldon to sell only directly, through its website.Today, a majority of men's underwear is purchased by men, a reversal from a decade ago. Amid a dizzying number of choices, men are indulging: Tommy John and Mack Weldon each more than doubled sales last year.Young brands are also going beyond products and revamping how items are purchased. New York-based Basic Outfitters offers a ''create-a-drawer'' option that makes things really easy for guys by offering underwear, socks, undershirts, and joggers in one package for $60.""Men really are rethinking what they want,'' said Matthew Congdon, Mack Weldon's creative director and former top underwear designer for Calvin Klein. It used to be about ""an oversize logo or a slicker pattern or print,"" he said. ""Now it's about innovation, the fit, the fabric, and the waistband. Something that is for him.""

But comparable store sales fell 2.2% for the all-important shopping period.Hibbett, which has over 1,000 stores in the U.S., carries Nike (NKE), Under Armour (UAA), Adidas and other brands among its product assortment.""We continued to experience strength in our footwear business, which was a direct result of our improved assortments and in-stocks by store types,"" said Hibbett CEO Jeff Rosenthal in a release. ""As traffic declined and sales softened, we became more promotional in order to drive sales and manage inventory, which had a negative impact on gross margin.""Hibbett expects 53-55 cents in diluted per-share earnings for the period, well below current Street forecasts for 61 cents a share.For fiscal 2018, the company sees flat to low-single-digit range same-store sales and $2.65-$2.85 in EPS, the midpoint of which is shy of current views for $2.77 a share.Shares of Hibbett sank nearly 12% to end the regular trading session at 29.35 on the stock market today, hitting the lowest level in more than a year.

Analysts expected $1.32. Revenue grew 6% to $2.11 billion, in line with views. Same-store sales jumped 5%, better than forecasts for 4.6%.Foot Locker cited strong demand for Nike (NKE) shoes as well as some Adidas footwear. But it didn't mention struggling Under Armour (UAA), which already reported weak holiday results.Foot Locker sees current-year EPS rising by double digits vs. consensus for a 11% gain.Shares surged 9.4% to close at 75.01 on the stock market today, vaultiing over its 50-day moving average. Nike, which depends on Foot Locker for a lot of its sales, gained 0.8%. Under Armour edged 0.7% higher.Finish Line (FINL), another mall-based athletic shoe retailer, advanced 2.9%. Sporting goods chains Hibbett Sports (HIBB)  and Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS) climbed 2.6% and 1.9%, respectively.Earlier this month, Hibbett reported weak apparel and equipment sales during Q4 and gave weak guidance, ahead of its full Q4 report next month.Concerns have lingered that consumers were growing weary of the basketball genre as interest in more casual sneakers grows. While Nike management said in December that it is seeing ""incredible momentum"" in basketball and that ""basketball is back,"" Foot Locker, in November, said it saw lukewarm results in the basketball-shoe category during the third quarter.In addition to struggling under Amazon's (AMZN) retail choke-hold, the sports retail industry last year contended with the bankruptcies of chains like Sports Authority and Sports Chalet.Those chains may have drawn many bargain-seeking shoppers away from companies in better shape. Other analysts say Sports Authority customers have yet to make the leap to other athletic chains in the wake of the bankruptcy, according to Footwear News.In Q3 however, Foot Locker said U.S. store traffic increased. Casual throwback sneakers from Adidas, Puma and others have also helped sales.

144,UAA,"Facebook (FB) and chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) had their price targets raised, while Under Armour (UAA) had its price target cut and Amgen (AMGN) was upgraded.The social networking leader had its price target raised to 175 from 170 by RBC Capital markets, which maintained a sector perform rating.Facebook reported fourth-quarter earnings after the market close Wednesday that beat Wall Street expectations. Revenue rose 51% to $8.8 billion, also topping views.RBC said Facebook continues to benefit from a surge in advertiser demand, driven by newer ad formats such as video and improved ad targeting tools.Facebook stock fell 1.8% to close at 130.84 on the stock market today after briefly going positive.Advanced Micro Devices had its price target raised to 14 from 13 by Canaccord Genuity, with a buy rating. Late Tuesday, the chipmaker delivered better-than-expected Q4 results and gave strong 2017 guidance.AMD stock rose 1.8% to close at 12.28, following a 16% pop Wednesday.Amgen was raised to a buy from neutral by BofA Merrill Lynch, with a price target of 192, ahead of its quarterly report after the close Thursday.Biotech giant Amgen is putting pressure on AbbVie (ABBV) as Amgen preps to deploy a Humira biosimilar. AbbVie's Humira, one of the world's top-selling drugs, is used to treat an array of diseases including rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.Amgen stock sliped 9 cents to end the regular trading session at 159.58, but shares climbed 3% shortly after the closing bell.Telsey Advisory Group slashed its price target on Under Armour to 18 from 34 and maintained a market perform rating.Under Armour reported fourth-quarter earnings late Tuesday that disappointed and said CFO Chip Molloy is stepping down ""due to personal reasons.""

"
145,UAA,"The ""Amazon (AMZN) effect"" is well documented. Foot traffic at brick-and-mortar stores across America are declining as people spend their dollars online.But it's also shaping what is perhaps the new normal among department stores and other retailers as they fight for market share through a beefier online presence.At Kohl's (KSS), sales for the key holiday quarter were ""weak,"" said CEO Kevin Mansell in the company's earnings release Thursday, as brick-and-mortar traffic declined. But that softness was ""offset somewhat by strength in online demand.""Kohl's shares fell 2.1% to 40.91 in the stock market today. For the key holiday quarter, total sales fell almost 3% to $6.21 billion, missing views for $6.22 billion, as comparable store sales drooped 2.2%. Per-share profit fell 9% to $1.44, besting expectations by 11 cents. Kohl's also raised its dividend by 10% to 55 cents.Fellow department store Macy's (M) logged similar Q4 results on Tuesday, with sales and comps down but ""double-digit growth"" in its online business.Wal-Mart (WMT) on Tuesday boasted a 29% U.S. e-commerce gain as its overall 1% revenue gain came up short.Soft in store, strong online is a recurring theme. Target's (TGT) November-December comparable store sales fell 3% as digital sales popped 30%. (That discounter reports next week.)But online sales are still a fraction of traditional stores' business, so it's hard for even strong e-commerce gains to move the needle.IBD'S TAKE: In an e-commerce-driven consumer landscape, the raison d'etre of malls is waning. Some shopping arenas are calling on mayhem and drama to boost foot traffic.Reducing store count is one way to combat crummy foot traffic. Kohl's said it closed 19 locations in 2016 and opened nine small-format locations, as well as a number of outlets.Macy's is 66 stores into its 100-store closure plan. The rest will be shuttered over the next few years. That will give the department store operator a ""healthy physical portfolio"" that will complement its growing online sales, said CEO Terry Lundgren on the Macy's earnings call on Tuesday.But the kicker is: as department stores close more stores, that may only in turn weigh on their e-commerce sales.""Our customers buying online love to return in store,"" said Macy's CFO Karen Hoguet on the same call. ""They love to shop in store, buy online. So we are, I think, forever going to lose some of that Macys.com business when we close a single-store market.""Macy's shares rose 0.3% on Thursday but are continuing to find resistance at their 50-day line.Wal-Mart has taken a slightly different tack with its acquisition of smaller Amazon rival Jet.com and its push into online groceries. That helped drive its strong online sales gain as the big box retailer also gave bullish overall revenue guidance. Wal-Mart's 29% online sales gain is faster than Amazon's overall revenue growth of 22%, and that's flattered by its Amazon Web Services cloud division.""We're the second-largest U.S. online retailer by revenue, one of the top three online retailers by traffic and our Wal-Mart app is among the top three apps in retail,"" said Wal-Mart CEO Doug McMillon on the call Tuesday.Wal-Mart shares fell 0.6% on Thursday but are still up solidly for the week.Wal-Mart recently dropped its Amazon Prime membership rival and announced that it would offer free two-day shipping for minimum orders of $35. Amazon this week dropped its free shipping minimum order to $35 for non-Prime members, but deliveries will take five to eight business days.Meanwhile, faster fashion and athleisure — two other ongoing trends — appear to be on the minds of Kohl's execs going into the new fiscal year.""In 2017, we will accelerate our focus on becoming the destination for active and wellness with the launch of Under Armour (UAA) in early March,"" said Mansell. ""We will also extend our efforts on improving our speed to market across all of our proprietary brands into all apparel areas and home.""Kohl's said it expects $3.50 to $3.80 in diluted per-share earnings for fiscal 2017 and a 1.3% decline to 0.7% growth in total sales, vs Wall Street forecasts for $3.73 EPS on flattish sales.Comps are expected to range from a decline of 2% to flat sales for the year.Nordstrom (JWN) reported so-so results and guidance late Thursday. The upscale department store said Nordstrom.com sales topped $2.5 billion in 2016, more than 17% of total revenue. Nordstrom shares closed down 3.1% during the regular session, but recouped those losses late.RELATED:Wal-Mart Gives Strong Revenue Guidance As Q4 Online Sales Soar 29%Macy's Eyes 'Entertainment Options' After Profit, Sales Fall For 8th Quarter

146,UAA,"Major stock indexes were firmly in the red in afternoon trading Tuesday as earnings reports and Donald Trump remained focal points. The Dow Jones industrial average underperformed, falling 0.8%, as Intel (INTC), Goldman Sachs (GS) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) lagged.Several medical-related industry groups outperformed after Trump met with Big Pharma leaders. He called on CEOs to manufacture in the U.S. to curb rising drug prices.The Nasdaq composite lost 0.6% and the S&P 500 eased 0.5%. Volume on both the NYSE and Nasdaq was tracking close to Monday's levels.Gold miners and utility stocks also outperformed.

Since hitting a low of 107 in mid-December, the ETF is up nearly 8%.Nucor (NUE) shed nearly 5% despite a big earnings beat.

Group peer U.S. Steel (X) reports after the close.Steel stocks and other infrastructure plays rallied sharply after the election but have come under recent selling pressure. Aggregate makers like Martin Marietta (MLM), Vulcan Materials (VMC) and Eagle Materials (EXP) extended losses after recent breakouts.In earnings news, Under Armour (UAA) was a big loser in the stock market today. Shares cratered 21% after the company reported weak earnings, gave a bad outlook and also announced the departure of its CFO. Under Armour offers the latest example of the dangers of buying a stock on the way down. Cheap stocks are often cheap for a reason.Two other names gapped down sharply on weak earnings: UPS (UPS) and Harley Davidson (HOG).Financial BofI Holding (BOFI) was a top performer in the IBD 50 early, but the heavily shorted stock gave back a good chunk of a 7.9% intraday gain after reporting earnings.

147,UAA,"Under Armour (UAA) shares are in a tailspin Tuesday after fourth-quarter earnings disappointed and the athletic apparel brand said CFO Chip Molloy is stepping down ""due to personal reasons.""During the key holiday shopping season, the Nike (NKE) rival logged a penny's profit decline from the prior-year to 23 cents a share on 12% revenue growth to $1.308 billion, the weakest gain in eight years. North American sales grew just 6% while international revenue (16% of the total) jumped 55%.Analysts had expected a 4% EPS rise to 25 cents with sales up 20% to $1.409 billion.""Numerous challenges and disruptions in North American retail tempered our fourth quarter results,"" said Kevin Plank, Under Armour Chairman and CEO, in a statement.The quarter is prompting something of a reset — at least of Plank's well-known whiteboard. He scrubbed the board clean of his maxims and motivational phrases (most notably ""Don't forget to sell shirts and shoes"") and replaced it with ""Keep Under Armour simple,"" he said during the earnings call.For 2017, management expects net revenue to rise 11%-12% to reach nearly $5.4 billion, well below analyst views for $6.05 billion. Along with this ""tempered"" sales growth, ""strategic investments"" will lead to a drop in operating income.Shares crashed nearly 26% to 21.49 in the stock market today, setting a three-year low. Under Armour is on track for its worst one-day stock loss since it came public in 2005.The guidance left one analyst wondering if the brand might be struggling more than it is letting on.""The revenue guidance is peculiar given the rollout into Kohl's (KSS),"" wrote Susquehanna's Sam Poser, who downgraded the stock to neutral from positive. ""However, the decision to go to the moderate channel may have been more reactive than we had previously thought.""Athletic footwear stocks have largely been having a tough go of it for the last year. Under Armour, Nike and Skechers (SKX) all posted double-digit share-price declines in 2016 amid a tough consumer environment. NPD Group said Monday that the athletic footwear industry grew a below-average 3% in 2016, with slight declines during the holiday quarter as the bankruptcies of Sports Authority and Sport Chalet.Nike stock fell 0.3% intraday, but rebounded from morning lows to close back above its 50-day line. Skechers rose 0.8% after undercutting its 50-day intraday.And as retro and classic trends rule the sneaker set, Under Armour is acknowledging that the brand does not have as much fashion cred as it could.""We need to become more fashionable with the products that are out there,"" said Plank during the call. He said the company had been counting on core basics, but today's consumer ""frankly has more options"" from good brands that are discounting their prices, he said.""The consumer expects more today, he later added.Piper Jaffray analyst Erinn Murphy, who downgraded the stock from overweight to neutral, noted the slowdown.""By segment, apparel grew only 7% — well below the 17% growth rate we anticipated and while footwear was still a healthy 36%, we see the slowing apparel as a significant concern to the brand given the importance of this category,"" she wrote.But Plank, predictably, still sounded bullish on the future, particularly the China and womenswear markets.""Our eyes are wide open and we're ready to run in 2017 and beyond,"" he said.When Molloy steps down, senior VP David Bergman will take over as acting CFO on Feb. 3, said Under Armour.RELATED:Spring Retail Playoffs: J.C.

148,UAA,"Is Under Armour (UAA) running out of steam? Will it report decent holiday-quarter sales? Have we reached peak ""athleisure""?Depends on who you ask. But first, a quick recap.When the Nike (NKE) rival reports fourth-quarter results Tuesday morning, earnings are expected to rise a penny, or 4%, from last year's Q4 to 25 cents a share, while revenue is seen growing 20% to $1.41 billion, which would mark a sequential slowdown on both fronts.Last quarter's solid beat was overshadowed by lowered growth projections, sending Under Armour shares down over 13% and into a slump from which they have not recovered.Management emphasized that the trimmed forecast came in exchange for growth-focused investments, but the revised target for midteens annual operating income growth (vs. prior outlook for 23% growth) has apparently been sitting well with investors.Athletic brands have been on the defensive lately, with Nike management coming out swinging on its earnings call last month as it insisted that ""basketball is back"" and that Nike is ""well-positioned"" for the latter half of its fiscal year.IBD'S TAKE: Under Armour is just one of many notable earnings reports. Be prepared for the coming market day with IBD's Investing Action Plan. Today's action plan highlights Tuesday earnings from Apple, Exxon, MasterCard, AMD and more.More broadly, Under Armour shares have slid over 30% in the last year. Its peers haven't fared much better. Nike — the biggest underperformer on the Dow in 2016 — is down 15% over the trailing 12 months, while Skechers (SKX) has fallen 13%.Under Armour shares fell 0.65% to 28.94 on the stock market today, close to a two-and-a-half-year low set on Jan. 23. Nike and Skechers shares dipped 0.2%.So what to expect on Tuesday?Retailers generally didn't have a great Christmas shopping season, and NPD Group data hint at a potentially troubled holiday picture for gym-shoe makers as well.Research firm NPD said Monday that the overall U.S. athletic footwear industry grew a below-average 3% in 2016, logging gains through the first three quarters of the year but declining ""slightly"" in the all-important holiday quarter.The bankruptcies of Sports Authority and Sport Chalet weighed on Q4, said NPD sports industry analyst Matt Powell in a release. He sees the impact of the retail closures ending after Q1.Cowen found Under Armour's promotional activity over the holidays ""concerning,"" but analyst John Kernan said shares are ""already discounting bad news"" and highlighted that the brand continues to gain market share from Nike in apparel.Kernan has a market perform rating on Under Armour.Morgan Stanley analyst Jay Sole, a noted Under Armour bear, said that the company's Q4 results will ""indicate its sales growth rate is slowing more than the market expects,"" with the ""most acute"" issues being in Under Armour's women's and basketball shoe segments.Calling Under Armour ""a much more mature brand than the market realizes,"" Sole has an underweight rating on the stock.Under Armour bulls believe otherwise. Susquehanna's Sam Poser, who has a positive rating on the name, says Under Armour is ""playing the long-game,"" and says "" the decision to slow profit flow-through is, in a telling way, indicative of all that is right about the way Under Armour is approaching its business.""And Piper Jaffray's Erinn Murphy, despite acknowledging that some of the company's initiatives — in mid-tier channels, international and footwear — are ""proving more expensive than we once thought, we do not believe the ultimate opportunity for the brand has changed.""Plus, athletic trends aren't going away anytime soon, wrote Murphy, who has an overweight rating on the stock.""We view athletic as one of the only domestic softlines categories with both the ability to deliver reliable unit growth and pricing over the coming years,"" she said. ""Our checks continue to indicate square footage expansion of the category across multiple channels into 2017.""RELATED:Dow Dog Nike Comes Out Swinging; Bullish On North America, BasketballUnder Armour Dives On Growth Targets; Execs Vow To Invest 'Aggressively'

Here poses a threat to Google Maps owner Alphabet (GOOGL).Mobileye ticked down 1 cent to 42.95, rebounding from earlier lows.

150,UAA,"Add Sears Holdings (SHLD) and Sears-owned Kmart to the list of companies that are shedding some Trump-branded products — but the company insists that politics has nothing to do with it.The major retailer said on Saturday that Sears and Kmart would no longer carry several dozen Trump Home products, according to Reuters.""As part of the company's initiative to optimize its online product assortment, we constantly refine that assortment to focus on our most profitable items,"" said Sears Holdings spokesperson Brian Hanover, according to a statement acquired by the outlet.""Amid that streamlining effort, 31 Trump Home items were among the items removed online this week,"" he said. Those products were reportedly sold only online and not in brick-and-mortar Sears and Kmart stores.But responding to recent headlines via blog post, Sears said Monday that the changes reflect a routine shuffle of its product assortment and that ""hundreds"" of Trump and Ivanka Trump items are available on Sears.com through third-party marketplace sellers.""I think any fair observer can understand why this confusion was generated and why we prefer to remain focused on serving our members and our marketplace sellers and leave the politics to others,"" wrote Sears Holdings Vice President of Corporate Communications Chris Brathwaite.Sears shares plunged 8.1% to close the regular trading session at 6.40 on the stock market today. But the stock rose nearly 26% Friday as the ailing retailer said it will slash costs further and could sell more core brands and real estate. The stock hit its lowest level since 2003 on Wednesday.Meanwhile, the Wall Street Journal reported Saturday a 32% sales decline of Ivanka Trump-brand merchandise at Nordstrom (JWN) in the prior fiscal year, citing internal Nordstrom data. The data also reportedly shows a more-than-70% sales tumble of the brand's footwear and clothing items in the second, third and fourth weeks of October vs. prior-year sales. Those weeks marked the period leading up to the election.IBD'S TAKE: With or without scrutiny from the president, retailers have been facing challenges, and malls have been forced to ramp up the drama in the age of Amazon (AMZN). Here's what that looks like.Boycotts of Trump-branded goods have surfaced in the form of the Grab Your Wallet campaign and criticism online. The President fired off a tweet at Nordstrom on Wednesday, less than a week after reports emerged that the upscale department store was dropping his daughters line of merchandise.My daughter Ivanka has been treated so unfairly by @Nordstrom. She is a great person -- always pushing me to do the right thing! Terrible!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 8, 2017Nordstrom said the change was a reflection of sales performance.While this is far from the first time that Trump has singled out an individual company on Twitter (TWTR), his tweet at the department store has raised concerns about ethical conflicts of interests and a blurred line between his roles as president and businessman.Despite the attack, Nordstrom shares rose sharply on Wednesday to notch its biggest one-day gain in two months. But Nordstrom dipped 2.3% Monday morning.Fashion news site Racked.com has reported that Neiman Marcus, Belk, HSN and ShopStyle have dropped Ivanka Trump merchandise.Meanwhile, Wal-Mart (WMT)-owned Jet.com also appears to have pulled Trump-branded goods, Mic reported, though Wal-Mart itself still offers Trump merchandise.T.J. Maxx and Marshalls, both owned by off-priced retail specialist TJX Cos. (TJX), also seem to be pulling back on Ivanka clothing.In other news, Under Armour (UAA) CEO Kevin Plank is under fire from his own brand's endorsers after calling Trump ""a real asset to the country"" in a recent CNBC interview.RELATED:President Trump Attacks Nordstrom To Defend Daughter's Business Sears Could Sell More Brands, Real Estate To Cut $1 Billion

151,UAA,"The major indexes closed at fresh record highs Friday as the market made a broad advance.The Nasdaq composite climbed 0.3%, the S&P 500 0.4% and the Dow Jones industrial average 0.5%. Indexes came off session highs in the final couple of hours but held to more than half the day's winnings. The small-cap Russell 2000, Dow utilities and Dow transports outperformed with 0.7% gains.Volume was higher on the Nasdaq and lower on the NYSE, according to early numbers. Breadth was strong: Winners topped losers by 13-to-5 on the NYSE and by 17-to-9 on the Nasdaq.Indexes closed higher for the week, which saw consumer and metals stocks make some of the best strides. Apparel, toy, retail, RV, video game, steel and mining were some of the top 20 industry groups for the week.Game software was the best industry group in today's trading after Activision Blizzard (ATVI) catapulted 19% on strong earnings. The stock closed in buy range from the 45.65 buy point.Apparel stocks also led despite the fact that Under Armour (UAA) has been a drag on the group. Columbia Sportswear (COLM) leapt more than 12% after earnings for the fourth quarter beat expectations. The stock surged above its 50-day and 200-day moving averages and continues to form an undefined pattern.Fiber optics was a hot industry, thanks largely to Infinera's (INFN) 27% surge on its Q4 results. Its per-share loss beat estimates, and analysts believe the optical communications device maker's revenue growth is rebounding. The stock, however, is rebounding from a severe decline that started in August 2015.Despite a low ranking, the industry group is sparkling with other fast-rising stock such as Lumentum (LITE) and Finisar (FNSR).But the telecom infrastructure group was Friday's worst, something that could be rightly blamed on Ubiquity Network's (UBNT) 17% implosion. The stock gapped below its 50-day line in huge volume, causing a sell signal. The company's December-period earnings missed estimates late Thursday.In the finance sector, Piper Jaffray (PJC) broke out of a cup-without-handle base, clearing the 77.90 buy point. Volume was a little higher than average. The investment bank's earnings on Feb. 2 beat expectations, which sent shares back above the 50-day line and up the right side of the base.RELATED:Infinera Sales, Q1 Sales Outlook Beat, Bulls See Rebound Coming Activision Blizzard Soars On Q4 Beat; Stock Hits Buy Point

But Nvidia (NVDA) and Yelp (YELP) tumbled after hours.The Dow, Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 each rose 0.6%. Small caps fared even better as the Russell 2000 surged 1.4%. Volume was lighter vs. Wednesday, according to early figures.After the close, Nvidia was down 3% despite a solid Q4 earnings and sales beat. Its EPS of 99 cents trounced views for 83 cents; revenue of $2.17 billion topped consensus estimates for $2.11 billion. But it guided for in-line sales in the current quarter and hinted at lower gross profit margin.Shares closed the regular session down 2% in light trade. The stock had climbed past a 120.03 cup-base buy point intraday Tuesday before easing the past two sessions.Yelp sank 8% in extended trading after its Q4 EPS ex items beat views by a penny and revenue slightly outpaced forecasts. But shares sank on its disappointing Q1 and 2017 revenue outlook. The stock closed the regular session with a fractional gain to close 4% below a 43.46 cup-base buy point.During the regular session, steel makers, apparel companies and discount retailers outperformed in the stock market today. But gold miners, paper and chip stocks underperformed. West Texas intermediate crude prices rose more than 1% to $53.53 a barrel; gold futures dipped nearly 1% to $1,232 an ounce.Nike led blue chips with a 2.7% jump to retake its 200-day line in fast trade for its fourth consecutive advance. The athletic shoe powerhouse in December reported quarterly results that beat forecasts, while rival Under Armour (UAA) gapped down and plunged 23% on Jan. 31 after its earnings and sales missed.Tesla (TSLA) cruised 2.7% higher in speedy turnover to its best levels in 16 months. Shares are near the top of a buy range from a 258.56 cup-with-handle entry. The electric car maker is reportedly planning to start test production of its Model 3 entry-level sedan on Feb. 20, according to Reuters, well ahead of its July mass-production target. Paycom Software (PAYC) gapped up and surged 13%, regaining its 50-day and 200-day lines and breaking out past the 51.07 buy point of a choppy consolidation. The human resources software provider reported higher-than-expected Q4 results and forward guidance.But Twitter (TWTR) dived 12% as it gapped down below its 50- and 200-day lines in massive turnover. The social media site reported Q4 earnings per share that beat, but revenue that sharply missed, views. The number of monthly active users also missed analyst forecasts. Year-over-year advertising revenue fell.In economic news, first-time jobless claims dipped 5% in the latest week to 234,000, below economist forecasts for an increase to 250,000.

154,UAA,"Technology startups faced a tough climate over the last year.The Bloomberg U.S. Startups Barometer, a weekly gauge that tracks both the funding flowing into private tech companies as well as the exits that make their investors money, is now near its lowest level since 2014. But venture capitalists are optimistic that things will turn around this year.For one, investors expect more initial public offerings this year. Last year was a particularly slow one for IPOs as well as acquisitions within the tech industry — so it's not surprising that investors expect 2017 will be better.The hope is that successful IPOs from some of the largest startups such as Snap (SNAP), which filed publicly last week for an initial share sale, will encourage smaller companies that have been on the fence to go public.""Most bankers are predicting 30 to 40 IPOs, and that's up substantially over 2016,"" said Scott Raney, a partner at Redpoint Ventures. ""A lot of companies think it's a good time to go public, and a lot of companies have the ability to go public.""But the industry got a bit of a shock when AppDynamics, which was expected to be a trendsetter for the year's tech IPOs, announced a surprise sale to Cisco Systems (CSCO) the day before it was supposed to price its shares.Another reason for optimism is that venture capital firms are stockpiled with cash. VCs raised $41.6 billion in 2016, the most since 2001, according to research firm PitchBook Data and the National Venture Capital Association.With that amount of cash sitting on the sidelines, there's a good chance it will be put to use in the near future, said Nizar Tarhuni, an analyst at PitchBook.Also, the stock market is booming. On Jan. 25, the Dow Jones industrial average cracked 20,000 for the very first time.Public companies, ""seeing their stock price go up, are more emboldened to acquire smaller companies,"" said Maha Ibrahim, general partner at Canaan Partners.Further, favorable policies could free up cash at big tech companies. President Trump has suggested cutting taxes on companies' accumulated offshore earnings to persuade them to bring back that money to the U.S. If his repatriation plan goes into effect, many companies may start making use of their overseas profits — not just to build factories and create jobs, as Trump has intended, but also to fund domestic investments.""If that happens, I would assume there's going to be a ton of M&A,"" said Marvin Liao, a partner at 500 Startups. ""There's a very good chance of that happening under his regime.""Finally, even nontech companies are interested in startups. It's not just the tech giants like Alphabet's Google (GOOGL) and Facebook (FB) that are interested in startups — there's a new batch of buyers in industries like retail that are looking to acquire the talent, the strategies and the customer base that their smaller rivals have developed.There's been ""a rush of nontech incumbents active in private tech markets as of late, like Wal-Mart (WMT) and Jet.com, Unilever (UL) and Dollar Shave Club, Under Armour (UAA) and MyFitnessPal,"" said Vas Natarajan, a partner at Accel Partners.For large companies, spending a few billion dollars to acquire a tech business is a small price to pay to mitigate the threats that these startups pose to their core business, according to Natarajan.RELATED:IPO Stock News And AnalysisWhat Are Today's Top-Performing IPOs?

155,UAA,"J.C. Penney (JCP) and Nike (NKE) have joined forces to launch Nike ""brand shop environments"" in more than 600 J.C. Penney stores, the department store chain said Tuesday.The linkup between the midlevel department store company and major sports apparel brand pits them directly against another similar duo. Under Armour (UAA) announced last July a move to roll out products at around 600 Kohl's (KSS) locations starting early this year.On the surface, the most notable difference in the two alliances appears to be the gender of their target consumers.The 500 sq. ft. Nike shop-in-shops, which are now available, have been placed in a ""prominent location within the men's department,"" said J.C. Penney, and will feature basketball, training and running product areas. The details found in the press release appeared primarily geared toward men's products, though the company said ""similar visual elements are available in select stores for women and kids.""Meanwhile, Under Armour Chief Executive Kevin Plank acknowledged last year that the majority of Kohl's customers are women shoppers.""We think Kohl's is a great evolution for us,"" said Plank in Under Armour's second-quarter call in late July, adding he thinks there's ""a big opportunity"" in the women's market.IBD's TAKE: What's in store for American shoppers? A ""reckoning,"" says one expert.The move comes at a time when athletic wear remains popular but department stores have largely been struggling to keep abreast of Amazon.com (AMZN) and other online shopping destinations.A brief postelection rally for department stores soon gave way to a downswing that was further weighed down by weak holiday sales figures. Macy's (M), Nordstrom (JWN), Kohl's, J.C. Penney have all been trading well below their key 50-day and 200-day moving averages.But shares of J.C. Penney advanced 2.7% on the stock market today, as retailers and apparel makers generally rallied following President-elect Trump's negative comments about a House GOP plan to tax imports. Nike climbed 1.4% and Kohl's 1.45%. Under Armour closed up 0.2%.RELATED:Wal-Mart, Best Buy, Apple Rally After Trump Pans GOP Border Adjustment TaxRetailers Face 2017 'Reckoning,' More 'Sad Malls' As Amazon Keeps Booming

160,UAA,"Nike (NKE) management sounded extremely bullish late Tuesday after Q2 earnings per share rose vs. forecasts for the first decline in more than four years, following recent investor bearishness and concern over its ""futures"" orders growth.Shares have tumbled over 17% in 2016, making it the worst performer on the Dow Jones industrial average by far, amid retail choppiness and an increasingly crowded athletic apparel market. Under Armour (UAA) and Adidas continue to challenge the sports apparel titan; the latter in particular has seen a resurgence in popularity in the U.S.But the plan is to grow both Nike and the overall marketplace, and Nike Brand President Trevor Edwards said on the company's conference call that there is ""tremendous potential"" in North America.The company also is seeing ""incredible momentum"" in its basketball business, which was the subject of some investor worry, and momentum is solid in China, he added.""To be clear, basketball is back,"" Edwards said.CEO Mark Parker said the company is ""well-positioned for the back half of the year.""This also marked the first earnings release that did not provide the company's futures orders, a term that reflects products scheduled for delivery to retailers. A shift in its business mix, i.e. more direct-to-consumer sales growth, has rendered the metric less relevant now, management said in the previous quarter's call.Reporting the figure during the earnings call instead, CFO Andy Campion emphasized that Nike's revenue outlook reflects more comprehensive guidance, vs. futures as a proxy for guidance.For the quarter, futures ex-currency rose 2%. Reported futures were flat vs. the prior-year period.Nike shares climbed 1.5% in late trading, giving up some earlier gains on the disappointing futures orders data. Shares closed up 1.9% at 51.79 on the stock market today, rising above their 50-day moving average. Under Armour edged up 0.1% late.Estimates: Profit was seen declining 4% to 43 cents a share. Revenue was expected to grow 5% to $8.09 billion.Results: Nike earned 50 cents a share, up 11%. Revenue rose 6% to $8.18 billion, or 8% excluding currency effects.Among key regions:North America sales rose 3% to $3.65 billion.Western Europe sales rose 7% to $1.385 billion, or 12% excluding currency effects.Greater China sales jumped 12% to $1.055 billion, or 17% stripping out foreign exchange swings.Emerging markets revenue rose 6% to $1.047 billion, but that was a 13% gain without currency effects.Mall-based athletic shoe retailer Finish Line (FINL) will report quarterly results Wednesday morning.
"
161,UAA,"Since Nike last reported quarterly earnings, a few things have changed.America elected a new president, Adidas is back at the No. 2 spot in the U.S. athletic market and Nike's upcoming second-quarter earnings release will no longer prominently feature its highly watched ""futures"" orders, a metric that has been known to move share prices.Of those factors, the contentious election might be the least impactful on Nike so far. Shares have only slipped 0.6% since Nov. 8, though the stock has tumbled 19% this calendar year. Nike dipped 0.1% to close at 50.85 on the stock market today, dropping further below its 50-day line.""I don't think the election has impacted consumer demand, but many apparel retail stocks have traded down on concerns over possible changes to trade regulations,"" said Morningstar apparel retail analyst Bridget Weishaar (who does not cover Nike), when asked about the impact of the election on the broader retail environment.When Nike reports after the close Tuesday, per-share profit is expected to decline 4% to 43 cents on 5% revenue growth to $8.09 billion.Significantly, this will mark the first earnings release that does not share the company's futures orders, a Nike-made term that reflects products scheduled for delivery to retailers.As the company points shoppers to its app, website and stand-alone Nike stores, the metric is losing some relevance — at least, to Nike, which said in its last earnings call that its ""evolving business mix"" means that futures and revenue are less correlated now.Shifting the disclosure to the earnings call with management may alleviate some of the pressure around the quarterly figure, particularly following the last three quarters of missed forecasts.IBD'S TAKE: Wondering what happened last quarter? Nike beat on both the top and bottom lines but its stock took a hit when futures growth fell short of expectations. You can stop looking at that metric now, said Nike.Meanwhile, Adidas and Under Armour (UAA) remain pressing challengers.Nike ""faces potentially peak market share and operating margin in N. America as Adidas remains in a robust product cycle while Under Armour expands distribution and categories,"" wrote Cowen analyst John Kernan in a Dec. 6 report, downgrading Nike to market perform from underperform.Its three-striped rival, Adidas, is back in the spotlight following a sluggish period in the U.S. that saw the athletic apparel maker ceding its second-place spot to Under Armour in 2014. The Germany-based maker of Superstar and Stan Smith shoes has since clawed its way back up, however.From NPD Retail Tracking service, Adidas has once again attained #2 spot in US sport footwear & apparel, passing UA. and behind Nike/Jordan— Matt Powell (@NPDMattPowell) October 25, 2016Investors and analysts will also be looking for further signs of slowing in Nike's basketball business.But such concerns are ""overdone"" and ""shortsighted,"" wrote Susquehanna analyst Sam Poser on Monday, highlighting the company's brand and innovation pipeline. He has a positive rating on the stock.""The point is, NKE doesn't remain complacent for very long and the stock chart reflects this,"" said Poser. ""Historically, shares rallied 20%+ following other periods of investor angst (Mar-Sep 2002, Jan-Aug 2006, May-July 2012). We believe the recent pullback is a buying opportunity.""Also next week, mall-based athletic shoe retailer Finish Line (FINL) will report quarterly earnings on Wednesday. Analysts expect a loss of 18 cents a share, narrowing from a 49-cent loss a year earlier. Finish Line sells shoes from Nike, Under Armour and Adidas.After breaking out past a buy point on Dec. 8, Finish Line stock has fallen for six straight sessions.RELATED:Skechers Comeback Seen; Nike Loss To Under Armour, Adidas Could RampNike Seeks 'Energy Harvesting,' Augmented-Reality PatentsUnder Armour Clinches First Pro-Sports Deal; Nike Gets Nod From HSBC

162,UAA,"The Nasdaq and small-cap firms pared some of their gains with less than 15 minutes remaining in Thursday's session. Investors digested a new rate hike by the Federal Reserve and the odds that three more increases in the cost of money may arrive in 2017.Meanwhile, investors continued to shove their way into Nvidia (NVDA) and Apple (AAPL), two of the most innovative tech firms in the fast-growing fields of artificial intelligence, digital entertainment, self-driving transportation and online video.The former, rising 2.3% to 98.66, has thrust past a 96.63-98.56 buying zone for short-term investors, according to IBD's newest premium product, IBD Swing Trader.As noted in an earlier Stock Market Today column, Nvidia was poised to triple since initially breaking out of a cup-with-handle base at 33.16 in mid-March.IBD'S TAKE: The cup with handle is one of the most common chart patterns that the top growth stocks form just before breaking out to new highs and staging monster gains amid a market uptrend. Learn about this and other key patterns by taking free IBD University courses and reading Investor's Corner on a daily basis.Apple, meanwhile, was up nearly 0.7% to 115.97, and got as high as 116.73, a strong sign of outperformance by the largest company in the U.S. markets by market value ($619 billion). For now, a new base-on-base buy point has emerged at 118.79.The Nasdaq composite faded a bit from an intraday high of 5485, yet still gained more than 0.7% at around 2:15 p.m. ET. The Nasdaq 100 was up 0.5%.The S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrials also faded a bit but held gains of 0.3% to 0.4%; the Russell 2000 outpaced the two large- and megacap indexes with a 0.6% gain.Leading bank and financial shares helped hoist the indexes higher. Dow 30 components American Express (AXP) rallied nearly 1.3% to 75, extending its gains from a breakout past a 68.03 bottoming-style saucer with handle to slightly more than 10%.Goldman Sachs (GS) stretched to new multiyear highs with a 1.6% jump to 243.66. It' s now just 3% shy of eclipsing an all-time peak of 250.70 set in October 2007, before the ""Great Recession"" bear market of 2008 to early 2009. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) rallied nearly 2% to 85.99; the Wall Street and consumer and business lending giant has now risen more than 32% past a 65.08 cup with handle that formed within its large bottoming base.Volume was running sharply higher on both main exchanges vs. the same time Wednesday.In the stock market today, a flurry of tech industry groups, as seen in IBD's daily ranking of 197 industry groups, showed heavy buying demand by institutions. Top tech industry groups for the day included medical software (up more than 6%), fiber optic telecom (up more than 2%), computer hardware and peripherals (+2%), fabless semiconductor (+1.8%) and semiconductor manufacturing (+1.8%).Perhaps the market perceives the latest hike in short-term interest rates as having a minimal impact on companies' growth prospects in 2017.Apple got a boost in part by bullish comments from analysts at Needham as the investment bank called it a top pick for 2017 and forecast a 30% price gain in shares.Apple, which originally pushed past a 110.33 cup-with-handle buy point on Sept. 14 within a long bottoming base pattern, rallied as much as 7.5% before retreating below that proper entry. But in November, Apple showed fortitude with a strong bounce off the 200-day line. And last week, shares thrust back above the 50-day moving average, a key signal of renewed demand from big fund managers.The Accumulation/Distribution Rating for Apple has improved to a bullish B-, according to IBD Stock Checkup. The rating tracks price and volume changes over the past 13 weeks to give users an idea of whether a stock is under net accumulation or net distribution.In the fabless semiconductor industry group, Semtech (SMTC) continues to act well after shares cleared a 28.30 cup-base buy point on Nov. 23. The stock gained 0.9% to 32.45 on Thursday, rising more than 15% past the proper entry, so it's extended for now. Intraday, shares made a new 52-week high of 33.25.For nearly a week, volume stayed quiet following Semtech's breakout. However, turnover bulged 473% above the 50-day average on Dec. 1 and shares jumped more than 3.5% after the expert designer in mixed-signal integrated circuits reported a 95% surge in October-ended fiscal Q3 earnings to 37 cents a share, nearly 3% above the consensus view.The gain stretched a streak of accelerating growth to three quarters. Earnings dropped 50% in the fourth quarter of the prior fiscal year, then rose 11% and 46% the following two periods.Sales grew 18% to $137 million, marking a third quarter of accelerating growth (following a drop of 9%, then gains of 1% and 8%). Wall Street sees Semtech's earnings per share rising 58% to $1.36 in fiscal 2017, then climbing an additional 21% to $1.65 in fiscal 2018, ending in January that year.On the downside, apparel makers slid hard. Under Armour (UAA) dropped sharply for the third time in four sessions, sinking 2.4% to 30.91. An attempt to rally back above the key 50-day moving average last week failed.The sportswear leader has shown impressive fundamentals that include 26 straight quarters of 20%-plus top-line growth. Yet the Baltimore-based firm faced a fast-changing brick-and-mortar retailing landscape as UA's key partner, Sports Authority, decided earlier this year not to pursue restructuring and keep some of its shops open.While Under Armour operates its own trademark and outlet stores, the bulk of its revenue comes from the wholesale channel. In Q3, sales in that segment grew 19% to $1.01 billion, while direct-to-consumer sales jumped 29%. International net revenue surged 80% on a currency-neutral basis.Keep track of the uptrend's health by monitoring IBD's The Big Picture column as well as IBD ETF Market Strategy, which offers subscribers signals on whether to be 100% invested in a diversified equity-index-tracking exchange traded fund, 50% invested, or fully in cash.RELATED:Will Tesla Motors Join Apple As A Future Stock Breakout?What Is The Bottoming Base Pattern, And Why Apple May Form One AgainThe Bottoming Base Pattern, Part II: How Apple Formed One In 2009The Case For A Trump Era Secular Bull Run; Which Sectors Will Thrive In 2017?

163,UAA,"Talk about hot! Imagine if quarterback Tom Brady were as good at playing defense as he is at leading the New England Patriots offense. That would be impressive, right? Well, that two-way talent is what fund manager Craig Hodges displayed in 2016.Hodges is a quarterback of the $15.9 million Hodges Pure Contrarian Fund (HDPCX), whose 71% gain through Dec. 29 outperformed all other U.S. diversified stock funds regardless of size. Contrarian is a small-cap value strategy. At the same time, he's also lead signal-caller for the $411.5 million Hodges Fund (HDPMX), whose 40.47% gain made it 2016's third-best performing growth fund.Value. And growth. Two very different strategies. And outperformers both.Hodges Fund, the larger of the two portfolios, has been driven by leaders like Southwest Airlines (LUV), which climbed 16% in 2016 and has a strong IBD Composite Rating of 92; construction and industrial leasor United Rentals (URI), which jumped 46% for the year and also sports a 92 Comp Rating; and construction materials maker Eagle Materials (EXP), up 63% in 2016 and boasting a 90 Comp Rating.IBD's TAKE: Hodges Fund co-manager Eric Marshall recently told IBD why he and Craig Hodges like stocks such as Horizon Pharma, Facebook and Texas Pacific Land Trust.Hodges is also CEO and chief investment officer of Hodges Capital Management and the son of Donald Hodges, founder of Hodges Capital's parent company. Craig Hodges, 53 years old, talked with IBD about his investment approach from his office in Dallas.IBD: What should investors do with their portfolios in 2017?Hodges: We're optimistic about some niches in retail, some selected companies. J.C. Penney (JCP) is one. Some low-hanging fruit. The old (company management) regime almost wrecked the company. The new regime is turning the company around, making it profitable.We don't like retail as a whole, but we like some selected names like Duluth Holdings (DLTH) and G-III Apparel (GIII), which have significant upside.And there are some names in consumer discretionary. Adidas (ADDYY) has taken market share from Under Armour (UAA) and Nike (NKE). There are some names we feel good about.IBD: Which existing holdings got a boost from the Trump election?Hodges: We owned a good position in U.S. Concrete (USCR) as well as Eagle Materials and U.S. Steel (X). Those could benefit if the new administration acts on its interest in investing in infrastructure.We already had quite a bit of exposure to energy, and we added to some like Diamondback Energy (FANG), RSP Permian (RSPP) and Matador Resources (MTDR). Those are our three favorite Permian Basin plays. Hillary Clinton was viewed as anti-fracking, so a lot of those stocks went up. Long term, we think those companies are as well situated as any we know in energy.Volaris Avia (VLRS), a Mexican airline, dropped from about 20 to about 14 or 15. It was on concerns that trade with Mexico would be affected. But we think that fear is political rhetoric. In fact, we think trade with Mexico will be a big part of what (the U.S. does).IBD: Have you bought any stocks that looked poised to benefit from the Trump election?Hodges: Yes, one is Forterra (FRTA). They're in the water infrastructure industry. They provide cast cement piping, precast products for a wide range of water-related infrastructure, even drainage. If you build a road or bridge, drainage is essential. And they have a good management team. They had an IPO right before the election. That was not a good time for an IPO, so we got it at a favorable time.About Nov. 11 (as its share price climbed) we started buying a larger stake. We bought quite a bit in the 17-18 range. It ran up above 20, pulled back, then we added to it. Now it's trading near a 52-week high (around 22).We bought some (Mexico-based) Cemex (CX) ADRs. Thirty percent of their business is in the U.S. They got hit hard by the election results. We think the stock has a good chance to go back to where it was before the election.IBD: Am I right in thinking that Contrarian and Hodges funds are about as different as funds can be?Hodges: Contrarian is just that. It buys the most out-of-favor, unloved name we can come across. About 80% of its stocks would never cross over into Hodges Fund.IBD: Freeport McMoRan (FCX) posted eight straight quarters of EPS slowdown before finally notching a gain. Why do you still like this mining company?Hodges: Our assessment is that they will survive. They're doing things necessary to survive. They're selling off Gulf oil properties, getting their balance sheet squared away, fixing their short-term ills. Our cost is under 6 per share. (It's trading around 13.50). They're not out of the woods, but their asset sales will get them out of the woods.IBD: Facebook (FB) said last month that its advertising-revenue growth rate would slow, which hurt its share price. Do you still like the stock?Hodges: We think it's the ultimate social media company. They're the ones that continue to gain market share. They're diversified. They own Instagram. They're the ones hurting Twitter (TWTR). They're rock solid in my mind.For us, it's a way to participate in what's going on in social media without paying a crazy multiple. It's not inexpensive, but relative to their number of users and how fast it's growing, it's inexpensive.The stock hasn't done much for a quarter and a half. Maybe people who bought it in the 130s are selling and taking losses. But the stock will do well next year.IBD: Southwest Airlines posted a 1% decline in earnings per share growth in the third quarter and it expects a revenue decline in Q4. Do you still like the airline?Hodges: The days of wild fluctuations in earnings for airlines are gone. The competitive landscape is more friendly. They've gone from eight main carriers to three, and Southwest is the fourth.There are barriers to entry. It's expensive to buy the fuel-efficient planes that you need to compete. Meanwhile, Southwest is paying down debt. You've seen a decrease in airlines' earnings estimates, but most are up 30% to 40% (in share prices) for the year. All are buying back their stock. I imagine Delta (DAL) (which Hodges Fund also owns) will continue to raise its dividend. Others might pay more, once they pay back debt. Southwest is buying back a lot.IBD: Match Group (MTCH) aims to help people get an education and get a spouse. It's somewhat new to Hodges Fund. What's your thesis?Hodges: They are like the Facebook of online dating. They own several different dating sites. Their biggest is Match.com, but they also own OKCupid, PlentyOfFish and BlackPeopleMeet. They have 45 dating brands. In the education space, they own PrincetonReview.com.They make money from advertising and membership fees. They don't have a great growth rate, but they own such a good(-size) part of the business that it creates a barrier to entry.IBD: United States Steel's earnings per share grew 61% and 157% the past two quarters after slowing for five quarters in a row. What's the driver?Hodges: The main thing is, people don't understand how hard it is to get into the business, even after there have been so many bankruptcies and so much consolidation. And China has been dumping steel into the U.S. for years. Now there's a president who not only will refine trade agreements but push to get a level playing field for companies like U.S. Steel.There just isn't a lot of (U.S.) competition, but U.S. Steel has tremendous earnings power. Shares trade in the mid-30s. Shares traded near 200 in 2008 on $17 per share in earnings. They're not going near that. But this company could earn $4 to $5 a share in two to three years. On that, the stock could trade back into the 60s or 70s. With a more robust economy, you could see some real multiple expansion.RELATED:2017 Personal Finance Action Plan & 2016 Stock Market ReviewTop-Notch Investor's Bets On Likely Trump-Era Stock LeadersFranklin DynaTech's Matthew Moberg Wins With Stocks Of InnovatorsWarren Buffett Liked Airlines So Much That He Bought Several

169,UAA,"Herbalife Ltd. (HLF  -  Free Report) is slated to release first-quarter 2018 results on May 3. This provider of nutrition and weight management solutions has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 28.6% in the trailing four quarters. Let’s see what’s in store this time.Factors Impacting the QuarterHerbalife remains dedicated toward implementing new technologies and making advancements in the digital space. This is evident from its recently inked deal with Salesforce, which is likely to bring various CRM capacities to Herbalife’s distributors and customers. Moreover, the company remains focused on undertaking innovations in order to align with the changing needs of customers. Incidentally, it launched more than 70 products globally during the fourth quarter. We believe that such efforts are likely to bear a positive impact the company’s performance in the first quarter of 2018.Well, such endeavors to enhance performance, combined with an impressive earnings history have buoyed investor optimism on the stock. Evidently, the stock rallied 67.5% over the past year, in comparison with the industry’s decline of 17.8%. However, Herbalife has been battling soft volumes due to stringent FTC regulations in the United States, which has been marring sales in the North American region. Further, volumes have been weak in the Mexico region, stemming from the impact of earthquakes in 2017. Owing to such headwinds, sales volumes in the North American and Mexico regions tumbled 7.3% and 8.4% respectively, during fourth-quarter 2017. As a result, overall, volume points slid 1.8% to 1.3 billion in the last reported quarter. Such adverse conditions are likely to persist in the aforementioned markets and consequently drag overall performance.That said, lets now take a look at the picture unveiled by the Zacks Model as well as expectations for the upcoming quarterly announcement.Which Way are Estimates Moving?The company expects adjusted earnings per share to range from 90 cents to $1.10. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at $1.07, which shows a 13.7% decline from $1.24 recorded in the year-ago period. This estimate has remained stable in the last 30 days.Herbalife LTD. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Herbalife LTD. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Herbalife LTD. QuoteHowever, analysts polled by Zacks anticipate revenues to climb 1.6% year over year to $1,120 million. For first-quarter 2018, Herbalife expects net sales growth in a range of negative 1% to 3% rise.Zacks ModelOur proven model doesn’t conclude that Herbalife is likely to beat bottom-line estimates this quarter. For this to happen, a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold).

170,UAA,"Pinnacle Foods Inc. (PF  -  Free Report) is slated to release first-quarter 2018 results on May 3. This provider of branded food products delivered a negative earnings surprise in the last reported quarter, though it has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 2.8% in the trailing four quarters. Let’s see what’s in store for Pinnacle Foods this time around.Pinnacle Foods Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Pinnacle Foods Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Pinnacle Foods Inc. Quote Can Revenue-Driving Initiatives Offset Hurdles?Pinnacle Foods should continue gaining from its focus on acquisitions, innovations and robust brand portfolio. Well, the company has a solid customer reach, as its products can be found in over 85% U.S. households. Pinnacle Foods has been undertaking constant innovations to maintain market share. Some noteworthy innovations in the past include new varieties of the Duncan Hines Decadent, Duncan Hines Perfect Size baking kits, Birds Eye product lines and Vlasic purely pickles. The company also revealed plans to roll out new products under the Birds Eye brand and will also be expand its Hungry-Man Handful line in 2018, which may benefit the quarter to be reported. These factors, along with improved pricing and contributions from its Duncan Hines Grocery and Birds Eye Frozen businesses fueled its top line in the last reported quarter, wherein the company delivered a solid in-market performance. Moreover, the quarter marked Pinnacle Foods’ 15th straight quarter of market share growth.However, sales were somewhat by exit of certain low-margin Aunt Jemima (“AJ”) products, shut down of Boulder UK operations and soft underlying sales. Weakness in underlying sales resulted from lower retail inventory levels and lower volume/mix. Well, AJ exit and underlying sales decline was a major drag for the Specialty Foods segment in particular, as sales here tumbled almost 10% in the fourth quarter of 2017. Underlying sales were majorly hurt by the lower volume/mix stemming from the company’s previously announced exit from its gardein private label business. Markedly, analysts polled by Zacks expect net sales from Specialty Foods to fall 9.1% to $80 million in the first quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales of Birds Eye Frozen (or Frozen) and Duncan Hines Grocery (or Grocery) segments are pegged at $319 million and $260 million, respectively, in comparison with $321 million and $259 million. The consensus mark for sales at Boulder Brands, which is likely to be hurt by shut down of Boulder UK operations, stands at $103 million.Though net sales in the first quarter of 2018 is expected to gain from early Easter, overall top line looks somewhat pressurized from the aforementioned hurdles. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales currently stands at $763 million, reflecting a decline from $766 million reported in the year-ago period.Cost-Savings Efforts vs. Input Cost InflationPinnacle Foods has been battling elevated costs owing to increased packaging and logistics costs. This, along with unfavorable impacts of product mix, increased manufacturing investments and discrete costs arising from the AJ exit remained a drag on gross margin in the last reported quarter. Also, management had earlier projected input cost inflation for 2018 in the range of 3.8-4.2%, with greater inflationary pressure in the first half of the year. This raises concerns over Pinnacle Foods’ upcoming earnings. Nevertheless, we commend the company’s solid productivity initiatives aimed at generating savings and improving gross margin. To this end, the company has an operational excellence program in place designed to generate annual productivity savings across the supply chain. On account of such efforts combined with acquisition synergies and benefits from the network optimization program, the company expects productivity for 2018 in the range of 4-4.5% of cost of products sold. Pinnacle Foods is also pursuing other initiatives to boost gross margin, including improving its product mix through product innovation and low-margin SKU rationalization, increasing the effectiveness of trade promotional spending and realizing synergies from acquisitions. It looks like these dedicated endeavors will help the company tide over all aforementioned hurdles and deliver bottom-line growth.The consensus estimate for first-quarter earnings is pegged at 56 cents, which marks an improvement of 12% from 50 cents recorded in the year-ago period. However, this estimate has dropped by a notch over the past 30 days.What the Zacks Model UnveilsFurther, our proven model doesn’t show that Pinnacle Foods is likely to beat bottom-line estimates this quarter.  For this to happen, a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold).

171,UAA,"Welcome to the sixth episode of Full-Court Finance, a podcast from Zacks Investment Research focused on the intersection of sports, business, and the stock market. On this week’s episode, we take an in-depth look at Under Armour’s (UAA  -  Free Report) climb from startup to multibillion-dollar sports apparel powerhouse, and why its fortunes changed so quickly.Shares of Under Armour have fallen off a cliff in 2017, and Kevin Plank’s company recently posted its first quarterly sales decline since going public more than a decade ago.The reasons behind Under Armour’s third-quarter slump range from shifting domestic shopping habits, to declining sales at sports retailers such as Foot Locker (FL  -  Free Report) and Dick’s Sporting Goods (DKS  -  Free Report), as well as consumers’ newfound love for athleisure.On top of a need to bolster direct-to-consumer sales and add more non-competitive apparel options, it seems that having stars such as Tom Brady and Steph Curry on its roster, and sponsoring college powerhouses like UCLA and Notre Dame, has not been enough to propel Under Armour to the heights many predicted.Under Armour also faces increased competition from Adidas (ADDYY  -  Free Report) in North America, while the company still struggles to compete with Nike (NKE  -  Free Report) in nearly every business segment.However, the company’s recent downturn has forced Under Armour to make some changes—that investors should take note of—in order to get back on track.Make sure you listen to the entire episode of Full-Court Finance if you want to find out more about Under Armour’s recent woes and what the sports apparel company might do to turn things around going forward.If you have any questions about this episode of Full-Court Finance please feel free to shoot us an email over at podcast@zacks.com.

172,UAA,"Benchmarks ended in the red on Monday following reports from Bloomberg that the House was considering a ‘gradual phasing-in’ of corporate tax rates. This hurt investor sentiment and caused broad based losses for the markets. Market watchers also awaited the announcement of the next Fed Chief, whose name President Trump is expected to reveal on Thursday. Meanwhile, markets also suffered after Paul Manafort was convicted in the Russian meddling case.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) closed at 23,348.74, losing 0.4%. The S&P 500 Index (INX) decreased 0.3% to close at 2,572.83. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite Index (IXIC) closed at 6,701.26, decreasing 0.03%. Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 1,469 to 1,308. On the Nasdaq, decliners outnumbered advancers by 1,625 to 1,049. The CBOE VIX increased 4.6% to close at 10.25.Benchmarks Post LossesThe Dow declined 85.5 points to end the session with losses. The blue-chip index was weighed down by a decline in the shares of Merck & Co. (MRK  -  Free Report) and Verizon Communications (VZ  -  Free Report), shares of which declined 6.1% and 2.1%, respectively. Merck suffered its biggest two-day decline following reports that it had withdrawn its application seeking approval for the usage of its cancer immunotherapy drug in Europe.Of the 11 major sectors of the S&P 500, seven ended in the red, with healthcare stocks leading the decliners. The Health Care Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLV) dipped 1.1% on Monday, posting its worst one-day dip since Aug 17. Moreover, a decline in the shares of Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD  -  Free Report) and General Motors (GM  -  Free Report) led the S&P 500 lower.While, shares of AMD declined after some analysts from Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report) commented that demand for cryptocurrency mining chips will be reduced almost 50%, shares of GM plunged after analysts from Goldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report) downgraded the stock to sell.House Proposes ‘Gradual Phase-in’ of Corporate TaxesReports from Bloomberg surfaced on Monday that legislators from the House  who are involved in the formulation of the new tax code were considering a possible ‘phasing-in’ of the corporate tax-rate cut. This would effectively reduce the current rate of corporate tax — at 35% — to 20% by 2022. However, House Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady commented that the procedure is still under review and there has not been any formal decision on it.The guidelines of the proposal state that tax rates would be slashed by three percentage points each year, beginning in 2018. The economists have clearly stated that if such a framework is adopted it would not only become less effective but would also delay any economic effects that President Trump and his aides aim to achieve. However, White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, in a press meeting, commented that Trump wants to immediately slash the tax rates.Such news led to losses for the Russell 2000 index which declined 1.2% to post its worst single-day decline since Aug 17.Investor sentiment was also hurt after Trump’s former campaign manager Paul Manafort was charged with conspiracy against the United States for an alleged Russian meddling in 2016 Presidential elections. Meanwhile, investors also eagerly wait to know as to whom Trump would choose as the next Fed Chief. Trump is expected to announce his decision on Thursday.Economic DataOn the economic data front, personal income for the month of September increased 0.4%, up from 0.2% in August. The consensus estimate for the period was also 0.4%. On the other hand, the consumer spending surged 1%, more than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 0.8%. This marks its highest level in almost 8 years. Such a rally can be attributed to the fact that the residents of hurricane ravaged Texas and Florida replaced their flood-damaged automobiles. Economists believe that this would have only a short term effect on consumer spending. Meanwhile, the Core PCE inflation for September increased 0.1%, in line with the consensus estimate.Stocks That Made HeadlinesUnder Armour Q3 Earnings Top, Stock Tanks on View CutUnder Armour, Inc. (UAA  -  Free Report) reported mixed quarterly numbers in third-quarter 2017, wherein earnings came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate but revenues lagged the same.

(NKE  -  Free Report) in the sports apparel business, is keen on expanding footprint and enhancing brand recognition to get an edge. Further, the deal with rising athletes provides it the suitable platform to showcase its brands.Quarterly Results in DetailApparel sales declined 8% to $939.4 million, while Footwear net revenues increased 2.2% to $285.1 million during the quarter. Net revenues in the Accessories category inched up 1.4% to $123.5 million, while Licensing revenues rose 16.4% year over year to $34.3 million. Moreover, the company’s Connected Fitness segment reported year-over-year increase of 15.9% to $23.4 million.North America net revenues dropped 12.1% to $1,077.1 million, while net revenue from EMEA, Asia-pacific and Latin America jumped 21.7%, 51.9% and 32.8% to $127.9 million, $130.3 million and $46.9 million, respectively.Moreover, adjusted gross margin contracted 130 basis points to 46.2% owing to aggressive inventory management and regional mix.Under Armour, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Under Armour, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Under Armour, Inc. QuoteOther Financial DetailsUnder Armour ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $258 million, up 43.4% from the prior-year period, while total long-term debt was $771.4 million compared with $796.8 million in the prior-year period. Shareholders' equity at the end of the quarter was $2,100.7 million.2017 GuidanceManagement trimmed 2017 revenues guidance. The company now expects net revenues for 2017 to rise by low-single digit, down from the earlier estimate of increase in the range of 9-11% over the 2016 level primarily due to weak demand in North America and operational difficulties owing to execution of enterprise resource planning system.The company anticipates adjusted gross margin to decline by minimum of 190 basis points, in comparison with 46.4% reported in 2016. This can be attributed to restructuring plan, its efforts toward managing inventory, higher promotional cost and regional mix.Adjusted operating income is expected to be nearly $140-$150 million, sharp down from the prior estimate of $280-$300 million. The company projects interest expense of about $35 million and effective tax rate of 23% (excluding the impact of restructuring plan). The company anticipates adjusted earnings per share in the range of 18-20 cents, compared with earlier estimate of 37-40 cents. The Zacks Consensus estimate for 2017 is currently pegged at 37 cents, which could witness downward revisions in the coming days.Zacks Rank & Stock to ConsiderUnder Armour currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

174,UAA,"PVH Corp. (PVH  -  Free Report) recently launched an integrated e-commerce site for its Heritage Brands, which allows cross-brand shopping. The sites launched include IZOD.com, VanHeusen.com and styleBureau.com, thus permitting customers to shop from the IZOD and Van Heusen brands via these sites in a single shopping platform. This website is built in collaboration with Firstborn, the design company.The launch of this website is expected to improve customers’ shopping experience through the availability of various choices, flexibility and convenience. Notably, StyleBureau e-shop will help customers to buy men’s clothing and accessories across the company’s IZOD, Van Heusen and EAGLE brands. The e-shop will also cover a wide range of the company’s offerings besides shirts and ties under the Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger brands. Additionally, it features a ‘tie match’ device that will digitally connect the site’s more than 200 neckties as well as above 100 dress shirt styles.We note that PVH Corp.’s Heritage Brands has been witnessing sluggish growth compared with its premium Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger brands. In fact, the company continues to benefit from the Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger brands’ solid momentum, particularly in the international regions. These have been significantly contributing to the company’s financial performance.In first-quarter fiscal 2018, revenues at Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger improved 18% and 21% each, whereas Heritage Brands segment’s revenues grew 5% year over year. For fiscal 2018, brand-wise, revenues are expected to increase roughly 8% (or 7% on a currency-neutral basis) at Calvin Klein and 7% (or 6% on a currency-neutral basis) at Tommy Hilfiger. However, management anticipates revenues from its Heritage Brands to be flat year over year.We believe that the launch of this new website for Heritage Brands will surely drive the segment’s revenues, while boosting the company’s overall profitability. This multi-platform online site is likely to enhance customers’ shopping experience and in turn generate higher sales.A glance at this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s share price shows that it has gained 7.6% year to date.

176,UAA,"The 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia is nearing its climax, with the final set to kick off this Sunday on Fox (FOXA  -  Free Report). And although the final matchup isn’t set and the victorious nation has not hoisted the trophy, Nike (NKE  -  Free Report) already beat its rival Adidas (ADDYY  -  Free Report) at the World Cup.When the tournament began on June 14, Adidas held the early lead over Nike. Not only is the German sportswear giant one of just seven official FIFA partners along with Coca-Cola (KO  -  Free Report), Visa (V  -  Free Report), Hyundai/ Kia, Chinese conglomerate Wanda, Russian giant Gazprom, and Qatar Airways, the company also edged out Nike in terms of total team sponsorships.JerseysAdidas has been a FIFA partner since 1970, and will be the official ball of the world’s biggest sporting even until at least 2030. The company also sponsored 12 of the 32 teams at this year’s tournament, including three favorites Germany, Spain, and Argentina. But, Germany didn’t make it out of the group stage and Spain and Argentina were eliminated in the round of 16.Oregon-based Nike spent heavily to become a soccer powerhouse since the U.S. hosted the World Cup in 1994. Since then, Nike has successfully infiltrated every level and nearly every league in the world. Nike began the 2018 World Cup with 10 teams sporting its iconic swoosh, including Brazil.More importantly, three out of the four teams that made it to the semi-finals of the World Cup were Nike teams. Furthermore, France defeated Belgium, the lone Adidas team, in the first semi-final game Tuesday. Now, even before England play Croatia on Wednesday in the second semi-final, the World Cup winners are guaranteed to be wearing Nike—all of whom are currently on the front page of Nike’s website.This is great exposure for Nike, especially since Adidas pays millions to be an official FIFA partner, which according to The Telegraph costs between $25 million and $50 million annually.Stars Although the three most famous soccer stars on the planet, Cristiano Ronaldo, Lionel Messi, and Neymar, are all out of the World Cup, there are certainly some big names left.Adidas’ only remaining star is France’s Paul Pogba, who sports a Nike kit for France. The third biggest team sponsor, with Under Armour (UAA  -  Free Report) notably left off this list, was Puma. The German sportswear company’s biggest individual star, Antoine Griezmann also happens to play for France (also listen to: A Sportswear Industry Overview Amid Puma's Basketball Push).Meanwhile, two of Nike’s rising soccer stars are England’s Harry Kane and Kylian Mbappe of France, both also play for Nike-sponsored club teams. Nike tweeted from its main Twitter (TWTR  -  Free Report) account for the first time in a month to congratulate Mbappe on Tuesday.Nike noted that Kane’s Tottenham and the World Cup were two of the big places the company spent money. “Fourth quarter demand creation increased 25% primarily driven by investments in new sports marketing assets such as Chelsea, Tottenham and the NBA, brand marketing around key global sporting events such as the NBA Finals and the World Cup,” CFO Andy Campion said on Nike’s recent quarterly earnings call.Bottom LineSome people might say that sports sponsorships don’t matter, and maybe they are less quantifiable to Budweiser (BUD  -  Free Report) or McDonald’s (MCD  -  Free Report), which are official 2018 World Cup sponsors. But for sportswear companies such as Nike, they are important, especially since the company is actively expanding its reach in the sport. Investors should also note that Nike’s overall soccer revenues climbed 8% to $2.15 billion during its recently completed fiscal year, trailing only sportswear and basketball in terms of growth.The World Cup also offers the chance to reach billions of people around the world, as well as across social media channels such as Instagram (FB  -  Free Report) and YouTube (GOOGL  -  Free Report) in highlights that will live for years to come. The 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil reached 3.2 billion people total, with one billion reportedly tuned into the final. And while Americans might not love the sport, 60% of Nike’s revenues come from outside of its domestic market.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

177,UAA,"Shares of Under Armour (UAA  -  Free Report) skyrocketed on Tuesday morning after the company reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter revenues, bouncing back from its abysmal Q3. Now, as investors begin to assess the sports apparel company’s prospects for a continued recovery, let’s take a look at how UAA stacks up against one of its biggest industry rivals, Nike (NKE  -  Free Report).Under Armour reported its Q4 and 2017 results before the opening bell today. Nike, which is on a somewhat-odd fiscal calendar, reported its second-quarter 2018 results on Dec. 21, 2017. Therefore, Nike’s previous quarter does not take into account the full holiday shopping period. On top of that, as most investors know, Nike is a much older and more established brand, while Under Armour is an upstart by comparison.But investors can still easily compare these two sports apparel firms by looking at some key fundamentals.Earnings SurpriseUnder Armour reported a fourth-quarter net loss of $87.9 million, based in part on a one-time impact from the new tax law, along with a $36 million loss attributable to its restructuring plan. On an adjusted basis, the company posted break-even earnings, falling just short of our Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.01 per share.Nike posted quarterly earnings of $0.46 per share, which topped our expectations by nearly 18% but marked an 8% year-over-year downturn. The sportswear giant attributed this drop to a decline in gross margin as well as higher selling and administrative expenses.Revenues Under Armour’s quarterly revenues climbed 4.6% from the year-ago period. UAA posted Q4 sales of $1.37 billion, which also topped our $1.31 billion consensus estimate.The company’s direct-to-consumer sales popped 11% to $575 million and accounted for 42% of global revenue in the quarter. This is an encouraging sign for Under Armour, which had relied heavily on wholesale revenue amid a downturn from Dick’s Sporting Goods (DKS) and traditional retail as a whole.Footwear sales jumped 9.5% to $246.2 million, which is another hopeful sign for the recently struggling firm as this sector is where it will need to grow in order to compete with Nike and rival Adidas (ADDYY  -  Free Report) long-term. However, apparel still accounted for nearly 70% of total quarterly sales.Nike’s sales gained 5% year-over-year to hit $8.55 billion in its most recent quarter. Footwear, which is Nike’s dominant category, accounted for roughly 60% of total sales.Looking AheadUnder Armour expects its 2018 sales will jump by a low single-digit figure. Our current estimates are calling for UAA revenues to hit $5.15 billion, which would mark 4.7% year-over-year growth. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate projects similar 4.7% earnings growth.The company also announced a new 2018 restructuring plan that is expected to cost between $110 million and $130 million. Under Armour noted that it hopes this plan will begin to save the company at least $75 million per year starting in 2019.Nike is projected to see its current-quarter sales climb 4.39% to reach $8.80 billion, based on our current estimates. Nike’s full-year sales are also projected to gain 4.09% year-over-year to hit $35.76 billion. However, its quarterly earnings are expected to fall by over 20% to $0.54 per share, while its full-year EPS is projected to sink nearly 10%.The Winner Is… Both companies are spending more money as they try to shift more of their business online. Nike is bigger and more established around the world and in vital, valuable categories such as athleisure and footwear. Under Armour has struggled more recently, but the company has a plan to turn things around and just showed that it might be on track to do just that.Both Nike and Under Armour are currently Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stocks. Outlook here is mixed, but investors should be far from giving up on either of these companies.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion.

178,UAA,"V.F. Corporation (VFC  -  Free Report) is slated to release results for the transitional period ending Mar 31, 2018, on May 3, before the market opens. As previously announced, the company decided to change its fiscal year-end to the Saturday closest to Mar 31 from the current Saturday closest to Dec 31. This change was effective from Mar 31, 2018.In the last reported quarter, the designer, manufacturer and marketer of branded apparel and related products delivered a negative earnings surprise of 0.98%. However, the company recorded an average positive surprise of 3.1% in the last four quarters.What to Expect?The question lingering on investors’ minds is whether V.F. Corp. will be able to deliver positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is 65 cents per share, reflecting a year-over-year decline of 18.2%. We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate has been stable ahead of the earnings release. Analysts polled by Zacks anticipate revenues of $2.9 billion, up 12.8% from the year-ago quarter.V.F. Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise V.F. Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | V.F. Corporation QuoteMoreover, we note that the stock has outperformed the industry in the past year, where its shares have increased 52.6% while the industry grew 34.7%.Factors at PlayV.F. Corp. is gaining from its progress on the 2021 growth strategy, which focuses on responding to the changing marketplace while targeting shareholder returns. The company’s focus on this plan is evident from the growth in direct-to-consumer and digital businesses as well as the international segment, which are among the key aspects of the 2021 plan.Additionally, the company is gaining from strength in the international and direct-to-customer platforms, Outdoor & Action Sports coalition and workwear businesses. Moreover, contributions from the recently-concluded Williamson-Dickie buyout are aiding results. The company’s shareholder-friendly moves also bode well.V.F. Corp. provided an encouraging view for the transition period. It expects revenues of nearly $2.9 billion, an increase of 16%. This includes a $200-million contribution from the Williamson-Dickie acquisition. Excluding the acquisition, revenues are likely to increase at a high-single-digit rate. The company envisions adjusted earnings per share for the transitional period to be around 65 cents, marking 27% growth, including a contribution of 2 cents from the aforementioned acquisition. Excluding effects of this acquisition, adjusted earnings per share are estimated to increase more than 20%.However, currency woes, which impacted gross and operating margins in the fourth quarter of 2017, continued to be a hurdle. Further, the company is being troubled by a difficult global economic environment for over a year now.What the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model shows that V.F. Corp. is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.The company’s Earnings ESP of +8.49% and Zacks Rank #3 make us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.

The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because Under Armour is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for UAA in this report.Analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for UAA, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +9.57% heading into earnings season.Under Armour, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Under Armour, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Under Armour, Inc.

180,UAA,"Under Armour, Inc. (UAA  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results on May 1, before the opening bell.The question lingering in investors’ minds is whether this marketer and distributor of apparel, footwear and accessories will be able to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.What to Expect?The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter is pegged at a loss of 5 cents, wider than the loss of a penny reported a year ago. Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $1.12 billion, almost flat with the year-ago quarter figure.Under Armour, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Under Armour, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Under Armour, Inc. QuoteFactors at PlayFor the first quarter, management expects revenues to decline or remain flat in comparison to the year-ago quarter. Further, the company envisions loss per share in the range 6-7 cents on the back of adjusted operating loss of nearly $15 million.We believe that the prolonged weakness in the North American business is likely to tarnish first-quarter results. The company has been reporting sluggish sales from the region since fourth-quarter 2016. In fourth-quarter 2017, sales in North America declined 4.5%. The dismal show can be attributed to bankruptcies, store closures, decreased productivity and demand along with shift in fashion preference.Additionally, gross margin has been consistently shrinking in the past few quarters. In fourth-quarter 2017, the metric contracted 140 basis points (bps) to 45% following a decline of 130, 190 and 70 bps in the third, second and first quarter, respectively. Management expectsgross margin to remain flat in the first quarter of 2018.Further, Under Armour has been struggling to keep interest expenses in check. In fourth-quarter 2017, the company’s interest and other expenses rose to nearly $12 million in comparison with $10 million in the prior-year quarter. Further, it anticipates interest and other expenses to rise around $45 million in 2018 from $38.2 million last year.Nevertheless, Under Armour’s sustained focus on brand development, restructuring plans, expansion of direct-to-consumer and technology-based fitness businesses seem favorable. The company’s continuous efforts to innovate are also full of promise.What Does the Zacks Model Say?Our proven model does not conclusively show an earnings beat for Under Armour this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) and a positive Earnings ESP for this to happen.Under Armour has an Earnings ESP of +7.22%.  You may uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.However, the company has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

181,UAA,"Welcome to the latest episode of the Full-Court Finance podcast from Zacks Investment Research. On this episode, Content Writer Ben Rains discusses Nike (NKE  -  Free Report) and tells investors what to expect from the sportswear giant's upcoming fourth quarter financial results, which are due out Thursday. Rains then dives into everything investors need to know about Puma SE PUM.DE after the German sportswear company decided to jump back into basketball for the first time in 20 years.Nike is coming off a relatively rough quarter, based on its own high standards, with many investors nervous about the company’s sliding North American sales. Many, including Nike executives, have pointed to the shifting retail landscape and increased competition from the likes of Lululemon (LULU  -  Free Report) and rival Adidas (ADDYY  -  Free Report), as major reasons for this recent downturn.With that said, Nike now thinks it will be able to successfully navigate its domestic setbacks, while it continues to grow internationally. The company is expected to see its Q4 revenues climb by 8.2% to hit $9.39 billion, based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimates. Meanwhile, its quarterly earnings are projected to pop by 6.67% to reach $0.64 per share. But investors should pay close attention to Nike’s North American sales figures and watch out for e-commerce and digital sales, which have become Nike’s focus in a retail age that Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) and other online sellers helped transform.Moving on, Puma decided to make a performance-based push in the U.S. market, starting with basketball. The company announced that it signed four top NBA prospects last week—two of whom ended up being drafted #1 and #2 overall. Puma also stuck to its plan of adding to its roster of music and entertainment talent.The company announced that it signed Jay-Z as a creative consultant for its new basketball division. The rapper and entertainment mogul joins a list of Puma partners that include Rihanna, Selena Gomez, Big Sean, and more—Puma’s non-sports push mirrors fellow German giant Adidas’ push into non-performance sportswear, athleisure, and streetwear with the help of Kanye West and others.Puma has somewhat quietly amassed a strong roster of stars who have an outsized influence on social media channels, such as Instagram (FB  -  Free Report) and Twitter (TWTR  -  Free Report)—which are hugely important in the online shopping age. Now that the company has jumped back into basketball, Nike and Adidas might have to try a little harder to stay on top. Meanwhile, Puma’s move puts even more pressure on Under Armour (UAA  -  Free Report).As a reminder, if you feel that we missed something, or if you have any topic suggestions, shoot us an email at podcast@zacks.com.

183,UAA,"Investors in Under Armour, Inc. (UAA  -  Free Report) need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Nov 3, 2017 $15.50 Put had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options todayWhat is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Under Armour shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Under Armour is a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) in the Textile - Apparel industry that ranks in the Top 19% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, one analyst has increased the earnings estimates for the current quarter, while 14 analysts have dropped their estimates. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from 18 cents per share to 20 cents in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Under Armour right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Often times, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Each week, our very own Dave Bartosiak gives his top options trades.

184,UAA,"Under Armour, Inc. (UAA  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 31, before the opening bell.The question lingering in investors’ minds is whether this marketer and distributor of apparel, footwear and accessories will be able to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the to-be-reported quarter. In the trailing four quarters, the company’s earnings have outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate with an average of 33.3%. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.What to Expect?The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter is pegged at 19 cents down from 29 cents reported in the year-ago period. Notably, the estimates have witnessed downward revisions in the last 30 days. Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $1,490 million for the said quarter, up about 1.2% from the year-ago quarter.Factors at PlayWe believe the third-quarter results are likely to be impacted by moderation in North American business. Further, Under Armour has been grappling with higher interest expense as a result of increased debt level. In second-quarter 2017, the company’s interest expenses increased to nearly $8 million in comparison with $6 million in the prior-year quarter. Further, it anticipates interest expenses to rise to roughly $40 million in 2017 from $26.4 million in 2016.Gross margin, which has been witnessing a sharp decline over the past few quarters, is anticipated to decline by a minimum of 120 basis points in comparison with 46.4% reported in 2016. This can be attributed to foreign currency headwinds, restructuring plan and its efforts toward managing inventory. The decline is likely to persist in the third quarter too.These factors have been well reflected in the company’s stock price performance. Evidently, Under Armour’s shares have plunged over 42% year to date against the industry’s gain of 2.4%.However, Under Armour’s sustained focus on brand development, expansion of direct-to-consumer and technology-based fitness businesses look encouraging.Under Armour, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Under Armour, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Under Armour, Inc. QuoteWhat Does the Zacks Model Unveil?Our proven model does not conclusively show earnings beat for Under Armour this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) and a positive Earnings ESP for this to happen. You may uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Under Armour has an Earnings ESP of +2.13%. However, the company carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks with Favorable CombinationHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Conn's, Inc. (CONN  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +50.00% and a Zacks Rank #1. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Ralph Lauren Corporation (RL  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +2.63% and a Zacks Rank #2.Big Lots, Inc. (BIG  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of + 15.39% and a Zacks Rank #2.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +18.8% from 2016 - Q1 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +157.0%, +128.0%, +97.8%, +94.7%, and +90.2% respectively.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - Q1 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 11X over. Maybe even more remarkable is the fact that we're willing to share their latest stocks with you without cost or obligation.See Them Free>>

185,UAA,"Nike (NKE  -  Free Report) is currently playing a leading role on the global stage at the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia. The sportswear company is also about a week away from reporting its quarterly financial results. So let’s evaluate Nike stock to show investors why they might want to buy NKE at the moment.Sports Overview Nike has grown into the largest sports apparel company in the world by cultivating its brand through partnerships with key athletes, in key sports in the U.S. and around the world. Today, maybe more than ever before, Nike’s clothing and footwear is also worn far away from athletic competitions as the industry trends toward athleisure, which the likes of Lululemon (LULU  -  Free Report) and rival Adidas (ADDYY  -  Free Report) have capitalized on as well.Meanwhile, Nike’s presence in soccer, the world’s most popular sport, is as big as ever. Nike sponsors 10 teams at this year’s World Cup, with German giant Adidas claiming 12. Meanwhile, one-time heir apparent Under Armour (UAA  -  Free Report) is nowhere to be found on soccer’s biggest stage—or in the sport in general. Nike is also the official jersey sponsor of America’s most popular sports, the NFL and the NBA, with reports it will soon take over MLB as well.Nike also happens to sponsor seven of the eight most famous athletes on the planet, according to ESPN’s (DIS  -  Free Report) recently published World Fame 100 list. This list includes international soccer icons, Cristiano Ronaldo and Neymar—who both have a massive impact on Instagram (FB  -  Free Report) and Twitter (TWTR  -  Free Report)—as well as LeBron James and Kevin Durant.The company’s global reach was demonstrated through its most recent quarterly results in which Nike reported big sales jumps outside of the U.S. Nike’s Greater China revenues climbed 24% to $1.34 billion, while sales in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa surged 19% to hit $2.29 billion.Price Movement Many of the recent narratives are that Adidas has caught up to Nike through a massive North American expansion, driven by key partnerships in both sports and entertainment. There is some truth to this, as Adidas has been able to grow in the U.S., but let’s take a look at Nike’s recent price movement to see what’s really going on.Shares of Nike have climbed 143% over the last five years, which outpaces Adidas' roughly 111% surge and crushes the S&P 500’s 79%. This picture does change dramatically when assessing the last three years. Nike stock has popped just over 38%, while ADDYY has skyrocketed 174%. Yet, as investors will see, NKE has outperformed Adidas stock over the last year. Nike stock has also climbed higher since the start of the year and has jumped over 10% during the past three months, with Adidas stock down 8%.Valuation The company’s recent performance has caused Nike’s valuation picture to look a bit stretched at the moment. Coming into Tuesday, Nike stock was trading at 28.3X forward 12-month Zacks Consensus EPS estimates, which marks a significant premium compared to Adidas’s 21.9X as well as its industry’s 21.6X——which includes the likes of Ralph Lauren (RL  -  Free Report), Michael Kors (KORS  -  Free Report), Columbia Sportswear (COLM  -  Free Report), and more. Over the last year, Nike has traded as high as 28.5X and as low as 20.7X, with a one-year median of 25.5X. Clearly, Nike is resting just below its year-long high. But it is also worth noting that Nike has traded at a premium compared to its industry over the last five years, which means investors have been willing to pay more for a company they believe offers more value.  Growth Outlook Nike is set to report its fiscal fourth-quarter financial results after market close on Thursday, June 28, which means investors will want to understand what to expect from the sportswear company.Our current Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for Nike’s fiscal Q4 revenues to climb by 8.24% to $9.39 billion. Meanwhile, Nike’s quarterly earnings are projected to pop by 6.67% to $0.64 per share.Investors should also note that the company’s earnings picture is being adversely impacted by its shift toward more direct-to-consumer and e-commerce focused sales in a retail environment obsessed with Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report). These strategic initiatives should end up paying off in the not so distant future, and should also lead to higher margins.Nike is also currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and sports an “A” grade for Growth in our Style Scores system. And let’s not forget that the company is a dividend payer, with a yield of 1.06%.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021. Early investors stand to make a killing, but you have to be ready to act and know just where to look.See the pot trades we're targeting>>

186,UAA,"John Wiley & Sons Inc. (JW.A  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 results before the opening bell on Jun 12. In the preceding quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 3.6%. Notably, it has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, the average beat being 15.8%.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-quarter earnings is pegged at 81 cents, a penny down from the year-ago figure. Notably, the consensus estimate has been stable in the past 30 days. Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $451.7 million, which is almost in line with $452.2 million reported a year ago.Factors Influencing the ResultsJohn Wiley & Sons is on track to provide better digital products and services to professionals, researchers and educators worldwide. The company is also undertaking plans to realign cost structure; reinvest in particular areas with growth potential along with efficiently allocating resources. To acquire a greater market share, John Wiley & Sons has taken up inorganic expansion in a big way. Over the years, the company has acquired several publishing and distribution companies along with various online service providers.John Wiley & Sons, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  John Wiley & Sons, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | John Wiley & Sons, Inc. QuoteHowever, the company continues to face weak demand for printed books due to the shift from print to digital and increased share of rentals. In fact, John Wiley & Sons expects the overall business to be steady but softness in print book markets is likely to persist.We note that management had earlier reaffirmed a not-so-impressive guidance for fiscal 2018. Both revenues and adjusted operating income (at constant currency) are expected to be nearly flat year over year. Adjusted earnings (at constant currency) are likely to decline in low-single digits.Zacks Model Shows Earnings Beat UnlikelyOur proven model does not conclusively show that John Wiley & Sons is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen.John Wiley & Sons has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% and a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Stocks With Favorable ConditionHere are some companies that you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat.Costco Wholesale Corporation (COST  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.10% and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

187,UAA,"Welcome to the third episode of Full-Court Finance, the new podcast from Zacks Investment Research focused on the intersection of sports, business, and the stock market. This week, we tackle the ongoing FBI investigation into the world of big-time college basketball and the role sportswear companies such as Adidas (ADDYY  -  Free Report) and Nike (NKE  -  Free Report) play.Recently, the FBI and the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York helped expose the underbelly of college basketball, illuminating a world of bribes and massive payments involving players, families, financial advisors, coaches, and sportswear powers.Schools such as Arizona, Louisville, and USC were caught up in the investigation, while an Adidas executive was implicated for paying a high school player’s family $100,000 to attend a university that the German sportswear company sponsors.On this episode, we look into how and why sportswear companies—Adidas, Nike, and Under Armour (UAA  -  Free Report)—are so heavily involved in major college sports, specifically basketball. On top of that, we delve into what implications this serious investigation will have on these companies and try to understand if they will continue to invest in college sports going forward.With long-term agreements like UCLA’s 15-year, $280 million deal with Under Armour changing the landscape of collegiate athletics, this podcast is set to help investors understand what they need to know about sportswear companies and their involvement in “amateur” sports.If you have any questions about the third episode of Full-Court Finance please feel free to shoot us an email over at podcast@zacks.com.

188,UAA,"Shares of Nike (NKE  -  Free Report) dipped marginally on Wednesday ahead of the company’s upcoming Q3 earnings report. The sportswear giant’s stock is still up 6.8% since the start of the year, but recent executive-level turmoil could spell trouble.Nike Brand President Trevor Edwards and VP Jayme Martin both resigned last week amid a code of conduct-related scandal. At this point, there are few details about what specifically happened, but investors should note that CEO Mark Park is now committed to staying in his role beyond 2020.Aside from the possibility of a scandal and some reorganization at the executive level, Nike also faces real business challenges. Nike posted earnings of $0.46 per share last quarter, which topped our expectations by nearly 18% but marked an 8% downturn from the year-ago period. The sportswear company attributed this drop to a decline in gross margin as well as higher selling and administrative expenses.Nike also currently faces greater domestic competition from the likes of Adidas (ADDYY  -  Free Report) and Under Armour (UAA  -  Free Report), along with new shopping habits that forced a slow transition away from brick-and-mortar retailers such as Dick’s Sporting Goods (DKS  -  Free Report).Nevertheless, Nike’s overall sales climbed 5% last quarter, driven by international expansion. But as most investors know, past performance is no indication of future success.Latest OutlookFor the soon-to-be-reported quarter, our current consensus estimates are calling for Nike to post revenue of $8.83 billion, which would mark a 4.7% climb. Meanwhile, after a downturn in the previous quarter, Nike’s third-quarter earnings are projected to plummet 23.5% to hit $0.52 per share.With that said, the raw top and bottom line projections do not tell the whole story. Investors still need to know a lot more if they are considering buying Nike ahead of Thursday’s earnings release.Earnings ESP WhispersOne thing many investors often consider is if a company is likely to top its earnings estimates—as an earnings beat can sometimes lead to positive stock performance in the immediate aftermath of a report. Luckily for investors, we can turn to our Earnings ESP figures to gain a better understanding of Nike’s chances to surprise.Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst estimates. This is done because, generally speaking, when an analyst posts an estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.A positive Earnings ESP paired with a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better ranking helps us feel confident about the potential for an earnings beat. In fact, our 10-year backtest has revealed that this methodology has accurately produced a positive surprise 70% of the time.Nike is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and sports an Earnings ESP of -1.15%, which means earnings estimates have been lower directly ahead of NKE’s Q3 results. This means that Nike is a stock that could disappoint investors this week.Price Performance and Surprise HistoryWith that said, despite Nike’s negative ESP figure, the company’s history does show that Nike seems like it will do everything in its power to try to meet or top earnings estimates. But do these earnings beats result in at least a short-term boost in stock price? Here’s a look at the trend:NIKE, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise NIKE, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | NIKE, Inc. QuoteAs investors can see, Nike has posted an impressive streak of earnings beats, including an average earnings surprise of 22.48% in the trailing four periods. Nike has also successfully met or surpassed earnings estimates in 20-consecutive quarters. However, a positive earnings surprise has not always resulted in an immediate surge in share prices.More importantly, shareholders should keep an eye on Nike’s sluggishness in North America and growth in key international markets when it reports. Nike is set to report its fiscal third quarter 2018 earnings results after market close on Thursday, March 22.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

189,UAA,"Welcome to the latest episode of the Full-Court Finance podcast from Zacks Investment Research. On this week’s episode, we take a look at the multibillion-dollar business that drives NCAA March Madness after a wild opening weekend for the college basketball tournament.A No. 1 seed lost to a No. 16 seed for the first time ever, big brand name schools busted brackets early, and ratings jumped accordingly. But what might be more fascinating than the craziness on the court is the mind-boggling money that is generated during the event.CBS (CBS  -  Free Report) and Time Warner’s  Turner bet big on the long-term viability of March Madness, committing billions of dollars to broadcast the tournament through 2032. The two media companies broadcast and stream all of the games across an array of networks, and the deal will see them retain the broadcasting rights no matter how fans consume games in the future.On top of these broadcast fees, the NCAA makes millions from tickets and marketing deals. Capital One (COF  -  Free Report), AT&T (T  -  Free Report), and Coca-Cola (KO  -  Free Report) remain the tournament’s biggest sponsors this year. Meanwhile, companies like Pizza Hut (YUM  -  Free Report) and Lowe’s (LOW  -  Free Report) will be ever present over the next few weeks, while Google (GOOGL  -  Free Report) debuted the first advertising campaign for its cloud computing products as part of a new multiyear NCAA partnership.The players themselves will also act as walking, talking, and dunking billboards for Nike (NKE  -  Free Report), Adidas (ADDYY  -  Free Report), and Under Armour (UAA  -  Free Report). And that is just the start of the major money that fuels March Madness.

190,UAA,"NCAA March Madness begins Thursday morning, and when the games tip off it marks the start of one of the richest months in sports. But while people around the U.S. begin to stare at scores, check their brackets, and make initial payments on their office pools, let’s take a look at where the real money is made.TV Money Two years ago, at the end of the 2016 men’s college basketball tournament, CBS (CBS  -  Free Report) and Time Warner’s  Turner extended their already-massive March Madness rights deal. The previous 14-year, $10.8 billion deal was set to end after the 2024 tournament. The new contract tacked on eight years and $8.8 billion, and now runs through 2032.The new deal pays an average of $1.1 billion per season, up from $770 million on the current contract, for the roughly three week basketball extravaganza. This is clearly a lot of money to pay for the rights to broadcast and stream just 63 games—not including the play-in games.Yet both CBS and Tuner understand that this continued investment is a well-calculated risk at a time when advertisers flee linear television in favor of Facebook (FB), Google (GOOGL  -  Free Report), and other online outlets. Their bet is that live sports will remain a viable money-making business for the foreseeable future.The most recent deal also includes language that will see CBS and Turner own the exclusive rights no matter how people actually consume March Madness content in 2030.“Whatever new platforms develop, we have all of those rights,” CBS Sports Chairman Sean McManus told the Wall Street Journal in 2016. “If people are watching on a skinny bundle, a phone or Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) TV, we have the ability to exploit all of those rights going forward.”CBS and Turner share these rights across an array of channels, alternating which network broadcasts the Final Four and championship game. TBS will broadcast the climax of the college basketball season this year, while fans will be able to watch almost all of the games live on streaming services and March Madness Live—though login information is required for TBS, TNT, and truTV games.NCAAThe NCAA pulled in a record $1.06 billion in fiscal 2017, which includes tournament broadcast rights, as well as tickets sales—$129.4 million, including the NIT—and roughly $60 million in marketing rights deals.This money is then used to fund scholarships, stipends, medical insurance, travel, and a slew of other programs for most non-revenue generating sports across the country.Marketing The NCAA Tournament is played at a nearly perfect time in order to generate the most viewership and buzz. The NFL season is over, MLB is just staring to gear up, and the NBA playoffs are still about a month away. Therefore companies pour millions of advertising and marketing dollars into March Madness.Capital One (COF  -  Free Report) is one of the biggest sponsors again this year, with hundreds of commercials scheduled to appear while its name remains splattered all over the official NCAA tournament website—including “The Capital One March Madness Bracket Challenge.”AT&T (T  -  Free Report) and Coca-Cola (KO  -  Free Report) are the two other “presented by” sponsors this year.Sportswear Giants Aside from TV coverage, marketing, and advertising, the players themselves are also walking billboards for three companies.Nike (NKE  -  Free Report), Adidas (ADDYY  -  Free Report), and Under Armour (UAA  -  Free Report) will be on display over the next three weeks on the chests, legs, ankles, and feet of nearly every athlete. These companies often provide schools and teams monetary benefits for winning or making it past a certain round of the tournament.Check back later for a complete breakdown of which sportswear company dominates March Madness and how the other two stack up.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

191,UAA,"A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Under Armour, Inc. (UAA  -  Free Report). Shares have lost about 9.5% in that time frame.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is UAA due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Under Armour Q4 Earnings MissUnder Armour reported mixed quarterly numbers in fourth-quarter 2017 wherein earnings came in below the Zacks Consensus Estimate but revenues surpassed the same. The company reported break-even adjusted earnings, missing the consensus mark of 1 cent.Following robust demand in Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA), Asia-Pacific and Latin America the company’s top line increased 4.6% to $1,365.4 million, beating the consensus estimate of $1,308 million. Currently, the company is keen on expanding footprint and enhancing brand recognition to get an edge. Further, the deal with rising athletes lends Under Armour a suitable platform to showcase its brands.Quarterly Results in DetailApparel sales rose 2.5% to $951.7 million while Footwear net revenues increased 9.5% to $246.2 million in the quarter under review. Net revenues in the Accessories category were up 6.1% to $110.7 million while Licensing revenues rose 10.1% year over year to $32.9 million. Moreover, the company’s Connected Fitness segment reported year-over-year increase of 30.8% to $23.9 million.North America net revenues dropped 4.5% to $1,024.2 million while the same from EMEA, Asia-pacific and Latin America jumped 45.5%, 55.7% and 36% to $135.3 million, $123.9 million and $58 million, respectively.Also, gross margin contracted 140 basis points to 45% due to aggressive inventory management that overshadowed favorable channel mix.Other Financial DetailsUnder Armour ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $312.5 million, up 24.8% from the prior-year period. Total long-term debt was $765 million compared with $790.4 million in the prior-year period. Shareholders' equity at the end of the quarter was $2,018.6 million.2018 GuidanceManagement expects 2018 revenues to increase by low single-digit percentage rate. While revenues from North America are likely to decline by mid-single-digit, international revenues are anticipated to increase above 25%.The company anticipates adjusted gross margin to increase by nearly of 50 basis points to 45.5%. This improvement can be attributed lower promotional activity, product costs, channel mix as well as variation in foreign currency.Adjusted operating income is expected to be nearly $130-$160 million. The company projects interest expenses of about $45 million. Capital expenditures are anticipated to be nearly $225 million compared with $275 million in 2017.The company, which has undertaken restructuring efforts since 2017, projects savings of at least $75 million annually in 2019 and thereafter.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed an upward trend in fresh estimates. There have been two revisions higher for the current quarter compared to one lower.Under Armour, Inc. Price and Consensus  Under Armour, Inc. Price and Consensus | Under Armour, Inc. QuoteVGM ScoresCurrently, UAA has a strong Growth Score of A, though it is lagging a bit on the momentum front with a B. The stock was allocated a grade of C on the value side, putting it in the middle 20% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of B. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.Based on our scores, the stock is primarily suitable for growth investors while also being suitable for those looking for momentum and to a lesser degree value.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending upward for the stock and the magnitude of these revisions looks promising. Notably, UAA has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.

192,UAA,"Nike (NKE  -  Free Report) is in the first year of its eight-year, roughly $1 billion jersey deal with the NBA. So as the NBA Finals begin Thursday night, let’s take a look at Nike stock to see if investors might want to consider buying a piece of the world’s largest sportswear company.Star Power When Nike won the NBA jersey rights a few years back, it was a big deal not only because of how much the company paid but also because Nike’s swoosh would be the first logo ever to appear on NBA game jerseys.Nike’s iconic logo also appears on NFL jerseys, and the company signed a 10-year extension with the NFL in March that will see it remain the official apparel brand through 2028. And now there are even reports that Nike will sign a uniform deal with MLB, starting in 2020, with Under Armour (UAA  -  Free Report) set to back out from its scheduled deal.Nike also happens to sponsor seven of the eight most famous athletes on the planet, according to ESPN’s (DIS  -  Free Report) recently published World Fame 100 list—LeBron James and Kevin Durant are two of these seven athletes.To some, these sponsorships might seem unnecessary, but they provide the exposure that brands like Nike and German rival Adidas (ADDYY  -  Free Report) need. They must have their sportswear connected to the biggest leagues, teams, and athletes in the world.Obviously, there are many other important factors for investors to consider, but it is worth noting just how big Nike’s presence is and how much value the company places on maintaining its relationships with the lifeblood of professional sports.Recent Performance Nike reported revenue of $8.98 billion during its fiscal third quarter, which marked a 7% climb from the year-ago period. Meanwhile, the company’s hugely important North American footwear sales slipped 8% to $2.29 billion. Luckily, much of this downturn can be attributed to overall market conditions in the U.S., and Nike’s presence throughout the rest of the world is bigger than ever. Nike’s Greater China revenues climbed 24% $1.34 billion, while sales in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa surged 19% to $2.29 billion.Price Movement Moving on, Nike stock has performed well recently and over the last decade. Shares of Nike have soared 322% over the last 10 years, outpacing the S&P 500’s 113% climb. Over the last three years, Nike stock is up 40%. Scaling down, even more, shares of Nike have popped 37% during the last year, which tops the S&P 500 and rival Adidas, despite the German company’s wave of North American success. Year to date, Nike Stock is up 14%. Valuation Nike’s recent price movement has helped the stock rest just below its 52-week high of $73.49 per share, which might make some investors nervous. The company’s strong performance has also caused Nike’s valuation to look just a tad bit expensive at the moment. Coming into Thursday, Nike stock was trading at 27.3X forward 12-month Zacks Consensus EPS estimates. Over the last year, Nike has traded as high as 27.6X, as low as 20.6X, with a one-year median of 24.5X.Investors can also see that Nike’s valuation picture has slowly grown worse since November 2016. With that said, investors have clearly seen a reason to pay a premium for Nike stock over this same time period, as the company has consistently traded above its industry’s average—which includes the likes of Ralph Lauren (RL  -  Free Report), Michael Kors (KORS  -  Free Report), Columbia Sportswear (COLM  -  Free Report), and more.Growth Outlook One of the last key factors many investors will want to take a look at is Nike’s growth picture. Our current Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for Nike’s Q4 revenues to climb by 8.4% to $9.40 billion. Meanwhile, Nike’s quarterly earnings are projected to sink by 13.3% to touch $0.52 per share.With that said, investors should not worry too much about Nike’s bottom line at the moment as the company makes a massive shift toward e-commerce and direct-to-consumer selling that is aimed at helping Nike better compete in a retail world that is shifting to Amazon’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) model.Nike is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and sports a “B” grade for Growth in our Style Scores system.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

194,UAA,"Tuesday, February 13, 2018Market futures are in the red in today’s pre-market, keeping form with this new volatility we’re growing to understand as part of our investment environment of the past couple weeks now. The Dow soared another 400+ points in regular trading yesterday, yet remain in the negative year to date because of last week’s shedding of valuation.The Dow, which looks to only be trading in triple-digit swings of late, is expected to open down 150 points as of this minute. Things can certainly swing quickly, as we’ve seen, but without much pressure from outside-the-market events this morning, we see the current trading habitat as more or less finding its own equilibrium. Of course, that might change on a dime, as well.A new budget is being hashed out in Washington DC, which looks to add plenty more deficit spending to the nation’s bottom line, but the market has not directly reacted to this. In fact, it may not — at least until the Fed, under new direction of Jay Powell, decides what to do about the changing economic environment.As far as Q4 earnings are concerned — hey! remember them? — we see two prominent better-than-expected losses from two 21st century companies, Under Armour (UAA  -  Free Report) and Blue Apron (APRN  -  Free Report). Both stocks are up nearly 10% in today’s pre-market.Blue Apron, which had a difficult time finding its way into the publicly traded market last year, is seeing 9% pre-market gains on its lower-than-expected loss of 20 cents per share, better than the -27 cents in the Zacks consensus. With the help of its new CEO, the company also brought in $187.7 million for the quarter, above the $183 million expected. Costs related to building out new fulfillment centers have eaten into company profits, but $248 average revenue per customer and -20% cost of goods sold year over year were factors toward positive sentiment on Wall Street this morning.Under Armour initially blasted up 13% upon the release of its Q4 earnings report, posting -20 cents per share versus -23 cents a year ago. This bottom line result was worse than expected, though revenues of $1.4 billion was higher than the Zacks consensus, and guidance for full-year 2018 looks strong, as well.Mark VickerySenior EditorQuestions or comments about this article and/or its author?

195,UAA,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for Under Armour, Inc. (UAA  -  Free Report). Shares have added about 14.6% in that time frame.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is UAA due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Under Armour (UAA  -  Free Report) Beats on Q1 Earnings, Reiterates '18 ViewUnder Armour reported break-even earnings per share in the first quarter of 2018, which compared favorably with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 5 cents and the year-ago loss of a cent.Following robust demand in Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA), Asia-Pacific and Latin America, the company’s top line increased 5.9% to $1,185.4 million, beating the consensus estimate of $1,122 million.Apparel sales rose 7.1% to $766.3 million, while Footwear net revenues inched up 0.8% to $271.8 million in the quarter under review. Net revenues in the Accessories category were up 3.4% to $92.2 million, while Licensing revenues rose 8.8% year over year to $26.3 million. Moreover, the company’s Connected Fitness segment reported a year-over-year increase of 34.4% to $28.8 million.North America net revenues dropped 0.4% to $867.5 million, while the same from EMEA, Asia-pacific and Latin America jumped 23.4%, 34.6% and 21% to $126.9 million, $115.6 million and $46.5 million, respectively.Also, gross margin contracted 120 basis points (bps) to 44.2% due to aggressive inventory management that offset favorable foreign exchange fluctuation. Adjusted gross margin shrunk 60 bps to 44.8%.Other Financial DetailsUnder Armour ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $283.6 million, up 64.8% from the prior-year quarter. Long-term debt was $758.7 million compared with $784.1 million a year ago. Shareholders' equity at the end of the quarter was $2,017.7 million.2018 GuidanceManagement reaffirmed the full-year 2018 outlook. The company expects 2018 revenues to increase by low single-digit percentage rate. While revenues from North America are likely to decline by mid-single-digit, international revenues are likely to increase more than 25%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $5.11 billion.This company continues to anticipate adjusted gross margin growth of nearly 50 basis points to 45.5%. This improvement can be attributed to lower promotional activity, product costs, channel mix as well as variation in foreign currency.Adjusted operating income is expected around $130-$160 million. The company projects interest expenses of about $45 million. Capital expenditures are anticipated to be nearly $225 million, compared with $275 million in 2017.Management expects adjusted earnings per share in the range of 14-19 cents per share. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 17 cents per share, which is well within the company’s guided range.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates. There have been ten revisions lower for the current quarter. Last month, the consensus estimate has shifted downward by 48.7% due to these changes.Under Armour, Inc. Price and Consensus  Under Armour, Inc. Price and Consensus | Under Armour, Inc. QuoteVGM ScoresCurrently, UAA has a nice Growth Score of B, a grade with the same score on the momentum front. However, the stock was allocated a grade of F on the value side, putting it in the fifth quintile for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of D. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.Zacks' style scores indicate that the company's stock is suitable for growth and momentum investors.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. Interestingly, UAA has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.

196,UAA,"Under Armour, Inc. (UAA  -  Free Report), once considered as the arch rival of NIKE, Inc. (NKE  -  Free Report), has been facing multiple challenges for quite some time now. The company has been grappling with weakness in North America business, decline in gross margin and rising interest expenses. Meanwhile, Under Armour’s sustained focus on brand development, expansion of direct-to-consumer and technology-based fitness business bode well.Given this backdrop, let’s delve deeper to find out the factors likely to have a bearing on the company’s performance.Hurdles to CrossSales decline in North America has been a major concern for investors in the past few quarters. In fact, the company has been reporting sluggish sales from the region since fourth-quarter 2016. In the fourth quarter 2017, sales from North America declined 4.5% and operating income slumped more than 100%. Notably, bankruptcies, store closures, decrease in productivity and demand along with change in fashion preference has been the major causes behind the dismal show.Furthermore, gross margin — a key financial metric for determining a company’s basic financial health — has consistently declined in the past few quarters. In fourth-quarter 2017, the metric contracted 140 basis points to 45%, following a decline of 130, 190 and 70 basis points in the third, second and first quarter, respectively. The downside can be attributed to aggressive inventory management that overshadowed favorable channel mix. However, the company anticipates adjusted gross margin to increase by nearly of 50 basis points to 45.5% in 2018. This improvement is expected to be backed by lower promotional activity, product costs, channel mix and variation in foreign currency.Meanwhile, higher interest expenses have been concerning for the company. In fourth-quarter 2017, the company’s interest and other expenses were up nearly $12 million in comparison with $10 million in the prior-year quarter. For 2018, the company anticipates interest and other expenses to increase roughly $45 million from $38.2 million last year.Hidden CatalystUnder Armour, which shares space with G-III Apparel Group (GIII  -  Free Report), Delta Apparel (DLA  -  Free Report) and Lululemon Athletica (LULU  -  Free Report), continues to seek opportunities for increasing its global footprint and market share. Though the company generates major portion of its revenues from the North America region, it intends to expand business operations to other parts of the world to mitigate the risks stemming from concentration in one geographic region. In the process, over the years the company has opened its factory and brand stores in Canada and China as well as given franchise licenses in many countries. Moreover, Under Armour is expanding its DTC business in the U.K., Germany and the Netherlands. It has also rolled out e-commerce platforms in countries like Mexico, Australia, New Zealand and Chile.The company has undertaken restructuring efforts since 2017 and projects savings of at least $75 million annually in 2019 and thereafter.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce """"the world's first trillionaires,"""" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

197,UAA,"Welcome to the latest episode of the Full-Court Finance podcast from Zacks Investment Research. This week we explore Under Armour’s (UAA  -  Free Report) Q4 results and look to the company’s future, which seems highly uncertain amid stiff competition and shifting sports retail trends.Coming off the company’s dismal third quarter, Under Armour’s North American sales dipped once again during the vital holiday shopping period. The sportswear company also posted a quarterly loss, based largely on impacts from the new Republican tax law as well as its own restructuring plan.Investors were happy to note that Under Armour grew its international sales and its direct-to-consumer revenues, partially offsetting a big shift in U.S. retail patterns that has seen downturns from Dick’s Sporting Goods (DKS  -  Free Report), Foot Locker (FL  -  Free Report) and others.Nevertheless, Under Armour and CEO Kevin Plank face increased competition from Adidas (ADDYY  -  Free Report) both domestically and abroad. Meanwhile, Lululemon Athletica (LULU  -  Free Report) and other smaller North American retailers, as well as footwear firms such as Skechers (SKX  -  Free Report), have also made life harder for a brand that many said looked poised to challenge Nike (NKE  -  Free Report) in the U.S. for years to come. Looking ahead, Under Armour will begin to focus more heavily on non-performance, athleisure apparel and footwear—which is where the industry is currently trending. As it tries to expand its market share in North America and internationally, the company also needs to grow its presence on social media platforms like Twitter (TWTR  -  Free Report), Facebook (FB  -  Free Report), and Instagram as online sales become more vital than ever.Now the question for many investors is simple: can Under Armour claw its way back, or are its days of massive growth simply over?If you have any questions about this episode of Full-Court Finance please feel free to shoot us an email over at podcast@zacks.com.

198,UAA,"Shares of Under Armour (UAA  -  Free Report) surged 3.58% on Wednesday to hit $21.40 per share, continuing the sportswear company’s impressive run. With that said, let’s dive into Under Armour’s recent stock price movement to see just how well its stock has performed.At this point, many investors have likely heard and read about the company’s late fiscal 2017 decline. Under Armour’s sales slipped in the third quarter last year for the first time since it went public, after the company began to suffer from overall North American market pressures and also from its own success. In the fourth quarter, CEO Kevin Plank said that “complexities as a result of rapid growth” forced the company to streamline and simplify its go to market strategies.As part of its revamp, Under Armour adopted a 2018 restructuring plan in which the company expects to spend between $110 million to $130 million. Under Armour spent $45 million on restructuring costs in the first quarter. But investors started to move on from Under Armour stock long before its recent downturn.Under Armour stock hit its all-time high in September 2015. Since then, the stock has sunk 47% over the last three years. However, investors will note in the chart below that UAA stock has soared since it reported its third-quarter financial results on Halloween. It seems investors bought the Under Armour dip at what looks like its bottom—at least for now. Under Armour stock hit its 52-week and five-year low of roughly $11.60 per share in early November. Since then, the company’s stock price is up nearly 78%, which crushes the S&P 500’s 4.2% climb.It is also worth noting that shares of Under Armour have even topped tech giant’s Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) and Micron’s (MU) massive climbs, of 47% and 41%, respectively, since November 1. Under Armour stock looks even better compared to its direct competitors, Nike (NKE  -  Free Report) and Adidas (ADDYY  -  Free Report). The company even quietly outpaced Lululemon’s (LULU  -  Free Report) impressive 72% climb during this time frame. Bottom LineAt the moment it remains unclear if Under Armour will be able to maintain its current run of success or if this momentum will subside as we move farther into the second quarter. One thing to note is that Under Armour’s outsized run has made the stock look very expensive.UAA is currently trading at 84.9X forward 12-month Zacks Consensus EPS estimates, which is just below the all-time high it reached recently. This means that its earnings estimates have failed to climb along with its surging stock price. Investors should also note that Under Armour was trading as low as 29.1X on November 2.  Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

199,UAA,"The NBA Finals begin Thursday night, with two of the league’s biggest stars, LeBron James and Steph Curry, set to face off for the NBA title. But while many will look at how the Cleveland Cavaliers and Golden State Warriors played up to this point, it’s also a great time to check out how some of the NBA’s biggest sponsors performed during the season.Sports Apparel The common thought among many investors is that Curry’s star power hasn’t helped Under Armour UAA stock much over the last year, as it tries to adjust to life as a much bigger company. Curry’s direct impact is debatable, but the company’s stock price has performed rather well since the start of the 2017-18 NBA season in mid-October.Let’s take a look at how it has stacked up against the NBA’s official jersey sponsor and basketball shoe juggernaut, Nike NKE, as well as Adidas ADDYY. Investors will see that despite some of the recent love thrown Adidas’ way, both Nike and Under Armour stock have greatly outperformed the German sports apparel powerhouse since the start of the NBA season. Clearly, there are many other factors impacting these stocks aside from the exposure that the NBA provides, but it is a fun exercise nonetheless.Jersey Sponsors  Nike, which became the official jersey sponsor of the NBA this season, greatly outpaced its two closest rivals. With that said, this season also marked the first time the NBA allowed jersey sponsorship patches. In total, 21 out of the 30 teams played with a patch during the first season, with companies paying an average of $6.5 million per year to place their logo on a team’s jersey—worn by both the players and fans.The inaugural jersey patch season saw some major publicly traded companies join in on the NBA’s growing business. This list includes General Electric (GE  -  Free Report), Disney (DIS  -  Free Report), Harley-Davidson (HOG  -  Free Report), Western Union WU, Fitbit (FIT  -  Free Report), Lending Tree (TREE  -  Free Report), Sun Life (SLF  -  Free Report), Ultimate Software (ULTI  -  Free Report), and Goodyear (GT  -  Free Report).Clearly, some of the bigger names on the list have all gone through a massively disappointing stretch during their first year as official team jersey sponsors. It’s also worth noting that three out of the four conference finals teams that had a sponsor this year—the Warriors and Japanese electronics firm Rakuten RKUNY; the Cavaliers and Goodyear; and the Boston Celtics and GE—all saw their stocks prices fall over 25% since the start of the season.But don’t be surprised if underperforming companies continue their sponsorships as these investments offer a ton of exposure for a relatively small amount of marketing dollars. This becomes even more likely when looking at the NBA’s television ratings, which saw an 8% surge across the league’s four TV-network partners, Disney’s ABC and ESPN, Turner’s  TNT, and NBA TV.TV Partners Investors might remember that the NBA is currently benefiting hugely from its nine-year, $24 billion rights deal with ESPN and Turner that runs through the '24-25 season. This is significant money even for these entertainment giants, which means it’s worth taking a look at how ESPN parent Disney and Turner owner Time Warner have performed throughout this season.Biggest Corporate Sponsors Lastly, it is worth taking a look at some of the NBA’s overall corporate partners, which not only advertise heavily but also sponsor the league. Three of the league’s biggest corporate partners are American Express Company (AXP  -  Free Report), Anheuser-Busch InBev (BUD  -  Free Report), and PepsiCo (PEP  -  Free Report) via Frito-Lay, Mountain Dew, and Gatorade.Obviously, all of the companies touched on throughout this article have much larger priorities beyond their affiliation with the NBA. Therefore, none of this stock price movement is a direct reflection on the NBA’s growing business, which saw its overall sponsor revenue surge 31% to $1.12 billion—placing it not too far behind the NFL.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

200,UAA,"Welcome to Episode #81 of the Value Investor PodcastEvery week, Tracey Ryniec, the editor of Zacks Value Investor portfolio service, shares some of her top value investing tips and stock picks.The recent stock market correction is impacting stocks across the entire gamut of the stock market, from large cap to small caps. That even includes the golden blue-chip type stocks.The reason some stocks are considered blue chips is because they are considered safe, large cap stocks that aren’t supposed to be volatile in a portfolio. They are also usually owned by a large percentage of investors.Some might even consider them boring.But even the blue chips can run into rocky periods and, for some, that’s happening right now.Some blue chips started to tumble in 2016 and 2017 and the recent correction only added to the losses.Is it time to buy them?Definition of a Value TrapRemember, not all stocks that sell off are values. Some companies may have value fundamentals including low P/E, P/B, P/S ratios. Some may even have value PEG ratios, which means a PEG under 1.0.But that’s not enough. A true value stock will also have earnings growth.The value traps will have all the value fundamentals but earnings estimates will be falling or will be negative year-over-year.The key, then, is to look at the full year earnings estimates.Are These 5 Battered Blue Chips Value Stocks or Traps?Tracey took a look at 5 blue chip stocks that have sold off the last few years to see if there could be a buying opportunity there.1.      General Electric (GE  -  Free Report) continues to sink. It recently hit a new multi-year low. The shares are trading with a forward P/E of 15 now. You’d think these were a bargain, right? After all, it IS GE. But is it a true value?2.     Newell Brands (NWL  -  Free Report) is a mess. After two quarters of disappointing sales, and now a management crisis, the shares are down 14% year-to-date. 2018 earnings are expected to be unchanged versus 2017 despite the largest corporate tax cuts in history. But shares are trading at just 9x. Should you be buying Newell right now?3.     Under Armour (UAA  -  Free Report) plunged in 2017 but this year it has recovered and is now up 11% year-to-date. Sounds like things could be turning around. But shares now trade with a forward P/E of 68. Are investors too bullish on this athletic apparel and shoe retailer or is there a true earnings turnaround happening here?4.     Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (CMG  -  Free Report) saw its shares sink over 14% in 2018 after it reported yet another disappointing quarter. Customer traffic has not rebounded and same store sales remain anemic for a chain that was once the darling of the restaurant industry. The appointment of a former Taco Bell executive to be CEO, however, has boosted the shares off the recent lows. Should value investors be buying with a forward P/E of 30?5.     J.C. Penney Company, Inc. (JCP  -  Free Report) was left for dead by investors in 2017. Department stores aren’t going to make it, right? But shares are up 1% year-to-date. With a forward P/E of 20, are earnings finally going in the right direction for this out-of-favor retailer?What else should you know about telling the difference between value stocks and value traps?Tune into this week’s podcast to find out.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion.

201,UAA,"Shares of Dropbox (DBX  -  Free Report) jumped over 5% through midday trading Thursday without much significant news to speak of. So let’s take a look at what might have investors excited about the newly public tech company and see if its stock is worth buying at the moment.Dropbox went public in late March at $21 per share, and saw its stock price skyrocketed more than 35% during its first day of trading as investors jumped into what was, at that point, the biggest tech IPO of 2018—and the first tech unicorn to hit the market since Snap (SNAP  -  Free Report). Since Dropbox’s IPO, streaming music power Spotify (SPOT  -  Free Report) also began trading, somewhat overshadowing the online storage company.Dropbox’s Business San Francisco-based Dropbox, which started as a free service to store and share music, photos, and other large files, now competes directly against some Google (GOOGL  -  Free Report) offerings, as well as Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report), Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report), and others in the storage industry. Today, Dropbox offers an extremely slimmed down, limited storage version for free, along with multiple levels of business offerings that range from “Standard” at $15 per user, per month—starting with 3 users—up to enterprise level offerings. The company currently boasts publicly traded clients including Under Armour (UAA  -  Free Report), Hyatt (H  -  Free Report), and others.Dropbox’s business is relatively simple: it allows users to share and store an unlimited amount of data with users almost anywhere in the world on a pretty easy to use portal via the internet. The company, which calls itself a “collaboration platform,” could easily become even more popular as more people work from home and remotely. The company currently boasts over 500 million registered users in over 180 countries, and reported revenues of $1.1 billion in 2017, which climbed from $844.8 million the year before. Meanwhile, Dropbox’s net loss nearly halved from $210.2 million in 2016.Fundamentals Shares of Dropbox were up roughly 8.7% over the last three months, before Thursday’s climb. And investors should note that its full-year growth projections look rather strong. Our current Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for Dropbox’s full-year revenues to hit $1.35 billion, which would mark a roughly 22% surge from the year-ago period. Moving onto the other end of the income statement, the company is expected to post adjusted quarterly earnings of $0.06 per share, with its full-year EPS figure expected to reach $0.28 per share. These bottom-line estimates are rather impressive for a young tech company, which often post adjusted losses.Dropbox is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and sports an “A” grade for Growth and a “B” for Momentum in our Style Scores system.

203,UAA,"Shares of Nike (NKE  -  Free Report) soared over 12% to hit a new all-time high on Friday morning after the company posted better-than-expected Q4 results Thursday. Yet, more than the top and bottom line beats, investors seem ecstatic that the sportswear giant posted North American revenue growth after nearly a year of declining sales. So, amid this Nike fervor, let’s assess the stock and see if investors might want to consider buying NKE at its new high.Q4 HighlightsNike’s Friday climb comes after the company saw its stock price surge nearly 10% after-hours Thursday. The company posted adjusted earnings of $0.69 per share, which topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.64 per share. Meanwhile, Nike beat our quarterly revenues estimate, with Q4 sales up 13% from the year-ago period to $9.79 billion.The Beaverton, Oregon-based company also saw its North American sales pop 3% to hit $3.88 billion, after three straight quarters of declines. This is hugely important since Nike’s domestic market accounts for roughly 40% of its total revenues.Investors will also be pleased to see that Nike has continued its double-digit international growth, with Greater China sales up 35% to $1.47 billion—Jordan Brand soared nearly 50%. Nike’s revenues climbed by 24% in Europe, Middle East, and Africa to $2.47 billion, while Asia Pacific and Latin America sales popped 12% to $1.44 billion.Nike-brand footwear sales, by far its most important business, saw its quarterly revenues hit $6.14 billion, representing a 12% climb from the prior-year period. The company also announced a new four-year, $15 billion share repurchase plan of Nike’s Class B Common Stock that is set to begin after Nike’s current $12 billion program is completed at some point during fiscal 2019. This should be good news for investors since big buybacks can signal that the company’s executives and board believe the stock to be undervalued—and certainly not expensive. The company also upped its quarterly dividend.Digital DashNow that we have covered some of Nike’s overall fourth-quarter highlights, let’s take a closer look at why investors should really be pleased: digital sales growth. Last June, Nike announced its new digital and e-commerce push, known as the Consumer Direct Offense.Nike’s Consumer Direct Offense includes digital initiatives such as the SNKRS app and its NikePlus memberships, as well as vital partnerships with Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) and Chinese e-commerce power JD.Com (JD  -  Free Report). Nike even noted that it has benefited from its use of Facebook’s (FB  -  Free Report) Messenger app.Nike Direct sales climbed 15% to $10.4 billion for the year, compared to just 4% growth in its traditional wholesale business. The company said that its digital sales soared by 41% in Q4.Nike noted on its earnings call that Nike Direct drove over 90% of its growth for the full-year. “First, we said that new innovation platforms will drive over 50% of our incremental growth over the next five years,” CFO Andy Campion said on the call. “Digital is proving to be as transformative as we expected, and potentially even more transformative.”Industry OverviewMoving on, Nike currently faces increased competition from rival Adidas (ADDYY  -  Free Report) as well as Lululemon (LULU  -  Free Report) and other companies, with the sportswear market shifting further toward athleisure. Notably, Under Armour (UAA  -  Free Report) has failed to gain much traction in this category.Luckily for investors, Nike has been very successful in its off the court, non-performance sector. In fact, its Sportswear unit—what it calls its non-running, non-basketball, non-Jordan, non-training offerings—was the company’s largest at roughly $10.02 billion in full-year revenues. Nike Sportswear also expanded 8% and the company seemed very pleased with its outlook.Valuation/ Growth OutlookNow that we have covered Nike’s Q4 results and touched on its key categories, let’s take a quick look at NKE’s valuation picture and its growth outlook. Coming into Friday, Nike stock was trading at 26.7X forward 12-month Zacks Consensus EPS estimates, which marked a premium compared to its industry’s 20.7X.Nike stock has traded as high as 28.5X and as low as 21X over the last year, with a one-year median of 25.5X. Therefore, Nike is resting just below its year-long high and above its peers. But it is also worth noting that Nike has traded at a premium compared to its industry over the last five years and is currently trading below its three-year high of 29.6X.Looking ahead to fiscal 2019, Nike’s revenues are projected to climb by 6% to $38.61 billion, based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimates. Meanwhile, Nike’s full-year earnings are projected to pop by 9.5%. The following year looks even better, with revenues projected to pop 7.5% and earnings expected to climb by 15.5%.Bottom LineNike is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and sports an “A” grade for both Growth and Momentum in our Style Scores system.Nike sees its future centered around digital and direct to consumer sales, which is not only good news since that is the direction the industry is trending, but because it should lead to higher margins. The company also looks poised to continue to expand internationally, including massive growth in the world’s second-largest economy, while it begins to reestablish itself in North America. Therefore, Nike stock might be worth buying, even at its new high.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time. It’s a once-in-a-generation opportunity to invest in pure genius.Click for details >>

204,UAA,"Stocks opened lower on Tuesday morning, suggesting that celebrations over the end of the recent sell-off may have been premature. Markets looked prime to bounce back strong from their worst week in two years after Monday’s strong gains, but investors have again been reminded that volatility appears to be back in play.What is most interesting about the recent market volatility is that it comes on the back of a strong earnings season. Critics will point to large disparities between GAAP and non-GAAP results—created by one-time tax reform charges—as a reason to be skeptical, but revenue growth was truly impressive, and guidance was encouraging across the board.We have certainly moved past the busy stretch of Q4 earnings season, but a few marquee reports are still trickling in. Athletic retail giant Under Armour (UAA  -  Free Report) just announced its latest results this morning, and tech giants like Cisco Systems (CSCO  -  Free Report) and Applied Materials (AMAT  -  Free Report) are expected later this week.With that said, one of the best ways for investors to avoid the possibility of continued volatility over the next few trading periods is to target companies that are likely to outperform earnings estimates. Luckily, Zacks Premium customers can utilize the Earnings ESP Screener in order to search for stocks that are expected to beat.This is done because, generally speaking, when an analyst posts an estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.A positive Earnings ESP paired with a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better ranking helps us feel confident about the potential for an earnings beat. In fact, our 10-year backtest has revealed that this methodology has accurately produced a positive surprise 70% of the time.Today, we are giving our readers a very special treat: a free look at three of the strongest stocks that are popping up on our Earnings ESP Screener right now. Check them out:1.       Warrior Met Coal, Inc. (HCC  -  Free Report)Warrior Met Coal is a producer and exporter of premium metallurgical coal, operating primarily in Alabama. The company is scheduled to release its brand-new quarterly report after the market closes on Feb. 14. HCC is currently sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and has an Earnings ESP of 5.00%.Based on our current consensus estimates, we expect Warrior Met to report earnings of $1.00 per share and total revenues of $227.72 million. The stock’s Most Accurate Estimate, which is the representation of the most recent analyst predictions, is calling for earnings of $1.05 per share. 2.       Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. (HII  -  Free Report)Huntington Ingalls designs, builds, and maintains nuclear and non-nuclear ships for the U.S. Navy and Coast Guard and provides after-market services for military ships around the globe. The defense firm is scheduled to release its latest report before the market opens on Feb. 15. HII is currently holding a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and an Earnings ESP of 5.32%.Our overall consensus estimates are calling for earnings of $2.92 per share and revenues of $2.01 billion. These results would represent growth rates of -20.4% and +4.3%, respectively, from the year-ago period. 3.       Deere & Company (DE  -  Free Report)Deere & Company, the parent of the John Deere brand, builds agricultural, construction, and lawn care equipment. The famous American manufacturer is scheduled to release its latest quarterly earnings report before the opening bell on Feb. 16. DE is currently sporting a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and has an Earnings ESP of 4.89%.According to our latest consensus estimates, Deere & Company is expected to report earnings of $1.13 per share and revenues of $6.40 billion. These results would represent year-over-year growth of 85.3% and 36.3%, respectively. Want more analysis from this author?

205,UAA,"Market futures are in the red in today’s pre-market, keeping form with this new volatility we’re growing to understand as part of our investment environment of the past couple weeks now. The Dow soared another 400+ points in regular trading yesterday, yet remain in the negative year to date because of last week’s shedding of valuation.The Dow, which looks to only be trading in triple-digit swings of late, is expected to open down 150 points as of this minute. Things can certainly swing quickly, as we’ve seen, but without much pressure from outside-the-market events this morning, we see the current trading habitat as more or less finding its own equilibrium. Of course, that might change on a dime, as well.A new budget is being hashed out in Washington DC, which looks to add plenty more deficit spending to the nation’s bottom line, but the market has not directly reacted to this. In fact, it may not — at least until the Fed, under new direction of Jay Powell, decides what to do about the changing economic environment.As far as Q4 earnings are concerned — hey! remember them? — we see two prominent better-than-expected losses from two 21st century companies, Under Armour (UAA  -  Free Report) and Blue Apron (APRN  -  Free Report). Both stocks are up nearly 10% in today’s pre-market.Blue Apron, which had a difficult time finding its way into the publicly traded market last year, is seeing 9% pre-market gains on its lower-than-expected loss of 20 cents per share, better than the -27 cents in the Zacks consensus. With the help of its new CEO, the company also brought in $187.7 million for the quarter, above the $183 million expected. Costs related to building out new fulfillment centers have eaten into company profits, but $248 average revenue per customer and -20% cost of goods sold year over year were factors toward positive sentiment on Wall Street this morning.Under Armour initially blasted up 13% upon the release of its Q4 earnings report, posting -20 cents per share versus -23 cents a year ago. This bottom line result was worse than expected, though revenues of $1.4 billion was higher than the Zacks consensus, and guidance for full-year 2018 looks strong, as well.

206,UAA,"Under Armour, Inc. (UAA  -  Free Report), a leading designer, marketer, and distributor of athletic footwear, apparel, and accessories, released fourth-quarter 2017 results, wherein it posted break-even earnings per share that lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a penny. Under Armour, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Under Armour, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Under Armour, Inc. QuoteEarnings Estimate Revision: The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 has declined by a penny in the last seven days. However, if we look at its performance in the trailing four quarters (excluding the quarter under review), the company’s earnings have outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 33.2%.Revenues: Under Armour generated net revenue of $1,365.4 million that increased 5% year over year and also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,308 million. Also, on a currency-neutral basis, it rose 4%. For 2018, the company anticipates net revenue to be up at a low single-digit percentage rate.Zacks Rank: Currently, Under Armour carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), which is subject to change following the earnings announcement.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Stock Movement: Following the earnings release, shares of Under Armour are up nearly 12% during pre-market trading hours.Check back later for our full write up on Under Armour’s earnings report!The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

207,UAA,"Market Futures Are In The Red In Today's Pre-Market

208,UAA,"Shares of Michael Kors Holdings Limited (KORS  -  Free Report) have underperformed the industry in the past three months. The stock has gained 1.7%, underperforming the industry’s rise of 12.9%. Analysts pointed that year-over-year decline in the bottom line during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 hurt investor sentiment. Further, the company continues to witness dismal wholesale segment performance. Along with these, the contraction in margin adds to the woes.To overcome these bottlenecks, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company has been constantly deploying resources to expand product offerings, open stores and upgrade the e-commerce platform. The company’s project Runway 2020 strategic plan, which focuses on product innovation, brand engagement and customer experience, is well on track as well.What Hurt the Stock?Dismal Wholesale Segment PerformanceWe note that the wholesale segment continues to lack luster. After declining 8.9% in the third quarter of fiscal 2018, wholesale revenues were down 3.2% (or 6.1% on a constant currency basis) in the final quarter. The company now expects wholesale revenue decline in the mid-single digits during fiscal 2019. The company has been strategically slowing down its promotional activity, which has resulted in lower shipments within the wholesale channel. Meanwhile, licensing revenues plunged 11.1% in the fourth quarter. The company expects the same to decline in the high single-digits on account of transition to a more elevated jewelry line and fashion watch trends.Soft MarginsMichael Kors continues to invest heavily in new store openings, expand existing outlets and fortify international operations, digital flagships and global infrastructure. As a result, operating costs are expected to rise, which may compress margins. Operating margin contracted 110 basis points to 13.1% in the final quarter of fiscal 2018. For fiscal 2019, management expects operating margin to decline 100 basis points to 17.7%.Initiatives Adopted to Lift the Stock’s PerformanceThis London, UK-based company’s commitment toward deploying resources to expand product offerings, build “shop-in-shops”, and upgrade its information system and distribution infrastructure should drive sales. This along with the “Runway 2020” plan, cost containment efforts, inventory management, focus on e-commerce platform and accretive buyouts such as that of Jimmy Choo bode well. Moreover, Michael Kors is also expanding its product mix beyond handbags, into men’s, footwear and women’s ready to wear.Meanwhile, the acquisition of Jimmy Choo has provided Michael Kors avenues for international growth, strong base in the luxury footwear segment and diversification of product portfolio. With a network of more than 240 stores, Jimmy Choo has a strong presence in Europe, the Middle East, the Americas and Asia.Management sees opportunity to boost Jimmy Choo sales to $1 billion annually and operating margin rate growth in the low teens over the long haul. We believe that the company may pursue other such strategic buyouts in the future.Michael Kors’ Runway 2020 strategic plan, which focuses on product innovation, brand engagement, fleet modernization, digital innovation and customer experience, has been progressing well.3 Stocks Hogging the LimelightLululemon Athletica Inc.

210,UAA,"Under Armour, Inc.’s (UAA  -  Free Report) sustained focus on brand development, and the expansion of direct-to-consumer (DTC) and technology-based fitness businesses bode well. Furthermore, apart from rolling out e-commerce platforms, the company continues to look for opportunities to expand its global footprint and market share.Moreover, in the past few years, Under Armour has been trying to boost its DTC business (offering merchandise via the network of brand and factory house stores, and its website and catalogs) through store expansion initiatives and the enhancement of its e-commerce platform.These efforts have helped the stock to outperform not only the industry but also the overall sector in the past three months. The stock has gained around 34% compared with the industry’s increase of 13.7% and overall sector’s rise of 8.7%. Let’s find out whether the company will be able to sustain growth over the long haul.Focus on Digital Fitness BusinessWith increasing consciousness about fitness among people, sports apparel makers are entering fitness gadget business and other tracking platforms to attract customers.

Further, the buyouts of Endomondo — a fitness tracking platform and social fitness network connecting athletes — and the nutrition-tracking platform, MyFitnessPal, for $85 million and $475 million, respectively, are also in line with the company’s strategy of expanding its reach in the fitness space.These apart, this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) also unveiled its state-of-the-art line of Connected Fitness products, comprising UA HealthBox, UA SpeedForm Gemini 2 Record Equipped and two models of wireless headphones.Per management, the sale of UA HOVR, which was launched in February 2018, surpassed expectations.

211,UAA,"lululemon athletica inc. (LULU  -  Free Report) is a lucrative pick at the moment as the stock has displayed unmatched momentum lately, having surged 41.3% in the last three months. Notably, the company also significantly outperformed 11.6% growth recorded by the industry. This increase mainly came on the back of synergies from product innovation, international expansion and digital acceleration, which collectively reflect the strength of the company’s business.lululemon’s shares have been surpassing the broader market (S&P 500) since the end of 2013 and are currently trading at a level that has taken the valuation multiple near a five-year high. However, there are enough reasons to expect a solid upside for this yoga-inspired apparel specialist, given its niche market positioning, innovative product lines, store growth and earnings outlook.Furthermore, the uptrend in the company’s estimates is reflective of the optimism on the stock. In the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 49 cents and $3.21 for the second quarter and fiscal 2018 moved north by a penny and 2 cents, respectively. Management envisions earnings per share of 46-48 cents for the second quarter and $3.10-$3.18 for the fiscal.Growth Catalystslululemon remains committed to its strategy for 2020, which revolves around four distinct growth strategies, including product innovation, building store fleet in North America, broadening digital business and international expansion.Digital ExpansionNotably, lululemon’s e-commerce retailing channel is its key growth engine. Investments in the website and mobile app helped it improve traffic and conversion rates, as evident from 60% growth in e-commerce sales (24.3% of total sales) in first-quarter fiscal 2018. With continued progress on e-commerce strategy, the company is on track to deliver $4 billion in total revenues by 2020, with e-commerce accounting for more than one-third of sales.Growth in the e-commerce business, which scores high on marginality compared with traditional stores, should also prove accretive to margins. The inter-linking of the company’s e-commerce and store business, through the ‘ship from store’ and ‘buy-online pick-up in-store’ functionalities, should take the company’s business to the next level.International GrowthThe stock also presents a long-term buying opportunity, backed by its international growth potential and strength in the athleisure category. lululemon has significant scope to expand square footage and enhance business globally, particularly in the underpenetrated European and Asian markets. Recent trends reveal that growth in Asia is well ahead of expectations while Europe is lagging targets. Notably, comps in Asia increased more than 50% in the fiscal first quarter against double-digit comps growth in Europe. The company targets nearly 14% increase in global square footage in fiscal 2018 and plans to add 20-30 international stores. It expects international business, including e-commerce, to account for nearly 20-25% of total sales by 2020.North America Holds PotentialAlongside international, the company also sees immense opportunity in North America, both in terms of sales productivity and store growth. Though the market may seem mature, lululemon expects to execute a healthy number of real estate projects through 2018. Additionally, the co-located strategy provides an opportunity for the expansion of square footage, as well as guest experience, by making way for new product categories such as Men’s and potentially shoes.Innovation MantraMoreover, the introduction of innovative products has been a winning strategy for lululemon. Men’s category presents a significant growth opportunity, with the potential to expand product lines into the office travel category. The Men's business is on track to exceed the target of at least 25% market penetration. Further, opportunities to expand in the footwear (shoes) line are shoring up, evident from the recent studies, which suggest that guests are interested in buying shoes at lululemon stores.Bottom LineThe abovementioned factors clearly indicate that lululemon has significant growth potential in the days ahead.

212,UAA,"The 2018 FIFA World Cup has kicked off in Russia with the host taking on Saudi Arabia in the inaugural match. There seems to be nothing much to look forward to for the United States in this world cup. But the world’s biggest economy along with neighbors Canada and Mexico has clinched the opportunity to host the 2026 FIFA World Cup, beating Morocco.This is definitely good news for North America at a time when political tension is looming between the United States and its once allies, Canada and Mexico. Winning the world cup bid is expected to boost the United States’ and Canada’s joint football event, Major League Soccer (MLS). Moreover, companies like NBCUniversal and 21st Century Fox also have ample reasons to rejoice this bid clinched by the three countries.Hosting 2026 World Cup is Good News for MLSThe 2026 FIFA World Cup will be bigger than the ongoing tournament in Russia. This year’s World Cup has 32 teams competing for the coveted title, while in 2026 the number of teams will be 48. Moreover, instead of 64 matches this time around, 80 matches will be played. The United States will host 60 matches, while Canada and Mexico will host 10 matches each.With the United States becoming one of the co-hosts of the 2026 FIFA World Cup, ESPN’s Darren Rovell said that the “profile of U.S. soccer” will get a boost. Additionally, MLS franchises and sponsors are also expected to gain from this latest development. In fact, only last year, Adidas AG (ADDYY  -  Free Report) has signed a $700-million deal with MLS to retain the league’s official sponsorship at least till 2024.Telemundo, Fox Clear Winners of 2026 World CupWith the United States, Canada and Mexico chosen as the host of 2026 FIFA World Cup, broadcasters like Comcast Corporation-owned (CMCSA  -  Free Report) NBCUniversal’s Telemundo and Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc. (FOXA  -  Free Report) are likely to gain. Way back in 2011, Telemundo and Fox together paid $1.1 billion to corner the U.S. rights to broadcast the 2018 Russia World Cup and the Qatar 2022 World Cup.However, FIFA feared that Qatar’s high temperatures may have a negative impact on the entire competition, following which FIFA decided to stage the mega football event in the fall of 2022. This did not go down well with Telemundo and Fox as other big sporting events, like National Basketball Association, National Hockey League and National Football League take place during that time.In order to make up for this situation, FIFA decided to give the broadcasting rights for 2026 World Cup in the United States to Telemundo and Fox in a private auction. This in turn is definitely a positive for these two television networks.What Does This 3-Nation Event Mean for FIFA?The United States together with Canada and Mexico won the joint bid to host the 2026 World Cup in a 134 to 65 vote. North America is projected to generate revenues of $14 billion, while FIFA’s profits are estimated to be around $11 billion. The amount is more than half of what Morocco, another contender for the 2026 event, could offer the football regulatory body.This is definitely a big opportunity for sports footwear and apparel company, NIKE, Inc. (NKE  -  Free Report). Moreover, smaller competitors like Under Armour, Inc. (UAA  -  Free Report) can also gain from the event by sponsoring participating countries.Given this scenario, other companies like YouTube-owner Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL  -  Free Report) and social networking giant Facebook, Inc. (FB  -  Free Report), are also expected to gain. Both Alphabet and Facebook have a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.ConclusionFor the first time, three countries, the United States, Canada and Mexico, will be hosting a FIFA World Cup. The 2026 event is certainly big news for broadcasters, sports apparel and footwear designers, streaming networks, and social media behemoths.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time. It’s a once-in-a-generation opportunity to invest in pure genius.Click for details >>

214,UAA,"The 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia kicks off Thursday on Fox (FOXA  -  Free Report). The month-long tournament is expected to attract billions of viewers from over 200 countries, making it a marketing dream. The likes of Coca-Cola (KO  -  Free Report), Visa (V  -  Free Report), Budweiser (BUD  -  Free Report), and McDonald’s (MCD  -  Free Report) will all be heavily featured, but Adidas (ADDYY  -  Free Report) and Nike (NKE  -  Free Report) are the only companies competing against each other. So let’s take a look to see which sportswear company seems poised to come out on top at the 2018 World Cup.According to The Telegraph, it costs between $25 million and $50 million annually to be a FIFA partner and $10 million to $25 million to be a major World Cup sponsor. German giant Adidas has been a FIFA partner since 1970. The company also signed an extension to become the official partner, supplier, and licensee for the FIFA World Cup and all FIFA events until 2030.Therefore, right off the bat, Adidas might get more overall shine with their classic “three stripes” logo plastered on in-stadium signage, official game balls, and more. But this is just the start.JerseysNike has spent heavily to become a soccer powerhouse around the world since the U.S. hosted the World Cup in 1994. The Oregon-based company has successfully infiltrated every level and nearly every league in the world, including Europe’s top five leagues. Adidas, which has been a soccer giant for decades, has cultivated and maintained similar relationships and sponsorship deals.Adidas sponsors 12 of the 32 national teams competing at this year’s World Cup. This list includes some of the favorites: Germany, Spain, and Argentina.Nike, in a move that reshaped soccer sponsorships, spent millions of dollar in 1996 to outfit the Brazilian national team. Brazil, who has won the most ever World Cups, with five, is also the top favorite this year. Overall, Nike’s Swoosh logo will appear on 10 different jerseys, including France.Although it is nearly neck and neck, the slight edge has to go to Adidas. (Side Note: Puma sponsors four teams, with Under Armour (UAA  -  Free Report) notably left off this list)Stars Cristiano Ronaldo (Portugal), Lionel Messi (Argentina), and Neymar (Brazil) are three of the most famous people on the planet. The three soccer stars ranked number one, three, and four, respectively, on ESPN’s (DIS  -  Free Report) World Fame 100 list. They also all landed in the top five of Forbes’ highest paid athletes rankings. Ronaldo boasts over 202 million followers on Instagram (FB  -  Free Report) and Twitter (TWTR  -  Free Report) combined, with the other two resting closely behind.Ronaldo has been with Nike since 2003, while Messi signed with Adidas in 2006—both players are currently on “lifetime” deals with their sportswear companies. Neymar tips the balance slightly in Nike’s favor, with the Brazilian superstar currently under a massive, incentive-laden contract with the American company.Cleats/BootsWith the team sponsorships and some of the biggest stars covered, let’s take a look at what a majority of the players will be wearing on their feet. ESPN ranked their top 50 players at the World Cup and also recently highlighted what boots they will wear when they take the field. The publication noted that 49 of their 50 best players in Russia will sport Nike, Adidas, or Puma—with New Balance as the one outlier.Nike takes the top spot here, with 26 of the 50 set to play in Nike cleats, while Adidas claims 20. However, Adidas noted that 60% of all the players will be wearing Adidas footwear at the World Cup. With that said, the slight edge still has to go to Nike.Stock Performance With the fight between Nike and Adidas still a little too close to call, let’s dive into their stock price performance to help determine a winner.Clearly, Adidas stock has crushed Nike since the end of the 2014 World Cup. Therefore, coupled with its slight edge in the jersey department, and its standing as an official FIFA partner, Adidas appears to be the winner in the 2018 sportswear World Cup.But, this could change depending on how individual players and teams perform on the world’s biggest stage. So make sure to come back to Zacks for more World Cup business updates.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

The company reported break-even adjusted earnings, missing the consensus mark of 1 cent.Despite the earnings miss, the company’s shares are up nearly 12% during the pre-market trading session.

218,UAA,"Investors interested in stocks from the Textile - Apparel sector have probably already heard of Perry Ellis (PERY  -  Free Report) and Under Armour (UAA  -  Free Report). But which of these two stocks presents investors with the better value opportunity right now? Let's take a closer look.The best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits.Currently, Perry Ellis has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Under Armour has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold). This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions, so investors should feel comfortable knowing that PERY is likely seeing its earnings outlook improve to a greater extent. But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in.Value investors analyze a variety of traditional, tried-and-true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics. These include the long-favored P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company's fair value.PERY currently has a forward P/E ratio of 14.37, while UAA has a forward P/E of 123.90. We also note that PERY has a PEG ratio of 4.79. This popular figure is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also considers a company's expected EPS growth rate. UAA currently has a PEG ratio of 5.99.Another notable valuation metric for PERY is its P/B ratio of 1.12. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, UAA has a P/B of 4.93.These metrics, and several others, help PERY earn a Value grade of B, while UAA has been given a Value grade of D.PERY is currently sporting an improving earnings outlook, which makes it stick out in our Zacks Rank model. And, based on the above valuation metrics, we feel that PERY is likely the superior value option right now.

219,UAA,"Shares of Under Armour (UAA  -  Free Report) climbed after-hours following a 3.50% jump on Monday, one day before the struggling athletic apparel company is set to release its fourth-quarter earnings. But despite this last-minute rally, Under Armour may not be poised to wow many investors when it reports before the opening bell on Tuesday.As nearly every investor already knows, the Baltimore-based athletic company made history for all the wrong reasons in Q3. Under Armour reported its first-ever sales decline since going public last quarter, after North America sales plummeted 12% and wholesale revenues sunk 13%.Unlike global rivals Nike (NKE  -  Free Report) and Adidas (ADDYY  -  Free Report), North American sales account for around 75% of its business, while wholesale makes up over 60%—meaning that this performance was devastating for Under Armour.Investors bought the dip after the initial post-earnings sell-off, which helped Under Armour stock climb 7.76% over the last 12 weeks. However, before today’s gains, shares of UAA had slipped significantly over the last month.If anything, the recent uptick seems to be tied to either a short-term windfall if the company beats its low expectations tomorrow, or a possible long-term hold based on faith in possible 2018 growth.What to Expect TomorrowKevin Plank’s company is expected to see its fourth-quarter earnings sink nearly 96% year-over-year to $0.01 per share, based on our Zacks Consensus Estimate. On top of that, Under Armour is projected to see its Q4 sales slip marginally to $1.31 billion in the vitally important holiday quarter.The company has received some upward earnings estimate revisions for its current quarter. Unfortunately for investors, none of this positive sentiment has come recently. Under Armour’s current Earnings ESP of -63.46% helps demonstrate that the company has fallen out of favor with analysts lately.Other Scary Fundamentals Under Armour is currently trading at 63.56x earnings and sports an overall “D” grade for Value in our Style Scores system. In terms of more broad, company-wide problems, Under Armour already reduced its workforce by 2% over the summer—which means this quick money-saving fix could be less likely to occur again anytime soon.There have also been a massive amount of shakeups at the top. A new COO was brought on over the summer, and David Bergman took over as Chief Financial Officer in December.Under Armour has also failed to compete in the growing athleisure segment, and its Curry 4 basketball shoes failed to live up to initial sales expectations at the start of the quarter. This led to yet another executive transition.  Bottom LineUnder Armour, which is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), has begun to focus on expanding is business beyond performance footwear and apparel as its much bigger and more successful rivals did years ago. This change doesn’t look like it will be reflected in Q4 results. But investors should note that Under Armour is expected to see both its fiscal 2018 sales and earnings climb roughly 4.70% above its 2017 estimates.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

220,UAA,"Welcome to a Winter Olympics edition of the Full-Court Finance podcast from Zacks Investment Research. On this week’s episode, we explore the companies driving the 2018 Games in Pyeongchang, South Korea.The next two weeks are massively important for NBC Universal and its parent company Comcast (CMCSA  -  Free Report), as the media conglomerate has spent billions of dollars to broadcast the Olympics for years to come.NBC outbid Fox (FOXA  -  Free Report) and Disney’s (DIS  -  Free Report) ABC and ESPN to earn its domestic broadcast rights. The company has since sought to innovate its coverage through a recent streaming push and future-looking partnerships with firms such as Snap Inc. (SNAP).One of the main reasons NBC can justify spending this money is because advertisers are willing to shell out the cash to promote their brands during the global athletic showcase. This year, Google (GOOGL  -  Free Report), Famers Insurance, Hershey (HSY  -  Free Report), and many others are official NBC partners.But there are also 13 top dogs: the firms that spend over $100 million to become official International Olympic Committee sponsors.

221,UAA,"Under Armour, Inc. (UAA  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 13, before the opening bell.The question lingering in investors’ minds is whether this marketer and distributor of apparel, footwear and accessories will be able to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the to-be-reported quarter. In the trailing four quarters, the company’s earnings have outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate with an average of 33.2%. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.What to Expect?The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter is pegged at 1 cent down from 23 cents reported in the year-ago period. Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $1,308 million, almost flat from the year-ago quarter.Factors at PlayWe believe fourth-quarter results are likely to be impacted by weakness in North American business. Decline in sales in North America has been a major concern in the past few quarters. The company has been reporting sluggish sales from the region since fourth-quarter 2016. In third-quarter 2017, sales from North America declined 12.1% and operating income slumped 64%. This dismal showing can be attributed to bankruptcies, store closures, decrease in productivity and demand along with change in fashion preference.Further, Under Armour has been grappling with higher interest expense as a result of increased debt level. In third-quarter 2017, the company’s interest expenses increased to nearly $9.6 million in comparison with $8.2 million in the prior-year quarter. Moreover, it anticipates interest expenses to rise to roughly $35 million in 2017 from $26.4 million in 2016. Gross margin, a key financial metric determining a company’s basic financial health, has consistently declined in the past few quarters. In third-quarter 2017, gross margin contracted 130 basis points (bps) to 46.2% following a decline of 190 bps and 70 bps in the second and first quarter, respectively. The company expects gross margin to decline in fourth-quarter 2017.These factors have been well reflected in the company’s stock price performance. Evidently, Under Armour’s shares have plunged over 26.9% in the past six months against the industry’s growth of 10.7%.However, Under Armour’s sustained focus on brand development, expansion of direct-to-consumer and technology-based fitness businesses look encouraging.What Does the Zacks Model Unveil?Our proven model does not conclusively show earnings beat for Under Armour this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) and a positive Earnings ESP for this to happen. You may uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Under Armour has an Earnings ESP of -63.46%. The company’s Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise.Stocks with Favorable CombinationHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Foot Locker, Inc. (FL  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +3.43% and a Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The Children's Place, Inc. (PLCE  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of + 0.88% and a Zacks Rank #2.L Brands, Inc. (LB  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +1.13% and a Zacks Rank #3.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

222,UAA,"Welcome to the latest episode of Full-Court Finance, the podcast from Zacks Investment Research focused on the intersection of sports, business, and the stock market. On this week’s episode, Zacks producer and avid golfer Daniel MacPherson joins the show to discuss the current state of golf and the big business surrounding the PGA Tour as the 2018 season swings into full gear.The golf world is abuzz with the possibility of a 2018 PGA Tour season that could see the long-awaited return to success for Tiger Woods, as his presence alone often substantially boosts television ratings and overall interest in the sport. With millions of dollars invested in television coverage, the likes of NBC (CMCSA  -  Free Report), Fox (FOXA  -  Free Report), CBS (CBS  -  Free Report) and ESPN (DIS  -  Free Report) are all actively rooting for Woods—who missed a majority of the last few seasons due to injuries—to remain healthy.Still, no matter if Woods makes a real comeback or not, the PGA Tour is still a big draw for sponsors as the likes of AT&T (T  -  Free Report), FedEx FDX, Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report), Dell Technologies (DVMT  -  Free Report) and many other major companies are all heavily involved in golf through sponsorships and more.On top of that, despite Nike (NKE  -  Free Report) exiting the golf equipment business and Adidas (ADDYY  -  Free Report) selling TaylorMade, the two sportswear powers are still major players in golf apparel even as struggling Under Armour (UAA  -  Free Report) grows its golf segment. What’s more, other golf-focused companies including Titleist and Footjoy owner Acushnet Holdings (GOLF  -  Free Report) and Callaway Golf (ELY  -  Free Report) have done well.Lastly, despite gloomy attitudes about golf’s future, the game and business of golf are far from doomed, as amateur interest continues to be spurred by the rise of fun and recreational golf outlets such as Topgolf.If you have any questions about this episode of Full-Court Finance please feel free to shoot us an email over at podcast@zacks.com.

223,UAA,"(0:30) - Nifty Fifty: Secular Bulls Of The Past(5:45) - Lessons To Learn From The Nifty Fifty(9:00) - Tracey's Top Stock Picks: Fizzled Out Growth Stocks(16:10) - Episode Roundup: Podcast@Zacks.comWelcome to Episode #64 of the Value Investor PodcastEvery week, Tracey Ryniec, the editor of Zacks Value Investor portfolio service, shares some of her top value investing tips and stock picks.The growth stocks are still on a rampage, with FANG, the biotechs and the semiconductor stocks soaring in 2017.A lot of people in the media like to compare this market with the late 1990s dot-com era but Tracey thinks it more closely resembles the late 1960s and early 1970s bull market.And for value investors, that means having patience.The Rise of the Nifty FiftyIn the 1960s, growth stocks were also all the rage with investors jumping into a group of about 50 stocks that took on the popular name “The Nifty Fifty.”These were considered blue chip stocks where nothing could go wrong.  Investors were willing to buy them at whatever valuation in order to get their innovation and growth. Sound familiar?By the time of the 1972 bear market, the group was trading with an average valuation of 50x.But then, these growth stocks fizzled, and the stock market along with them.Today, investors are willing to pay a high price for many of the cutting-edge growth stocks. But some are already fizzling.Could the fizzling growth stocks be value stocks? Or are they value traps?5 Growth Stocks That Are Out of Favor1.     Chipotle (CMG  -  Free Report)) shares have fallen 56% over the last 2 years. The PR issues it faced in late 2015 haven’t yet abated. The shares are no longer the darling of Wall Street. But is it a value at this level?2.    Ulta (ULTA  -  Free Report)) shares are down 20% year-to-date as the analysts are concerned it’s going to be Amazoned. It once traded as high as 35x earnings and is now at 23x. Is it a value?3.    Under Armour (UAA  -  Free Report)) was once one of the top growth stocks. It was expected to take the mantle away from Nike as the top apparel sportswear and shoe maker. But shares are down 43% year-to-date. They once traded near $50 and are now around $16. Is it time to get in?4.    General Electric (GE  -  Free Report)) is trading at multi-year lows with shares down 27% in 2017. Wall Street has turned its back on this once “sure thing” blue chip. It trades with a forward P/E of just 15.3. Should value investors be interested?5.    Disney (DIS  -  Free Report)) had been flying high for years as its movies have dominated the box office, especially the Star Wars franchise. But shares are down 10% over the last 2 years, underperforming the overall stock market. They used to trade around 20x earnings but now trade at just 15.3 times. Is this a buying opportunity?While many of the Nifty Fifty companies are still around and trading on the exchanges, such as Walmart, Coke and IBM, quite a few are now defunct or a shadow of their former selves including Schlitz Brewing, Polaroid and Eastman Kodak.Additionally, after the bear market of the 1970s, it took years for some of the Nifty Fifty companies to again hit their pre-bear highs.That’s a reminder for investors that, in the end, valuation does matter.What else should you know about finding value in the fizzling growth stocks?Tune into this week’s podcast to find out.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

224,UAA,"Shares of Under Armour (UAA  -  Free Report) sunk near their 52-week low on Wednesday after fellow sportswear giant Nike (NKE  -  Free Report) posted some worrisome results in its first-quarter 2018 earnings report.Nike beat revenue expectations and topped earnings estimates, but profits fell year-over-year and sales remained flat.Despite topping Wall Street projections and extending its earnings beat streak to 21 straight quarters, Nike recorded its slowest quarterly sales growth in almost seven years on Tuesday. One of the biggest reasons for this downturn: lagging North American sales, which dipped 3% from the year-ago period.An array of factors have harmed Nike on its home turf. For one, the rise of e-commerce and online shopping has hurt some of its biggest retail partners’ sales, including Finish Line , Foot Locker (FL  -  Free Report), and Dick’s Sporting Goods (DKS  -  Free Report).But competition from a major sportswear player has also helped diminish Nike’s North American presence and could continue to cut into its revenues at home down the road.Adidas (ADDYY) recently passed Nike’s Jordan brand as the second-most popular sneaker company in the U.S. Through the first eight months of the year, Adidas claimed 11.3% of the U.S. shoe market, up from 6.6% a year ago, based on a report from the market research group NPD.Nike’s market share fell just 2% and still dominates the overall U.S. shoe market in terms of total revenue, claiming 37% of all U.S. shoe dollars. But if this slight dip in market share and increased competition has caused Nike investors to worry—its shares dipped over. 3.90% Wednesday—Under Armour investors might just be shaking in their shoes.Nike has more wiggle room than the Baltimore, Maryland-based athletic apparel brand. For example, the Oregon-based company has already started to adjust to shifting consumer habits through several new initiatives, including inking a deal with Amazon (AMNZ) and making an internal online sales push. Under Armour is much younger and has had far less overall success. More than that, it seems that the company does not hold the cultural cachet to fight back against Adidas’ U.S. rise and Nike’s number one spot.Even though the company sponsors some of the most popular athletes in North America, it hasn’t led to great results recently, as Under Armour has seen its stock price plummet almost 58% over the last year.Shares of Under Armour fell by over 2% on Wednesday to rest just above its 52-week low of $15.92 per share.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

225,UAA,"Dick's Sporting Goods, Inc. (DKS  -  Free Report) has been reeling under major sports industry woes of late. The company is battling a soft hunting business, along with pressurized margins. Incidentally, these headwinds caused DICK's Sporting’s bottom line to lag the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the second quarter of fiscal 2017, which marked the company’s first negative earnings surprise in the last six quarters.In fact, management also lowered fiscal 2017 view, as it expects these hurdles to linger. So, let’s take a closer look at the obstacles looming over the company and see what’s in store for this sporting goods retailer.DICK’s Sporting Troubled by Industry WoesThe company belongs to the sporting goods space that has turned extremely competitive and promotional, owing to consumers’ rapid shift to online shopping. While most retailers including DICK’s Sporting are trying all means to boost omni-channel operations, competition from online giant Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) remains a major deterrent.Amazon’s growing dominance has been weighing upon DICK’s Sporting, as some of its most significant vendors including NIKE, Inc. (NKE  -  Free Report), Adidas AG (ADDYY  -  Free Report) and Under Armour, Inc. (UAA  -  Free Report) have resorted to considerable direct-to-consumer selling. These factors, along with NIKE’s plans to sell directly on Amazon remains a major threat to DICK’s Sporting’s top line.Efforts to Stay Afloat Amid the Competition Hurt MarginsGiven the stiff competition, DICK’s Sporting is undertaking several efforts to boost its e-commerce operations. This is partly evident from the recent relaunch of its website. While these endeavors bode well for the long term, costs associated with these investments remain a deterrent for the company’s margin. Margins are also bearing the brunt of intense promotional activities undertaken by the company to thrive amid the mounting competition.DICK’s Sporting’s gross margin contracted 17 basis points (bps) and 82 bps in the first and second quarters of fiscal 2017, respectively. This was largely due to higher shipping and fulfilment expenses associated with the online sales. Further, management expects fiscal 2017 gross and operating margins to decline year over year, which reflects chances of these boulders to linger.FY17 View & Hunting Business Weakness: Major ConcernsDICK’s Sporting’s hunting category remained extremely challenging in the second quarter. Incidentally, comparable store sales (comps) at this category fell by double digits, which was worse than management’s expectations. Also, the gross margin remained stressed owing to increased promotions. Further, management expects the hunting business to witness tough times in the remainder of fiscal 2017. Despite its strong efforts to capture displaced market share from liquidation of rival firms, the company anticipates the hunting category to remain drab.Unfortunately, management expects all aforementioned barriers to persist in fiscal 2017, which compelled it to curtail fiscal 2017 earnings per share and comparable-store sales forecasts when it released its last quarterly results.  For fiscal 2017, which will have an additional week, management updated its adjusted earnings guidance to the range of $2.80-$3 per share versus $3.65-$3.75, guided earlier. Despite the benefits from industry consolidation, comps for the year are anticipated to be flat to down low single-digit compared with 1-3% growth projected earlier.While DICK’s Sporting’s remains committed toward its merchandise plan and strategies of boosting digital operations and exploiting industry consolidation, these plans may take a while to offset the prevailing glitches.4 Stocks to Watch after the Massive Equifax HackCybersecurity stocks spiked on recent news of a data breach affecting 143 million Americans.

226,UAA,"Under Armour, Inc.’s (UAA  -  Free Report) sustained focus on brand development, expansion of direct-to-consumer business, product innovation and foray in to the technology-based fitness business bode well. However, conservative sales guidance for fiscal 2017, currency headwinds and margin pressure remain matters of concern for investors. Let’s delve deeper and find out more about the stock’s state of affairs.Hidden catalystUnder Armour continues to seek opportunities for increasing global footprint and market share. Though the company generates a major portion of its revenues from the North America region, it intends to expand business operations to other parts of the world, in order to mitigate the risks stemming from concentration in one geographic region. In sync with this strategy, the company has opened factory and brand stores in Canada and China over the years as well as given franchise licenses in several other countries.Further, it has rolled out e-commerce platforms in countries like Mexico, Australia, New Zealand and Chile. Another major tool used by Under Armour to broaden its base is the development of an International e-commerce team. In second-quarter 2017, international business surged 57% to $235 million.Previously, management had announced a restructuring plan in order to utilize financial resources more efficiently. This will better cater to evolving demands of the changing consumer environment. Taking this into consideration, Under Armour anticipates incurring total estimated pre-tax restructuring and related charges of roughly $110-$130 million in the fiscal 2017.Under Armour, which share space with NIKE, Inc. (NKE  -  Free Report), PVH Corp. (PVH  -  Free Report) and G-III Apparel Group, Ltd. (GIII  -  Free Report) has been trying to boost its DTC business through store expansion initiatives and enhancement of e-commerce platform for the past few years. This strategy has enhanced DTC’s contribution to total revenues, which has advanced 25% in 2016 from 6% in 2005. In second-quarter 2017, the company’s revenues increased 20% to $386 million and its contribution to total revenues rose to 35%.Hurdles to CrossMeanwhile, despite top and bottom line beat in second-quarter 2017, investors were hurt due to conservative sales guidance. It anticipates net revenues for 2017 to rise in the range of 9-11%, down from the prior estimate of an increase of 11-12% over the 2016 level primarily due to moderation in North American business. Further, the company expects adjusted earnings per share in the range of 37-40 cents, which was lower than the analysts’ expectations.Gross margin, an important financial metric, which gives an indication about the company’s health has shown constant deceleration in the past three quarters. In second-quarter 2017, gross margin contracted 190 basis points to 45.8% following a decline of 70 basis points in the first quarter. In the second quarter, gross margin shriveled owing to aggressive inventory management, foreign currency headwinds, and rise in air freight related to the company’s enterprise resource planning (ERP) system implementation, which overshadowed the benefits from channel and product mix.We noted that, in the first, second, third and fourth quarters of 2016, gross margin have decreased 100, 70, 130 and 320 basis points to 45.9%, 47.7%, 47.5% and 44.8%, respectively. The company anticipates adjusted gross margin to decline by a minimum of 120 basis points, in comparison with 46.4% reported in 2016 due to foreign currency headwinds, restructuring plan and efforts toward managing inventory.4 Promising Stock Picks to Keep an Eye OnWith news stories about computer hacking and identity theft becoming increasingly commonplace, the cybersecurity industry looks like a promising investment opportunity.

227,UAA,"Shares of Adidas (ADDYY  -  Free Report) tumbled on Tuesday after U.S. federal authorities brought charges against a company executive in connection with a larger NCAA college basketball fraud and corruption case.“Federal criminal charges have been brought against ten people, including four college basketball coaches, as well as managers, financial advisors, and representatives of a major international sportswear company,” the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York wrote in a statement Tuesday.The allegations focus on a set of schemes where agents, apparel executives, and financial advisers bribed college basketball coaches and players in attempts to sway student athletes to their companies or services.Coaches from schools such as the University of Arizona, the University of Southern California, and Oklahoma State University were charged with accepting tens of thousands of dollars worth of cash bribes.The U.S. Attorney office went on to say that FBI and federal prosecutors have been investigating “the criminal influence of money on coaches and student-athletes who participate in intercollegiate basketball governed by the NCAA” since 2015.Alleged NCAA player/coach/shoe company bribery scheme charts pic.twitter.com/oLUZZVnHCJ— Darren Rovell (@darrenrovell) September 26, 2017One of the non-coaches named in the corruption and fraud charges is James Gatto. He was not directly identified as an Adidas executive, but instead as the head of basketball-related global sports marketing for “Company-1.” However, Gatto’s LinkedIn profile confirms that he currently works for Adidas in that role.According to the indictment, the Adidas official reportedly paid $100,000 to the family of a high school all-American and top college basketball recruit in order to persuade him to attend an Adidas sponsored college basketball program. The indictment notes that news reports described the player’s choice of school as a surprise in June.The Kentucky-based university in question was not named directly, but the University of Louisville is a direct match based on numerous details, including the school’s enrollment numbers.Louisville, a long-time Adidas-sponsored school, landed the final five-star player available in the class of 2017 this summer and signed a new 10-year, $160 million apparel contract with Adidas in August.Gatto also supposedly made similar deals with other players, families, and schools. But the German sportswear giant said in a statement that it is unaware of any wrongdoing:“Today, we became aware that federal investigators arrested an Adidas employee. We are learning more about the situation. We’re unaware of any misconduct and will fully cooperate with authorities to understand more.”Shares of Adidas sank over 2.80% to fall as low as $110.20 per share, which is almost $9 below its 52-week high reached earlier this month.

228,UAA,"Shares of Under Armour (UAA  -  Free Report) climbed 3.57% on Tuesday to close at $23.53 as part of a sustained run of success for the previously struggling sports apparel company. Some of Tuesday’s gains seem to stem from news that Dwayne ‘The Rock’ Johnson’s new shoes sold out extremely quickly.Under Armour released The Rock’s “Project Rock 1” men’s training shoes on Memorial Day. The shoes, which Under Armour called the movie star’s first signature sneaker, were released in limited quantities for $120 on UnderArmour.com and select UA retailers. The shoes reportedly sold out in 30 minutes, according to Instinet analysts, and are currently listed as “Sold Out” on Under Armour’s website.This is not the first time this has happened. Last April, Under Armour rolled out Johnson’s “Project Rock Delta” sneakers in a similarly limited release-fashion and they sold out quickly as well. “To stop production on a blazing hot product when it's at its height of sales is a very bold business decision,"" Johnson wrote on Instagram last year. ""But our game plan here is to create a window of success where the people always win but also establish that the window doesn't stay open forever.""Johnson, who signed with Under Armour in 2016, provided metaphorical reasoning for last year’s limited release. But there is a much simpler and somewhat logical business reason behind this tactic. Under Armour planned this limited release to help create buzz—a tactic that other footwear players, such as Nike (NKE  -  Free Report) do regularly—so investors shouldn’t worry that this is a missed opportunity to cash in.“We believe that the limited availability (and subsequent restocking) is part of the company’s plan for managing the franchise to generate buzz and promote a ‘call to action’ and represents a positive for brand equity,” Instinet analysts wrote in a note to clients.The RockThe question is should Under Armour investors be so excited that Johnson has started to play such a large role in the company’s marketing and apparel strategy.There is no arguing that Johnson, the former World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE  -  Free Report) personality turned movie superstar is widely famous and hugely popular. Johnson currently boasts 107 million Instagram (FB  -  Free Report) followers, which rivals Kim Kardashian West’s 112 million and soccer star Cristiano Ronaldo 128 million as some of the most popular people on the social media platform.On its face, this a great sign because Under Armour only has 5.5 million followers and its second biggest star, Steph Curry, claims 20.4 million. Therefore, Johnson has the ability to promote the Under Armour brand more than anyone else at the company.With that said, Johnson is selling shoes that people are meant to lift weights and workout in, at a time when the sportswear industry is moving toward athleisure wear and footwear and apparel that can be worn far away from the gym.In essence, the success of Johnson’s shoes and his other Under Armour apparel helps illuminate a massive problem for the company that aspires to be on the same level as Nike and Adidas (ADDYY  -  Free Report). Johnson’s workout-specific gear is what Under Armour originally became famous for. Meanwhile, Curry’s shoes have not lived up to their outsized expectations and Under Armour’s presence in the world’s most popular sports, soccer, is practically nonexistent at this point.This hasn’t stopped Under Armour from climbing recently, but that is more likely due to how cheap the stock had become. Under Armour is in the midst of a major 2018 restructuring plan in which the company expects to spend between $110 million to $130 million. Tuesday’s gains are also part of a much larger and longer Under Armour run. Since November 1—right after UAA reported its first-ever quarterly sales decline in Q3—the company’s stock price has skyrocketed, crushing the S&P 500 and Nike.With that said, UAA's massive rise has made it look very expensive. Coming into Tuesday, Under Armour was trading at 91.8X forward 12-month Zacks Consensus EPS estimates, which marks an all-time high, and comes in far above its year-long low of 29.1X.Bottom LineUnder Armour’s earnings are projected to sink about 5% year over year in 2018, and one negative revision has kept the stock at a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Under Armour is expected to see some earnings momentum next year, with our current estimates calling for adjusted profits to soar about 87% from 2018’s estimated totals as the company works through its restructuring plan.But, while some may say that any growth is good for investors, take a quick step back to look at the big picture here. Johnson cannot help Under Armour get to the heights that many hoped the company could reach because although he and his movies may have mass appeal, his apparel and shoes are far less marketable to a wide audience.Johnson’s Under Armour successes could even be the start of a bigger overall shift back to the company’s roots, which would mean that its days of chasing Nike for market share are all but over.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

229,UAA,"Shares of Under Armour (UAA  -  Free Report) were up nearly 6% through early afternoon trading hours Monday after analysts from Stifel said the sports apparel giant was making significant changes that should soon be apparent in its financial results.Citing management’s renewed focus on operating efficiency, expense control, resource allocation, and commitment to earnings, Stifel today set a $27 price target for Under Armour—nearly 27% higher than Friday’s close.According to Stifel’s analysts, Under Armour began showing signs late last year that “rational minds would prevail and focus would shift from cavalier growth to profitability.”This has not been fully realized in the company’s actual numbers just yet, with better-than-expected Q1 revenue results being overshadowed by concerns about sluggish gross margins, but Stifel believes that should change soon.“With the recent market evidence that performance athletic demand and channel inventories are healthy, we have increased confidence that inventories will be appropriately matched to demand before year-end and margins will inflect and margin improvement can continue in 2019 and beyond,” the firm wrote.Under Armour shares are up nearly 50% in 2018 as the company looks to rebound from a two-year selloff that saw the stock crash more than 70% from its all-time highs. Fierce competition from Nike (NKE  -  Free Report) and Adidas (ADDYY  -  Free Report) exacerbated this volatility, raising questions about the effectiveness of founder and longtime CEO Kevin Plank.Plank remains the company’s CEO, but Under Armour has made changes to its management team—including bringing in Aldo and VF Corp. (VFC  -  Free Report) veteran Patrik Frisk as its new president, a position that Plank previously held himself.Stifel’s optimism is a part of a larger picture of improving analyst sentiment for Under Armour right now. Within the last 60 days, the company has seen 11 positive revisions to its full-year EPS estimates, lifting our Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny in that time.Still, earnings are projected to slump about 5% year over year in 2018, and one negative revision has kept the stock at a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Under Armour is not expected to see significant earnings momentum until next year, when current estimates are calling for adjust profits to surge about 87% from 2018’s estimated totals.Want more market analysis from this author?

231,UAA,"On Wednesday, shares of department store Kohl’s Corp. (KSS  -  Free Report) are rallying, up about 4.7% in afternoon trading after the company announced a new partnership with e-commerce giant Amazon.com (AMZN  -  Free Report).Kohl’s will open 1,000-square feet Amazon areas in 10 of its stores, offering popular devices like the Amazon Echo smart speaker and the Fire tablet. Called the Amazon Smart Home Experience, the new “store-in-store” concept will start appearing in Kohl’s locations in the Los Angeles and Chicago areas next month.Kohl’s joins fellow retailers Best Buy (BBY  -  Free Report) and Sears  who have chosen to collaborate with the online behemoth, in addition to tech company Microsoft Corp. (MSFT  -  Free Report). Best Buy is similarly creating in-store Amazon concepts, and Sears recently said it will sell Kenmore appliances on Amazon.com. Meanwhile, Microsoft’s Cortana and Amazon’s Alexa are collaborating in a new voice assistant alliance.“We are thrilled to offer a unique new way for customers to try out our lineup of Alexa-enabled Amazon devices, learn more about our smart home services from Amazon experts and then buy those items directly from Amazon — all within Kohl’s stores,” said Dave Zimmer, vice president of sales and marketing for Amazon Devices, in a statement.While this is clearly a smart move on Kohl’s part, especially if this turns into a broader rollout to the company’s roughly 1,160 stores, but it also benefits Amazon. Amazon has been opening a number of its own brick-and-mortar stores, mainly bookstores, but this partnership is way to sidestep those huge building costs; the company also completed its acquisition of Whole Foods last week, another retail space in which Amazon can sell its Echo devices.Amazon isn’t the first tech company Kohl’s has struck a deal with. Last year, it teamed with Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) to create small shops within its stores. Kohl’s has suffered through six straight quarters of sales declines, but its focus on electronics—and surprisingly, activewear; earlier this year, the company began selling Under Armour (UAA  -  Free Report) product)—has helped the retailer stand out.Kohl’s sits at a #3 (Hold) on the Zacks Rank, and has lost almost 19% year-to-date.4 Surprising Tech Stocks to Keep an Eye On Tech stocks have been a major force behind the market’s record highs, but picking the best ones to buy can be tough.

The S&P 500 index topped 2,700 for the first time led by technology stocks.Investors are bargain hunting tech stocks after the recent sell-off given the high potential of growth in the sector.

234,UAA,"Welcome to the twelfth episode of Full-Court Finance, the podcast from Zacks Investment Research focused on the intersection of sports, business, and the stock market. On this week’s episode, Zacks’ resident retail expert Maddy Johnson stops by to discuss all things sports retail, from Lululemon’s (LULU  -  Free Report) recent success to the recharged battle between Nike (NKE  -  Free Report) and Adidas (ADDYY  -  Free Report).The retail landscape is changing quickly, and the sportswear industry is not immune to these shifting consumer habits. This has forced some of the biggest sports apparel companies to change how they do business.Nike and Adidas have focused on grassroots growth in the world of everyday fashion and streetwear. The two biggest global sportswear powers, and the likes of Puma and Under Armour (UAA  -  Free Report), have turned to non-athletes to help drive growth in a world where people wear sneakers and sports apparel away from fields of play more and more.On top of that, the closure of brick-and-mortar shops has forced the Nikes of the world to focus on expanding their own e-commerce business—even partnering with Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) after refusing to for years—and grow direct to consumer sales. Shifting retail habits have also forced companies to try to create new experiential shopping experiences. If you have any questions about this episode of Full-Court Finance please feel free to shoot us an email over at podcast@zacks.com.

Moreover, the company’s top-line also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,075 million. Notably, this is the third time in the last 29 quarters that it has reported revenue growth of less than 20%.Restructuring PlanManagement has announced a restructuring plan in order to organize financial resources more efficiently.

236,UAA,"Kevin Durant recently spoke negatively about Under Armour (UAA  -  Free Report), and shares of the struggling sports apparel retailer dipped about 2.5% on Tuesday, leaving some investors to wonder whether there is a connection between the NBA superstar’s comments and the latest dip in UAA’s stock price.The Golden State Warriors’ forward took to the podcast airwaves for a two-part question and answer session on The Bill Simmons Podcast, which is part of sports and pop-culture website The Ringer. During the interview, Durant touched on an array of topics, but one was very relevant in the world of sports financials.Simmons asked Durant why Maryland colleges are unable to recruit top local basketball players. And the reigning NBA Finals MVP didn’t mince words with his response.“I think a lot of kids, to be honest, they don’t choose Maryland unless they play in like an Under Armour system coming up,” Durant told Simmons. “Shoe companies have a real big influence on where these kids go. Nobody wants to play in Under Armours, I’m sorry. The top kids don’t because they all play Nike.”Durant, who grew up in Maryland, was brutally honest. In his opinion, most top young basketball players don’t play in Under Armour gear, and many prefer Nike.But Durant is a Nike athlete. He has his own expensive KD signature shoes, of which Nike is currently selling the tenth generation. More than that, Durant signed a 10-year, $300 million deal with Nike in 2014.He is playing the role of a company man, a company Durant most likely truly values and believes in. Nonetheless, Nike pays Durant more per year than the Golden State Warriors do, so it isn’t hard to see why he backs his brand and disparages its competitors.Let’s not forget that Durant’s MVP teammate Stephen Curry is the face of Under Armour’s basketball leg, if not the whole company. And the two stars are at least cordial enough to share the basketball and the spotlight.Durant’s shoes might help Nike stock, especially heading into the upcoming basketball season. But his comments against Under Armour should hardly have swayed Under Armour investors.The Maryland-based company has taken far greater hits based on real economic and retail realities this year. In fact, Under Armour stock hit a new 52-week low on Tuesday.Yet, Under Armour’s fall is more likely to do with Finish Line’s (FINL) massive one-day collapse than one of Maryland’s most famous sons’ off the cuff remarks (also read: Finish Line (FINL) Stock Tanks, Sports Industry Follows).Industry trends, not generalizations about what basketball shoes young players think are cool, determine stock prices. On the same day that Durant’s comments made their rounds on the internet, Nike’s (NKE  -  Free Report) stock dropped by 1.86%. Shares of Adidas AG (ADDYY  -  Free Report) also fell by 1.13%.Zacks' 10-Minute Stock-Picking SecretSince 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year.

237,UAA,"Shares of Finish Line  surged nearly 12% on Thursday morning after the company reported both top and bottom line third quarter beats. Finish Line’s better-than-expected Q3 also helped lift shares of fellow sports retailers, with Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS  -  Free Report) and Foot Locker (FL  -  Free Report) stock both climbing in morning trading.The athletic footwear-focused retailer beat Wall Street expectations for earnings, revenue, and same-store sales. Indianapolis-based Finish Line saw its Q3 revenues jump 1.8% year-over-year, driven in part by a 0.8% increase in comps. Finish Line’s partnership with Macy’s (M  -  Free Report) also proved to be somewhat successful, as sales in that category rose by 2.3%.Still, Finish Line reported an adjusted quarterly loss of $12.9 million, or $0.26 per share (also read: Finish Line  Posts Narrower-Than-Expected Loss in Q3).“Looking ahead, we continue to be cautious in the near-term, but I am confident that the work we are doing to position the company for long-term growth and enhanced profitability is gaining traction,” CEO Sam Sato said in a statement.Finish Line now expects to post a 2% to 3% decline in comparable sales for its full fiscal year. The retailer also projects to report a drop in fourth-quarter comparable store sales in the 3% to 5% range.However, based on the company’s solid third-quarter, it upped its adjusted full-year earnings per share range to between $0.59 and $0.67. The retailer’s previous guidance range was $0.50 per share to $0.60 per share.This new positive guidance helped lift shares of Finish Line to their highest point since August, touching $13.41 per share in morning trading. Before today’s gains, shares of Finish Line had fallen nearly 38% in 2017.Shares of fellow sports retailers climbed after Finish Line posted a stronger than anticipated Q3 and raised its full-year guidance.Dick's Sporting Goods saw its stock price pop around 1.90%, while shares of Foot Locker surged nearly 3%. Shares of lesser-known sports retailer Hibbett Sports (HIBB  -  Free Report) rose over 1.25%.Shares of sports footwear and apparel powers Under Armour (UAA  -  Free Report), Adidas AG (ADDYY  -  Free Report) and Nike (NKE  -  Free Report) remained little changed on Thursday. Nike is set to report its latest results after the closing bell today.Zacks’ Best Private Investment IdeasWhile we are happy to share many articles like this on the website, our best recommendations and most in-depth research are not available to the public.Starting today, for the next month, you can follow all Zacks' private buys and sells in real time.

238,UAA,"Under Armour, Inc. (UAA  -  Free Report), once considered the arch rival of NIKE, Inc. (NKE  -  Free Report), has been in a spot of bother for quite some time. The stock, which was trading around $50 in 2015, is now hovering around $15.Neither Stephen Curry's ""Curry One"" signature shoe nor UA SpeedForm Apollo running shoes have helped the stock to drive performances in 2017. Year to date, the stock has witnessed a sharp decline of 47.7%, against the industry’s gain of 8.1%. Under Armour has also been facing issues like sluggish North America business, deteriorating gross margin, higher interest expenses and most importantly decline in the bottom line.Let’s Have a Closer Introspection?Decline in sales in North America has been a major concern for investors in the past few quarters. The company has been reporting sluggish sales from the region since fourth-quarter 2016. Bankruptcies, store closures, decrease in productivity and demand along with change in fashion preference have been the major causes behind the dismal show.Further gross margin, a key financial metric in determining a company’s basic financial health, has persistently declined in the past few quarters. In third-quarter 2017, gross margin contracted 130 basis points to 46.2% following a decline of 190 and 70 basis points in the second and first quarter, respectively. We noted that, in the first, second, third and fourth quarters of 2016, gross margin declined 100, 70, 130 and 320 basis points to 45.9%, 47.7%, 47.5% and 44.8%, respectively. Decline in gross margin has been primarily due to aggressive inventory management, regional mix and higher promotional costs.Under Armour has been grappling with higher interest expenses stemming from increased debt levels. In third-quarter 2017, the company’s interest expenses increased to nearly $9.6 million in comparison with $8.2 million in the prior-year quarter. Further, it anticipates interest expenses to rise to roughly $35 million in 2017 from $26.4 million in 2016.All these aforementioned headwinds have been major deterrents to the company’s bottom-line, which has been declining over the past few quarters. In third-quarter 2017, Under Armour’s earnings fell 24.1% year over year. Following the last quarter results, the company trimmed the sales guidance for 2017, giving another blow to the stock. It now expects net revenues for 2017 to rise in low-single digits, down from the earlier estimate of an increase of 9-11% over the 2016 level. This can primarily be attributed to sluggish demand in North America and operational difficulties. The company anticipates adjusted earnings per share in the range of 18-20 cents, compared with the earlier estimate of 37-40 cents.Stock Surges in December: Here’s WhyHowever, as the old saying goes “All’s Well That Ends Well”, the company has displayed resilience of late. In fact, the stock has shown some signs of recovery lately, which is a big boost before we kick off 2018. Month to date, the company’s shares have witnessed a sharp gain of 14.2%, outperforming the industry’s growth of 5.3%. The recent surge can primarily be attributed to industry experts’ optimistic view on company’s 2018 performance.Earlier, management announced a restructuring plan in order to utilize financial resources more efficiently. This will cater to the evolving demands of the changing consumer environment. In sync with this, Under Armour anticipates to incur total estimated pre-tax restructuring and related charges of roughly $110-$130 million in fiscal 2017. The company incurred $89 million of these charges in the third quarter.The Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company continues to seek opportunities for increasing global footprint and market share. Though the company generates a major portion of revenues from the North America region, it intends to expand business operations to other parts of the world, in order to mitigate the risks stemming from concentration in one geographic region. In sync with this strategy, the company has opened factory as well as brand stores in Canada and China over the years along with giving franchise licenses in several other countries.Further, it has rolled out e-commerce platforms in countries like Mexico, Australia, New Zealand and Chile. Another major tool used by Under Armour to broaden base is the development of an International e-commerce team. In third-quarter 2017, international business surged 35% to $305 million, following an increase of 57% in the preceding quarter.(Looking for the Best Stocks for 2018?

Last quarter, the company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.5%.Which Way Are Top & Bottom-Line Estimates Headed?The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter stands at a loss of 11 cents per share, against earnings per share of $1.03 reported in the year-ago quarter. We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged in the past 30 days.Also, the bottom line missed the consensus mark in the trailing four quarters, the average being 4.1%. The analysts polled by Zacks expects revenues of around $1,429 million, which shows a 1.9% improvement over the year-ago figure.Factors at PlaySignet Jewelers’ focus on digital marketing and e-commerce bodes well. Total e-commerce sales in the fourth quarter rose 56.8% year over year. The sharp rise in e-commerce sales was primarily driven by the R2Net buyout. Additionally, in an effort to drive growth over the long run, Signet Jewelers announced strategic initiatives, which will continue over the next three years. Notably, the company’s three-year strategic initiatives focus on cost effectiveness. A portion of this cost savings will be used to invest in growth initiatives, which include e-commerce development, omni-channel capabilities and product innovation.Signet Jewelers Limited Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Signet Jewelers Limited Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Signet Jewelers Limited QuoteFurther, in an effort to enhance store experience, the company plans to develop innovative store concepts. Currently, it is focusing on diversifying store base. Apart from this, Signet Jewelers holds a significant position in the world jewelry market, courtesy of its distinctive brand appeal. The company is well positioned to augment performance in the long run by leveraging capital investments made over the past several years in distribution, manufacturing and diamond sourcing processes.However, margins, which have been declining over the past few quarters, are likely to remain under pressure in the to-be-reported quarter due to rise in investment and promotional expenses. Further, waning same store sales and mall traffic remain major concerns.Zacks Model Shows Unlikely Earnings BeatOur proven model does not conclusively show that Signet Jewelers is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — for this to happen. You may uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Signet Jewelers has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. Although the company’s Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise.Stocks With Favorable ConditionHere are some companies that you may want to consider as our model shows that these too have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat.G-III Apparel Group, Ltd. (GIII  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +28.57% and a Zacks Rank #3. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Under Armour, Inc.

240,UAA,"Shares of Finish Line  plummeted 30% in premarket trading on Tuesday after the company reported lower than projected preliminary second quarter sales results Monday night. Despite bouncing back a bit since then, investors seem to be running from sporting goods sector stocks due in part to Finish Line’s updated full-fiscal year outlook.The athletic footwear company expects to report $469.4 million in second-quarter revenues, which marks a 3.3% decline from the year-ago period. The revenue dip can be attributed to a 4.6% drop-off in comparable sales.Finish Line now projects its full-year comparable store sales will fall by 3% to 5%, instead of the low-single digit gains the company previously projected. The sports retailer cut its updated full-year earnings projections in half to hit a new range of between $0.50 a share and $0.60 a share—which would be its smallest profit since 2009.In response to the dim outlook, Finish Line  stock touched a new 52-week low of $6.90 a share after more than 18 million shares traded hands Tuesday morning. The company’s average volume is 1.6 million. Finish Line stock has fought its way back from its premarket depths to hover around 19% below Monday’s close.The poor quarter and even worse guidance prompted the company’s board of directors to “unanimously adopted a shareholder rights plan (the “Rights Plan”) to protect the best interests of Finish Line shareholders.”The move to bar any individual stockholder from owning more than 12.5% of outstanding shares was made Monday night to help avoid a possible takeover. The anti-takeover plan is set to expire in August 2020.With a market cap of just $417 million, Finish Line isn’t a massive company. But its negative updated outlook seems to have helped confirm what many investors already knew: the sports retail and sporting goods industry could be in serious long-term trouble—especially in the footwear sector.Sports Industry Retail The Indianapolis, Indiana-based sports footwear retailer helped send sports-related investors running on Tuesday, as it seems the industry continues to be crossed over by the fluidity and reach of online retail.Shares of fellow sports-focused footwear retailer Foot Locker (FL  -  Free Report) dipped by 1.12%, while Dick’s Sporting Good (DKS  -  Free Report) fell by 1.80% and now hovers just above its 52-week low. Small cap sports retailers Big 5 Sporting Goods (BGFV  -  Free Report) and Hibbett Sports (HIBB  -  Free Report) both sunk by over 2.50%.  Big-name sportswear brands with major exposure at Finish Line also suffered. Adidas AG (ADDYY  -  Free Report) saw its stock price fell by 0.95%, while shares of Nike (NKE  -  Free Report) dropped by 2.35%.And as is often the case during the recent industry wide investor pullback, Under Armour (UAA  -  Free Report) felt the brunt of the blow. Shares of the Maryland-based sportswear company tanked by over 3.60% and touched a new 52-week low.Bottom LineBrick-and-mortar sporting goods companies have seen their stock prices fall as e-commerce outlets, and Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) in particular, further encroach on their sales. To remain competitive going forward, Finish Line and other retailers need to consider all of their options, and the first among them might be to allocate resources to bolster their online and digital presence.If they don’t, Nike, Adidas, and Under Armour could have little choice but to wean their way off of traditional retail dependence faster than they originally planned.Zacks' 10-Minute Stock-Picking SecretSince 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year.

241,UAA,"Once an industry outperformer, Dick's Sporting Goods Inc. (DKS  -  Free Report) now seems to be in doldrums. This Pennsylvania-based retailer has slumped 22.8% since it reported second-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Aug 15. Further, this stock has crashed 47% in the past six months, much wider than the Zacks Miscellaneous Retail industry’s 14.7% downside. So, let’s analyze the factors that have been hindering the company’s performance and led to the second-quarter debacle.Intense Competition Mars the Sports IndustryThe sporting goods space has been extremely competitive and promotional of late, owing to consumers’ rapid shift to online shopping. While most retailers including DICK’s Sporting are trying all means to boost omni-channel operations, competition from online giant Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report) remains a major deterrent. Well, this has been a concern for DICK’s Sporting, as some of its significant vendors including NIKE, Inc. (NKE  -  Free Report), Adidas AG (ADDYY  -  Free Report) and Under Armour, Inc. (UAA  -  Free Report) have resorted to considerable direct-to-consumer selling. These factors, along with NIKE’s plans to sell directly on Amazon remains a major threat to DICK’s Sporting’s top line.Apart from DICK’s Sporting, these obstacles have taken a toll on many other major sporting goods companies like Foot Locker Inc. (FL  -  Free Report), Hibbett Sports, Inc. (HIBB  -  Free Report) and Big 5 Sporting Goods Corporation (BGFV  -  Free Report). Incidentally, these big-wigs recently curtailed their forecasts after posting dismal numbers in the second quarter. Aptly, the industry stands among the bottom 6% of the 265 Zacks Industries.Margins May Remain PressurizedAs stated above, DICK’s Sporting is undertaking several efforts to boost its e-Commerce operations, as evident from the recent relaunch of its website. While these endeavors bode well for the long term, the costs associated with these investments remain a deterrent for the company’s margin. Margins are also bearing the brunt of intense promotional activities undertaken by the company to thrive amid the mounting competition.DICK’s Sporting’s gross margin contracted 17 basis points (bps) and 82 bps in the first and second quarters of fiscal 2017, respectively. This was largely due to higher shipping and fulfilment expenses associated with the online sales. Further, management expects fiscal 2017 gross and operating margins to decline year over year, which reflects chances of these obstacles to linger.Softness in the Hunting CategoryDICK’s Sporting’s hunting category remained extremely challenging in the second quarter. Incidentally, comparable store sales (comps) at this category fell by double digits, which was worse than management’s expectations. Also, the gross margin remained stressed here owing to increased promotions. Further, management expects the hunting business to witness tough times in the remainder of fiscal 2017. Even though DICK’s Sporting is strongly focused on capturing displaced market share from liquidation of rival firms, the company still anticipates the hunting category to remain negative.Q2 Bears the Brunt, Outlook Hurts EstimatesAll aforementioned challenges caused DICK’S Sporting to post negative earnings surprise in the second quarter of fiscal 2017. Also, the earnings of $1.00 per share was below the company’s guidance range of $1.02-$1.07. Furthermore, expectations of all aforesaid hindrances to linger compelled DICK’s Sporting to lower its fiscal 2017 earnings per share and comparable-store sales views.For fiscal 2017, which will have an additional week, management expects adjusted earnings in the range of $2.80-$3 per share versus $3.65-$3.75, guided earlier. Despite the benefits from industry consolidation, comps for the year are anticipated to be flat to down low single-digit compared with 1-3% growth projected earlier.This, in turn has led a downward spiral in the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third quarter and fiscal 2017. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate of 26 cents for the third quarter has gone down by 30 cents, while for fiscal 2017 the same has fallen by 19.3% to $2.93 in the past 30 days.Dick's Sporting Goods Inc Price and Consensus  Dick's Sporting Goods Inc Price and Consensus | Dick's Sporting Goods Inc QuoteNonetheless, DICK’s Sporting’s remains committed toward implementing its new merchandise plan, as well as its strategies of augmenting digital operations and exploiting industry consolidation. However, it may take a while for these plans to offset the boulders that are currently lying in this Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) company’s path.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Zacks' 10-Minute Stock-Picking SecretSince 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year.

242,UAA,"Welcome to the latest episode of the Full-Court Finance podcast from Zacks Investment Research. On this week’s episode, Ben Rains discusses the NFL’s new national anthem policy and breaks down everything investors and sports fans need to know about e-commerce power Fanatics after the company’s new NFL and Nike (NKE  -  Free Report) deal.  The NFL’s ratings have declined across NBC (CMCSA  -  Free Report), CBS (CBS  -  Free Report), Fox , and ESPN (DIS  -  Free Report) over the last two seasons. But while many have pointed to the growing popularity of streaming services, such as Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report) and new NFL partner Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report), along with cord-cutting as major reasons for the league’s poor ratings, others have blamed the controversy surrounding the national anthem. This prompted the NFL’s owners and Roger Goodell to adopt a new policy, starting this upcoming season.“This season, all league and team personnel shall stand and show respect for the flag and the Anthem,” the NFL wrote in an official statement. “Personnel who choose not to stand for the Anthem may stay in the locker room until after the Anthem has been performed.”This move is sure to become a point of controversy in the coming months, and will likely linger throughout the entire 2018/19 season—which is the last thing the NFL really wants.Transitioning to a non-political NFL update, the league recently struck a new 10-year licensing deal with Fanatics. The multibillion-dollar e-commerce powerhouse will soon manufacture and distribute all non-player NFL gear for adults.Nike’s logo will still appear on all official NFL gear and the sportswear giant will also outfit all of the players. But the new deal is part of growing trend. The NFL, like many others, wants a more streamlined and insanely fast e-commerce business. This is where Fanatics and CEO Michael Rubin’s—who sold his last company to eBay (EBAY  -  Free Report) for $2.4 billion in 2011—end-to-end e-commerce strategy comes into play.Fanatics has made similar deals with Under Armour (UAA  -  Free Report) and MLB. Meanwhile, the company has amassed some of the biggest names in sports from Manchester United (MANU  -  Free Report) to the NBA and NHL, which is all part of Fanatics’ goal to take on the likes of Amazon and Alibaba (BABA  -  Free Report) in a unique way.As a reminder, if you feel that we missed something, or if you have any topic suggestions, shoot us an email at podcast@zacks.com.

243,UAA,"Avon Products, Inc. (AVP  -  Free Report) is slated to release first-quarter 2018 results on May 3, before the market opens. The question lingering in investors’ minds is whether this leading beauty and cosmetics retailer will be able to deliver earnings beat in the quarter to be reported.Though the company reported positive earnings surprise in the last quarter, it exhibited a dismal earnings trend in the preceding five quarters. Consequently, it has a negative earnings surprise of 35.7% in the trailing four quarters. Further, the company lagged sales estimates in five of the last six quarters. Let’s find out how things are shaping up for this announcement. Avon Products, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Avon Products, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Avon Products, Inc. QuoteWhich Way are Estimates Treading?In order to get a clear picture of what analysts are thinking about the company prior to the earnings release, let’s have a look at the earnings estimate revisions. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at a loss of 2 cents per share and has witnessed negative revisions in the last 30 days. However, this compares favorably with a loss of 7 cents per share reported in the year-ago quarter. Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $1.4 billion, up 2.4% from the prior-year quarter.Factors at PlayAvon’s troubles are not new though. Dismal earnings and sales trends and fall in Active Representatives are major concerns for Avon for quite some time. We note that Active Representatives were consistently recording a decline in the preceding quarters. Apparently, the company’s top line in the fourth quarter of 2017 was mainly hurt by a decline in both Active Representatives and Ending Representatives across all segments, except EMEA. Active Representatives declined higher-than-anticipated, mainly owing to fall in Brazil, which also hurt volumes significantly.Moving ahead, Avon’s top line is likely to remain under pressure due to a tough macro and competitive environment, mainly in its largest markets.However, Avon is on track with its Transformation Plan, which delivered above its cost-saving plan for 2017. Notably, the company surpassed the cost-saving target of $230 million in 2017, realizing cost savings of more than $250 million. Further, it is on track to reach three-year cost savings target of $350 million.Going forward, management is likely to focus on business foundations and improve overall performance to attain the savings target. Furthermore, the company anticipates achieving the long-term target of delivering mid-single-digit constant-dollar revenue growth and low double-digit operating margin. Management expects 2018 to be a year of executing significant operational improvements, despite continued competitive pressures.Despite all odds, the company’s shares have improved 6.9% in the last three months, outperforming the industry’s growth of 4.2%. This indicates that there still remains hope for revival.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Avon is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Avon currently has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of -66.67%. The combination of Avon’s Zacks Rank and negative Earnings ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.Stocks With Favorable CombinationHere are some companies that you may want to consider as our model shows that these, too, have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Ralph Lauren Corporation (RL  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +2.92% and a Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The Estee Lauder Companies Inc. (EL  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.67% and a Zacks Rank #3.Under Armour, Inc.

By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion.

244,UAA,"Welcome to the latest episode of the Full-Court Finance podcast from Zacks Investment Research. On this week’s episode, Ben Rains dives into Under Armour’s (UAA  -  Free Report) current struggles before taking a look at Twitter’s (TWTR  -  Free Report) latest live streaming sports deals with Disney’s (DIS  -  Free Report) ESPN, Turner , MLB, and many others.Under Armour reported adjusted break-even earnings last week, topping our Zacks Consensus Estimate. Meanwhile, Under Armour’s Q1 revenues popped by nearly 6% to reach $1.19 billion, which also beat our consensus estimate. With that said, investors clearly wanted to see more from Under Armour—and rightfully so.Not too long ago CEO Kevin Plank’s company was considered by many to be on track to compete with Nike (NKE  -  Free Report) and Adidas (ADDYY  -  Free Report). These days, Under Armour compares more favorable against the likes of Lululemon (LULU  -  Free Report) and Columbia Sportswear (COLM  -  Free Report) as it fails to expand its footwear business and international presence quickly enough.Under Armour even rolled out a new app for the NBA playoffs to try to boost its digital engagement at a time when direct-to-consumer sales have become vital. Going forward, Under Armour needs to pull out all of the stops as the company tries to grow its social media base on Facebook’s (FB  -  Free Report) Instagram and other platforms where it lags far behind many of its peers.Rains then shifts to Twitter’s latest foray into the world of live streaming sports. Twitter’s newest deals include MLS and MLB coverage as well as partnerships with Turner’s Bleacher Report, The Players' Tribune, and Barstool Sports.ESPN made one of the biggest splashes with a series of new Twitter deals that come on the back of its brand new ESPN+ streaming service. This space is one that investors should keep a close eye on moving forward as Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report), Hulu, Alphabet’s (GOOGL  -  Free Report) YouTube TV, and many more streaming players compete for coveted live sports-focused content.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

245,UAA,"Welcome to the latest episode of the Full-Court Finance podcast from Zacks Investment Research. On this week’s episode, we dive into BodyArmor as the sports drink newcomer looks to take on Gatorade. Next, we discuss the NBA’s latest deal with Amazon’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) Twitch, before we close with a look at a deal that could impact Disney’s (DIS  -  Free Report) brand new ESPN+ streaming service.BodyArmor—which has no relation to Under Armour (UAA  -  Free Report)—is ready to take on PepsiCo’s (PEP  -  Free Report) Gatorade and Coca-Cola’s (KO  -  Free Report) Powerade in the multibillion-dollar sports drink market. Those unfamiliar with BodyArmor might soon see the company a lot more after it launched its latest national television campaign, which features some big stars, including James Harden.The company could also get a real boost from one of its largest investors, Kobe Bryant, who also happens to play a big role in BodyArmor’s creative vision. BodyArmor has a long way to go to try to catch up to Powerade and Gatorade, but the drink market is going through a massive shake-up recently. And with Dr Pepper Snapple Group  as another major investor, BodyArmor could be poised to become a legitimate long-term player in the sports drink market.Full-Court Finance then transitions into the NBA’s latest streaming rights deal with Twitch for its brand new esports league, which the NBA created in partnership with Take-Two Interactive (TTWO  -  Free Report). The NBA has been on the cutting edge of a lot of media trends, and its growing relationship with Amazon could end up playing a much bigger role as streaming TV providers, from Hulu to YouTube TV (GOOGL  -  Free Report), slowly look to enter the live sports business.We then close with a look at a possible partnership between ESPN and Fox (FOXA  -  Free Report). The two companies reportedly proposed to split a UFC TV package last week that, if completed, would see some UFC fights move to Disney’s brand new ESPN+ streaming service (also read: Should Disney Investors Worry As ESPN Plus Underwhelms?).Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

246,UAA,"Shares of Foot Locker (FL  -  Free Report) are falling 26% in morning trading on Friday after the company reported worse-than-expected second quarter fiscal 2017 results.The athletic apparel retailer reported adjusted earnings of $0.62, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.90. The company’s earnings are down 34% year-over-year. Foot Locker also reported revenue of $1.701 billion, missing our estimate of $1.813 billion, and are down 4.44% year-over-year.Foot Locker stated that same-store sales fell 6% year-over-year. CEO Richard Johnson said that “sales of some recent top styles fell well short of our expectations and impacted this quarter’s results. At the same time, we were affected by the limited availability of innovative new products in the market.”“We believe these industry dynamics will persist through 2017,” said Johnson, “and we expect comparable sales to be down three or four percent over the remainder of the year.”The company was also hurt by a $50 million pre-tax litigation charge related to a lawsuit regarding Foot Locker’s conversion of former employee’s pension plans.Foot Locker’s poor report falls in a bad week for athletic retailers. This past Tuesday, Dick’s Sporting Goods (DKS  -  Free Report) sank to a new 52-week low after reporting weaker earnings and revenue than investors expected. Dick’s poor performance caused a variety of sports retailers’ stock to fall, including shares of Foot Locker by 4%.In reaction to Foot Locker’s poor report today, fellow athletic retailers have fallen again. Shares of Nike (NKE  -  Free Report) fell 5% and Under Armour (UAA  -  Free Report) stock is down 3% in morning trading. Shares of Adidas AG (ADDYY  -  Free Report) and Puma  also fell marginally, each falling about 1%.FL remains a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), with a VGM score of ‘A.’4 Surprising Tech Stocks to Keep an Eye on Tech stocks have been a major force behind the market’s record highs, but picking the best ones to buy can be tough.

247,UAA,"Most of the big players have already reported earnings this season, but the Retail group is still be heard from, both this morning and through most of next week. Here are a few companies making headlines in today’s pre-market, all of which indexes are moderately in the green at this hour after a rough Thursday sell-off.Foot Locker (FL  -  Free Report) is hitting the skids in today’s pre-market following its Q2 earnings results that came in far lower than expected on both the top and bottom lines. Earnings of 62 cents per share missed the 90 cents in the Zacks consensus, while revenues of $1.70 billion underperformed the $1.81 we were looking for and were down 4.3% year over year. Foot Locker’s previous 4 quarters had all produced modest positive surprises.This time around, same-store sales fell 6%, whereas analysts had expected 9% gains in comps. Foot Locker shares are down more than 20% in today’s pre-market at this hour, and shares of Foot Locker suppliers Nike (NKE  -  Free Report) and UnderArmour (UAA  -  Free Report) are also falling this morning.Estee Lauder (EL  -  Free Report) outperformed expectations in its Q2 earnings report before today’s opening bell, posting 51 cents per share versus 43 cents in the Zacks consensus, up 25% year over year. Quarterly sales of $2.89 billion topped the $2.85 billion expected, up 11% year over year. Acquired brands Too Faced and BECCA boosted growth for the Zacks Rank #2 (Buy)-rated beauty giant, and shares are up 4% in the pre-market at this hour.Zacks Rank #2 (Buy)-rated tractor maker Deere & Company (DE  -  Free Report) also beat estimates on its bottom line this morning to $1.97 per share from the $1.93 expected, up 27% year over year. Revenues in the quarter missed the mark, however, bringing in $6.83 billion as opposed to the $6.89 billion anticipated. Shares are down more than 6% in today’s pre-market following these mixed results, but consider this stock has risen 20% so far in 2017.

248,UAA,"Shares of Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS  -  Free Report) rose slightly on Thursday despite earning yet another analyst downgrade—this time from Cowen.Cowen, citing all too familiar reasoning, lowered its rating for the struggling sporting goods retailer from “outperform” to “market perform.” Cowen’s John Kernan also reduced his Dick’s price target to $28 a share from $31 a share.""Despite Dick's Sporting Goods remaining the preferred destination when shopping for sporting goods according to the Cowen Consumer Tracker, slowing N. America sales growth rates from key vendors Nike and Under Armour, along with increased emphasis on the brands' own direct-to-consumer platforms will pressure Dick's Sporting Goods SSS [same-store sales] growth and margin profile,"" Kernan wrote in a note clients.The Cowen note also cited the fact that Nike (NKE  -  Free Report) and Under Armour (UAA  -  Free Report) represent 32% of Dick’s overall sales. But by now, Dick’s investors are likely well aware of the company’s exposure to these brands and understand that analysts are worried that sportswear companies will transition further into direct to consumer sales.""With Nike's plans to shortly begin direct selling on Amazon, Dick's Sporting Goods likely three largest vendors, Nike, Under Armour and Adidas will all be selling directly on Amazon,"" Kernan continued. ""Sporting good and athletic apparel and footwear industries are currently over-inventoried and the environment is as promotional as we have ever seen.""Yet, shares of Dick’s climbed 1.09% in morning trading. So why did the Pittsburgh-based retailer’s stock climb slightly in morning trading after this downgrade?It is very possible that this line of reasoning simply no longer scares Dick’s investors—because they have heard it all before.The company’s stock price has plummeted by more than 50% since the start of 2017, due in large part to poor sales and lower than expected earnings. And the reason for the drop-off has to be attributed to an overall shift in the retail landscape, especially when considering that Dick’s faces less direct brick-and-mortar sporting goods competition overall.Today’s marginal gain could be a sign that investors are just trying to wish away the Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) malaise. However, as Wal-Mart (WAL  -  Free Report) begins to show true staying power in traditional retail’s fight against online outlets, maybe investors hope that Dick’s can act quickly to change its current trajectory by pivoting some of its business models.Sports Industry Retail The sports retail industry is up almost across the board despite the downgrade and cautious note for an industry giant (also read: Retail Stocks Gain on Better-Than-Expected Earnings From Abercrombie, Sears).Sporting goods retailer Finish Line  saw marginal gains, while shares of Foot Locker (FL  -  Free Report) climbed by 1.50% on Thursday. Fellow we-sell-everything sporting goods chain Big 5 Sporting Goods (BGFV  -  Free Report) saw its stock price jump by 3%, and shares of Hibbett Sports (HIBB  -  Free Report) skyrocketed nearly 10%.The sportswear and sporting goods brands that these retailers often heavily rely on also saw nearly universal gains.

249,UAA,"DICK'S Sporting Goods Inc.’s (DKS  -  Free Report) growth endeavor of strengthening store network and expanding e-commerce business is commendable. In a move to widen its footprint in Texas and Arkansas, the company has announced the launch of two flagship stores in April. With the accretion of these stores, the company will operate 727 DICK'S Sporting Goods stores across 47 states.As of Feb 3, 2018, the company operated 716 DICK'S Sporting Goods stores across 47 states, 94 Golf specialty stores in 32 states and 35 Field & Stream stores in 16 states.Grand opening celebrations for these stores will be held between Apr 27 and 29. While the store in Texas is expected to open doors at Richland Mall in Waco, that in Arkansas will be located at McCain Plaza in Little Rock. The gala opening events will include lucrative opportunities to win prizes. To lure customers, special guests are also invited to make in-store appearances.We believe that the opening of stores benefit the employees and respective community. Hiring about 135 staffs in the new stores, the Waco and Little Rock communities can avail high-class services, with exclusive apparel and footwear collections from the company’s private brands like Tommy Armour, Field & Stream and more. Customers will also be offered assortments from leading players like NIKE, Inc. (NKE  -  Free Report), Under Armour, Inc. (UAA  -  Free Report) and Adidas.Earlier, DICK'S Sporting had announced the opening of four namesake stores in March. These stores opened doors at Tyrone Square Mall in St. Petersburg, FL; Pace Crossroads in Pace, FL; Shoppes at Belmont in Lancaster, PA; and Town East Mall in Mesquite, TX.Amid an evolving retail backdrop, where retailers are resorting to store closures and enhancing digital capabilities, players like DICK'S Sporting and Nordstrom, Inc. (JWN  -  Free Report) are aggressively opening stores to enhance shopping experience.Further, DICK'S Sporting’s investments in e-commerce, technology, store payroll, Team Sports HQ and private brands bode well. Also, the company’s unique strategy of offering exclusive branded merchandise, sourced from leading manufacturers, provides it with a platform to better compete with other players. Notably, it is progressing well with its merchandising strategy (announced in fourth-quarter fiscal 2016), which is all about optimizing inventory in order to make shelves available for popular and private label brands.Going ahead, the company plans to invest in the supply chain to improve in-stock levels and speed up delivery. These investments will not only improve customer satisfaction and inventory turnover but also boost merchandise margin rates.These laudable efforts have aided this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s shares to surge 38.5% in the last six months, cruising ahead of its industry’s increase of mere 3.9%.

250,UAA,"On Monday, shares of athleisure giant Lululemon Athletica Inc. (LULU  -  Free Report) are rising, up about 2.5% in morning trading after Bank of America Merrill Lynch raised its rating on the company.BofA upgraded Lulu shares to a Buy rating from Underperform, saying the retailer is taking away key sales from rivals like Nike (NKE  -  Free Report) and Under Armour (UAA  -  Free Report). The firm also raised its price target for the company to $70 from $49, representing a 20% upside from Friday’s close.Analyst Rafe Jadrosich said Lululemon is ""gaining share from saturated competitors. We believe weakness in Nike and Under Armour North America apparel sales creates share gain opportunity for lululemon,"" he wrote in a note to clients. ""Nike and Under Armour have suffered from a lack of innovation, over-distribution in moderate channels, and heavy promotions.”Jadrosich cites some of Lulu’s customer-favorite products like its Enlite bra, Nulux fabric, and Wunder Under fabric, and believes these will help drive sales growth going forward. He also predicts comparable store sales growth to increase 1%-5% in the July quarter from the negative 1% reported in the April quarter.""Lululemon's fabric and product innovation appears robust, in our view,"" wrote Jadrosich. ""We believe lulu will increase its assortment of Jacquard (specialized knitted and dyed nylon yarn that allows designers to form unique textured patterns), which will carry higher average selling prices and is difficult to replicate.""Lulu In-DepthYear-to-date, LULU stock has fallen about 13%, and like many of its retail peers, it has been hit hard by the growth of e-commerce and changing consumer shopping habits. However, Lululemon has yet to fall into the discount trap, and the company rarely runs store promotions, a factor that sets them apart from other athletic retailers.When customers visit a Lulu store, then, they are there for a reason. Lululemon has a very loyal base, and even though today, with almost every apparel brand boasting their own in-house athleisure collection, customers return to Lulu. Their logo still resonates with a large swath of exercising consumers, no matter the price.LULU shares are currently a #2 (Buy) on the Zacks Rank, and the company sits in a fairly high-ranking industry as well; Textile-Apparel is in the top 38% of all 265 industries ranked on the Zacks Industry Rank, and has returned about 4.5% so far this year. Sales at Lululemon are expected to grow about 9% for the current year, with earnings projected to rise 8.8% for the same time frame.LULU, though, is not a cheap stock, and its P/E is nearly 25, much higher than that of its industry’s 16.04. And if you look at the past 12 months, while the company’s valuation has decreased somewhat, Lulu’s P/E has hovered around the low-to-mid 20s. This may deter some investors, but Lululemon is still the king of (expensive) athleisure and athletic, everyday wear, and this title should continue to work in the retailer’s favor.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

251,UAA,"Investors in Under Armour, Inc. (UAA  -  Free Report) need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the May 4, 2018 $16.00 Put had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Under Armour shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Under Armour is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Textile – Apparel industry that ranks in the Top 38% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 30 days, one analyst has increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while none have dropped their estimates. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from a loss of 6 cents per share to a loss of 5 cents in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Under Armour right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options? Each week, our very own Dave Bartosiak gives his top options trades.

252,UAA,"Similar to wise buying decisions, exiting certain underperformers at the right time helps maximize portfolio returns. Selling off losers can be difficult, but if both the share price and estimates are falling, it could be time to get rid of the security before more losses hit your portfolio.One such stock that you may want to consider dropping is Under Armour, Inc. (UAA  -  Free Report), which has witnessed a significant price decline in the past four weeks, and it has seen negative earnings estimate revisions for the current quarter and the current year. A Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) further confirms weakness in UAA.A key reason for this move has been the negative trend in earnings estimate revisions. For the full year, we have seen 19 estimates moving down in the past 30 days, compared with no upward revisions. This trend has caused the consensus estimate to trend lower, going from 37 cents a share a month ago to its current level of 21 cents.Also, for the current quarter, Under Armour has seen 17 downward estimate revisions versus no revisions in the opposite direction, dragging the consensus estimate down to 2 cents a share from 21 cents over the past 30 days.   The stock has also seen some pretty dismal trading lately, as the share price has dropped 24.4% in the past month.Under Armour, Inc.

254,UAA,"Friday, August 18th, 2017Most of the big players have already reported earnings this season, but the Retail group is still be heard from, both this morning and through most of next week. Here are a few companies making headlines in today’s pre-market, all of which indexes are moderately in the green at this hour after a rough Thursday sell-off.Foot Locker (FL  -  Free Report) is hitting the skids in today’s pre-market following its Q2 earnings results that came in far lower than expected on both the top and bottom lines. Earnings of 62 cents per share missed the 90 cents in the Zacks consensus, while revenues of $1.70 billion underperformed the $1.81 we were looking for and were down 4.3% year over year. Foot Locker’s previous 4 quarters had all produced modest positive surprises.This time around, same-store sales fell 6%, whereas analysts had expected 9% gains in comps. Foot Locker shares are down more than 20% in today’s pre-market at this hour, and shares of Foot Locker suppliers Nike (NKE  -  Free Report) and UnderArmour (UAA  -  Free Report) are also falling this morning.Estee Lauder (EL  -  Free Report) outperformed expectations in its Q2 earnings report before today’s opening bell, posting 51 cents per share versus 43 cents in the Zacks consensus, up 25% year over year. Quarterly sales of $2.89 billion topped the $2.85 billion expected, up 11% year over year. Acquired brands Too Faced and BECCA boosted growth for the Zacks Rank #2 (Buy)-rated beauty giant, and shares are up 4% in the pre-market at this hour.Zacks Rank #2 (Buy)-rated tractor maker Deere & Company (DE  -  Free Report) also beat estimates on its bottom line this morning to $1.97 per share from the $1.93 expected, up 27% year over year. Revenues in the quarter missed the mark, however, bringing in $6.83 billion as opposed to the $6.89 billion anticipated. Shares are down more than 6% in today’s pre-market following these mixed results, but consider this stock has risen 20% so far in 2017.Mark VickerySenior EditorQuestions or comments about this article and/or its author?

255,UAA,"President Donald Trump’s power to polarize continued after the weekend’s tragic events in Charlottesville, Va.—and his subsequent remarks—caused the president to become further isolated from some members of the business community on Tuesday.Scott Paul, President of the Alliance for American Manufacturing, stepped down from President Trump’s American Manufacturing Council on Tuesday. Paul is the latest member of a group of chief executives from some of the biggest U.S. companies in manufacturing-based businesses to resign from the council, which grew from the president’s early Manufacturing Jobs Initiative.Paul took to Twitter (TWTR  -  Free Report) on Tuesday morning to officially announce his move.I'm resigning from the Manufacturing Jobs Initiative because it's the right thing for me to do.— Scott Paul (@ScottPaulAAM) August 15, 2017The head of the Alliance for American Manufacturing’s resignation from President Trump’s council to promote American manufacturing jobs is hardly what the president would have hoped for.Paul followed a recent wave of high profile CEO’s who separated themselves from the president after the weekend’s deadly white supremacist rally. But many, including the CEOs who left the council, cited President Trump’s seemingly noncommittal rebuke of the white supremacist.MerckMerck (MRK  -  Free Report) CEO Kenneth Frazier—one of the few African American CEOs in the Fortune 500—was the first major council member to step down on Monday.“America's leaders must honor our fundamental values by clearly rejecting expressions of hatred, bigotry and group supremacy, which run counter to the American ideal that all people are created equal,” Frazier said.pic.twitter.com/a1PNQZism5— Merck (@Merck) August 14, 2017Intel (INTC  -  Free Report) CEO Brian Krzanich and Under Armour (UAA  -  Free Report) CEO Kevin Plank both also stepped down from the council on Monday.Intel “Earlier today, I tendered my resignation from the American Manufacturing Council,” Krzanich said in a blog post. “I resigned to call attention to the serious harm our divided political climate is causing to critical issues, including the serious need to address the decline of American manufacturing.

256,UAA,"Shares of Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS  -  Free Report) plummeted on Tuesday morning after the retailer posted underwhelming quarterly same-store sales growth. The chain’s massive sell-off dragged sporting goods manufacturers and sportswear companies, including Nike (NKE  -  Free Report) and Under Armour UAA, lower as well.Dick’s sank to a new 52-week low on Tuesday morning, touching $27.92 a share after investors hammered the company’s stock. The brick-and-mortar sports chain carries almost every major sportswear company in the world, and its 0.1% same-store sales growth has some investors running scared.Many other companies in the retail sector shared Dick’s fate, while some were able to avoid the downturn. But companies with big exposure inside of the sporting goods chain were not so lucky.Sports Industry DipsShares of Adidas AG (ADDYY  -  Free Report) and Puma SE PUM both fell marginally on Tuesday, with Puma experiencing the bigger drop-off. Callaway Golf (ELY  -  Free Report) and Columbia Sportswear (COLM  -  Free Report) slid by around 1.50%.Nike (NKE  -  Free Report) stock dipped 2% on Tuesday morning. Recently, the powerful sportswear company has made moves to sell more directly to consumers with its new Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) partnership. Nike has also tried to bolster and revamp its own online and mobile presence with the Nike app and the Nike SNKRS app, which hopes to create an easy shoe shopping experience.Still, chains such as Dick’s provide Nike the invaluable service of allowing Nike consumers the ability to try on higher-end footwear and sneakers. Shares of Finish Line  and Foot Locker (FL  -  Free Report), which cater even more to the high-end sneaker lover, both plummeted over 4% on Tuesday on the back of Dick’s fall. Under Armour (UAA) stock took one of the biggest hits in the sportswear world on Tuesday. Shares of the struggling company sank 4.41% and touched a new 52-week low of $17.81 a share. The company has large exposure in Dick’s and does not yet have the online and direct to consumer outlets to combat the retail drop off.Sports Retailers FallSlow growth, missed Wall Street expectations, and a poor full-year outlook from one of the biggest sporting goods chains helped send shares of fellow sports-based brick-and-mortar companies down as well.Dick’s retail peer Hibbett Sports’ (HIBB  -  Free Report) stock sank 11.65% to hit a new 52-week low of $12.23 a share. Shares of Big 5 Sporting Goods (BGFV  -  Free Report) also struck a 52-week low of $8.43 per share after falling over 5%. Outdoor sporting retailer Cabela’s  stock fell 4.92%. Lululemon (LULU  -  Free Report) stayed above the fray on Tuesday and actually saw marginal gains.Bottom LineThe retail squeeze is seemingly in full effect as Amazon and e-commerce companies siphon more and more sales from traditional retail. Dick’s hit a 52-week low and the company’s shares have fallen almost 50% in the last year. If the retail chain does not begin to make possibly drastic changes to its game plan, it could eventually get knocked out of the retail world.Nike, Under Armour, and other sportswear companies must also remain diligent in this ever growing digital world in order to remain highly competitive in the minds of investors.Zacks' 10-Minute Stock-Picking SecretSince 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year.

257,UAA,"Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS  -  Free Report) stock sunk to a new 52-week low on Thursday, less than a week before the struggling sporting goods retailer is set to report its second-quarter earnings.Other retailers, including industry powers and sporting goods chains, have already reported rough second-quarter results. Now, investors are preemptively dumping Dick’s as the e-commerce squeeze seems to be in full effect.Last week, outdoor sporting retailer Cabela’s  posted earnings of $0.53 a share, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.57 per share and marked a 10.2% year-over-year decline. The company also fell short of revenue targets and dipped 4.2% from the year-ago period, due in part to a 9.3% decline in comparable store sales.Today, citing the decline at Cabela’s, UBS analyst Michael Lasser remained cautious about Dick’s ahead of its earning report.“While DKS probably benefitted from fewer competing stores in 2Q, we think there were offsets that weighed on its same-store sales,” Lasser wrote in a Thursday note. “DKS has had a lot going on, creating the potential for distractions due to the TSA and Golfsmith conversions, the Second Skin launch, vendor consolidation and management turnover… Still, it should be better positioned than other sporting goods retailers to weather the storm.”Last quarter, Dick’s earnings jumped 8% year-over-year to $0.54 a share. The retailer’s revenues increased by 9.9% to $1.8 billion, but sales fell below our Zacks Consensus Estimate. However, consolidated same-store sales climbed 2.4% from the previous year.Those first-quarter numbers don’t scream looming disaster for Dick’s on their face, but recent earning estimate revisions, spurred by slow overall growth, resulted in the company’s full-year Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings dropping to $3.67 from $3.71 a share. On top of that, our consensus estimate for the company’s fiscal 2018 earnings has fallen from $4.08 to $3.97 per share.The Pittsburgh-based retailer faces less direct brick-and-mortar sporting goods competition today, but online retailer Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report)) has sapped some of the company’s moneymaking power.Shares of the sporting goods chain plummeted over 7% on Thursday to reach a new 52-week intraday trading low of $33.49 a share. Dick’s is currently a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). The company is set to report its second quarter earnings results on August 15.Sports Industry DownMacy’s (M) and other retailers’ shaky second-quarter earnings reports spurred Thursday’s massive retail meltdown, which hit the sporting goods world hard as well (also read: Retail Earnings Roundup: Macy's, Kohl's, Dillard's Plummet).Sporting goods retail peers Hibbett Sports (HIBB  -  Free Report) and Big 5 Sporting Goods (BGFV  -  Free Report) both saw their stock prices fall over 3% on Thursday. Shares of Finish Line  dipped 2.35%, while Foot Locker (FL  -  Free Report) dropped by 1.35%.The brands that these sports retailers sell have also been dragged down. Shares of Under Armour (UAA  -  Free Report) and Adidas AG (ADDYY  -  Free Report) both sunk by around 2%.

259,UAA,"Welcome to the eighth episode of Full-Court Finance, the podcast from Zacks Investment Research focused on the intersection of sports, business, and the stock market. On this week’s episode, we jump into the business of college basketball to help provide investors deeper insights into the world of big-time NCAA hoops, as the likes of Nike (NKE  -  Free Report), CBS (CBS  -  Free Report), ESPN, and others continue to fuel the sport.Big-time programs engulfed in scandal, debate surrounding the one-and-done rule, and the NCAA’s role in enforcing amateurism are likely to remain some of the biggest storylines during the 2017-18 college basketball season, even as the regular season begins to heat up.Still, in an era where blue chip college basketball programs, such as the University of Kentucky, Indiana, and Duke, could be worth upwards of $340 million on the open market, the sport is seemingly more profitable than ever.CBS and Turner  are set to spend billions of dollars on the rights to the roughly one month NCAA March Madness tournament through 2032. On top of that, major sponsors of one of the biggest U.S. sporting events such as Coke , AT&T (T  -  Free Report), and Capital One (COF  -  Free Report) aren’t likely to leave anytime soon. And this just covers the most mainstream portion of the college hoops season.Disney’s (DIS  -  Free Report) struggling sports media network, ESPN, is deeply invested in college basketball. The nearly five-month regular season is fueled by marquee games presented by the likes of Lowe’s (LOW  -  Free Report) and sponsor-laden in-season tournaments tied to Progressive (PGR  -  Free Report), Gildan (GIL  -  Free Report), 2K TTWO, and many more. Even social media powerhouse Facebook (FB  -  Free Report) bought the rights to live stream college basketball this season.Lastly, as many college basketball fans and investors already know, Nike, Adidas (ADDYY  -  Free Report), and Under Armour UAA might be the real lifeblood of NCAA hoops.If you have any questions about this episode of Full-Court Finance please feel free to shoot us an email over at podcast@zacks.com.

The speculation and predictions have already begun, but let’s leave the guessing to the NBA experts and look instead at the NBA’s rapidly growing business.James, who is set to play for his eighth straight NBA title, Curry, and Kevin Durant are all global superstars. All three are some of the biggest names for some of the biggest sports apparel companies in the world, Nike (NKE  -  Free Report) for James and Durant, and Under Armour (UAA  -  Free Report) for Curry.The three biggest names in the NBA Finals are also successful pitchmen as well as investors, making millions on and off the court. On top of the success of these superstars, the NBA has become one of the most successful sports leagues in the world and its business has never been bigger.TV RatingsThe NBA saw its overall national TV ratings climb 8% from last season to hit 1.28 million, according to Nielsen. This uptick comes across the league’s four television-network partners: Disney’s (DIS  -  Free Report) ABC and ESPN, Turner’s  TNT, and NBA TV. The 2017/18 season also marked the NBA’s best overall ratings average since the 2013/14 season and stands in stark contrast to the NFL’s ratings decline.The league has also performed well on television throughout the playoffs. The struggling ESPN’s overall NBA playoff ratings were up 31% from 2017, with Game 7 of the Eastern Conference finals drawing 13.305 million viewers—which marked the second-largest total for an NBA game in ESPN history. Meanwhile, TNT’s coverage of the Western Conference finals climbed roughly 33%.These ratings will be fun to pay attention to throughout the NBA Finals as the league’s performance on television might have major implications for sponsorship partners and help determine the NBA’s negotiating power going forward.  Sponsors The NBA introduced for the first time this season jersey sponsorship patches, which allowed teams to negotiate their own deals with companies for the rights to a 2.5 inch by 2.5 inch patch on players’ left sleeves. In total, 21 out of the league’s 30 teams played with a patch during the first season, with notable teams from big markets, including the Chicago Bulls and Houston Rockets, taking the court without patches.With that said, the rest of the teams made some big money from deals. The average patch deal brought in roughly $6.5 million per year, and accounted for roughly $137 million of total sponsorship revenue, according to IEG/ESP.The recent influx of new revenue helped the NBA pull in $1.12 billion in total sponsorship money this season, which marked a 31% surge from the $861 million last season. It is also worth noting that the NBA rested just behind the NFL’s $1.25 billion.General Electric (GE  -  Free Report), Disney, Harley-Davidson (HOG  -  Free Report), Western Union (WU  -  Free Report), eBay (EBAY  -  Free Report)-owned StubHub, and Fitbit (FIT  -  Free Report) were just some of the notable jersey sponsors in the inaugural season. The two teams that face off in the NBA finals stand to help provide even more exposure for their corporate sponsors: Japanese electronics firm Rakuten RKUNY for the defending champion Warriors, and Goodyear (GT  -  Free Report) for its hometown Cavaliers.The 2018 NBA Finals mark another first for the NBA when it comes to boosting its top line, with Google’s (GOOGL  -  Free Report) YouTube TV acting as the first-ever presenting sponsor for the NBA Finals. The YouTube TV logo will appear all over the place, including the official NBA Finals logo. Meanwhile, select markets are also expected to be able to watch ABC’s NBA Finals coverage on YouTube TV.Looking AheadFrom the NBA’s partnership with Take-Two Interactive and Amazon’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) Twitch on its new esports league to its active expansion in China and other growth markets, the NBA’s business looks poised to keep on booming.Going forward, these deals should help the NBA become even more popular and relevant as it fights to stay on the cutting-edge of content distribution and outside the box business ventures.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

261,UAA,"The rise of health consciousness consumers has compelled Under Armour, Inc. (UAA  -  Free Report) to focus on the development of fitness gadgets and other fitness tracking platforms. The acquisition of MapMyFitness was a step toward this direction. The buyouts of Endomondo and MyFitnessPal are also in line with the company’s strategy to expand in the fitness space.By acquiring fitness technology companies, Under Armour has enhanced its digital capabilities which allow it to launch digital products and fitness tracking platforms. The company also unveiled a state-of-the-art line of connected fitness products comprising UA HealthBox, UA SpeedForm Gemini 2 Record Equipped and two models of wireless headphones.Per management, the sale of UA HOVR, which was launched in February 2018, surpassed expectations. The launch of these shoes reflects the company’s continued focus on improving a runners’ experience. The HOVR platform launched two running styles, namely, the UA HOVR Sonic and UA HOVR Phantom. These shoes can also be connected to the MapMyRun app. Meanwhile, the company’s continuous efforts to expand its product portfolio  has helped it to outperform the industry over the past month. The stock has gained 15.5% compared with the industry’s gain of 1.7%.Apart from expanding its product line, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company continues to seek ways to expand its global footprint and market share. Though the company generates a major portion of its revenues from the North America region, it intends to expand business operations to other parts of the world to mitigate the risks stemming from concentration in one geographic region.Sales decline in North America has been a major concern for investors in the past few quarters. In fact, the company has been reporting sluggish sales from the region since fourth-quarter 2016.Nevertheless, the company is expanding its DTC business in the U.K., Germany and the Netherlands. Further, it has rolled out e-commerce platforms in Mexico, Australia, New Zealand and Chile. Another major tool used by Under Armour to broaden its base is the development of an international e-commerce team.Stocks to ConsiderDelta Apparel, Inc.

262,UAA,"The Masters’ tagline has been “a tradition unlike any other” for years. The validity of this claim aside, the first major championship of the year at Augusta National Golf Club is unique to the rest of major sports and golf as a whole for the simple fact that it does not pursue the most money possible.Augusta keeps many of its financial dealings under wraps, but the Masters reportedly generated revenues of roughly $115 million in 2015, according to a Golf Digest report. The club also leaves millions of dollars on the table when you consider the relatively cheap ticket prices, insanely inexpensive food, and absence of online merchandise.So where does the money come from and where does all of it go?AugustaThe most basic revenue breakdown is as follows: merchandise ($47.5 million); tickets ($34.75 million); international TV rights ($25 million); and concessions ($7.75 million).Augusta pours millions and millions of dollars into the course every year. Another large chunk of the money goes directly to the players. The Masters will shell out a total of $11million in prize money this year, which is the second-highest on tour.Masters tickets, one of the largest revenue generators despite their relatively low costs, are usually won and purchased through a lottery system. But tickets always end up on secondary markets. Four day badges for the Masters had been selling for about $6,500 right up until the start of Thursday’s first-round, on various ticket sites.One of the most obvious ways that Augusta leaves money on the greens is through its now iconically-cheap food and drink offerings.Once again, the amazing concession prices at the Masters. Important Note: Today’s badge alone is going to cost you about $1,750. pic.twitter.com/DGhfsy4gJN— Darren Rovell (@darrenrovell) April 5, 2018TelevisionCBS (CBS  -  Free Report) will broadcast weekend coverage of the Masters for the 63rd year in a row. The network and Augusta have worked on one-year deals pretty much the entire time, and look as if they will continue this relationship in perpetuity.Interestingly, neither CBS nor Augusta reportedly make money from their relationship. This breakeven partnership is based on mutual prestige, which seems hardly enough when looking at the massive 12-year, $1.1 billion deal Fox (FOXA  -  Free Report) and the USGA signed in 2013.  The 2018 Masters also marks roughly 10 years since ESPN (DIS  -  Free Report) took over Thursday and Friday coverage. Details about the deal aren't clear, but ESPN certainly dedicates a lot of resources to its nearly around-the-clock coverage.Fans can also watch nearly all of the coverage on Masters.com, which shows far more total hours than ESPN and CBS.SponsorsDelta (DAL  -  Free Report) became the newest official sponsor of the Masters last October. The airline’s addition brought the overall total to six. UPS (UPS  -  Free Report), AT&T (T  -  Free Report), IBM (IBM  -  Free Report), Mercedes-Benz, and Rolex all spend between $6 and $8 million a year, but have zero signage in view on the property.This investment grants the Masters’ partners the rights to split four minutes of ads per broadcast hour, which is far less time than most other sporting events. Three of the biggest sportswear giants, Nike (NKE  -  Free Report), Adidas (ADDYY  -  Free Report), and Under Armour (UAA  -  Free Report) will also all be on full display during the four-day tournament. Lastly, many of the players themselves will have a slew of corporate logos, from KPMG and other financial firms to golf companies such as Callaway (ELY  -  Free Report), all over their bodies.RatingsOf all the mystique surrounding the Masters, one thing that seems all too clear is that both CBS and ESPN hope this year’s tournament grabs better ratings.The Masters suffered it lowest TV ratings in 13 years in 2017. But this year’s event promises to be different because the sport’s biggest star, Tiger Woods, is back at Augusta—and this time he looks healthy.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

263,UAA,"The Q1 earnings season has crossed the halfway mark, with earnings and revenue growth well on track to mark the highest in seven years.However, two factors are dampening the optimism for this reporting cycle. First, estimates for the quarter under review have remained stagnant, as was the case at the start of the season. Second, though the positive surprises are trending beyond historical levels, they have so far failed to beat the previous earnings cycle, especially with respect to revenue surprises.Per Earnings Preview dated Apr 27, the total earnings for the S&P 500 index in the first quarter are projected to improve 22.6% year over year on revenue growth of 8.4%. In fourth-quarter 2017, earnings and revenues have increased 13.4% and 8.6%, respectively.The first-quarter 2018 earnings season has seen releases from nearly 267 S&P 500 members as of Apr 27. Per the latest report, the scenario looks compelling, with 76.8% of the members delivering positive earnings surprises and 73.8% trumping top-line expectations. In fact, the proportion of companies pulling off earnings and revenue beats is a stellar 61.4%. Also, earnings for the companies that have reported their financial numbers advanced 25.1% from the year-ago period, with revenues up 10%.The performance of the index is not restricted to a single sector, and of the 16 Zacks sectors, only the Autos space is expected to witness an earnings decline in the reporting season. While textile-apparel stocks like — Under Armour, Inc. (UAA  -  Free Report) and Hanesbrands Inc. (HBI  -  Free Report) — form part of Consumer Discretionary sector, Tapestry, Inc. (TPR  -  Free Report) belongs to Retail/Wholesale sector.According to the above report, total quarterly earnings for the Consumer Discretionary sector are likely to grow 12.1% year over year, with revenues expected to increase 6.6%. In fact, margins are also estimated to edge up 0.6% year over year. This bullish projection can be attributed to gain from a buoyant U.S. economy characterized by rising consumer confidence, improving consumer spending and an accelerating labor market.Meanwhile, Retail/Wholesale sector has long been witnessing an evolving environment where retailers are adhering to various omni-channel techniques for providing a seamless shopping experience. Impressively, total earnings for the sector are likely to increase 17.8% year over year in Q1, courtesy of revenues growth of 7.8%. The sector’s margins are also expected move up 0.4% year over year.Our research shows that when a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) stock is combined with a positive Earnings ESP, the chance of beating earnings estimates is high. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.All said, let’s find out where Under Armour, Hanesbrands and Tapestry stand ahead of their earnings releases on May 1.Key Predictions for UAA and HBI Under Armour has pulled off a positive earnings surprise in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 10.2%. However, the company missed the earnings estimate in the last reported quarter. Moreover, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the first quarter of 2018 is pegged at a loss of 5 cents, wider than the loss of a penny reported a year ago. Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $1.12 billion, almost flat with the year-ago quarter figure. Per management, revenues are likely to decline or remain flat year over year in Q1. Also, it envisions loss per share in the range 6-7 cents due to adjusted operating loss of nearly $15 million.Under Armour, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Under Armour, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Under Armour, Inc. Quote Moreover, prolonged weakness in the North American business and soft margins are likely to hurt the company’s quarterly results. Further, Under Armour has been struggling to keep interest expenses in check. However, sustained focus on brand development, restructuring plans, expansion of direct-to-consumer and technology-based fitness businesses remain encouraging. The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 and has an Earnings ESP of +11.31. (Read: How is Under Armour Stock Placed Ahead of Q1 Earnings?)You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Leading designer and marketer of basic apparel, Hanesbrands has a mixed record of earnings surprises in the trailing four quarters. In the fourth quarter of 2017, it pulled off a negative earnings surprise of 1.9% that is likely to continue in the first quarter of 2018. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the first quarter is pegged at 24 cents, mirroring a year-over-year decline of 17.2%. Moreover, the company has been battling higher cost of sales and marketing expenses due to a challenging U.S. wholesale landscape.Hanesbrands Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Hanesbrands Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Hanesbrands Inc. Quote Nevertheless, Hanesbrands has been benefiting from its strong international performance and increasing organic sales, thus resulting in top-line growth. Apparently, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $1,431 million for the first quarter, up about 3.7% from the year-ago quarter’s figure. Notably, the expectation lies within management’s forecast of net sales in the band of $1.42-$1.44 billion for the quarter. The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of -0.92%. (Read: Hanesbrands Q1 Earnings: Can Strategies Pare Cost Woes?)What Lies Ahead of TPR?Tapestry boasts an impressive earnings surprise history, with a beat in each of the trailing four quarters by an average of 11.9%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter fiscal 2018 is pegged at 50 cents, up nearly 8.7% from the year-ago quarter. Further, the consensus mark for revenues is projected to be $1,302 million, up from $995 million in the year-ago quarter.Tapestry, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Tapestry, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Tapestry, Inc. Quote Furthermore, Tapestry’s approach to adapt to the evolving retail landscape is commendable. The company is also undergoing a brand transformation and introducing modern luxury concept stores in key markets. In this regard, management is viewing the acquisitions of Stuart Weitzman and Kate Spade as a significant step toward becoming a multi-brand company. Moreover, Tapestry has undertaken transformation initiatives revolving around product, stores and marketing, alongside expanding its e-commerce platform. These are likely to have a favorable impact on its third-quarter results. It has a Zacks Rank #2 and an Earnings ESP of +2.15%.

264,UAA,"Shares of Nike (NKE  -  Free Report) dropped on Monday morning after the sportswear giant received a significant analyst downgrade—amid what has already proven to be rough times for the company.Jefferies analyst Randal Konik lowered his Nike rating from a “buy” to a “hold.” Konik also dropped Nike’s price target from $75 a share to $60 per share. Konik cited steeper competition in the sportswear sector and overall sales declines as a few of the biggest reasons for the downgrade.Konik also pointed directly to Adidas AG’s (ADDYY  -  Free Report) strong outputs and positive outlook as a reason for Nike’s decline.""The athletic footwear cycle and Nike brand power are strong, but the competitive landscape should make share gains and margin expansion elusive… With expectations for less robust fundamentals, Nike's premium valuation conflicts with intensifying US competition unfolding,"" Konik wrote in a note. ""Adidas has been successful in leveraging the spark from its fashion retro footwear resurgence into other categories like running and athletic apparel.""Jefferies noted that traffic to Nike’s website has slipped, while Adidas’ website has added visitors. Adidas has also grabbed 44% of the secondary shoe market from Nike since January 2015. On top of that, Adidas has stolen some of Nike’s running sector dominance.Jefferies and Konik point to another overall sportswear trend that might be even more worrying for Nike investors: cultural significance. The firm points out that Adidas’ heavy move into fashion-forward looks and lines, including partnerships with Kanye West and Pharrell Williams, has served the company very well in terms of slowly eroding Nike’s U.S. dominance in the “cool” department.The note points out that premiums paid for high priced Adidas sneakers have risen to near the level of Nike’s high-end lines over the last few years. Shares of Nike dipped by as much as 3% Monday morning and now hover down around 2.6%.  Nike is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and scored a “D” grade for Value and Momentum in our Style Scores system.Bottom Line Nike’s cultural clout in the sports world is unlikely to disappear overnight. But investors might begin to consider the frailty and fickleness of fashion as Adidas cuts into Nike’s sales and style status domestically.Sports Industry DownNike’s stock has also been hurt as sporting goods retail companies have tanked in the last month due to an array of factors. Foot Locker’s (FL) recent rough earnings report sent its shares plummeting on Friday, and the sports shoe retailer’s stock price sank roughly 4.50% again on Monday to reach a new 52-week low of $32.55 a share.Big 5 Sporting Goods (BGFV  -  Free Report) and Dick’s Sporting Goods (DKS  -  Free Report) both saw their stock prices fall over 1% on Monday to near year-long lows. Shares of Finish Line  plummeted 8.63% to reach a new 52-week low of $9.89 per share.The brands that these sports retailers sell have also been dragged down because of poor overall sales and Nike’s woes. Shares of Under Armour (UAA  -  Free Report) sunk by 3.48% to hit a new 52-week low, while Columbia Sportswear (COLM  -  Free Report) and Adidas dropped marginally.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

265,UAA,"Church & Dwight Co., Inc. (CHD  -  Free Report) is slated to release first-quarter 2018 results on May 3. This consumer goods behemoth has surpassed earnings estimates for five consecutive quarters now, courtesy of its robust international presence, solid organic sales trend and focus on buyouts. However, the company is plagued by escalated expenses, which remain a threat to margins. So, let’s see if Church & Dwight can keep its splendid surprise streak alive this time around as well. Church & Dwight Co., Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Church & Dwight Co., Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Church & Dwight Co., Inc. Quote International Business: A Major StrengthWe expect Church & Dwight to continue gaining from its international business, which has been a growth driver over the past few years. In fourth-quarter 2017, organic sales in the international segment jumped 5.8%, courtesy of higher volumes. Further, overall international sales surged 33.3%, receiving considerable impetus from STERIMAR and OXICLEAN in the export business; STERIMAR, ARM & HAMMER toothpaste and OXICLEAN in Mexico; and ARM & HAMMER cat litter and BATISTE in Canada. Well, ARM & HAMMER remains the company’s biggest international brand, which is well placed to grow further in emerging markets. Well, international sales have also been contributing strongly to the company’s organic sales growth. Thus, the company continues to invest in the international consumer business to sustain its strong sales growth, as evident from its considerable investments in Southeast Asia and China. Also, the company is opening new offices to support increase in export business and expects its international operations to remain strong,Markedly, analysts polled by Zacks expect net sales from Consumer International to surge 20.3% to $172 million in the first quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales of Consumer Domestic and Specialty Products segments are pegged at $728 million and $78 million, respectively, in comparison with $660 million and $74 million reported in the year-ago period.Other DriversChurch & Dwight is also likely to continue witnessing organic sales growth, which has long been backed by the company’s solid focus on product innovations. Evidently, organic sales jumped 2.3%, 1.8%, 3.2% and 3.4% in the first, second, third and fourth-quarter 2017, respectively. In the fourth quarter, organic sales growth was driven by higher volumes and better-than-expected sales at all the three segments. In 2018, management expects organic sales to grow 3%, which also gives out positive signals for the quarter to be reported. In fact, for first-quarter 2018, the company expects organic sales growth of 2%.Apart from these factors, Church & Dwight has been benefiting from its focus on acquisitions. The company started with only one brand, i.e. ARM & HAMMER and since then has acquired a number of brands which are generally number-one or number-two brands with high margin. These businesses are likely to have boosted the company’s revenues from $1.5 billion in 2004, to reach $4 billion in 2018. Progressing on these lines, Church & Dwight concluded the buyout of Waterpik in the third quarter and is on track with its integration.Considering all aforementioned factors, management projects first-quarter reported sales growth to be 11% year over year. Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is $979 million, up 11.6% from $877 million recorded in the year-ago period.Will Cost Woes be Offset?However, Church & Dwight continues to battle increased commodity and transportation costs. Management expects these headwinds to weigh on gross margin in 2018. Further, the company plans to increase marketing expenditure, while it also expects SG&A expenses (as a percentage of sales) to increase, owing to intangible amortization expenses, integration costs and higher levels of SG&A from recent acquisitions. This may impact the operating margin.Nevertheless, it looks like the company expects strength of its international business and revenue-driving initiatives to compensate for these obstacles, as it envisions adjusted earnings per share of 61 cents for the first quarter, reflecting year-over-year growth of 17.3% (on an adjusted basis). This also falls in line with the Zacks consensus estimate that has remained stable over the past 30 days.What the Zacks Model UnveilsTo top it, our proven model shows that Church & Dwight is likely to beat bottom-line estimates this quarter. For this to happen, a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Church & Dwight carries a Zacks Rank #3, which when combined with its Earnings ESP of +0.52%, makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.Other Stocks Poised to Beat Earnings EstimatesHere are some other companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these too have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Under Armour (UAA  -  Free Report) a Zacks #3 Ranked stock, has an Earnings ESP of +11.31%.

266,UAA,"Similar to wise buying decisions, exiting certain underperformers at the right time helps maximize portfolio returns. Selling off losers can be difficult, but if both the share price and estimates are falling, it could be time to get rid of the security before more losses hit your portfolio.One such stock that you may want to consider dropping Under Armour, Inc. (UAA  -  Free Report), which has witnessed a significant price decline in the past four weeks, and it has seen negative earnings estimate revisions for the current quarter and the current year. A Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) further confirms weakness in UAA.A key reason for this move has been the negative trend in earnings estimate revisions. For the full year, we have seen fourteen estimates moving down in the past 30 days, compared with just no upward revisions. This trend has caused the consensus estimate to trend lower, going from 42 cents a share a month ago to its current level of 38 cents.Under Armour, Inc. Price and Consensus Under Armour, Inc. Price and Consensus | Under Armour, Inc. QuoteAlso, for the current quarter, Under Armour has seen thirteen downward estimate revisions versus no revision in the opposite direction, dragging the consensus estimate down to 66 cents a share from $1.14 over the past 30 days. The stock also has seen some pretty dismal trading lately, as the share price has dropped 9.9% in the past month.So it may not be a good decision to keep this stock in your portfolio anymore, at least if you don’t have a long time horizon to wait.If you are still interested in the Textile - Apparelindustry, you may instead consider a better-ranked stock - PVH Corp.(PVH  -  Free Report).

267,UAA,"Shares of Under Armour (UAA  -  Free Report) are plummeting on Tuesday after the struggling sports apparel company’s second-quarter earnings report sent investors sprinting. The company’s fall from grace happened seemingly overnight, and now investors are stuck wondering: is there any way forward for Under Armour?Under Armour’s second-quarter revenue was up 9% year-over-year to $1.1 billion and the company beat both Zacks earnings and revenue estimates. Yet UA shares fell 8.04% through mid-afternoon trading and hit a new 52-week low of $18.25 per share in intraday trading.What Has Under Armour Investors So Spooked? The company’s revenue figures rose, but investors had become accustomed to years of double-digit quarterly growth. And this quarter marked the third consecutive quarter in which revenue grew less than 20% after a period of massive growth that lasted more than six years.One of the biggest reasons for the downturn this quarter and today’s massive selloff is the fact that the Maryland-based company’s North American sales grew only 0.3% in the second-quarter. The lackluster North American sales growth looks even worse since the region accounts for more than three-quarters of the company’s total revenue.Investors are also nervous about the company’s plans to cut roughly 2% of its global workforce, or 280 jobs, as part of a restructuring plan—half of the layoffs will reportedly take place at the headquarters.Under Armour also lowered its 2017 expectations for revenue growth to 9% to 11% from its previous forecast of 11% to 12%. Under Armour now plans to try to add new wrinkles to its game in the hopes to improve and compete going forward.Star U.S. athletes, who win on the biggest stages in an array of sports—such as Stephen Curry, Jordan Spieth, and Tom Brady—all rock Under Armour gear, but now it looks like the company is headed in a different direction.The sports apparel company expects to try to expand its collections for both women and children. On top of that, Under Armour will try to transition its business into more of a life style brand that can be worn outside of athletic activities—in line with rivals Nike (NKE  -  Free Report) and Adidas AG (ADS  -  Free Report).“The landscape is evolving quickly. Therefore we, too, must evolve quickly,” CEO Kevin Plank said during a call.It’s All About The ShoesUnder Armour surpassed Adidas to become the second-largest U.S. sports apparel company, behind only Nike, in 2014. Some analysts believed the company would become the third-largest sportswear brand on the planet by 2030.Two years ago, Under Armour was riding high. Shares had skyrocketed from roughly $13 per share in July 2012 to an all-time high of $51 per share in July 2015.Under Armour had slowly secured a lineup of some of the most recognizable athletes across some of the biggest sports in the U.S. New England Patriots star Brady was the company’s first big signing back in 2010, and by the summer of 2015, Curry, Spieth, Cam Newton, and Bryce Harper were with the brand.Curry, Newton, and Harper were crowned MVP of their respective sports in 2015. Spieth grabbed the green jacket as the Masters champion, and Brady’s New England Patriots won Super Bowl XLIX in dramatic fashion.With stars in the NBA, MLB, PGA, and NFL—where all sports often require their own footwear— shoe sales became vital to Under Armour.In the second-quarter of 2015 net footwear revenues skyrocketed 40% year-over-year to $154 million. This prompted Under Armour’s CEO to predict that shoe sales would make up an estimated 22% of its projected $7.5 billion in sales by 2017.Under Armour’s footwear sales hit the $1 billion mark in 2016. However, today’s second-quarter report saw footwear revenue drop by 2% to $237 million year-over-year. One of the biggest reasons for the decline was the lack of sales and internet mocking of Curry 's “Curry 3” sneakers.Any Positives?Net revenue grew 88.8% in the Asian Pacific market, which helped bolster Under Armour’s total international growth to 56.8%.The Asian markets have become basketball crazed with all of the big NBA stars and footwear companies making massive summer tours throughout China and the rest of Asia. Curry and his Golden State Warriors are the odds on favorite to win another NBA title this season, and his new Curry 4’s, which he debuted in the 2017 NBA finals, have been well received.The two-time NBA MVP’s shoes could prove vital to the company’s success over the next two quarters. But only time will tell if they fly off the selves like the first couple Curry models did.Strong sales of high retail cost items from golf and football cleats to basketball shoes could help Under Armour get back on track. It desperately needs to, or the company might see investors run far away.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers.

268,UAA,"Though we’ve seen plenty of marquee names put out quarterly earnings reports already in this calendar Q2 — with Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report)due after the closing bell this afternoon — there are still a large amount of well-known firms having reported in Tuesday’s pre-market. UnderArmour (UAA  -  Free Report), Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report), Archer Daniels Midland (ADM  -  Free Report), among others, hit the tape this morning.We also see new econ datas this morning and on the horizon, including Personal Income and Spending reads.

In other words, a full plate of data to help move the needle for investors in the hours and days ahead.The June read for Personal Income and Spending was a disappointment: unchanged from the previous month, which itself was bumped down from 0.4% to 0.3% from its initial reported number. Analysts had expected another +0.4% in income growth. Spending came in as expected: +0.1% for June. These figures continue to show the lag between production and wage growth continues, keeping prices lower for longer, including employee salaries, while spending remained constant.Specialty retailer UnderArmour outperformed expectations in its Q2, posting a loss much narrower on the bottom line than expected: -3 cents per share compared to -6 cents. Quarterly sales of $1.088 billion also beat expectations of $1.075 billion.

They’ve since rebounded, as the company’s restructuring initiatives (worth $130 million) look to make notable improvements in its longer-term plans.Pfizer reported a mixed Q2 this morning, beating estimates on the bottom line by 2 cents to 67 cents per share, but once again coming up short on the revenue side, $12.9 billion compared to the $13.0 billion in the Zacks consensus. However, earnings guidance for 2017 was raised this morning, though sales guidance stayed pat.Archer Daniels Midland outperformed expectations on its bottom line, posting 57 cents per share as opposed to 52 cents analysts were looking for. This breaks a fairly woeful previous year of earnings, three of four which failed to meet consensus. That said, quarterly sales came in almost a billion dollars light from expectations: $14.94 billion (-4.4% year over year) compared with the $15.84 billion in the estimate.London-based BP (BP  -  Free Report) brought a solid earnings surprise ahead of the opening bell today, reporting 21 cents per share, a full dime higher than the Zacks consensus estimate. However, revenues also fell short of expectations, bringing in $57.37 billion in the quarter compared to the $64.51 billion estimated.

273,UAA,"Cabela's Incorporated , a specialty retailer and direct marketer of hunting, fishing, camping, and related outdoor merchandise, is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 results on Aug 3. In the preceding quarter, the company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 11.1%. Notably, the company’s earnings have lagged the estimate by 10% in three of the trailing four quarters. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.What to Expect?The question lingering in investors’ minds now is whether Cabela's will be able to post positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is 57 cents, reflecting a year-over-year decline of over 3%. We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate witnessed have been stable in the past 30 days. Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $912 million, down 1.9% from the year-ago quarter.We noted that the stock has outperformed the industry in the past six months. The company’s shares have gained 5%, while the industry has witnessed a decline of 9.2%.Factors at PlayCabela’s multi-channel model, next-generation stores and cost-saving initiatives bode well. Moreover, the next-generation stores are outperforming Cabela’s legacy stores in terms of both sales and profit per square foot. We remain optimistic about these store formats as they require less capital investment, while enhancing store productivity and sales per square foot.We believe that the company’s Financial Services Business segment plays an integral role in supporting the merchandising business by encouraging customer loyalty rewards program that provides a boost to revenues, profitability and customer retention at Retail as well as Direct businesses. In the previous quarter, Financial services revenues increased 6.5% to approximately $150 million, reflecting advancement in interest and fee income, primarily offset by an increase in the provisional losses for loans and interest expenses.However, soft economic recovery, deceleration in the sale of sporting goods, along with stiff competition from both brick-and-mortar and eCommerce has made things difficult for Cabela’s, which accepted the buyout offer of Bass Pro Shops. Moreover, dismal top-line performance for the third consecutive quarter is a major concern for the investors.Unlikely to Beat EstimatesOur proven model does not conclusively show that Cabela's is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

274,UAA,"Newell Brands Inc. (NWL  -  Free Report) is slated to report second-quarter 2017 results on Aug 4, before the opening bell. In the previous quarter, the company reported earnings surprise of 17.2%. Notably, in three of the trailing four quarters, the company’s earnings have surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 7.7%.What to Expect?The big question facing investors is whether this global manufacturer and marketer of consumer and commercial products will be able to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is 86 cents, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 10.3%. We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate has witnessed upward revisions in the past 30 days. Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $3,959 million, compared with $3,859 million reported in the prior-year quarter.We note that the stock has outperformed the industry in the past three months. The company’s shares have jumped 13.2%, while the industry has declined 3.2%.Factors Influencing This QuarterNewell’s superb earnings history reflects the splendid performance of its brand as well as Growth Game Plan, ongoing Project Renewal Program and solid acquisitions. The company has also made significant progress on its Growth Game Plan that targets accelerating growth by simplifying and strengthening portfolio.The company’s results in the second quarter are expected to be driven by core sales growth, Project Renewal savings and cost synergies. Further, it remains impressed with global growth and progress with e-commerce advancement. Moreover, the company earlier raised adjusted earnings outlook for 2017, while keeping the other forecasts intact. The raised earnings view reflects the timing of acquisitions and divestitures, and currency impacts. Normalized earnings per share for 2017 are anticipated in the range of $3.00–$3.20, compared with $2.95−$3.15 guided earlier.In first-quarter 2017, Newell made significant progress strengthening portfolio by completing six transactions in and just after the end of the quarter. The company completed two acquisitions including the Sistema food storage business and the WoodWick fragranced candles business, while divesting four businesses, namely tools, consumer storage totes, fire building and fire starting, as well as the rope and chain business.However, the company’s significant global presence exposes it to currency woes. Moreover, intense competition and volatile consumer behavior remain the major threats, given its consumer-focused nature.What Does the Zacks Model Unveil?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Newell Brands is likely to beat on earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

275,UAA,"Investors are always looking for stocks that are poised to beat at earnings season and Under Armour, Inc. (UAA  -  Free Report) may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because Under Armour is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings—with the most up-to-date information possible—is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for UAA in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at a loss of 5 cents per share for UAA, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 6 cents per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for UAA, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +16.67% heading into earnings season.Under Armour, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Under Armour, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Under Armour, Inc. QuoteWhy is this Important?A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market.

In the trailing four quarters, the company’s earnings have outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate with an average of 20.8%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.What to Expect?The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter is pegged at a loss of 6 cents compared  to earnings of 1 cent reported in the year-ago period. Furthermore, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 is pegged at 42 cents, down nearly 28% from 2016. Notably, the estimates have remained stable in the last 30 days. Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $1,075 million for the said quarter, up about 7.4% from the year-ago quarter.Under Armour forms part of the Consumer Discretionary sector that is currently placed at bottom 44% of the Zacks classified sectors (9 out of 16). Per the Earnings Outlook, total earnings for the sector are expected to decline 1.3%, while revenues are projected to improve 8%. We note that the broader sector has gained 2% in the last three months, underperforming the S&P 500 index’s growth of 4%.What Does the Zacks Model Unveil?Our proven model does not conclusively show earnings beat for Under Armour this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) and a positive Earnings ESP for this to happen.

Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Under Armour, Inc. QuoteUnder Armour has an Earnings ESP of -16.67%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at a loss of 7 cents, wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate loss of 6 cents. Although the company’s Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP but we need a positive Earnings ESP in order to be confident about an earnings surprise.Factors at PlayWe note that Under Armour has been grappling with higher interest expense on account of higher debt level. Evidently, the company’s interest expenses increased to nearly $8 million in the first quarter compared with $5 million in the prior-year quarter. Further, management anticipates interest expenses to rise to roughly $40 million in 2017 from $26.4 million in 2016.Under Armour continues to expect net revenue for 2017 to be nearly $5.4 billion, which represents an increase of 11–12% over the 2016 level. Notably, the company’s revenues grew 22% last year.Moreover, it expects gross margin to be down slightly year over year due to foreign currency headwinds and better performance of footwear as well as international businesses in the overall mix that has lesser margins in comparison with apparel and North American businesses. In fact, due to increase in strategic investments, Under Armour anticipates operating income to decline to nearly $320 million from $420.3 million in 2016.These factors have been well reflected in the company’s stock price performance. Evidently, Under Armour’s shares have plunged over 32% year to date against its industry’s gain of 0.3%. Currently, the industry is placed at top 48% of the Zacks classified industries (122 out of 256).However, on the positive note, Under Armour’s sustained focus on brand development, expansion of direct-to-consumer and technology-based fitness businesses look encouraging.In fact, with increasing consciousness about fitness among people, sports apparel makers are entering into the business of fitness gadgets and other tracking platforms to attract customers. To this end, the company is also taking steps and expanding its reach in the fitness space. Also, its international business is poised for growth.Stocks with Favorable CombinationHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Time Warner Inc.  has an Earnings ESP of +4.24% and a Zacks Rank #2.

277,UAA,"Stocks of sporting goods retailers performed sluggishly yesterday, following Hibbett Sports Inc. (HIBB  -  Free Report) announcement that its comparable store sales (comps) for second-quarter fiscal 2018 may fall as much as 10% due to extremely challenging sales trends. Further, the company indicated that the decline in sales and pressured margins in the quarter, would lead to a loss of 19–22 cents per share.Following the news, shares of Hibbett plunged more than 33%, hitting the 52-week low mark. Moreover, its industry counterparts were also punished with DICK’S Sporting Goods Inc. (DKS  -  Free Report) and Foot Locker Inc. (FL  -  Free Report) falling 5.5% and 4.6%, respectively. In fact, Hibbett’s shares have declined as much as 50.3% in the past three months, wider than the industry’s drop of 12.4%. This can primarily be attributed to the company’s dismal sales surprise history, wherein it has lagged estimates in eight out of the trailing nine quarters.Additionally, the news also hurt athletic equipment and apparel manufacturers including the likes of Nike Inc. (NKE  -  Free Report), Adidas AG and Under Armour Inc. (UAA  -  Free Report). While Nike and Under Armour declined 1.7% and 1.8%, respectively, following the news, Adidas dipped only 0.4%.The news of a tepid second-quarter overshadowed the company’s announcement of launching its eCommerce site, which analysts believe was bit too late. However, the company issued a statement in its defense that it waited to put the necessary infrastructure in place including new distribution center and omni-channel capabilities to provide a seamless customer experience.Hibbett’s eCommerce site will not only provide customers with user-friendly experience but will also offer wide variety of footwear, apparel as well as equipment items to select from. We believe that in an era of challenging retail landscape, this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company’s focus on omni-channel initiatives will help achieve its long-term goal.

278,UAA,"Shares of multiple sporting goods companies were down in morning trading on Monday after Hibbett Sports (HIBB  -  Free Report) announced that it expects a big second quarter drop off in a key sales category.Hibbett, a Birmingham, Alabama-headquartered sporting goods chain, announced today that it projects same-store sales to fall by around 10% in the second-quarter. Shares plummeted more than 30% after the announcement Monday morning, touching a new 52-week low in the process.In a statement, the company cited ""very challenging sales trends"" as a key reason for the predicted drop in same-store sales. Hibbett’s dismal second-quarter forecast has helped send shares of sports chain retailers Foot Locker (FL  -  Free Report) and Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS  -  Free Report) down as well.Shares of Foot Locker were down -4.52% in morning trading and also touched a new 52-week low. The footwear-focused chain has seen its stock price tank since its reported less than stellar first-quarter earnings in May. The company is currently a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Dick's stock fell 3.26% in Monday morning trading, reaching about $1 higher than its intraday and 52-week low by afternoon hours. The company is Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Interestingly, Hibbett’s horrible quarter is forcing the company to get with the times. “Launching an e-commerce site has been a key strategic goal for Hibbett, and we took time to invest in our omni-channel infrastructure to do it the right way,” the company’s president and CEO Jeff Rosenthal said.“Our main objective is to provide a seamless shopping experience for our customers with a platform that will allow us to significantly expand our assortment over time.”However, with Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) snatching up business from retails chains every day, it might be too little too late for the struggling sporting goods chain to try to turn things around online.Luckily for Dick's and Foot Locker, their e-commerce presence is far more established. Still, investors will have to wait a couple more weeks to see how things shake out, as all three companies are projected to report earnings in mid-August.Athletic Footwear & Apparel DipsSome of the world’s biggest athletic gear giants also fell in morning trading on the back of the Hibbett news. Shares of Nike (NKE  -  Free Report) fell by 1.25%, while Under Armour (UAA  -  Free Report) dropped by 1.84%. Adidas’ (ADDYY  -  Free Report) stock dipped only 0.60%. The news has clearly made investors hesitant about the state of the sporting goods market.However, Hibbett’s downturn is not as likely to affect these apparel powers as their retail counterparts, especially in the long run, as the companies have more flexibility to adapt to the shifting retail environment.In fact, shares of Nike had climbed roughly 16% this year until today’s dip. Nike also reached a significant partnership with Amazon in late June. The global sports company’s products could already be purchased on Amazon through third-party sellers, but the new partnership will see Nike become more prominent on Amazon.Bottom LineAs more and more people become focused on health and exercise, it seems unlikely that the sporting goods business will fall apart completely anytime soon. What seems more likely is that sports apparel and retail companies will need to shift their focus online and completely revamp their brick and mortar models.Hibbett’s story is a cautious tale for those that remain stuck in the past for too long.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!                   It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.
