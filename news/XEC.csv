0,XEC,"XExchange traded funds tracking major stock indexes rose on Thursday, led by the energy and financial sectors. Gains in oil, gas and bank stocks came as oil rallied for a third straight day on the heels of an extended slump.Financial Select Sector SPDR (XLF), Energy Select Sector SPDR (XLE) and Industrial Select Sector SDPR (XLI) nudged higher at the opening bell on the stock market today. Their exchange traded fund stablemates investing in other S&P 500 sectors were flat to lower.A rebound in crude prices is giving the beleaguered energy sector a much-needed boost this week. XLE is eyeing its first weekly gain after three down weeks, but is poised for its third monthly loss in this young year.Early on Thursday, United States Oil (USO) punched up more than 1% to build on a 2.2% surge the prior day. The commodity exchange traded product tracks the price of West Texas Intermediate, or light sweet crude, which approached $50 a barrel in the morning session.The energy sector will have the best growth out of all 11 S&P sectors as earnings finally grow after contracting for two consecutive years, Lindsey Bell, investment strategist at CFRA Research, wrote earlier this month. She expects that cyclical sectors — financials, information technology and materials — will follow energy's lead with double-digit earnings growth in 2017.""They will also largely be the drivers of revenue growth, which is expected to improve to 5.1% in 2017, from less than 3% in 2016,"" Bell wrote.Those three S&P sectors are tracked by XLF, Technology Select Sector SPDR (XLK) and Materials Select Sector SPDR (XLB).In identifying 10 companies with the largest year-over-year profit and revenue growth this year, Bell found only three made both lists: Cimarex Energy (XEC), Chevron (CVX) and Concho Resources (CXO) — all of which are energy companies.All three are S&P 500 oil and gas firms, which means XLE counts them among its 36 holdings.""We would point out that when coming off such a deeply negative base of earnings and revenue growth, like the energy sector is, lofty growth rates are more easily achieved,"" Bell added.ETF investors should keep in mind that sector earnings growth and performance often don't match up. That contrary fact is easily explained — the stock market tends to look ahead rather than look back.XLE was the top-performing sector SPDR ETF in 2016, vaulting 28% despite being the earnings laggard. Investors bet in large part on the turnaround in earnings growth expected this year.The ETF reversed lower Thursday around 10:30 am ET.IBD'S TAKE: As the Trump and Fed agenda emerge, read IBD Leaderboard and The Big Picture every day to assess whether the stock market has more room to run.RELATED:What Is Going On In The ETF Market?Find And Track The Best ETFs

1,XEC,"U.S. stock indexes slouched Tuesday but closed fairly high in the day's trading range.The Nasdaq fell 0.3% after being down almost 0.8%, while the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average whittled off 0.3% and 0.2% respectively. The small cap Russell dropped 0.6%. Volume in the stock market today was lower on the Nasdaq and higher on the NYSE, according to preliminary data.The higher volume on the NYSE may have been related to the energy sector.In the S&P 500,  Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD) fell 3% in volume twice its normal pace. Marathon Oil (MRO) slid 3% in double volume. EOG Resources (EOG) trimmed 0.3% in volume 40% above average. Cimarex Energy (XEC) was little changed, but volume was two-thirds higher than usual. ConocoPhillips (COP) lost 2% in volume 53% higher than usual. Chevron (CVX) dropped 2% in volume 25% greater than average. Halliburton (HAL) fell 2% in volume about 45% above average. Helmerich & Payne (HP) cut 1% in 30% faster turnover. Transocean (RIG) spun 2% lower in volume 30% above average.All of the above stocks are listed on the NYSE. West Texas intermediate crude oil dropped 1% to under $48 a barrel. The price of light sweet crude has dropped in nine of the past 11 sessions, slashing about 12% off the price.IBD'S TAKE: Is the Trump bull market strong enough to do what Reagan's bull market did? And what exactly did it do?In the IBD 50, losers led winners by a 5-2 ratio.Each of the five banking stocks in the Big Cap 20 fell, but volume was below average. The bank sector had been leading the market but recently fell to No. 4 among 33 sectors after months in either the No. 1 or No. 2 spot.On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve will conclude its two-day meeting and announce its decision on interest rates.RELATED:What To Expect When Oracle Reports Quarterly ResultsWill Trump's America First Plan Pump Up This NatGas Stock

2,XEC,"Monday's oil-price surge sent scores of energy-related stocks to new highs. Drilling contractors — one of the earliest industry segments to benefit when an oil cycle turns higher — saw many of the top gains. Unfortunately, most of those stocks are well extended and are still nursing earnings and sales declines weakened by the 2 2 1/2-year oil glut. The…

3,XEC,"The $1.6 billion USAA Growth & Income Fund (USGRX) has picked up steam. Its 13.44% gain this year going into Thursday tops 75% of its large-cap blend rivals tracked by Morningstar Inc. That's better than its 8.53% annual pace over the past three years, which beats 56% of its peers.The fund has received some of its drive from holdings like Applied Materials (AMAT), a semiconductor equipment and software maker that is up 75% year to date and has IBD's top Composite Rating of 99; and smartphone chipmaker Qualcomm (QCOM), which is up 34% this year and has a good 85 Comp Rating.IBD'S TAKE: Chemicals maker FMC, which is up 46% year to date, is another holding helping to drive Growth & Income. FMC's third-quarter earnings per share growth of 60% beat analysts' estimates. As IBD recently reported, it guided for full-year EPS of $2.76 to $2.86 a share, above consensus forecasts for $2.75.One reason for the fund's stronger showing this year is the spark it received from a rally in energy names like Cimarex Energy (XEC) and EOG Resources (EOG).Another reason is that its financial services stocks got a good bump up from the November election, in part on the expectation that the Republican victories would lead to a lighter regulatory burden on banks, says Michael Nayfa, assistant manager of the 40% fund sleeve run by a team from subadvisor Barrow Hanley Mewhinney & Strauss. At the same time, interest rates have been rising in anticipation of the Federal Reserve's rate hike this month. Higher rates have improved banks' net interest margins and profit outlook.For example, SLM (SLM), the private education-loan originator better known as Sallie Mae, is up 70% this year. It gapped up 18% the day after the election, and is up 56% overall since the election. The stock has a sterling 91 Comp Rating.Money center bank Morgan Stanley (MS), with a 96 Comp Rating, is up 36% this year and 27% since the election.The fund's management approach, with two separate sleeves of securities run independently of each other, is a two-heads-are-better-than-one strategy. Basically, it doubles the number of best ideas the fund can have.USAA's John Jares and John Toohey, who run a 60% sleeve, have been making changes since taking the helm of their segment of the fund from a subadvisor on Nov. 20, 2012. Since then, they have employed a more concentrated approach with their sleeve, trimming it to 60-80 names from its prior range of about 130-150, Jares says. And their top 10 holdings now tend to account for 30% to 50% of their sleeve. That's up from 20% or less.The idea is to boost the contribution to fund performance from their best ideas. ""Too much diversification is negative,"" Jares said.Jares and Toohey began their current stake in Applied Materials in Q1 2013, while the semiconductor industry was still under pressure from the financial crisis. Applied had completed a combination with Varian Semiconductor in 2011. After that, Applied began to cut costs, Jares says. ""They also increased R&D and began to get more products through their pipeline,"" Jares said. ""Now they have gained market share since the combination with Varian.""The Barrow Hanley sleeve focuses more on value-oriented stocks than the Jares-Toohey sleeve. That means hefty weights in financials and health care. But the Barrow Hanley sleeve also holds what assistant manager Michael Nayfa calls value technology names. ""Those are stocks that pay high dividend yield, have high free cash flow and that trade at reasonable valuations,"" Nayfa said.Microchip Technology (MCHP), for instance, has a dividend yield of 2.2%. Its shares are up 40% this year and within 2% of its all-time high.""It's a semiconductor company that is predominantly in microprocessors,"" Nayfa said. ""It's gaining market share across the auto and industrial spaces.""Microchip acquired Atmel early this year. ""We like the deal,"" Nayfa said. ""It's a good fit. Atmel gives them a foothold in 32-bit processors, which some (investors) argue they are behind in. This deal can be 20% to 25% accretive to their earnings. Microchip has a proven record of buying and integrating assets. They do a good job at cost synergies. It can be hard to reduce costs without losing business, but they do it.""RELATED:Check Out This Top Mutual Fund's Portfolio

5,XEC,"Stocks gained momentum Thursday, led once again by strong gains by Apple. The largest company in the U.S. by market cap powered 3% higher to 115.19, padding its gains from Wednesday's high-volume breakout.The Nasdaq composite rose 1% while the S&P 500 and Dow industrials climbed 0.6%, shaking off larger-than-expected declines in U.S. retail sales and industrial output. Gains by Goldman Sachs (GS), Chevron (CVX) and Intel (INTC) helped the Dow, though Apple is the big driver.The Russell 2000 gained 0.5%.Apple (AAPL) investors brushed off headlines from telecom giant Verizon (VZ) that its preorders for the iPhone 7 were not as remarkable as the gains seen at rival wireless carriers. Apple, meanwhile, says it's not going to report early numbers on the new iPhone given that it's repeatedly had a tough time meeting overwhelming demand, resulting in supply shortages and skewed short-term figures.While Apple shares are acting the way a good breakout should for now, it's imperative not to chase the stock more than 5% beyond the 110.33 proper buy point, or in other words beyond the 115.85 price level. Buying a stock extended -- say, 10% or 15% above where you should buy a high-growth stock -- can leave you high and dry when the stock decides to stage a normal pullback. Also keep in mind the market uptrend remains under pressure which makes new buys risky.Based on IBD research, in most cases, great stocks in bull markets won't pull back more than 7% to 8% below the proper buy point. So, buying shares at 10% or 15% above the right entry could force you to sell shares based on IBD's golden rule when it's normal to sit tight and be patient because the stock is doing nothing wrong. Roughly four of 10 major stock winners retreat back to or near their proper pivot point before resuming their awesome rallies.Companies believed to supply technology to Apple's iPhone and other products joined the company's rebound. Skyworks Solutions (SWKS), a big winner in 2013-14, gapped up at the open and jumped nearly 6% to 76.61 in fast trading. The stock is still in recovery mode and has been basing since topping out at 112.88 in June last year. Fiscal Q4 earnings are seen slipping 6% to $1.43 a share.In the energy patch, U.S. oil and explorers rebounded a bit, following the lead of crude oil prices as near-term WTI futures gained nearly 1% to $44 a barrel.Cimarex Energy (XEC) is fighting to not only hold gains since a breakout from a long cup with handle at 123.57 but also striving to hold above its steadily rising 50-day moving average. Shares rose nearly 2% to 127.32.Cimarex lost 60 cents a share last year, but is expected to post profits of 61 cents this year and $3.36 in 2017, up 451%. That's what you call a potential classic earnings turnaround.In the IBD 50, 22nd-ranked Alibaba (BABA) stretched its recent rally over the past several sessions, rising 1.5% to 103.96. The stock's rally past a proper 85.10 cup-with-handle entry continues to strengthen. As of Aug. 31, roughly 112 million shares have been sold short in the company, or roughly 11% of the total float.Also in the IBD 50, Gigamon (GIMO) ran ahead 3.8% to 50.09, moving further past stubborn upside resistance near 47. The stock is also acting right after testing support at the key 10-week moving average. The network security specialist ranks No. 3 in the IBD 50 and boasts a 99 Composite Rating from IBD Stock Checkup.RELATED:When Did Apple Shares Break Out?Why Is Gigamon Leading The Stock Market?What Is The ""Platinum Rule"" In Selling Stocks?

Once written off as unrecoverable, these assets have led to a U.S. oil boom.As the U.S. has again become a top oil producer and the world's No. 1 natural gas producer, some in Washington are pushing to lift the ban on U.S. oil exports imposed during oil shortages of the 1970s.Tension with Russia, which supplies energy to much of Europe, has added to calls for lifting the ban and created more buzz in the energy sector.EOG, the biggest company in the group by market cap at $58.3 billion, produces and sells oil and natgas in the U.S. and other countries, including energy-hungry China.Analysts recently have been upbeat on EOG's prospects. Wunderlich Securities upgraded it last month to buy from hold with a 124 price target.""EOG Resources continues to be inventive; after securing acreage in legacy plays such as the Eagle Ford Shale and the Bakken in Williston, the company continues to quietly work its land base,"" Wunderlich said in the report. Williston is the Williston Basin, a petroleum-rich area that stretches over parts of Montana and the Dakotas.Citigroup reiterated a buy rating last month and raised its price target to 115 from 105, citing higher-than-expected oil and natgas production last quarter.EOG shares rose 1.2% in Tuesday stock market trading.Continental Resources (CLR) has posted double-digit profit growth for at least four years. Revenue has risen in double digits six quarters in a row.It boasts a best-possible 99 IBD Composite Rating, meaning it's outperformed 99% of all stocks on key metrics in recent quarters. It's also on the IBD 50 list of top-rated stocks.CEO Harold Hamm said at an energy conference last month that he expects Congress to lift the ban on crude oil exports as early as next year in light of rapidly rising U.S. oil output.Cimarex Energy (XEC) produces mainly in the Midwest and the Permian Basin in Texas. Like EOG, it's seen analyst upgrades recently on strong growth prospects. The stock reflects its growth, with a near-perfect 98 Composite Rating.To boost its capital position as it expands, Cimarex last month sold $750 million worth of senior notes due in 2014, up from its original projection of $600 million.Midland, Texas-based Concho Resources (CXO) has big growth plans. On its Q1 earnings call May 12, CEO Tim Leach told analysts ""We're right on track to achieve our three-year execution goals to ultimately double production in '16.""Later in the month Concho unveiled what it called its ""2 by 3"" plan, an outline for how it intends to double production. One key — it's accelerating shifting production from regular wells to mostly horizontal wells.Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD) rounds out the list. Its employee roster has grown from 2,200 in late 2010 to more than 4,000 early this year and could climb further as the company pursues more opportunities.Pioneer holds rights to about 600,000 gross acres in the Permian Basin and has said that it expects to spend $3 billion this year to accelerate drilling activity, boosting output, revenue and profits.Follow James DeTar on Twitter: @IBD_JDeTar.

128,XEC,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for Cimarex Energy Co (XEC  -  Free Report). Shares have lost about 16.1% in that time frame.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is XEC due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.First-Quarter 2018 ResultsCimarex Energy reported first-quarter 2018 earnings per share of $1.82 that beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.70 and improved from the year-ago $1.05.In the first quarter, Cimarex Energy’s total revenues of $567.1 million surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $562.9 million. The figure also increased from $447.2 million a year ago.The strong first-quarter results were primarily aided by increased production in the Permian Basin and higher oil price realization.Operational HighlightsIn the quarter under review, total average production was 206.1 thousand barrels of oil equivalent (MBOE) per day, jumped 16.3% year over year. Oil volumes increased 25% year over year to 65.2 thousand barrels per day (MBbls/d) and natural gas volumes rose 9.7% to 534.7 MMcf. Natural gas liquids (NGL) volumes improved 18% to 51.7 MBbls/d. Higher activities in both the Mid-Continent area and the Permian Basin led to the improvement.Year-over-year realized prices for natural gas declined 24.3% to $2.28 per thousand cubic feet but realized prices for crude surged 25.6% to $59.93 per barrel. The price of NGL decreased a marginal 1% to $20.19 per barrel.As of Mar 31, 2018, a total of 54 gross (15 net) wells were brought online by the company, significantly lower than 70 gross (26 net) wells as of Mar 31, 2017.Financial ConditionCimarex Energy had cash and cash equivalents of $463.8 million as of Mar 31, 2018. Net long-term debt was $1.5 billion as of Mar 31, 2018, which represents a debt-to-capitalization ratio of 34.9%.Cimarex Energy's net cash from operating activities was recorded at $383.1 million, higher than $249.5 million in the prior-year quarter. Through the January-to-March quarter, the firm spent $313 million on operations related to exploration and production. Cimarex allocated roughly $264 million of the total amount to drilling and completion work. The company financed the entire amount through operating cashflows.GuidanceThe company has maintained its total production projection for 2018 in the range of 211-221 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (MBoe/d). Cimarex Energy also projects production through the April-to-June quarter between 200 MBoe/d and 209 MBoe/d.The company reiterated its capital spending for 2018 between $1.6 billion and $1.7 billion.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates.

129,XEC,"With releases from 409 S&P 500 members, the Q1 earnings season is at its tail end. The companies recorded year-over-year earnings growth of 24% on 9.3% higher revenues.Around 78% of the S&P 500 companies surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings, while 75.6% beat revenue estimates. Notably, 63.3% surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for both earnings and revenues.Energy to Outperform OthersThe elite S&P 500 index is expected to see year-over-year earnings growth of 23.2% in Q1. This growth estimate represents the January to March quarter as a whole, including the companies that have already reported results and have yet to report earnings.Energy will likely be the key sector backing the index’s outperformance. Excluding Energy, earnings of S&P 500 are expected to decline to 21.5% from 23.2%. In fact, the latest Earnings Preview shows that Energy will outshine all sectors with earnings growth of 73.9%.Favorable Oil Supports EnergyThe favorable crude pricing scenario primarily supported Energy’s outperformance. For the first three months of 2018, oil traded at an average monthly price of $63.70, $62.23, and $62.73 per barrel, respectively. The average monthly price of the commodity never touched $60 through 2015 to 2017. It was the production cut extension deal by the OPEC players through 2018-end that mainly drove the rally in crude.The fate of all the energy players is related to the movement of oil price. Exploration and production companies will likely gain from the crude rally. Also, drillers and oilfield service companies are expected to gain more contacts from explorers. Midstream energy companies, engaged in transporting and storing of oil and refined petroleum products, will likely record more fee-based revenues from shippers transporting the increased production.It is to be noted that for January and February of 2018, crude production in the domestic field was recorded at 310,138 thousand barrels and 287,379, respectively — representing a year-over-year improvement from 273,673 and 253,623.Oil Stocks to WatchWe have chosen four energy players gearing up to report first-quarter 2018 results on May 8.Headquartered in Denver, CO, Cimarex Energy Co.

130,XEC,"Callon Petroleum Company (CPE  -  Free Report) recently announced the upsizing of a senior notes offering. The principal amount of the senior unsecured notes has been bumped up from $300 million to $400 million. The notes offering, which has been priced recently, will likely conclude on Jun 7.The notes are being offered to a few private investors. The upstream energy player will likely utilize a part of the proceeds from the offering to finance part of the Delaware Basin asset acquisition from Cimarex Energy Co (XEC  -  Free Report). The funds are also likely to be used to pay off the loan taken under a senior secured revolving credit account. The balance is expected to be spent on normal corporate activities.On May 24, Callon signed an accord with Cimarex to purchase the upstream assets for a cash consideration of $570 million. The transaction will probably conclude on or before Sep 10. If the deal fails, net proceeds from the notes offering will be allocated for financing part of the company’s oil and gas exploration and production operations and also for normal corporate work and preferred stock redemption.Headquartered in Natchez, MS, Callon is a leading oil and natural gas explorer with prime focus on the Permian Basin.Meanwhile, the stock price chart of the company fails to make a statement.

131,XEC,"It was a week where oil prices slumped below $70-a-barrel. However, natural gas futures edged closer to the psychologically important $3 level.On the news front, energy major Royal Dutch Shell plc (RDS.A  -  Free Report) made a significant discovery in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, while natural gas exporter Cheniere Energy, Inc. (LNG  -  Free Report) took the final investment decision to construct a third liquefication unit at its Corpus Christi export terminal in Texas.Overall, it was a mixed week for the sector. While West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures lost about 4.9% to close at $67.88 per barrel, natural gas prices rose some 3.2% to $2.939 per million Btu (MMBtu). (See the last ‘Oil & Gas Stock Roundup’ here: TOTAL's Oman MOU, Rex Energy's Bankruptcy & More)The U.S. oil benchmark posted its first weekly loss in almost a month on fears of supply increase, bearish EIA inventory numbers, and soaring rig count.Oil futures fell after reports emerged that Saudi Arabia and Russia were in discussion to step up output amid reduced supply from Iran and Venezuela.The commodity was also spooked by the federal government’s EIA report that revealed crude stockpiles climbed by 5.8 million barrels, contrary to market expectations for 1.7 million barrels decline. On a further bearish note, the report revealed that U.S. output edged up 2,000 barrels per day last week to nearly 10.73 million barrels per day – the most since the EIA started maintaining weekly data in 1983.Data showing the number of U.S. oil rigs climbing – this time by 15, the most in more than three months – brought further downside.Meanwhile, natural gas prices moved northward last week. Apart from the weekly inventory release showing a smaller-than-expected increase in natural gas supplies, the commodity got a leg up from warm weather forecasts.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    Royal Dutch Shell recently discovered a large deepwater well in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico (GoM), providing a breather to the offshore oil industry of the United States, which has been gasping for breath since the crude downturn. The Dover well — in the Norphlet geologic play in the U.S. GoM — marks the sixth oil and natural gas find that Shell has struck in the region.The company has been focusing on exploration opportunities in the prolific Norphlet play, which will be moored by its multibillion-dollar offshore project Appomattox, production from which is expected to commence before 2019 end.The Dover well, drilled in Mississippi Canyon about 170 miles offshore southeast of New Orleans, is located in 7,500 feet of water. It was drilled to a depth of 29,000 feet vertically. The prospect lies 13 miles from the Appomattox project that was completed and launched into GoM earlier this month. The new discovery is thus poised for further drilling and development through potential tiebacks to Appomattox rather than building new platforms, which will in turn result in cost savings for the company.Notably, Appomattox is the first major deepwater project authorized by Shell since the oil slump. In fact, since then only two other projects — namely Mad Dog Phase 2 and Vito — have been going forward in the Gulf platforms. (Read more Offshore Industry Gets Respite from Shell's New GoM Find)2.    Cheniere Energy recently gave its final approval regarding the construction of its third liquefaction unit or Train 3 at its Corpus Christi export terminal in Texas. The approval of the project marks the first final investment decision on the new LNG project in the United States since 2015. Building of the third train will be handed over to contractor Bechtel Oil, Gas and Chemicals, Inc., which had started with its initial construction in late 2017.Notably, under the Corpus Christi LNG project, the company intends to develop three trains each having a nominal production capacity of 4.5 million metric tons per year of LNG. The first two trains are expected to come online next year.However, the cost and timeline of the third train has not yet been disclosed and its construction is likely to take around four years. Cheniere’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Cheniere Corpus Christi Holdings has credit facilities worth $6.1 billion, which are likely to be utilized to finance a portion of the construction and operation of the trains.Further, Cheniere Energy intends to develop seven midscale liquefaction trains adjacent to the Corpus Christi project. The company has also initiated the regulatory approval process regarding the same. The total production capacities of these trains are expected to be approximately 9.5 million tons per annum. (Read more Cheniere Green Lights Train 3 of Corpus Christi Project)3.    Halliburton Company (HAL  -  Free Report) recently inked the unconventional gas stimulation services three-year contract with Saudi Aramco, in a bid to unleash a natural gas revolution in Saudi Arabia. Per the deal, the oilfield services major will provide project management, hydraulic fracturing and well intervention services to meet Saudi Aramco’s production targets and improve the economics of its unconventional resources program. The program mainly covers three regions, namely Northern Kingdom, South Ghawar and Jafurah Basin.Though Saudi Aramco is the world’s top exporter of oil, Saudi Arabia also has a huge natural gas potential, holding the world’s fifth-largest gas reserves. By 2026, the government aims to produce some 651 billion cubic meters of natural gas per day -- almost double its current output.However, much of it is difficult to recover from shale rock and tight sand. Hence, the company intends to utilize Halliburton’s specialized technological services to tap into those resources.The contract will boost Saudi Aramco’s efforts to spur natural gas production for meeting the domestic needs as well as shoring up its evolving chemical industry, by providing the essential raw materials. The state-run company also intends to reduce its practice of burning oil for domestic power, thus freeing up more barrels for exports. Notably, over the past year, Saudi Aramco has awarded $4.5 billion worth contracts to international oil service companies, for increasing the country’s gas output.4.    Cimarex Energy Company (XEC  -  Free Report) has inked a purchase and sale agreement with Callon Petroleum Company to divest oil and gas properties located in Ward County, TX. The sale is expected to raise cash proceeds of about $570 million.Production from these properties, majority of which has been derived from the Bone Spring formation, is about 6,831 barrels of oil equivalent per day (73% oil). Net Wolfcamp acreage of about 18,925 is undeveloped. The transaction is likely to close in the third quarter of 2018.This sale reflects Cimarex Energy’s strategy to consistently upgrade and optimize its portfolio. Cimarex Energy was among the first horizontal operators in the Bone Spring formation in Ward County. The area has delivered good returns over the years. However, the remaining Wolfcamp prospects require more capital compared with other projects. (Read more Cimarex Energy to Divest Ward County Assets for $570M)5.    Enterprise Products Partners L.P. (EPD  -  Free Report) has signed a natural gas liquids (NGL) transportation deal with Apache Corp. (APA  -  Free Report).Per the accord, the Shin Oak pipeline of Enterprise Products will likely be utilized by Apache for carrying NGL from the Alpine High project to the storage facility of the partnership in Mont Belvieu, TX.In the Delaware Basin’s Alpine High discovery, Apache’s presence spreads over 336,000 net acres. The company is willing to transport all produced NGL from the resources through the Shin Oak pipeline. The partnership has committed to transport at least 205,000 barrels of NGL daily through the pipeline.Investors should know that the Shin Oak pipeline, which is being built by Enterprise Products, will spread over roughly 658 miles to the NGL fractionation and storage unit in Mont Belvieu, TX, from Reeves County. The construction of the Shin Oak pipeline will likely close by the second quarter of 2019. Enterprise Products projects the initial daily liquid transportation capacity of the pipeline at 550,000 barrels.The latest transportation commitment will likely provide Enterprise Products with steady fee-based revenues. Apache will also gain as the pipeline will help the company to persistently transport its growing production from the prospective Alpine High prospect.(Read more Enterprise Products, Apache Sign NGL Transportation Accord)Price PerformanceThe following table shows the price movement of some the major oil and gas players over the past week and during the last 6 months.CompanyLast Week Last 6 MonthsXOM-3.2%-4.3%CVX-4.4%+4.3%COP-5.9%+28.7%OXY-3.5%+17.9%SLB-7.7%+10.4%RIG-10.1%+23.6%VLO-1.5%+42.5%MPC-3.2%+34.3%Reflecting the week’s negative oil market sentiment, the Energy Select Sector SPDR – a popular way to track energy companies – generated a -4.5% return last week.

140,XEC,"""In a rangebound energy tape, many stocks still can do very well, as happened during the nine-month period from September 2012 to June 2013. During this period, the group was down 3% but eight E&Ps that we follow were up 10% or more, with the best performing stock (COG) up 55%.""

141,XEC,"These analysts are probably very right about being very selective in the E&P space. One of the strongest clues you can use is the Zacks Rank. When it turns back up from the cellar, you'll know the analysts went to far and bargains are being sought.

146,XEC,"Investors are always looking for stocks that are poised to beat at earnings season and Cimarex Energy Co (XEC  -  Free Report) may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because Cimarex Energy is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings—with the most up-to-date information possible—is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for XEC in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at $1.40 per share for XEC, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.39 per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for XEC, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +0.54% heading into earnings season.Cimarex Energy Co Price and EPS Surprise Cimarex Energy Co Price and EPS Surprise | Cimarex Energy Co QuoteWhy is this Important?A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market.

147,XEC,"BP plc (BP  -  Free Report) is expected to report fourth-quarter 2017 earnings on Feb 6, before the opening bell. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 14%. Also, the company was able to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in three of the prior four quarters, the average positive surprise being 26.8%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Which Way Are Estimates Treading?Let’s look at the estimate revisions in order to get a clear picture of what analysts expect from the company’s upcoming earnings release.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter earnings of 66 cents has been stable in the last seven days. It reflects year-over-year growth of 407.7%.BP p.l.c. Price and EPS Surprise  BP p.l.c. Price and EPS Surprise | BP p.l.c. Quote Factors to ConsiderFollowing the ongoing ramp up of key upstream developments, BP expects production to increase sequentially in the October-to-December quarter.Also, the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude increased almost 20% in the October-to-December quarter of 2017, per The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA). Through most of November and the entire December, the commodity traded above the $55-per-barrel psychological mark. The extension of the production cut deal by OPEC players supported the rally in crude. On Nov 30, 2017, OPEC members met non-OPEC players to decide on an extension of the crude production cut accord, first signed in late 2016, beyond the first quarter of 2018. More than 20 oil producers, including leading exporters like Russia and Saudi Arabia, participated in the meeting. As expected by most analysts, all crude exporters decided to extend the deal through 2018-end. Saudi Arabia, Russia and their allies have pledged to put 1.8 million barrels a day of crude oil out of the market through the end of this year.The improvement in oil price along with higher expected quarterly production by the company will likely fetch BP impressive profits from upstream business.However, for fourth-quarter 2017, the company expects refining margin to decline sequentially owing to turnaround activities.  Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that BP is likely to beat estimates this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below.  Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is 0.00%.

Last quarter, Weatherford received operating income from this region against a loss in the year-ago quarter. Growing market share in this region will drive the company’s revenues in the fourth quarter.

(XEC  -  Free Report) is set to report third-quarter 2017 results on Nov 7, after the closing bell.Last quarter, this upstream energy player posted a positive earnings surprise of 11.6%. Moreover, Cimarexdelivered an average positive earnings surprise of 11.9% for the last four quarters.Which Way Are the Estimates Headed?Let’s take a look at the estimate revision trend in order to get a clear picture of analyst opinion on the stock before the earnings release.The Zacks Consensus Estimate of 98 cents for third-quarter earnings has been revised upward over the last 30 days, with 14 firms being bullish and seven firms taking a bearish stance. The consensus estimate reflects a year-over-year rise of almost 138%.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that Cimarex is likely to beat earnings because it has the right combination of two key ingredients.Zacks ESP: Cimarex’s Earnings ESP is +0.01%. A favorable ESP serves as a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.       Zacks Rank: Cimarex currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Note that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings estimates.  Conversely, Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement.The combination of Cimarex’s Zacks Rank #3 and +0.01% ESP makes us reasonably optimistic of an earnings beat.  What’s Driving the Better-than-Expected Earnings?The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total production stands at 1,138 million cubic feet equivalent (Mmcfe/d), higher than 947 Mmcfe/d in the comparable quarter last year.  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for natural gas realized price is pegged at $2.74 per Mcf compared with $2.66 in third-quarter 2016. Moreover, the estimate for realized oil price stands at $44.26 a barrel, up from $40.54 in the year-earlier quarter. Hence, higher expected natural gas equivalent production amid a favorable gas and oil pricing scenario should support the company’s business.Cimarex has no current debt while long-term debt has been contracting steadily since 2017, reflecting balance sheet strength.  Q3 Price OutperformanceDuring the quarter, Cimarex has rallied 20.9%, outperforming the industry’s 5% gain.      Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are some other companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Denbury Resources Inc.

According to the latest Earnings Trends, total earnings for these energy firms are up 253.9% from the same period last year on 33.5% higher revenues; 50% of the companies have reported positive earnings surprises so far; with 50% beating revenue estimates.Moreover, our report shows that energy is the only sector among the 16 representing the S&P 500 index to witness triple-digit earnings growth in Q3.Hence, it is time for investors to add energy stocks with strong growth potential to their portfolio.Crude Turns Around in Q3As per macrotrends, The West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude saw a 12.2% gain during the third quarter of 2017 after two consecutive quarters of decline this year. Notably, this is the highest quarterly gain since the April-to-June quarter of 2016.According to The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), average monthly prices for each month of Q3 2017 were higher than the year-ago comparable period. Lower global crude inventory helped ease the crude supply glut concern which primarily supported the oil price rally in the third quarter.Oversupply Concerns Ease in Q3Per the EIA, during the July-to-September quarter of this year, worldwide oil inventories declined by 500,000 barrels per day (B/D). With this, the inventory level fell for three quarters in a row.According to The Oil & Gas Journal, Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) produced an average of 32.9 million B/D in the third quarter as compared to last November’s 33.4 million B/D. Thus, it can be safely concluded that the leading crude exporter’s landmark production cut deal primarily supported the draws in global crude inventory.Oil Rebound Drives Performance   Major oilfield service firms have reported healthy Q3 numbers so far. Schlumberger Limited’s (SLB  -  Free Report) third-quarter 2017 earnings of 42 cents per share (excluding charges and credits) were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The bottom line improved from the year-earlier adjusted figure of 25 cents.Another leading oilfield service player, Halliburton Company (HAL  -  Free Report), reported better-than-expected profit in the third quarter. The company’s income from continuing operations came in at 42 cents per share, above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 38 cents — the thirteenth consecutive quarter of outperformance. Moreover, revenues of $5,444 million beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5,318.9 million.On top of that, key upstream energy player Range Resources Corporation (RRC  -  Free Report) reported third-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings of 5 cents per share which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 2 cents. Notably, the company had incurred a loss of 6 cents in the year-ago quarter.Hence, it is clear that the promising Q3 crude pricing environment supported the top and bottom-line performance of key energy companies.Let’s Focus on Growth Energy StocksSince crude determines the fate of energy companies, the favorable oil price scenario will support Q3 numbers for energy firms that are yet to report results.However, choosing the right stocks is quite an uphill task. With the help of our proprietary screening criteria, we have shortlisted four energy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy). These stocks have a Growth Style Score of A or B.Growth stocks, as the name suggests, offer higher growth potential to investors compared to other stocks in the same category. A primary attribute of growth stocks is that these prefer to invest profits in capital growth projects to develop products and technologies rather than paying dividends.In particular, our Growth Style Score condenses all the essential metrics from a company’s financial statements to get a true sense of the quality and sustainability of its growth. Our research shows that stocks with a Growth Style Score of A or B, when combined with a favorable Zacks Rank, offer the best investment opportunities in the growth investing space.Headquartered in Irving, TX, Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM  -  Free Report) is the world’s largest publicly traded oil company.

152,XEC,"One thing the oil market downturn has taught investors: nobody has much visibility into the future. So, when you think of something as a clear line of sight one quarter, it can soon be overshadowed by an unforeseen event.To sum up, even as crude prices continue to make their way up, world oil supply remains in a glut and is likely to remain so through 2017. This might make any oil price strength short-lived.Regardless of the commodity’s price movement though, one oil-producing region that continues to attract investors is the low-cost Permian Basin spread over west Texas and New Mexico. According to some estimates, the region – that has been churning out crude continuously for nearly 100 years – has produced in excess of 30 billion barrels of oil since output began in 1921. Incredibly, despite that impressive output history, analysts maintain that its best days are yet to come. In fact, Permian Basin is key to the studies that say the United States has now overtaken industry giants Saudi Arabia and Russia in recoverable oil reserves.Permian Basin: A Hot Area for Producers   A sedimentary basin lying underneath the western part of Texas and the south-eastern part of New Mexico, the Permian Basin Shale covers roughly 75,000 square miles, almost half the size of California.Experts say that it’s cheaper to drill and complete oil wells in the Permian Basin, as compared to most other major fields. Moreover, there are certain parts of the shale play whose well-returns are the best in the U.S. With crude prices still down significantly from their 2014 levels, well returns have become a very important metric to gauge profitability.Permian’s attractive economics means that producers can still make money there at the current, $50-a-barrel price. This is mainly because of the region's extensive pipeline infrastructure, plentiful labor and supplies, and relatively warm winters that makes year-round work possible. Most other domestic share regions need prices above $60 to support new developments and expansions.As a result, the Permian currently constitutes the lion’s share of the industry's recovery. In 2016, more than a third of the total amount spent on all U.S. deals was spent on Permian land purchases and leases. No other major oil region in the country came close to this activity.Permian Deals GaloreIn January, ExxonMobil Corp. (XOM  -  Free Report) announced its intention to more than double its Permian Basin resource of 6 billion barrels of oil equivalent. The company aims to achieve this through the buyout of companies owned by the Bass family of Fort Worth, TX. Alongside an upfront payment of $5.6 billion, ExxonMobil will make a series of additional contingent cash payments of up to $1 billion. (Read: Exxon Mobil to Buy Bass Family Assets, Double Permian Yield.)Also, Noble Energy Inc. entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Clayton Williams Energy Inc. in a bid to expand its footprint in the Permian Basin. The transaction is worth $3.2 billion, post Noble Energy’s assumption of Clayton Williams’ net debt of $500 million. (Read: Noble Energy to Acquire Clayton Williams for $3.2B.)In February, Parsley Energy Inc. entered into an agreement with Double Eagle Energy Permian, LLC to acquire certain assets in the oil-rich Permian basin for $2.8 billion. (Read: Parsley Inks Permian Acquisition Deal, Updates Guidance)Toward the end March, Marathon Oil Corporation (MRO  -  Free Report) bought additional Permian Basin acreage for $700 million in cash. The followed the company’s decision to acquire 70,000 net acres in the lucrative region for $1.1 billion just weeks before. (Read: Marathon Inks Deal to Expand in the Permian Basin)According to analysts, deals of this nature could push up the value of the group as a whole. With its relatively low break-even cost, the Permian Basin is likely to attract more transactions of this nature in the near future. Also, with their new-found confidence, companies could soon be venturing into other oil rich areas. The new administration has already indicated that it would likely review regulations limiting drilling activities in Alaska and in other parts of the United States.Meanwhile, late last year, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) announced that it has discovered the biggest deposit of untapped oil in the U.S., located in the Wolfcamp shale formation in the Midland Basin portion of Permian Basin. (Read: USGS Just Discovered the Biggest Shale Oil Field in America.)Permian Basin Oil Stocks in FocusWith the hectic pace of land grab set to continue in the Permian basin and investor’s strong appetite for stocks focused in that region, we present five companies that investors should watch out for.Founded in 1954, Houston, TX-based Apache Corp. (APA  -  Free Report) is one of the world's leading independent energy companies engaged in the exploration, development and production of natural gas, crude oil and natural gas liquids. In particular, Apache’s recent Alpine High discovery in Delaware sub-basin, a section of the Permian, is expected to be a gamechanger for the company. Estimated to hold massive oil and natural gas reserves, the wells are said to have strong economics and top-tier returns.Second on the list is Pioneer Natural Resources Co. (PXD  -  Free Report). An independent oil and gas exploration and production company based in Irving, TX, Pioneer’s growth continues to be focused on the Permian operations. Its world-class assets in the region is likely to see year-over-year production growth of 30% in 2017.Denver, CO-based Resolute Energy Corp. (REN  -  Free Report) is another independent oil and gas finder in the U.S. with primary focus on its Permian Basin properties. Divided into the Appaloosa and Mustang project areas in Reeves County in the Delaware Basin, Resolute Energy’s Permian Basin drilling program continue to deliver compelling results. Second quarter production from the properties jumped an astounding 227% year-over-year, contributing meaningfully to cash flows.Next on our focus list is Cimarex Energy Co. (XEC  -  Free Report), an energy explorer with its exploration and production activities taking place primarily in two areas: the Permian Basin and the Mid-Continent region. The Denver, CO-headquartered entity is set to invest more than 60% of its exploration and development expenses in the Permian region this year and hopes to bring 61 net wells online.Finally, we have Tulsa, OK-based independent oil and gas operator WPX Energy Inc. (WPX  -  Free Report). Shifting its portfolio from Colorado's Piceance Basin to Permian’s Delaware basin, the company owns around 135,000 net acres in the oil-rich area. WPX Energy entered the Permian Basin in 2015 following the $2.75 billion acquisition of privately held RKI Exploration, gaining 92,000 net acres in the prolific play. Importantly, the company’s acreage acquisition cost at that time was much lower than current levels, providing further impetus to its returns.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!                   It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

153,XEC,"A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Cimarex Energy Co (XEC  -  Free Report). Shares have lost about 6.7% in that time frame.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is XEC due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Fourth-Quarter 2017 ResultsCimarex Energy reported fourth-quarter 2017 earnings of $1.47 per share that beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.39. In the fourth quarter of 2016, the company had reported earnings per share of 60 cents. The improvement is mainly attributable to increased production as well as higher oil and liquids price realizations.In the fourth quarter, Cimarex Energy’s total revenues of $550.9 million surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $532 million. The figure also increased from $382.2 million a year ago.Operational HighlightsIn the quarter under review, total production averaged 1,204.4 million cubic feet equivalent (MMcfe) per day, up 25.5% year over year. Oil volumes increased 35.6% year over year to 61.8 thousand barrels per day (MBbls/d) and natural gas volumes rose 16.8% to 534 MMcf. Natural gas liquids (NGL) volumes improved 30.8% to 50 MBbls/d.Year-over-year realized prices for natural gas decreased 9.1% to $2.60 per thousand cubic feet but realized prices for crude oil and NGL increased 15.7% and 42.6% to $51.68 per barrel and $25.88 per barrel, respectively, in the reported quarter.As of Dec 31, 2017, a total of 91 gross (34 net) wells were awaiting completion compared with a total of 55 gross (25 net) wells as of Dec 31, 2016.Financial ConditionCimarex Energy had cash and cash equivalents of $400.5 million as of Dec 31, 2017 compared with $652.9 million as of Dec 31, 2016. Long-term debt was $1.5 billion as of Dec 31, 2017, which represents a debt-to-capitalization ratio of 36.7%.Cimarex Energy's net cash from operating activities was $340.8 million compared with $185.1 million in the prior-year quarter. The company invested $1.28 billion for exploration and development during 2017, which exceeded the company's estimate of $1.2 billion. It was primarily funded with cash flow from operations and cash in hand. Reserves ReplacementAt the end of 2017, oil and gas proved reserves were 3.4 trillion cubic feet equivalent (Tcfe), up 16% year over year. In 2016, the company added 941 billion cubic feet equivalent (Bcfe) resulting in reserve replacement of 211% of the 2017 production. Proved developed reserves increased 21% to 2.8 Tcfe.GuidanceTotal production for 2018 is estimated in the range of 211-221 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (MBoe/d), up 14% from the midpoint of 2017 production levels. Oil production is expected to grow 21-26% in 2018, while oil production in fourth quarter of 2018 is estimated to grow 29-34% year over year.Total production for first-quarter 2018 is projected to average 198-207 MBoe per day, up 3% from the fourth-quarter 2017 level, while natural gas and NGL is expected to remain flat.For 2018, capital investment for exploration and development has been estimated in the range of $1.6-$1.7 billion, of which $1.3-$1.4 billion will be for drilling and completion. The capital spending is up 29% from 2017 levels. Of the total, 70% is allocated for the Permian, while 30% is allocated for the Mid-Continent.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?It turns out, fresh estimates have trended downward during the past month. There have been four revisions higher for the current quarter compared to seven lower.Cimarex Energy Co Price and Consensus  Cimarex Energy Co Price and Consensus | Cimarex Energy Co QuoteVGM ScoresAt this time, XEC has a great Growth Score of A, though it is lagging a lot on the momentum front with a C. The stock was also allocated a grade of C on the value side, putting it in the middle 20% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of B. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.Based on our scores, the stock is more suitable for growth investors than those looking for value and momentum.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. Interestingly, XEC has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.

154,XEC,"Crude OilWe are almost at the last leg of 2016, a year that was marked by unprecedented energy market volatility.The Story So FarThe year started on a disappointing note with crude prices falling to a 12-year low of $26.21 a barrel in Feb as investors worried about the oversupplied market. The commodity’s collapse threatened the industry’s creditworthiness by hurting cash flows, drying up liquidity and pummeling producer profit margins.However, indications that supply was easing helped oil prices rebound to $50/barrel mark in early Jun. The surge was driven by outages in Nigeria, Libya, Venezuela and Canada – countries that hold some of the world’s major sources of crude. The upward pressure in oil prices also reflected the U.S. Energy Department's inventory releases that showed crude stockpile builds turning into draws. Things were further helped by a continued decline in U.S. crude production.With factors like Canadian wildfires, Nigerian outages/disruptions, production issues in Venezuela and a strike by Kuwaiti oil workers vanishing from the market, oil slipped back under $40 in the first week of Aug. A glut of refined products also kept the commodity under pressure.The volatility in oil prices continued with the benchmark touching the $50 threshold again early Oct, buoyed by government figures that continued to show large drawdowns, while investors betted on commitments by Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (or OPEC) and non-OPEC players to slash production targets.When divisions in the cartel became apparent and the future of the ambitious OPEC announcement looked more and more uncertain, the commodity fell back under $45 only to receive a booster shot.The OPEC DealIn a bold but not unexpected move, the OPEC cartel agreed on Nov 30 to reduce production starting next month. Seen as a desperate bid to put a floor on falling oil prices, the group – led by Saudi Arabia – promised to take 1.2 million barrels a day out of the market.OPEC's decision to cut oil production was not totally surprising though the magnitude of reduction were deeper than many analysts had expected. The move aims to trim output to 32.5 million barrels per day -- at the low end of a preliminary agreement struck in September.Russia, which is not part of the body that pumps a third of the world’s oil, will also join output cuts for the first time in 15 years. The biggest supplier outside the bloc relented from its longstanding position of only freezing production and agreed to cut 300,000 barrels from its record high output of more than 10 million barrels a day.Oil Prices & Stocks SurgeThe OPEC deal had a massive impact on the energy markets, sending crude prices back above $50 a barrel. While the entire sector is roaring higher since the announcement, the independent oil explorers and producers – whose revenues are directly associated with crude price – have been among the best performing stocks. In fact, shares of oil finders like Whiting Petroleum Corp. (WLL), Oasis Petroleum Inc. (OAS) and Marathon Oil Corp. (MRO) have exploded higher and climbed to new multi-month highs.Certain Factors Still LingerDespite OPEC’s success in reaching an output deal, the oil sector is by no means out of the woods.The commodity is facing heat on several other fronts. Perhaps most important pertains to the mounting worries about China’s crude demand. In particular, the Asian giant’s currency devaluation has stoked speculation about soft economic growth in the world’s No. 2 energy consumer.What’s more, the resilience of North American shale suppliers to keep pumping irrespective of prices and concerns over the effects of Brexit on crude demand means that not much upside is expected in prices in the near term. Moreover, a stronger dollar has made the greenback-priced crude more expensive for investors holding foreign currency. Stronger focus on cleaner energy and weakness in industrial production worldwide are also holding back oil consumption.As it is, with inventories near the upper limit of the average range for this time of year, crude is very well stocked and it still looks like the commodity is in an environment of excess supply. Therefore, while the OPEC-driven rally is likely to drive up prices by a few dollars, it certainly can’t be termed a seismic event.Our ViewIn our view, crude prices in the next few months are likely to exhibit a sideways-to-bullish trend, mostly trading in the $50-$55 per barrel range. As North American supply remains strong and demand looks underwhelming, oil is likely to maintain its low trajectory throughout at least the first half of 2017.Natural GasOver the last few years, a quiet revolution has been reshaping the energy business in the U.S. The success of ‘shale gas’ – natural gas trapped within dense sedimentary rock formations or shale formations – has transformed domestic energy supply, with a potentially inexpensive and abundant new source of fuel for the world’s largest energy consumer.With the advent of hydraulic fracturing (or ""fracking"") – a method used to extract natural gas by blasting underground rock formations with a mixture of water, sand and chemicals – shale gas production is now booming in the U.S. Coupled with sophisticated horizontal drilling equipment that can drill and extract gas from shale formations, the new technology is being hailed as a breakthrough in U.S. energy supplies, playing a key role in boosting domestic natural gas reserves. As a result, once faced with a looming deficit, natural gas is now available in abundance.Prices Fell to 17-Year Lows Earlier in 2016With production from the major shale plays remaining strong and the commodity’s demand failing to keep pace with this supply surge, natural gas prices hit 17-year lows of around $1.6 per million British thermal units (MMBtu) in the first quarter. The glut was further exacerbated by lackluster industrial requirement over the past few years.And Then Recovered StronglySince then, successive below-average builds on the back of warmer temperature across the country followed by the recent start of the withdrawal season, has been cutting into the year-over-year storage surplus. Statistically speaking, the current storage level – at around 4 trillion cubic feet (Tcf) is up only slightly from last year and is just 6% above the five-year average. As a result, natural gas prices have rebounded strongly and doubled from the extreme lows it hit in Mar. The dramatic recovery has helped the commodity stay above the key psychological level of $3 per MMBtuThe price strength has translated into major gains for natural gas-weighted firms including the likes of Cimarex Energy Co. (XEC  -  Free Report), Southwestern Energy Co. (SWN  -  Free Report) and Range Resources Corp. (RRC  -  Free Report) – all Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) companies – which have popped up 50% or more year-to-date. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Long-Term Thesis PositiveWith the early winter turning out cooler than expected, natural gas demand has picked up on the back of elevated power sector consumption due to air-conditioning use. Coupled with the easing production from the major shale plays, natural gas prices are set to rise further.What’s more, rig count is now languishing below 120 – compared to almost 200 a year ago and the high of 1,606 reached in 2008. Therefore, production growth is unlikely to resume anytime soon.In general, sentiment toward natural gas is likely to become more positive in the near future as speculators bet on a frigid winter to follow the hot summer.What the Zacks Industry Rank IndicatesOil/Energy is one the 16 broad Zacks sectors within the Zacks Industry classification. We rank 265 X industries in the 16 Zacks sectors based on the earnings outlook and fundamental strength of the constituent companies in each industry. (To learn more visit: About Zacks Industry Rank.)The oil/energy industry is further sub-divided into the following industries at the expanded (aka ""X"") level: Oil and Gas - Integrated - United States, Oil and Gas - Drilling, Oil and Gas - Exploration and Production - United States, Oil and Gas - Production Pipeline - MLP, Oil and Gas - Field Services, Oil and Gas - Integrated - International, Oil and Gas - Production and Pipelines, Oil and Gas - Mechanical and Equipment, Oil and Gas - Integrated – Canadian, and Oil and Gas - Refining and Marketing.We put our X industries into two groups: the top half (industries with the best average Zacks Rank) and the bottom half (the industries with the worst average Zacks Rank). Over the last 10 years, using a one week rebalance, the top half beat the bottom half by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The Zacks Industry Rank is 39 for Oil and Gas - Integrated – Canadian, #56 for Oil and Gas - Mechanical and Equipment, #74 for Oil and Gas - Drilling, #84 for Oil and Gas - Exploration and Production - United States, #95 for Oil and Gas - Integrated - International, #102 for Oil and Gas - Integrated - United States, #145 for Oil and Gas - Production and Pipelines, #155 for Oil and Gas - Production Pipeline – MLP, #171 for Oil and Gas - Refining and Marketing and #176 for Oil and Gas - Field Services.Early Q4 Predictions Look PositiveAs is the trend over the past few quarters, a look back at the Q3 earnings season reflects that the overall results of the Oil/Energy sector were again very weak, dragging down the aggregate growth picture for the S&P 500 index.Unlike the second quarter, in which oil advanced more than 26% sequentially to notch up the best quarterly percentage gain in seven years, the Jun-Sep 2016 period turned out to be rather flat with crude barely advancing. In fact, the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures during the third quarter hovered around the $45 per barrel mark, flat with the second quarter and down from $46.50 in the same period last year.Before discussing Q4 2016 quarter estimates, let’s take a look at this year’s Q3 earnings season. Earnings fell by a whopping 63.3% year over year, following a 79% drop witnessed in the previous quarter. Things have been bad on the revenue front too, which was down 12.9% in the September quarter after declining 24.4% in the previous three-month period.However, the picture looks rather encouraging for the upcoming Q4 earnings season. This is not surprising, considering that oil scored a big jump on the recent OPEC deal that promises a worldwide cut in production. With estimate revisions going up, the Oil/Energy sector’s earnings are expected to improve 28.3% from the fourth quarter 2015 levels, while the top-line is likely to show a growth of 5%.For more information about earnings for this sector and others, please read our Earnings Trends report.The Best Place to Start Your Stock Search To help you find the most promising stocks in this industry, you are invited to download the full list of 220 Zacks Rank #1 ""Strong Buy"" stocks – absolutely free of charge.

This is because the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at $1.39, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is $1.38. A favorable ESP serves as a meaningful indicator of a likely positive surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.       Zacks Rank: Cimarex Energy currently has a Zacks Rank #3.  Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement.The combination of Cimarex Energy’s Zacks Rank #3 and +0.88% ESP makes us reasonably optimistic of an earnings beat.  What’s Driving the Better-Than-Expected Earnings?Cimarex Energy’s asset quality is one of the best among its peers. The Woodford shale wells in its Lone Rock area, the Wolfcamp wells in Texas and the acreage in Eddy County have had outstanding results during the third quarter. These regions are expected to continue producing superior results in the to-be-reported quarter.Cimarex Energy’s financial flexibility and strong balance sheet are real assets in this period of economic uncertainty. The company has no current debt while long-term debt has been contracting steadily since 2017, reflecting balance sheet strength.However, Cimarex Energy’s long-term production and reserve growth primarily depend on its acquire-and-exploit model. The company may find it difficult to complete accretive transactions in the future, which could negatively impact growth rate.Q4 Price PerformanceDuring the quarter, Cimarex Energy’s shares have returned 7.3% compared with the industry’s 9% rally.     Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are some other companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these too have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Houston, TX-based EOG Resources (EOG  -  Free Report) is a major independent oil and gas exploration and production company.

199,XEC,"Crude oil – considered to be in a bear market – is currently down significantly from its recent highs.Is now the time to be buying energy stocks?While record high inventories and robust production could still push the commodity to the depths of multiyear lows, signs are emerging that oil prices are likely to stabilize and gradually pick up. Not only is global demand expanding but energy companies have significantly scaled back on plans to explore for and bring out more oil. This should lead to lower future production and supply/demand rebalancing.However, not all oil stocks are the same. In fact, one needs to have an appetite for risk in order to invest in the energy sector. For savvy investors though, there are opportunities to earn big returns.Look at E&Ps with Strong Balance SheetsWhile all oil/gas-related stocks stand to move with fluctuating commodity prices, companies in the exploration and production (E&P) sector tend to be the most affected, as their product’s values are directly dependent on oil/gas prices.However, some upstream energy companies stand out from others with their ability to absorb volatile prices. These entities have restructured costs or taken other measures to deal with the prevailing situation. In this event, it may be a good idea to look at energy companies that have low debt capital ratios, which make debt servicing relatively easier for them.They boast of a conservative balance sheet with enough cash on hand and a manageable leverage. This provides the companies ample flexibility to make acquisitions or grow internally. Moreover, driven by operational efficiencies, these entities have been able to reduce unit costs -- an impressive achievement amid the low realization scenario.We advocate the likes of Devon Energy Corp. (DVN  -  Free Report), EOG Resources Inc. (EOG  -  Free Report) and Cimarex Energy Co. (XEC  -  Free Report) -- all large-cap companies.Integrated Majors Still AttractiveIn this current turbulent market environment, we advocate the relatively low-risk energy conglomerate business structures of the large-cap integrateds, with their fortress-like balance sheets, ample free cash flows even in a low oil price environment and steady dividends.Thanks to their integrated structures, companies like TOTAL S.A. (TOT  -  Free Report), Chevron Corp. (CVX  -  Free Report), and Eni SpA (E  -  Free Report) have been able to withstand plunging oil prices better than the rest and protect their top and bottom lines to a certain extent.The companies’ financial flexibility and strong balance sheet provide them with a larger war chest to draw upon in this highly-uncertain period for the economy. Most of them remain in excellent financial health, with ample cash on hand and investment-grade credit ratings with a manageable debt-to-capitalization ratio. On top of this, managements have established quite a track record of conservative capital management and cash returns to shareholders. They also pay a safe dividend, yielding attractive returns.While all of them have suffered from the crude carnage over the past 24 months, holding on to them can still prove to be an astute move.MLPs: A Safer Way to Play the SectorThe Master Limited Partnership (MLP) business model looked like a goner earlier this year. As oil prices plummeted to a 13-year low in Feb, the Alerian MLP index dived 30% in just five weeks. However, market sentiment has improved considerably thereafter.Importantly, the collapse in crude has markedly reduced the average price of U.S. gasoline, the most widely used petroleum product. This has resulted in record gasoline volumes across pipeline systems and a boon for operators whose compensation is based on the quantity moving through their system.Given the current weaknesses in petroleum stocks, MLPs are probably the best method of investing in the sector. They also offer liquidity and tax benefits, which add to their appeal. This is why these stocks would make good additions to your portfolio.With capital market access remaining tough for most sector components, we suggest buying stocks with clean balance sheets. Our picks would include the likes of Enbridge Energy Partners L.P. (EEP  -  Free Report), Archrock Partners L.P. APLP and CONE Midstream Partners L.P. CNNX.Check out our latest Oil & Gas Industry Outlook here for more on the current state of affairs in this market from an earnings perspective, and how the trend is looking for this important sector of the economy.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

200,XEC,"Crude OilU.S. oil futures have been very volatile in 2016 with prices recovering from a 12-year low of $26.21 a barrel in February to $50/barrel mark in early June and then slipping again to under $40.While factors like Canadian wildfires, Nigerian outages/disruptions, production issues in Venezuela and a strike by Kuwaiti oil workers contributed to jump in prices earlier this year that saw the benchmark recover significantly, these issues have largely vanished from the market. As of now, overproduction of crude and a glut of refined products keep the commodity under pressure.At over 520 million barrels, current crude supplies are up 15% from the year-ago period and are at the highest level during this time of the year. As it is, improvement in oil fundamentals remain fragile with the existing stocks of refined product inventories – gasoline and distillate – remaining at their maximum seasonal levels in at least 20 years despite healthy demand. Piling on the misery is the Baker Hughes report revealing a steady rise in the U.S. oil rig count and pointing to the resurgence in shale drilling activities.A number of major industry players, including Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM  -  Free Report), Royal Dutch Shell plc (RDS.A  -  Free Report) and BP plc (BP  -  Free Report) have reported sub-standard second-quarter numbers as lower energy prices take a toll.Over the past few trading days, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures have surged around 10% to around $45-a-barrel on renewed expectations of a production freeze from the 14-member OPEC bloc and Russia. However, several analysts have expressed skepticism over this mini-rally, pointing to the last such attempt made in April that failed spectacularly. Oil is facing the heat on several other fronts as well. Perhaps most important pertains to the mounting worries about China’s crude demand. In particular, the Asian giant’s currency devaluation has stoked speculation about soft economic growth in the world’s No. 2 energy consumer.  What’s more, in the absence of production cuts from OPEC, the resilience of North American shale suppliers to keep pumping despite crashing prices, and concerns over the effects of Brexit on crude demand., not much upside is expected in oil prices in the near term. Moreover, a stronger dollar has made the greenback-priced crude more expensive for investors holding foreign currency.As it is, with inventories at the highest level during this time of the year, crude is very well stocked. On top of that, the top producers of Middle East – pumping at full throttle – have indicated time and again that they are more intent on preserving market share rather than attempting to arrest the price decline through production cuts. Therefore, the commodity is likely to maintain its low trajectory throughout 2016.In our view, crude prices in the next few months are likely to exhibit a sideways-to-bearish trend, mostly trading in the $35-$45 per barrel range. As North American supply remains strong and demand looks underwhelming, we are likely to experience pressure to the price of a barrel of oil.Natural Gas""It's cleaner, it's cheaper and it's domestic.""- Legendary energy entrepreneur T. Boone Pickens, in reference to natural gas.Over the last few years, a quiet revolution has been reshaping the energy business in the U.S. The success of ‘shale gas’ – natural gas trapped within dense sedimentary rock formations or shale formations – has transformed domestic energy supply, with a potentially inexpensive and abundant new source of fuel for the world’s largest energy consumer.With the advent of hydraulic fracturing (or ""fracking"") – a method used to extract natural gas by blasting underground rock formations with a mixture of water, sand and chemicals – shale gas production is now booming in the U.S. Coupled with sophisticated horizontal drilling equipment that can drill and extract gas from shale formations, the new technology is being hailed as a breakthrough in U.S. energy supplies, playing a key role in boosting domestic natural gas reserves. As a result, once faced with a looming deficit, natural gas is now available in abundance.Statistically speaking, the current storage level – at 3.317 trillion cubic feet (Tcf) – is up 361 Bcf (12%) from last year and is 440 Bcf (15%) above the five-year average. Expectedly, this has taken a toll on prices. Natural gas peaked at about $13.50 per million British thermal units (MMBtu) in 2008 but dropped to its lowest level in almost 17 years – at $1.611 per million Btu (MMBtu) – in the first quarter. Apart from plentiful stocks, which hit an all-time high in November, the selloff was spurred by tepid demand for the fuel due to mild weather spurred by the El Niño phenomenon.In response to continued weak natural gas prices, major U.S. producers like Cimarex Energy Co. (XEC  -  Free Report), Cabot Oil & Gas Corp. (COG  -  Free Report) and Range Resources Corp. (RRC  -  Free Report) have all taken significant cost-cutting measures, including a reduction in their capital expenditure budgets.With production from the major shale plays remaining strong and the commodity’s demand failing to keep pace with this supply surge, natural gas prices have been held back. Industrial requirement has been lackluster over the past few years with demand barely rising. In fact, EIA estimates natural gas inventories will reach 4.042 Tcf by the end of October – a record level for that time of the year.In the past, winter weather has played a factor in boosting prices with demand for domestic natural gas exceeding available supply. But with no dearth of new supply, even this association is becoming more and more obsolete. Finally, with improved drilling productivity offsetting the historic decline in rig count, we do not expect gas prices to rally anytime soon.ZACKS INDUSTRY RANKOil/Energy is one the 16 broad Zacks sectors within the Zacks Industry classification. We rank all of the more than 260 industries in the 16 Zacks sectors based on the earnings outlook for the constituent companies in each industry. (To learn more visit: About Zacks Industry Rank.)The way to look at the complete list of 260+ industries is that the outlook for the top one-third of the list (Zacks Industry Rank of #88 and lower) is positive, the middle 1/3rd or industries with Zacks Industry Rank between #89 and #176 is neutral while the outlook for the bottom one-third (Zacks Industry Rank #177 and higher) is negative.The oil/energy industry is further sub-divided into the following industries at the expanded level: Oil – U.S. Integrated, Oil and Gas Drilling, Oil – U.S. Exploration and Production, Oil/Gas Production Pipeline MLP, Oilfield Services, Oil – International Integrated, Oil – Production/Pipeline, Oilfield Machineries and Equipment, Oil–C$ Integrated, and Oil Refining and Marketing.The ‘Oil – U.S. Exploration and Production’ is the best placed among them with its Zacks Industry Rank #41, comfortably placing it into the top 1/3rd of the 260+ industry groups, where it is joined by the ‘Oil/Gas Production Pipeline MLP’ with a Zacks Industry Rank of #65 and ‘Oil – International Integrated’ with a Zacks Industry Rank of #72.The ‘Oil and Gas Drilling’ – with a Zacks Industry Rank #97 – moves just out of the top 1/3rd and into the middle 1/3rd. There, it is accompanied by the ‘Oil–C$ Integrated,’ ‘Oil – Production/Pipeline,’ ‘Oil – U.S. Integrated’ and ‘Oilfield Services’ – carrying respective Zacks Industry Ranks of #105, #105, #105 and #170. The remaining sub-sectors – ‘Oilfield Machineries and Equipment’ and ‘Oil Refining and Marketing’ – are featuring in the bottom one-third of all Zacks industries with Zacks Industry Ranks of #208 and #240, respectively.The location of these industries suggests that the general outlook for the oil/energy space as a whole is ‘Neutral-to-Negative.’EARNINGS TRENDSAs is the trend over the past few quarters, a look back at Q2 earnings season reflects that the overall results of the Oil/Energy sector were again very weak, dragging down the aggregate growth picture for the S&P 500 index.Despite an impressive recovery, crude prices stayed under $50 – about half the level of two years ago – and far below the breakeven price for many energy companies. Moreover, most oil producers have been churning out ‘black gold’ at full throttle, thereby letting the commodity slip.Before discussing Q3 2016 quarter estimates, let’s take a look at this year’s Q2 earnings season. Earnings fell by a whopping 78.9% year over year, following a 108.6% drop witnessed in the previous quarter. Things have been bad on the revenue front too, which was down 24.4% in the June quarter after declining 29.3% in the previous three-month period.Predictably, the picture is looking bleak (though better than the recent quarters) for the upcoming Q3 earnings season. This is not surprising, considering that oil has plunged considerably from its recent peak of $51.23 in early June, in the process dragging down estimate revisions. The Oil/Energy sector’s earnings are expected to crash 56.1% from the third quarter 2015 levels, while the top-line is likely to show a drop of 5.0%.For the S&P 500, earnings are estimated to show year-over-year fall of just 2.6%, while revenues are set to rise 1.9% during the three months ended Sep 30, 2016. This puts the Oil/Energy sector in a bad light when compared to the broader markets. In fact, taking out Oil/Energy from the index, S&P earnings would increase by 0.1%, while revenue would be 2.6% higher from the year-ago period.For more information about earnings for this sector and others, please read our Earnings Trends report.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

201,XEC,"Crude Oil
"
202,XEC,"U.S. oil futures ended last year 30% below the 2014 level, which itself was 46% below the 2013 level – the first time since the late 1990’s of two back-to-back negative growth years. Such was the ferocity of the crash that three of 2015’s five worst-performing stocks in the S&P 500 index were all energy companies – Chesapeake Energy Corp. (CHK  -  Free Report), Southwestern Energy Co. (SWN  -  Free Report) and Kinder Morgan Inc. (KMI  -  Free Report), down approximately 77%, 74% and 63%, respectively. And now, with the failure of a producers’ meeting in Doha to agree to a production freeze plan in tackling the supply glut, prices look set to expand their 2-year rout.
"
203,XEC,"In recent days, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures jumped 30% – to above $40-per-barrel – since four key oil-producing countries (Russia, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Venezuela) reached a preliminary accord to cap future production on Feb 16. At that time, prices were hovering around their 12-year lows of around $27-a-barrel. The commodity gathered more steam on bullish talks surrounding the meeting of oil-rich countries.
"
204,XEC,"However, the pact fell apart after Saudi Arabia – by far OPEC’s major contributor – insisted that the kingdom might agree to a production freeze only ""if all countries” including Iran agree to limit production to Jan 2016 levels. But Riyadh’s Persian rival did not attend the meeting and vowed to increase production as it tries to bring oil back on the market post relief from international sanctions.
"
205,XEC,"Oil is facing the heat on several other fronts as well. Perhaps most important pertains to the mounting worries about China’s crude demand. In particular, the Asian giant’s currency devaluation has stoked speculation about soft economic growth in the world’s No. 2 energy consumer.   
"
206,XEC,"What’s more, in the absence of production cuts from OPEC, the resilience of North American shale suppliers to keep pumping despite crashing prices, and a weak European economy, not much upside is expected in oil prices in the near term. Moreover, a stronger dollar has made the greenback-priced crude more expensive for investors holding foreign currency.
"
207,XEC,"As it is, with inventories at the highest level during this time of the year, crude is very well stocked. On top of that, OPEC members (like Saudi Arabia) have made it clear time and again that they are more intent on preserving market share rather than attempting to arrest the price decline through production cuts. Therefore, the commodity is likely to maintain its low trajectory throughout 2016.
"
208,XEC,"In the medium-to-long term, while global oil demand will be driven by U.S. and the Middle East – this will be more than offset by sluggish growth prospects exhibited by Chinese and the European economies.
"
209,XEC,"In our view, crude prices in the next few months are likely to exhibit a sideways-to-bearish trend, mostly trading in the $30-$40 per barrel range. As North American supply remains strong and demand looks underwhelming, we are likely to experience pressure to the price of a barrel of oil.Natural Gas""It's cleaner, it's cheaper and it's domestic."" - Legendary energy entrepreneur T. Boone Pickens, in reference to natural gas.
"
210,XEC,"Over the last few years, a quiet revolution has been reshaping the energy business in the U.S. The success of ‘shale gas’ – natural gas trapped within dense sedimentary rock formations or shale formations – has transformed domestic energy supply, with a potentially inexpensive and abundant new source of fuel for the world’s largest energy consumer.
"
211,XEC,"With the advent of hydraulic fracturing (or ""fracking"") – a method used to extract natural gas by blasting underground rock formations with a mixture of water, sand and chemicals – shale gas production is now booming in the U.S. Coupled with sophisticated horizontal drilling equipment that can drill and extract gas from shale formations, the new technology is being hailed as a breakthrough in U.S. energy supplies, playing a key role in boosting domestic natural gas reserves. As a result, once faced with a looming deficit, natural gas is now available in abundance.
"
212,XEC,"Statistically speaking, the current storage level – at 2.477 trillion cubic feet (Tcf) – is up 956 Bcf (63%) from last year and is 849 Bcf (52%) above the five-year average. Expectedly, this has taken a toll on prices.
"
213,XEC,"Natural gas peaked at about $13.50 per million British thermal units (MMBtu) in 2008 but recently dropped to its lowest level in almost 17 years – at $1.611 per million Btu (MMBtu). Apart from plentiful stocks, which hit an all-time high in November, the selloff has been spurred by predictions of tepid demand for the fuel due to mild weather spurred by the El Niño phenomenon.
"
214,XEC,"In response to continued weak natural gas prices, major U.S. producers like Cimarex Energy Co. (XEC  -  Free Report), Cabot Oil & Gas Corp. (COG  -  Free Report) and Range Resources Corp. (RRC  -  Free Report) have all taken significant cost-cutting measures, including a reduction in their capital expenditure budgets.
"
215,XEC,"With production from the major shale plays remaining strong and the commodity’s demand failing to keep pace with this supply surge, natural gas prices have been held back. Industrial requirement has been lackluster over the past few years with demand barely rising.
"
216,XEC,"In the past, winter weather has played a factor in boosting prices with demand for domestic natural gas exceeding available supply. But with no dearth of new supply, even this association is becoming more and more obsolete. Finally, with improved drilling productivity offsetting the historic decline in rig count, we do not expect gas prices to rally anytime soon.ZACKS INDUSTRY RANK
"
217,XEC,"Oil/Energy is one the 16 broad Zacks sectors within the Zacks Industry classification. We rank all of the more than 260 industries in the 16 Zacks sectors based on the earnings outlook for the constituent companies in each industry. (To learn more visit: About Zacks Industry Rank.)
"
218,XEC,"The way to look at the complete list of 260+ industries is that the outlook for the top one-third of the list (Zacks Industry Rank of #88 and lower) is positive, the middle 1/3rd or industries with Zacks Industry Rank between #89 and #176 is neutral while the outlook for the bottom one-third (Zacks Industry Rank #177 and higher) is negative.
"
219,XEC,"The oil/energy industry is further sub-divided into the following industries at the expanded level: Oil – U.S. Integrated, Oil and Gas Drilling, Oil – U.S. Exploration and Production, Oil/Gas Production Pipeline MLP, Oilfield Services, Oil – International Integrated, Oil – Production/Pipeline, Oilfield Machineries and Equipment, Oil–C$ Integrated, and Oil Refining and Marketing.
"
220,XEC,"The ‘Oil–C$ Integrated’ is the best placed among them with its Zacks Industry Rank #33, comfortably placing it into the top 1/3rd of the 260+ industry groups, where it is joined by the ‘Oil – International Integrated’ with a Zacks Industry Rank of #52 and ‘Oilfield Machineries and Equipment’ with a Zacks Industry Rank of #78.
"
221,XEC,"The ‘Oil – U.S. Exploration and Production’ – with a Zacks Industry Rank #97 – moves just out of the top 1/3rd and into the middle 1/3rd. There, it is joined by the ‘Oil and Gas Drilling’, ‘Oil/Gas Production Pipeline MLP’ and ‘Oil Refining and Marketing’ – carrying respective Zacks Industry Ranks of #114, #156 and #160.  
"
222,XEC,"The remaining sub-sectors – ‘Oilfield Services,’ ‘Oil – U.S. Integrated’ and ‘Oil – Production/Pipeline’ – are featuring in the bottom one-third of all Zacks industries with Zacks Industry Ranks of #186, #189 and #228, respectively.
"
223,XEC,"The location of these industries suggests that the general outlook for the oil/energy space as a whole is leaning toward ‘Negative.'EARNINGS TRENDS
"
224,XEC,"A look back at the Q4 earnings season reflects that the overall results of the Oil/Energy sector were the weakest in several quarters, dragging down the aggregate growth picture for the S&P 500 index.
"
225,XEC,"Faced with plentiful supplies and lackluster demand, the meltdown in crude prices continued throughout this period. The OPEC oil cartel again refusal to curb output and let the commodity slide. Moreover, a stronger dollar made the greenback-priced crude pricier for investors holding foreign currency.
"
226,XEC,"Before discussing Q1 2016 quarter estimates, let’s take a look at last year’s Q4 earnings season. Earnings fell by a whopping 78.6% year over year, following a 56.4% drop witnessed in the previous quarter. Things have been bad on the revenue front too, which was down 35.1% in the December quarter after declining 37.1% in the previous three-month period.
"
227,XEC,"Predictably, things are looking bleak for the upcoming Q1 earnings season. This is not surprising, considering that oil plunged as low as $26-per-barrel in Feb, in the process dragging down estimate revisions. The Oil/Energy sector’s earnings are expected to crash 105.8% from the first quarter 2015 levels, while the top-line is likely to show a drop of 29.8%.
"
228,XEC,"For the S&P 500, earnings and revenues are estimated to show year-over-year fall of just 10.3% and 0.6% during the three months ended Mar 31, 2016, respectively. This puts the Oil/Energy sector in a bad light when compared to the broader markets. In fact, taking out Oil/Energy from the index, S&P earnings would fall by a mere 5.2%, while revenue would increase 2.4% from the year-ago period.

"
231,XEC,"It's been one heck of a bumpy ride for crude over the last few years. 2007 saw record global consumption of more than 86 million barrels a day as emerging markets like China and Brazil scrambled to compete for limited resources. But 2008 and 2009 ushered in a very different environment, the first two consecutive years of declining consumption since the early 80's as the global recession took a big bite out of consumer and corporate spending. 
"
232,XEC,"Crude Back to $80
"
233,XEC,"But here we are heading into the summer of 2010 and once again energy prices are sky high, with crude trading safely above the $80 mark. Some of the short-term momentum has to do with evidence that the economic recovery is gaining traction, fueled by very strong first-quarter earnings, a better than expected jobs report from early April and more signs of stability in housing. 
"
234,XEC,"But the long-term view is also bullish due to limited proven reserves and production capacities, erratic weather patterns and general political instability in the Middle East and other major oil-producing regions.
"
235,XEC,"Energy Agencies Raise Guidance
"
236,XEC,"Two well respected energy agencies, the federal government's Energy Information Agency and the independent International Energy Agency out of Paris underscored this notion, recently saying that energy consumption bottomed out in 2009 and raising their projections for both 2010 and 2011.
"
237,XEC,"And even if prices fail to drift higher and hold steady between $70 and $80 a barrel, make no doubt about it, energy companies will be raking in big bucks. So why not get on board and give yourself a chance to score some gains or hedge away your exposure to higher gasoline prices? Here are three stocks from different segments of the energy market that look well positioned to gain from elevated crude prices. 
"
238,XEC,"3 Excellent Energy StocksCimarex Energy Co. (XEC  -  Free Report) is a mid-cap domestic explorer out of Denver with interests in the Permian Basis (West Texas/Southeast New Mexico), Mid Continent (Kansas/Oklahoma) and the Gulf Coast.
"
239,XEC,"As an explorer, this stock will trade with a very strong correlation to underlying crude prices, which we have seen play out this year. That means that shares in explorers like XEC are going to be a bit more volatile than an energy services company that is more insulated from crude fluctuations and produces steadier cash flows. 
"
240,XEC,"Cimarex has an awesome valuation, trading with a forward P/E of just 11X, a nice discount to the overall market. With a next-year estimate projecting 24% earnings growth, the longer-term view looks good too. Take a look at the chart below. 
"
241,XEC,"Carbo Ceramics (CRR  -  Free Report) is a small-cap out of Houston that sells ceramic proppant to oil services companies. As a service provider, Carbo will have a weaker correlation to crude and produce steadier cash flows.
"
242,XEC,"There are a lot of things to like about this Zacks #2 ranks stock, starting with its consistency over the last year, with an average earnings surprise of 11%. The valuation looks a bit pricey at 27X, but the bullish next-year estimate of 24% helps temper the longer-term view. 
"
243,XEC,"Carbo also outpaces the competition in a couple key categories, with a net profit margin of 29% and an ROE of 13.8%, 4% better than the industry average. Take a look at the chart below.
"
244,XEC,"Oceaneering International, Inc. (OII  -  Free Report) is mid-capper that provides engineered products and services to offshore drillers with a specialty in deepwater applications.
"
245,XEC,"The company has a very strong international presence, with operations in Africa, Norway, The United Kingdom, Asia, Australia, Brazil and the United States. And with President Obama and the current administration moving towards opening up the domestic coasts to exploration, OII could be well positioned to capitalize.
"
246,XEC,"OII has been consistent over the last year, beating in all four quarters by an average of 8%. The forward P/E multiple of 18X is a premium to the overall market but a discount to its peer group. The next-year estimate is projecting 18% earnings growth, take a look at the chart below.
