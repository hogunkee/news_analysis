0,WHR,"Vacuum and home appliance giant Electrolux (ELUXY) halted a $250 million U.S. investment due to fears over the effects of the Trump aluminum and steel tariffs.X President Trump said Friday that ""trade wars are good"" a day after announcing that he'll impose a 25% tariff on steel imports and 10% on aluminum, with the final announcement and details out next week.But Sweden's Electrolux Friday said it is now delaying a planned $250 million investment in Tennessee due to concerns the measures will cause a spike in metal prices. The world's second biggest home appliance maker buys American steel in all its U.S.-made products.""We are putting it on hold. We believe that tariffs could cause a pretty significant increase in the price of steel on the U.S. market,"" Electrolux spokesman Daniel Frykholm said. ""This is not the possibility of tariffs directly impacting our costs, but rather the impact it could have on the market and that it could damage the overall competitiveness of our operations in the U.S.""Sign Up For Free IBD Newsletters: Market Prep | Tech ReportHowever he also held out an olive branch, saying Electrolux will not make a final decision on the planned investment until the tariff plans are finalized. The plan to expand and modernize the plant in Springfield, Tennessee was only announced in January.Shares tumbled 3.1% to 62.26 on the stock market today, hitting a nine-month low. Electrolux stock plunged through its 50-day moving average line Thursday.Last month Trump imposed huge tariffs on washing machines, giving shares of Electrolux rival Whirlpool (WHR) a boost, for a few days. But Whirlpool, which is the world's biggest appliance maker, has been selling off since late January. The stock sank 1.2% to 158.60 on Friday, hitting its worst levels since November 2016. Whirlpool fell more than 7% for the week on the prospect of higher steel costs and a trade war.President Trump has stood firm on the issue of tariffs, and took to his favored Twitter medium to share his thoughts on how it will pan out early Friday.""When a country (USA) is losing many billions of dollars on trade with virtually every country it does business with, trade wars are good, and easy to win. Example, when we are down $100 billion with a certain country and they get cute, don't trade anymore-we win big. It's easy!"" Trump tweeted.After lashing out at actor Alec Baldwin over his ""Saturday Night Live"" impersonations of him, he then turned his attention back to tariffs.""We must protect our country and our workers. Our steel industry is in bad shape. IF YOU DON'T HAVE STEEL, YOU DON'T HAVE A COUNTRY!"" the president wrote.However criticism has come from around the world, with Canada, the biggest supplier of steel and aluminum to the U.S., saying it will retaliate if hit by duties.The European Union, which is the world's second largest economy when counted as a bloc, also said it will take countermeasures and China urged Trump to show restraint. Mexico and Brazil will also consider taking retaliatory steps.YOU MAY ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Trump Says 'Trade Wars Are Good,' Sending S&P 500, Dow Jones FuturesTumblingTrump Tariff Sell-Off Triggers New Stock Market OutlookHow To Find The Next Stock Market Bottom

17,WHR,"Fred Maytag knew that he would have to overcome resistance to using his new washing machines.
"
18,WHR,"Many people sent out clothing to be professionally cleaned, since no devices were around to make cleaning easy to do at home.
"
19,WHR,"Convincing them to do their own laundry again wouldn't be easy.
"
20,WHR,"But Maytag had overcome many setbacks to pioneer safer farm machinery. He knew how to make new technology user-friendly.
"
21,WHR,"""When quality issues arose in his farm equipment, Maytag was determined to stand behind his products, spending hours in countless fields and barns fixing the issues,"" Kristine Vernier, spokeswoman for Whirlpool (WHR), which owns the Maytag brand, told IBD.
"
22,WHR,"""He was determined to make every product dependable. 'Along with leadership comes the confidence of the public,' he said. 'We must maintain the quality of our product in every aspect.' Soon after, he grew his business into making reliable major home appliances, taking care to instill a heritage of great component parts and, as he said, 'outstanding quality, second to none.'""
"
23,WHR,"Frederick Louis ""F.L."" Maytag (1857-1937) was born on a farm in Cook County, Ill., the first of 10 children of German Jewish immigrant parents.
"
24,WHR,"On The Go
"
25,WHR,"Several years later, they moved to Clay County. The farm was sold for a good profit in 1865, when they settled in Mattoon, Ill.
"
26,WHR,"Fred, 8, began delivering groceries for the family store there, but a year later they accepted a good offer to buy a farm near Newton, Iowa, their last move.
"
27,WHR,"""His father was often away working as a mechanic for other farmers, and Fred was left to keep things going,"" wrote A.B. Funk in ""Fred L. Maytag: A Biography."" ""Before he was 10, he had plowed 80 acres of prairie sod with a plow that weighed 200 pounds and whose handles were as tall as he was. It was a real man's job.""
"
28,WHR,"Maytag was curious about all kinds of equipment. In 1880, an implement dealer noted the young man's mechanical fascination and offered him $50 (worth $1,200 now) a month to be a salesman.
"
29,WHR,"At the end of the next year, one of the partners sold his half-share for the $800 (worth $19,000 now) that Maytag had saved and a new firm, Maytag & Bergman, was formed.
"
30,WHR,"It was successful for the next eight years, after which Maytag sold his half to his partner and, by then, brother-in-law, William Bergman. Maytag had married Bergman's sister, Dena, in 1882, and they would have two sons and two daughters.
"
31,WHR,"In 1893, after owning a lumber business for a few years, Maytag, 36, was back investing with William; another brother-in-law, A.H. Bergman; and inventor George Parsons. They formed Parsons Band-Cutter & Self Feeder in Newton.
"
32,WHR,"Amid a rash of threshing-machine injuries, the plan was to produce improved farm implements. Maytag and his partners answered the call with a device that fed straw into the threshing cylinder in a safer way.
"
33,WHR,"In 1905, they introduced a husker shredder to process corn mechanically, and it became popular.
"
34,WHR,"""But there were numerous customer complaints about product quality,"" said David Sturt, author of ""Great Work: How to Make a Difference People Love"" and executive vice president at the O.C. Tanner Institute, which advises companies on employee recognition programs. ""Maytag found there were the fewest problems in Minnesota, where a mechanic, Howard Snyder, was doing a good job of fixing the company's products. Maytag brought him to headquarters to improve their equipment design, and in 1909 Maytag bought out his partners to create the Maytag Company (also in Newton). From then on, he could take full responsibility, staking his reputation on the quality of the products and the service.""
"
35,WHR,"From 1907 to 1912, Maytag made personal investments in firms that were manufacturing other products, including vacuum cleaners, cars and fountain pens.
"
36,WHR,"He lost his shirt but took responsibility for friends who had invested their own money based on his judgment, reimbursing them.
"
37,WHR,"Next up for Maytag was innovation in the washing of clothes, sheets and linen.
"
38,WHR,"""Laundering clothes was one of the most labor-intensive tasks of daily American life,"" said Bernard Carlson, author of the Great Courses' audiovisual program ""Understanding the Inventions That Changed the World."" ""Clothes were washed primarily by women by scrubbing against a rock until the washboard was invented in 1797. Inventors had long tried to make a machine to do the rubbing, but by 1900 most families sent clothes and bedding out to commercial laundries that could use big steam engines. To convince housewives to bring the service back home, early washing machine makers had to come up with a way to automate and simplify the entire process — filling the tub, agitating the clothes, rinsing and wringing out the excess water.""
"
39,WHR,"Finding A Way
"
40,WHR,"In 1907 Maytag brought out his first washing machine, the Pastime, which used a corrugated wooden tub. A hand crank pulled a dolly that pulled clothes through the washer and along the walls of the tub for the cleaning action.
"
41,WHR,"A pulley could be attached so that a windmill or tractor could power the machine.
"
42,WHR,"In 1911, an electrical motor was offered as a power source.
"
43,WHR,"Four years later, a gasoline motor version could be used in rural areas without electricity.
"
44,WHR,"Maytag was finding his calling.
"
45,WHR,"By 1919, his company had replaced the wooden tub with an aluminum one. Three years later came the Gyrafoam washer, which used a vaned agitator on the bottom of the tub to force soapy water through the clothes rather than rubbing them.
"
46,WHR,"""The persistence at improving quality paid off,"" said Sturt. ""Sales increased from $2 million in 1921 to $53 million in 1926. By 1923, Maytag had phased out all his other equipment to focus on what became the world's largest washing machine plant in Newton.
"
47,WHR,"""Thomas Edison and Harvey Firestone said they recognized that his entrepreneurial success was due to the attention to consumer needs and expectations that had been the basis of their own.""
"
48,WHR,"In 1920, L.B. Maytag, one of the founder's sons, took over day-to-day operations as president, with his father continuing as chairman to provide advice and zeroing in on philanthropy and state politics.
"
49,WHR,"Solid Market
"
50,WHR,"By 1924, Maytag was making 20% of all washing machines in America.
"
51,WHR,"The next year, the company was listed on the New York Stock Exchange, with the other son, Elmer, becoming president in 1926.
"
52,WHR,"By then, Americans were buying 900,000 semiautomated washers a year from all manufacturers at an average price of $150, or $2,000 in today's money.
"
53,WHR,"By 1935, the price had dropped to $60, leading to 1.4 million sold by all companies, says Carlson.

58,WHR,"By the 21st century, the Maytag company had sold over 40 million appliances. Whirlpool bought it in 2006 and has enjoyed an 890% stock run since 2009.Fred Maytag knew that he would have to overcome resistance to using his new washing machines.Many people sent out clothing to be professionally cleaned, since no devices were around to make cleaning easy to do at home.Convincing them to do their own laundry again wouldn't be easy.But Maytag had overcome many setbacks to pioneer safer farm machinery. He knew how to make new technology user-friendly.""When quality issues arose in his farm equipment, Maytag was determined to stand behind his products, spending hours in countless fields and barns fixing the issues,"" Kristine Vernier, spokeswoman for Whirlpool (WHR), which owns the Maytag brand, told IBD.""He was determined to make every product dependable. 'Along with leadership comes the confidence of the public,' he said. 'We must maintain the quality of our product in every aspect.' Soon after, he grew his business into making reliable major home appliances, taking care to instill a heritage of great component parts and, as he said, 'outstanding quality, second to none.'""Frederick Louis ""F.L."" Maytag (1857-1937) was born on a farm in Cook County, Ill., the first of 10 children of German Jewish immigrant parents.On The GoSeveral years later, they moved to Clay County. The farm was sold for a good profit in 1865, when they settled in Mattoon, Ill.Fred, 8, began delivering groceries for the family store there, but a year later they accepted a good offer to buy a farm near Newton, Iowa, their last move.""His father was often away working as a mechanic for other farmers, and Fred was left to keep things going,"" wrote A.B. Funk in ""Fred L. Maytag: A Biography."" ""Before he was 10, he had plowed 80 acres of prairie sod with a plow that weighed 200 pounds and whose handles were as tall as he was. It was a real man's job.""Maytag was curious about all kinds of equipment. In 1880, an implement dealer noted the young man's mechanical fascination and offered him $50 (worth $1,200 now) a month to be a salesman.At the end of the next year, one of the partners sold his half-share for the $800 (worth $19,000 now) that Maytag had saved and a new firm, Maytag & Bergman, was formed.It was successful for the next eight years, after which Maytag sold his half to his partner and, by then, brother-in-law, William Bergman. Maytag had married Bergman's sister, Dena, in 1882, and they would have two sons and two daughters.In 1893, after owning a lumber business for a few years, Maytag, 36, was back investing with William; another brother-in-law, A.H. Bergman; and inventor George Parsons. They formed Parsons Band-Cutter & Self Feeder in Newton.Amid a rash of threshing-machine injuries, the plan was to produce improved farm implements. Maytag and his partners answered the call with a device that fed straw into the threshing cylinder in a safer way.In 1905, they introduced a husker shredder to process corn mechanically, and it became popular.""But there were numerous customer complaints about product quality,"" said David Sturt, author of ""Great Work: How to Make a Difference People Love"" and executive vice president at the O.C. Tanner Institute, which advises companies on employee recognition programs. ""Maytag found there were the fewest problems in Minnesota, where a mechanic, Howard Snyder, was doing a good job of fixing the company's products. Maytag brought him to headquarters to improve their equipment design, and in 1909 Maytag bought out his partners to create the Maytag Company (also in Newton). From then on, he could take full responsibility, staking his reputation on the quality of the products and the service.""From 1907 to 1912, Maytag made personal investments in firms that were manufacturing other products, including vacuum cleaners, cars and fountain pens.He lost his shirt but took responsibility for friends who had invested their own money based on his judgment, reimbursing them.Next up for Maytag was innovation in the washing of clothes, sheets and linen.""Laundering clothes was one of the most labor-intensive tasks of daily American life,"" said Bernard Carlson, author of the Great Courses' audiovisual program ""Understanding the Inventions That Changed the World."" ""Clothes were washed primarily by women by scrubbing against a rock until the washboard was invented in 1797. Inventors had long tried to make a machine to do the rubbing, but by 1900 most families sent clothes and bedding out to commercial laundries that could use big steam engines. To convince housewives to bring the service back home, early washing machine makers had to come up with a way to automate and simplify the entire process — filling the tub, agitating the clothes, rinsing and wringing out the excess water.""Finding A WayIn 1907 Maytag brought out his first washing machine, the Pastime, which used a corrugated wooden tub. A hand crank pulled a dolly that pulled clothes through the washer and along the walls of the tub for the cleaning action.A pulley could be attached so that a windmill or tractor could power the machine.In 1911, an electrical motor was offered as a power source.Four years later, a gasoline motor version could be used in rural areas without electricity.Maytag was finding his calling.By 1919, his company had replaced the wooden tub with an aluminum one. Three years later came the Gyrafoam washer, which used a vaned agitator on the bottom of the tub to force soapy water through the clothes rather than rubbing them.""The persistence at improving quality paid off,"" said Sturt. ""Sales increased from $2 million in 1921 to $53 million in 1926. By 1923, Maytag had phased out all his other equipment to focus on what became the world's largest washing machine plant in Newton.""Thomas Edison and Harvey Firestone said they recognized that his entrepreneurial success was due to the attention to consumer needs and expectations that had been the basis of their own.""In 1920, L.B. Maytag, one of the founder's sons, took over day-to-day operations as president, with his father continuing as chairman to provide advice and zeroing in on philanthropy and state politics.Solid MarketBy 1924, Maytag was making 20% of all washing machines in America.The next year, the company was listed on the New York Stock Exchange, with the other son, Elmer, becoming president in 1926.By then, Americans were buying 900,000 semiautomated washers a year from all manufacturers at an average price of $150, or $2,000 in today's money.By 1935, the price had dropped to $60, leading to 1.4 million sold by all companies, says Carlson.In the 1930s, Maytag engineers eliminated the wringer for drying clothes. He introduced a motor and a perforated basket that spun clothes at high speed to eliminate excess water.A timer and electromechanical controls were also added.Maytag built loyalty by taking care of his workers.

The amount was a record and up 14% from last year's Cyber Monday sales, Adobe said. Adobe also estimated that Thanksgiving through Cyber Monday receipts would top $11 billion, up 15% year-over-year and also a record.About a third of the Dow's issues were positive in premarket action, the rest were flat.

85,WHR,"RBC Capital Markets raised its stock price targets on Home Depot (HD) and Lowe's (LOW) ahead of the home improvement retailers' third-quarter earnings reports next week, citing positive industry trends. In a note released Wednesday morning, RBC analyst Scot Ciccarelli said trends in the home improvement sector ""remained solid in 3Q. Vendor readthroughs were a bit mixed, but generally positive.…
"
86,WHR,"Whirlpool (WHR) shares plummeted by more than 11% Tuesday as the appliance maker cut its annual profit forecast on results that fell well short of third-quarter estimates.Hurt by sluggish sales in the U.S. and Brexit-inspired turmoil in the U.K., Whirlpool posted earnings of $3.66 a share in the third quarter, missing the $3.86 projected by analysts. Sales fell to $5.25 billion, compared with an average estimate of $5.32 billion.The appliance giant now expects earnings of $14 to $14.25 a share this year, according to a statement on Tuesday. Whirlpool had previously forecast a range as high as $14.75.Shares had been up 16% this year through Monday's close, but they had plunged 11.4% in recent action to 151.11.The company, which sells appliances under brands such as KitchenAid and Maytag, cited a ""challenging"" environment in the U.S. for hampering sales. The U.K.'s vote to leave the European Union — and subsequent impact on the pound — also took a toll on results, the Benton Harbor, Mich.-based company said.
"
87,WHR,"Rival home-improvement retailers Home Depot (HD) and Lowe's (LOW) report third-quarter results on Tuesday and Wednesday, respectively. Here's a look at what to expect.Estimates: Earnings per share up 16% to $1.58 on revenue up 6% to $23.044 billion. Wall Street expects same-store sales growth of around 4.4%, according to a Credit Suisse note last week.Stock: Shares fell 1.7% to 127.67 in the stock market today. Home Depot found resistance at its 200-day line intraday but is still above its 50-day line.Estimates: A 20% jump in EPS to 96 cents. Revenue is expected to rise 10% to $15.859 billion. Comps were seen rising around 3.1%, according to the Credit Suisse note.Stock: Lowe's shares rose 0.4% to 70.01 Monday, finding resistance at its 50-day line.The earnings for both companies come amid investors' worries about weaker home-improvement spending, Jefferies said in a research note this month, and the firm cited concerns about commentary from companies like Whirlpool (WHR) and Sherwin-Williams (SHW).During its third-quarter earnings call, Whirlpool said it saw ""temporary softness"" in U.S. demand in the first two months of that quarter with improvement in the third. The company attributed the lag to election-related consumer anxiety.There are also concerns about weaker big-ticket purchases, discounting and Fed rate hikes for Home Depot and Lowe's. Weather, as always, could play a huge role in the companies' future results.""Comparisons will get more challenging the next two quarters as a warm winter extended the outdoor selling season last year,"" Jefferies analyst Daniel Binder wrote in the research note. ""Forecasts suggest a more typical and colder winter this year, so we would expect a deceleration in comp trend over the next two quarters.""IBD'S TAKE: Even as home improvement stocks contend with potential rate hikes and colder winters, the broader construction industry could see a bigger uptrend if President-elect Trump carries out plans to overhaul the nation's infrastructure.However, the investment firm said, home improvement spending was still better than in other areas of retail, with higher home prices and healthy consumer finances helping the industry. The housing market, and some companies associated with it, have benefited from lower interest rates in recent years.Home Depot has generally outperformed Lowe's in recent years. Credit Suisse also said that more than 120 Home Depot stores ""may have been in the path"" of Hurricane Matthew. Those stores, analyst Seth Sigman wrote, could have seen an uptick in demand from customers looking to prepare for the storm or make repairs to damage afterward.Credit Suisse said Lowe's gross margins could be strained by its purchase this year of Rona, a Canada-based retailer that sells home-improvement products and building materials.The two companies are in IBD's retail and wholesale building products industry group, which is lagging at No. 108 but rising in the past three weeks.RELATED:Lowe's Q2 Earnings, Revenue Miss Views As Comps Lag Home Depot'sHome Depot Earnings Solid On Housing 'Tailwind'; Stock Flirts With Buy Point

89,WHR,"Indexes weakened in afternoon trading Tuesday, as earnings reports caused a tumble for General Motors (GM) and for home-improvement stocks.The Nasdaq was down 0.5% and the S&P 500 0.3%. The Dow Jones industrial average did a little better, down 0.2% as components Procter & Gamble (PG) and Merck (MRK) rose following earnings reports.Volume was running higher on the Nasdaq and NYSE.The building products industry and other home-improvement stocks were rattled in a combination of weak earnings reports and a poor outlook from a major appliance maker. Air conditioning and heating, construction products, wood products, paints and appliances were industry groups down 2% to 6%.Masco (MAS) plunged nearly 10% in heavy trading, falling below the long-term 200-day moving average. The stock had been forming a base-on-base pattern, but is now seriously damaged. Masco missed third-quarter profit expectations, and sales growth of 2% continued a trend of flat or low single-digit gains dating back to 2015. Masco — which makes doors, windows, plumbing fixtures and other construction products — is exiting its lower-margin cabinet business.BMC Stock Holdings (BMCH) fell 5% in rapid trade. The supplier of lumber and other building products has been trading below the 200-day moving average for about two weeks. It's been below the 50-day line since Sept. 9.Whirlpool (WHR) gapped down to a loss of more than 11% in the highest volume since at least April 26, where there was a similar earnings-related sell-off. The appliance manufacturer missed profit and sales estimates and it cut its full-year earnings outlook. Whirlpool expects to earn $14 to $14.25 a share in 2016, down from an earlier forecast of as high as $14.75. The company cited soft demand in the U.S. and the U.K. and the weakening of the British pound.General Motors skidded 4% in heavy volume. The stock dipped below its 50-day moving average but shares remained in a long sideways pattern. The automaker beat profit and sales expectations and it forecast full-year earnings at the high end of $5.50-$6; that's above analysts' consensus of $5.85. But GM warned it may miss its 2016 European profit target due to Brexit. It also saw a softening in the U.S. auto market.Waters (WAT) gapped down to a loss of nearly 12% in huge volume after it reported Q3 profit that met the consensus estimate. The maker of products for drug development reported adjusted earnings of $1.57 a share, up 11%, on sales of $526.8 million, a 5% increase. Waters had been a leading stock, mounting a 15% gain from a 140.80 buy point. It was forming a new base, but Tuesday's crash has roiled the pattern.Metals stocks were leading the market, and a high-rated part of that sector made a breakout.Ternium (TX) jumped nearly 5% as it topped the 23.69 buy point of a cup-without-handle base. Volume was running four times the average, leaving little doubt that a stampede of institutional investors was buying shares. The Luxembourg-based steel producer is in talks to acquire a steel plant in Brazil from Germany's ThyssenKrupp, according to reports.RELATED:GM Sinks On Europe Warning; United Tech Ups View; Cat, 3M Guide LowApple Earnings After The Close: What To ExpectLockheed Martin Soars On Outlook But F-35 Contract Talks Drag On

90,WHR,"Arconic Inc. (ARNC) halted sales of the cladding panels used on an apartment tower in London where a devastating fire broke out June 14, killing dozens of people.X Officials investigating the Grenfell Towers blaze, which killed at least 79 people, suspect that the type of aluminum cladding used in the high-rise hastened the fire's progress. Metals specialist Arconic was aware that the material, known as Reynobond PE, was a fire hazard before supplying it for a Grenfell refurbishment project in 2015, according to reports.Meanwhile, a Reuters story on Monday said the news agency had seen six emails sent or received by an Arconic sales manager in 2014 that raise questions about why the company supplied the type of flammable cladding used at Grenfell Tower, despite publicly warning such panels were a fire risk for tall buildings.Arconic stressed in a statement that its panels were just part of the cladding system and that it did not supply the insulation. It argued that safety standards are up to local authorities.""We sold Reynobond PE to our customer, the fabricator, in 2015 for use as one component of the overall cladding system,"" Arconic said. ""While we publish general usage guidelines, regulations and codes vary by country and need to be determined by the local building code experts.""Arconic shares plunged more than 11% intraday on the stock market today. Arconic trimmed losses to 6%, at 24.01, just below its 200-day moving average.Meanwhile, Whirlpool (WHR) shares gained 1.1% to 190.70 despite reports that a Hotpoint fridge started the Grenfell fire. The Hotpoint brand is co-owned by Whirlpool, which fell 3.3% on Friday.The fall in Arconic stock Monday was described as its biggest intraday drop since the company spun off from Alcoa Inc. (AA) eight months ago. The sharp losses come amid fears that a political inquiry as well as a police investigation into the incident could create significant liabilities. Arconic is a high-end supplier to the airlines, automotive and building industries.""Arconic is discontinuing global sales of Reynobond PE for use in high-rise applications,"" the New York City-based company said Monday. ""We believe this is the right decision because of the inconsistency of building codes across the world and issues that have arisen in the wake of the Grenfell Tower tragedy regarding code compliance of cladding systems.""Following the Grenfell fire, the British government is carrying out tests on hundreds of high-rise buildings covered in cladding. So far, 75 buildings have failed the tests, requiring mass evacuations.Alcoa rose 0.3% to 31.18.RELATED:Arconic Jumps As CEO Kleinfeld Exits Amid Proxy Fight

91,WHR,"Wall Street analysts on Tuesday raised their price targets on internet television network Netflix (NFLX), home appliance maker Whirlpool (WHR) and graphics-chip maker Nvidia (NVDA), but lowered their outlook for sports apparel firm Nike (NKE) and chipmaker ON Semiconductor (ON).Guggenheim Securities reiterated its ""best idea"" buy rating on Netflix and raised its price target on the stock to 180 from 175.X""Netflix remains our best idea in the media industry as the company continues to invest in its compelling global content creation and distribution model, and expands its subscriber base,"" Guggenheim analyst Michael Morris said in a note to clients. ""Usage data clearly indicates that people around the world enjoy engaging with Netflix with increasing frequency.""Los Gatos, Calif.-based Netflix is making ""rational investments"" in content (about $8 billion in spending estimated in 2017) and is building a big lead in the subscription streaming video market, he said.Netflix shares closed down 0.9% at 152.05 on the stock market today.Pacific Crest Securities raised its ratings on Marvell Technology (MRVL) and Nvidia, but lowered its rating on ON Semiconductor.Pacific Crest upgraded chipmaker Marvell to overweight from sector weight and set a price target of 22. It also upgraded Nvidia to sector weight, or neutral, from underweight, or sell, while turning negative on ON Semi, lowering its rating to sector weight from overweight.The investment bank likes Marvell because of its pricing power in switches, multiple design wins, and sales momentum in the data-center business.Marvell stock rose 0.4% to 17.52, Nvidia dipped 0.15 to 157.09, while On Semi fell 3.6% to 15.08.Investment bank Cowen kept its market perform rating on Nike, but lowered its price target to 53 from 54.Beaverton, Ore.-based Nike is facing heightened North American competition in an increasingly promotional environment with rivals Adidas and Under Armour (UAA).""Our checks show elevated promotions continue on footwear (basketball, running and lifestyle) and apparel throughout North America (45% of sales) which also coincides with a more promotional cadence from Under Armour and Adidas,"" Cowen analyst John Kernan said in a report.Nike fell 0.9% to 51.56 Tuesday.RBC Capital Markets maintained its ""top pick"" buy rating on Whirlpool and increased its price target to 226 from 216.""We believe that Whirlpool's ability to achieve its long-term financial targets that were outlined at its recent investor day (May 4th) combined with expectations for multiple expansion should translate into share price appreciation,"" RBC analyst Robert Wetenhall said in a report. ""Sustained revenue growth, operating margin expansion, and improving free cash flow generation support our Top Pick rating.""Benton Harbor, Mich.-based Whirlpool dropped 1.2% to 194.56.

92,WHR,"The Federal Reserve surprised markets with its relatively hawkish outlook Wednesday after raising interest rates for the second time in 2017. Most Fed policymakers still expect another rate hike in 2017, and three more next year. The central bank also said it will start to normalize its massive $4.5 trillion balance sheet by year-end, with the details suggesting a slightly faster run-off that some had expectedBefore the Fed announcement, market pricing implied no more rate hikes for another year, and stocks did not react well to Fed hawkishness.The Fed's decision followed the latest in a series of surprisingly tame inflation reports. The Labor Department reported earlier in the day that core consumer price inflation, stripping out volatile food and energy prices, fell to a two-year low 1.7%.After the Fed's policy statement, the weak-Nasdaq, strong-Dow trade resumed as Fed Chair Janet Yellen elaborated on the U.S. central bank's views.The Nasdaq fell 0.7% in late afternoon trade, while the S&P 500 fell 0.25%. But the Dow industrials turned up 0.2%, helped by rebounding banks.Expectations of a slower rate-hike trajectory hit Dow component JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC) and other bank stocks ahead of the Fed announcement. But JPMorgan and Bank of America erased nearly all their losses by the close, with several banks turning positive.Housing-related stocks were among the lead performers on the stock market today ahead of the news, thanks to the benign rate outlook. Homebuilder D.R. Horton (DRI) rose to a buy zone and hit an 11-year high, but pulled back somewhat as the markets soured.  Home Depot (HD), another Dow component, climbed 1.8%, rebounding from its 50-day line. Whirlpool (WHR) gained 1.4%.Fed policy expectations may continue to be volatile. On Tuesday, market participants were expecting the next rate hike by December. Before the announcement, they saw the Fed on hold until  next June. The 10-year Treasury hit the lowest level since the week of the November election and the 2-year yield saw its sharpest single-day drop since Brexit, but yields rebounded somewhat after the Fed statement.Even as the Fed has been on a tightening path, financial conditions have been easing, with the 10-year Treasury yield sinking about 50 basis points since mid-December.While economists still expect inflation to firm in the months ahead, their confidence in that outcome is waning after broad weakness in airline, apparel, auto and medical care costs.The Fed noted that inflation has been cooling, but Yellen said in her press conference that ebbing inflation appeared to be related to one-time changes, citing wireless data and prescription drug prices.""On a 12-month basis, inflation has declined recently and, like the measure excluding food and energy prices, is running somewhat below 2%,"" the Fed said in its statement. The Fed lowered its inflation forecast for 2017 but expects inflation to hit its 2% target over the medium term.Separately, the Fed detailed how it plans to reduce its balance sheet gradually. It'll let some expiring assets roll off the balance sheet, starting with $10 billion a month, or $6 billion from Treasuries and $4 billion from mortgage-backed securities.Jefferies economists characterized the telegraphed balance-sheet reductions as ""fairly aggressive"" compared to expectations.The caps will rise every three months by $6 billion for Treasuries and $4 billion for MBS until they reach $30 billion and $20 billion, respectively.Officials didn't reveal the exact timing of when the process will begin this year, as well as specifically how large the portfolio might be when finished.The CME Group FedWatch tool showed that markets now don't expect the next rate hike until March 2018. At that point, the Fed will likely have a new leader, with Fed Chair Janet Yellen's term ending in February.With job growth running ""well in excess"" of the trend growth in the labor force, Yellen said it's prudent to remove accommodation to avoid having to tighten too quickly later.RELATED:These Stunning Economic Reports Could Give Fed PauseBank Stocks Testing Key Levels Amid Fed, Weak DataThis Hot Sector Is Putting Stocks In Buy Range: Investing Action PlanHome Depot Finds Support In Buy Zone As Amazon Rattles Retailers

93,WHR,"XStocks thundered to a second day of strong gains Tuesday as big-name earnings reports powered weighty moves across the market.The Dow Jones industrial average brought home a 1.1% gain, gaining some breathing room above its 50-day moving average and closing within 1% of its March 1 peak. The Nasdaq cleared the 6000 level, rising 0.7% to another fresh high. The S&P 500 climbed 0.6%, ending just below its March 1 high.Alcoa (AA) surged 9%. Miner Freeport McMoRan (FCX) rattled off a 6% gain. Whirlpool (WHR), Biogen (BIIB) and JetBlue Airways (JBLU) rose 4% apiece.Caterpillar (CAT) was a prime mover, powering up 8% — easily leading the Dow industrials and the S&P 500 — and pushing the stock's two-day gain to 11%, marking its best week since the Nov. 8 presidential election. The heavy-equipment maker reported a 100% gain in Q1 earnings and a 4% rise in revenue, its first revenue advance in ten quarters.The stock move cleared two buy points, a traditional flat-base entry of 99.46 and a more-aggressive entry of 97.99, leaving shares at their highest level since November 2014.Netflix (NFLX) streamed 6% higher to top the Nasdaq 100 on news that the company landed an agreement with iQiyi, owned by internet search giant Baidu (BIDU), to begin offering content in China. Chinese regulators have barred Netflix from offering content directly to consumers in the country. Netflix also announced Monday it would issue a $1.08 billion bond offering to investors outside the U.S. to fund new content and strategic acquisitions. The gain sent Netflix shares past a 148.39 buy point in a three-weeks tight pattern. Baidu shares rose 4% Tuesday, to just below a cup-base buy point of 188.64. Earnings from Baidu are due Thursday after the close.Steel alloys specialist Allegheny Technologies (ATI) forged a 10% gain after reporting that earnings growth accelerated to 128% and revenue popped 14% in the first quarter. Shares ended the session up 16% so far this week, beginning up the right side of a three-month consolidation.On the downside, weak quarterly results sent Ryder Systems (R) down 13% and ExpressScripts (ESRX) to an 11% loss.Verizon (VZ) marked the Dow's worst loss, down 0.6% after news reports said Verizon offered $1.8 billion for Straight Path Communications (STRP), outsizing AT&T's (T) earlier $1.6 billion offer. Straight Path bolted 15% higher. AT&T eased 0.2%.Earnings reports scheduled after the close include  AT&T, Exxon Mobil (XOM), Illumina (ILMN), Cree (CREE) and Macon Technology Solutions (MTSI), among many others.RELATED:Caterpillar Breaks Out, Steamrolls Earnings EstimatesNetflix Enters China - And A New Buy Zone

94,WHR,"XA powerful rebound Monday that left the Nasdaq at a new high and hefted the Dow industrials and S&P 500 back above the 50-day moving average for the first time since April 11 was only the start of the action.The Nasdaq vaulted 1.2%, while the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average rose 1.1%. Small caps slightly outpaced the general action, with the Russell 2000 notching a 1.3% gain.Up next is an after-hours reporting session with earnings reports from Whirlpool (WHR), Barrick Gold (ABX) and Range Resources (RRC), setting the tone for a week jammed with economic and political news, and in which more than 190 S&P 500 and a dozen Dow-listed stocks are set to report earnings. Alcoa (AA) was up 1% in extended trading following its results. Express Scripts (ESRX) also announced results and was unchanged.The first-round presidential vote in France on Sunday set up a second round between far-right-wing candidate Marine Le Pen and centrist challenger Emmanuel Macron, scheduled for May 7.  Macron's victory and his strength in polls ahead of the second-round vote eased some investor concerns that France was headed for an exit from the European Union, a move that could threaten the union.Stocks also received a boost from the White House, where news reports said President Trump had called for a tax plan by Wednesday that prioritized trimming the corporate tax rate to 15% over holding down the deficit.  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn are scheduled to meet with key GOP congressional leaders to discuss the plan on Tuesday, according to the Wall Street Journal.The combined result sent steel makers, banks and miners soaring. JPMorgan (JPM) led the Dow Jones industrial average with a  nearly 4% gain. Goldman Sachs (GS) jumped 3% and Caterpillar (CAT) climbed nearly 3%.Fiber-optic telecom stocks also outpaced the general market, led by Infinera (INFN) and Applied Optoelectronics (AAOI). Both stocks are not near valid buy points.C.R. Bard (BCR) easily topped the S&P 500, spiking 20% after reporting first-quarter earnings as news broke that the company would be acquired by Becton Dickinson (BDX) in a deal valued at $24 billion. Becton slumped 4%, hurt by a downgrade to credit watch negative, due to financial risk associated with the Bard deal, from Standard & Poor's.Hasbro (HAS) thrashed out a 6% gain following strong first-quarter results, seizing a new high and narrowly topping a 101.18 buy point in a flat base. Shares remained in a buy range.Dell Technologies (DVMT) popped 3% in strong trade, enough to take a new high and clear a flat-base buy point of 65.88.  The IBD Leaderboard and Swing Trader Stock is up 31% since its breakout from a cup-with-handle base in November.Oil and gold both dropped almost 1% during the session, but miners and energy stocks fared reasonably well. Among Nasdaq stocks, Biomarin Pharmaceuticals (BMRN) and Xylinx (XLNX) led, up more than 5% each. Xylinx ended just below a double-bottom base buy point of 60.91.Micron Technology (MU) took the Nasdaq's hardest hit, down a bit less than 3% in strong trade. The memory-chip maker ended 11% below its late-March high and is still holding support at its 10-week moving average.RELATED:Top Stocks In Buy Zone Ahead Of Results: Investing Action PlanThese Three Stocks Break Out As Nasdaq Nears New High

""That really hasn't happened yet.""Car Dealers Boost IncentivesThe troubles are extending beyond smokestack-type companies. Microsoft (MSFT) reported enduring a challenging macroeconomic climate in China, and virtualization software developer VMware (VMW) reported sluggish China business.Some companies selling big-ticket consumer goods have been disappointed as well. Household appliance giant Whirlpool (WHR) said it had strong growth but noted ""a lower demand environment in China than we had originally thought it was going to be.""General Motors (GM) said moderation and price competition in China's auto sector have been worse than anticipated, and the carmaker now sees the industry growing in the ""low single-digit range"" this year, down from a prior view of 6%-8% growth.Analysts at Sanford Bernstein have estimated that capacity utilization in China's auto industry has declined, and car dealerships are offering more generous incentives.But GM remained bullish on China long-term and expressed optimism that it can weather the near-term challenges with new models, improved product mix and aggressive cost cuts.Some other U.S. consumer-facing companies, especially those that enjoy extra brand cachet, have been bright spots in an otherwise gloomy picture.China's iPhone BonanzaApple reported that fiscal Q3 revenue shot up 112% to $13.2 billion in its greater Chinese market, which includes Taiwan. The Cupertino, Calif.-based tech giant said it plans to open 40 stores in China within the next 12 months.Starbucks (SBUX) reported that same-store sales in the China/Asia Pacific region jumped 11% in fiscal Q3 and maintained plans to open 850 stores there this fiscal year vs. 600 in the Americas and 200 in the Europe-Middle East-Africa region.And Nike (NKE), which reported its latest results last month, counts China as its fastest growing region. In its fiscal year that ended in May, the athletic gear giant's greater China sales leapt 18%. Meanwhile, consumer staples like Coca-Cola (KO) have seen sales volumes in China start to improve after slowing in 2014.One wild card could be China's roller-coaster stock market, which soared earlier this year only to see its worst decline since the 2008 financial crisis. While stock ownership is still relatively narrow in China, GM pointed to the ""potential recovery from the current reaction to the volatilities in the stock market"" as something it will monitor.Although China's shift is seen as necessary for more sustainable growth, the process of change can be awkward and painful.""In the long run, it's good for everybody,"" said Angel Ubide, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. ""In the near term, there are going to be winners and losers.""

126,WHR,"Keurig Green Mountain (GMCR) and big backer Coca-Cola (KO) are working to dethrone incumbent cold drink machine maker SodaStream (SODA) with their Keurig Kold, but a new appliance from Whirlpool (WHR) and Anheuser-Busch InBev (BUD) is also making waves.The B.blend, which is the result of a four-year collaboration between the appliance maker and beer company, is an all-in-one machine that can make hot coffee as well as cold juice and soda. The device went on sale Tuesday in Sao Paulo, Brazil, for about $1,150.The B.blend is based on technology that comes from a licensing deal with Bevyz, which Keurig fully acquired at the end of last year, several months after the August announcement from Whirlpool about the launch of the platform.Depending on demand, Whirlpool and Anheuser-Busch plan to expand sales to the entire South American country and beyond.Whirlpool and Anheuser-Busch shares were down a fraction in afternoon trading in the stock market today.Keurig Kold, which can make iced coffee, soda, sports drinks and iced tea, will start selling online this fall and in select stores this holiday, but it won't reach all retail stores until the 2016 holiday season.It's priced starting at $300, which left some analysts cold on last week's post-earnings conference call.The Keurig 2.0 carafe-and-pod duo is $200, but sales have been weak, in part due to backlash over the latest brewer's unlicensed pod lockout technology.Argus Research analyst John Staszak on Wednesday downgraded the at-home beverage machine maker to hold from buy, and says Keurig is seen facing pressure from price cuts on its K-cup pods that it manufactures for Starbucks (SBUX) and Kraft Foods (KRFT).Costs associated with the new Kold machine, as well as 2.0 markdowns, are expected to weigh on near-term earnings, Staszak says.Keurig shares rose fractionally Wednesday afternoon. The stock is trading a steep 43% off of its all-time high of 158.87 reached last November. Just this month, shares have dropped 23%.And in addition to competition from the high-end, early-adopter machine from Whirlpool and Anheuser-Busch, Keurig also faces pressure from SodaStream, whose machines range in price from $80 to $180.But SodaStream sales have been plunging. Shares are in an extended downtrend and are 73% below their August 2011 all-time high of 79.72.Follow Alissa Williams on Twitter: @IBD_AWilliams.

On July 12, Microsoft cleared a 53.10 buy point in a double-bottom base, but volume was inadequate. The stock never found strong volume until Wednesday's gap up. A double-bottom base is a bullish pattern shaped like the letter W.An individual investor might want to watch whether these stocks breaking out can close above their buy points and whether they can keep up the strong volume for the entire session. Sometimes a breakout will fade in price and volume as the session progresses, which sends a more indefinite message.

142,WHR,"XU.S. stocks shot up at the open Monday as global markets responded favorably to France's presidential vote on Sunday.The Dow Jones industrial average and S&P 500 jumped 1% while the Nasdaq added 1.2% each.The success of centrist candidate Emmanuel Macron in the first round of France's presidential election provides a powerful challenge to Marine Le Pen, leader of the National Front party, and raises the odds that France will remain a member of the European Union.

143,WHR,"LAS VEGAS – Voice-based user interfaces are becoming a huge deal and Amazon.com (AMZN) has taken a commanding lead.At CES 2017, numerous companies announced that they are using Amazon's Alexa voice-response technology to control their devices with spoken commands. Alexa is the technology that powers Amazon's Echo smart speakers.Alexa has jumped out ahead of rivals such as Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google Assistant, Microsoft's (MSFT) Cortana and Apple's (AAPL) Siri in what is shaping up as the next big computing platform.Amazon is using Alexa to boost its e-commerce business and add functionality to products like Echo and Amazon Fire TV. Google sees voice user interfaces as a threat to its web search business. (As much as 25% of web searches are now driven by voice.) Meanwhile, Microsoft and Apple are using voice to improve their operating systems.Voice-based user interfaces allow for hands-free control of devices. Consumers can use spoken commands to control thermostats, lighting, streaming music players and other gadgets. With gadgets like Echo, users can ask questions and do web searches by asking questions aloud and getting spoken responses.Amazon reportedly has sold about 5 million Echo speakers to date.Amazon is pushing hard to connect Echo to other devices throughout the home to create a broader ecosystem.Since it opened up its Alexa technology to third-party developers in June 2015, over 7,000 applications (or ""skills"") have been created, Mike George, vice president of Amazon.com's Alexa unit, said at an LG Electronics press conference on Wednesday.LG announced that it has added Alexa to its Smart InstaView refrigerator, which features a 29-inch touch LCD display. With Alexa voice services, people can ask the refrigerator to search for recipes, play music, check the weather, add items to a grocery list, place orders through Amazon.com and other tasks.Among the many consumer electronics products using Alexa at CES were smart speakers from Lenovo and Monster, lamps from General Electric (GE), washers and dryers from Whirlpool (WHR), home safety and security products from First Alert, kitchen appliances from Gourmia and lawn sprinklers from Rachio.NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) was at CES to show off chips with embedded voice technologies for access Amazon Alexa and Google Home. It is helping device manufacturers that want to add voice capabilities to products like coffee pots and microwave ovens, but lack the in-house expertise. Qualcomm (QCOM) is in the process of buying NXP for $47 billion.The four-day CES conference ends today.RELATED:Amazon Alexa, Vocal Computing Get Heard At CES 2017

144,WHR,"Television sets equipped with Amazon (AMZN) Fire TV along with a voice remote powered with Amazon Alexa will arrive later this year.The new 4K TVs will be made by Westinghouse, Element and Seiki — all owned by China-based Tong Fang Global. The TVs will come with 4K Ultra HD picture quality, with screen sizes ranging from 43 inches to 65 inches, according to a release announcing the plan. The announcement was made at the CES show underway in Las Vegas.Separately, Whirlpool (WHR) said that it has partnered with Amazon on a line of voice-controlled appliances, launching in early 2017. The appliances will feature voice-control capabilities through Amazon Alexa,  which is the technology also used in the Amazon Echo digital assistant.Whirlpool said Alexa can be used to pause and start washers and dryers and also interact with smart ovens and refrigerators, among other things.Amazon stock rose 0.46% to 753.29 in the stock market today.It is the first licensing agreement by Amazon calling for a television manufacturer to add Fire TV into the set. Amazon is the latest vendor of streaming TV adapters and set-top boxes to have its TV operating platform integrated into smart TVs. It joins Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google Chromecast and privately held Roku, among others.In addition to watching standard TV, viewers can also switch over to streaming content provided by Amazon without needing a Fire TV stick plugged into the set or a third-party set-top box.With the voice remotes, users can search channels and apps, manage TV settings and control smart-home devices on verbal command. Pricing would be announced closer to retail availability. RELATED:Amazon Fights Alphabet, Microsoft, Apple For Smart Device CloutAlexa, Why Did Morningstar Rate You As A Durable Business Pillar?

166,WHR,"Some see necessity as the mother of invention.Yet without proper production values and marketing techniques, an invention can go nowhere.Consider Howard Johnson, who didn't invent ice cream, but recognized its value, mass-produced it and made 28 flavors the cornerstone of his restaurant empire.Consider Richard Sears and Alvah Roebuck, who didn't invent the direct-market catalog, but built the largest catalog sales company in America.William Hoover, like Johnson, Sears and Roebuck, stands as an entrepreneurial giant.A Winning GripHoover (1849-1932) didn't invent the electric suction sweeper, but recognized its utility and used his production and marketing wits to transform it into a trusted and desirable product — the Hoover Vacuum Cleaner — as well as found the global Hoover Co.""The idea for a new invention or enterprise doesn't have to always spring from the mind of the entrepreneur,"" Fordham University business professor Robert Hurley, an expert on innovation and marketing, told IBD. ""But for entrepreneurs to be successful, there needs to be someone on the team — like William H. Hoover — who is able to notice big ideas and make sure they get executed fast and well.""Ahead of Hoover's climb were the 1907 doings of an aspiring inventor named James Spangler, who cleaned floors for a living in a Canton, Ohio, department store.Spangler used a clumsy, heavy, inefficient carpet sweeper that kicked up dust. That worsened his asthma, so he had to act: Quit his job or figure out how to craft a dustless electric suction sweeper.Rather than quit work, he developed the prototype for what would be the Hoover vacuum cleaner.Spangler patented his invention in 1908 and began selling it door-to-door in the Canton area.In ""Entrepreneurs: The Men and Women Behind Famous Brand Names and How They Made It,"" authors Joseph and Suzy Fucini recounted how Hoover discovered the new contraption:""One of the first sales that Spangler made was to his cousin, Susan Hoover, the wife of a prosperous Ohio saddle maker. ... When Susan's husband, William H. Hoover, saw her new sweeper, he was impressed. A former railroad president and the first elected mayor of New Berlin, Ohio, Hoover had a well-deserved reputation for being an astute businessman.""Although the car had yet to make its mark on the nation, Hoover believed that it would replace the horse and buggy. So he figured his days as a prosperous saddle maker were numbered.That gave him the impetus to grab the vacuum. All it needed was motor improvement and some marketing, and it was a lock to be a reliable electric household appliance.Spangler may have hatched the idea, but Hoover's financial heft, production and marketing know-how made the vacuum hum.In 1908, Hoover bought the patent for the sweeper from Spangler. What he paid is unknown.""What we do know is Hoover, apart from buying the patent, also paid off Spangler's debts and provided him the job opportunity to perfect his invention,"" said Ann Haines, operations coordinator at the Hoover Historical Center in North Canton (formerly New Berlin), Ohio.Patent in hand, Hoover founded Electric Suction Sweeper Co. and named himself president and treasurer. Spangler got the title of superintendent.Soon Hoover had six employees assembling six units a day in a corner of his New Berlin saddle shop.Hoover then spent $207 — or $5,300 in today's money — for ads in the Saturday Evening Post that offered a 10-day free trial of an electric suction sweeper, according to Hoover.com .All InThe Fucinis note that hundreds of homemakers responded.Hoover's marketing twist was not to send the sweeper directly to the customer. Instead, he chose a reputable store in each city where shoppers could pick up the sweeper for the trial, then let outlet managers keep the sales commission.After that, store managers could become dealers in Hoover vacuums. This tact laid the groundwork for a national dealer network that continues as a channel of distribution for Hoover products.Yet Hoover determined soon after his 1908 Saturday Evening Post ad that selling vacuums through dealerships didn't yield enough sales.He figured that many women were wary of the new machine, and the ""only sure way to overcome their doubts would be to take the vacuum into their homes and demonstrate their effectiveness on their living room carpets,"" wrote the Fucinis.So around 1909, Hoover sent an army of eager young men all over America for in-home demonstrations — and the move was a winner.According to Haines, Americans bought 330,000 of his vacuums in 1939 after a start of 372 machines sold in 1908 — when his Model O with attachments went for $75, worth almost $2,000 today. Today's Hoover upright vacuums go for $100 to $200.New Name, New LookMeanwhile, Hoover renamed the firm Hoover Co. in 1922.And kept improving his vacuum cleaners, developing innovative designs and additional attachments to make his product more appealing to consumers.He came up with disposable paper bags for vacuums as well as steam cleaners and self-propelled vacuums, according to Haines.Another noteworthy innovation was the beater bar, introduced in 1926, that was the basis for the advertising slogan, ""It beats, as it sweeps, as it cleans.""Aided by suction, the metal bar tapped the carpet to loosen embedded dirt while a bristle brush swept dirt up and out of the carpet.Since then, the beater bar has gone through many tweaks and refinements and is still used in most Hoover vacuums today.Other Hoover firsts included the vacuum cleaner headlight and the side-mounted hose feature.Hoover also thought globally. He opened a factory in Canada in 1911 and another in England in 1919.A century later, many in England refer to vacuuming as ""hoovering.""In 2007, Techtronic Industries, based in Hong Kong, bought the Hoover floor care business from Whirlpool (WHR) for $107 million, reported the Wall Street Journal.During World War II, Hoover switched from producing vacuum cleaners to items such as helmet liners and bomb fuses. Vacuum production resumed postwar.The Hoover Historical Center — his Victorian boyhood home — recounts the Hoover legacy. Which is: W.H. Hoover, living in northern Ohio at the turn of the 20th century, invested in a rough-hewn idea he believed in, turned it into a reliable cleaning solution, brilliantly sold it and continually improved it.He died at age 82, producing more than machines. He had six children, all of whom were involved in the family business.Colleen Olson, a 68-year-old educator, remembers how her Midwest family relied on Hoover vacuums. ""Where I come from,"" she said, ""the Hoover name resonates with quality and dependability.""

After-tax margin grew from a minuscule 0.5% in the second half of 2011 to 2.5% and 2.7% in the first half of 2012. OK, 2.5% and 2.7% aren't great after-tax margins, but they were headed in the right direction. And for turnaround candidates, direction is initially more important than location.The B+ Accumulation Rating pointed to buying by institutional investors. The chart also pointed to fund support.Look at the eight weekly closes on the right side of the base 1 — just before the handle formed.All eight weeks involved gains. All the closes were high in the weekly ranges. Volume was up from the previous week in five of the eight weeks 2 and above average in two of the weeks.Whirlpool cleared a 75.80 buy point in early September and advanced 77% in about eight months.

"
169,WHR,"Stocks struggled a bit and moved lower yesterday - while remaining in the range that I pointed out in yesterday's note....2080/2100 - Late morning we tested the 2080 level before finding some support and rally into the closing bell.... Trading was light as investors/traders appeared unwilling to commit to the market ahead of the onslaught of earnings today - think Apple (AAPL),  Facebook (FB),  Procter & Gamble (PG), EXXON Mobil (XOM), BAXTER (BAX), 3M (MMM), Freeport-McMoRan (FCX), Corning (GLW), Lockheed Martin (LMT), Eli Lilly (LLY) (Revenues beat, but EPS missed by 0.02 cts) & Whirlpool (WHR) (missed on the top line - revenues - and missed on the bottom line. reported $2.63 vs. exp of $2.68) that are all announcing today and ahead of tomorrow's FOMC announcement.Remember - today begins the two day FED meeting and there is a lot of anticipation and paralysis about what they will say tomorrow. Again - the mkt does not expect a change in rates at all...but it does expect some clarification in terminology concerning June and the next expected hike......Recall that the last hike in December, sent the mkts into a tailspin.....causing the FED to become a bit more 'dovish' as she searched for a reason to calm the mkts.....this time citing unstable global mkts as the culprit...but since then - the mkts have come roaring back - with the S&P now up 2.1% and the Dow up 3.74% - off of what looked like a disastrous year.....As a result of the strength - expect Janet to intimate a return to a path to higher rates......not necessarily faster, just a bit higher.....Expect every word to be parsed and every sentence to be deconstructed as everyone looks for the next 'clue'.Now why the low volumes? Well there are a number of reasons really - never mind the current regulatory environment, and the abuse suffered by so many managers during the 1Q - but yesterday - there was no 'news', right? No eco reports, no significant earnings, no speeches, no big international events, no nothing.....so why do anything? The mkt held in tight - giving no reason to deviate from the plan.....and so the only ones really playing yesterday were the HFT guys and - and asset managers that were tweaking core positions....but tweaking does not mean a change of investment strategy at all...it just means tweaking.....Now oil did come under a bit of pressure yesterday - falling by 2.4% to end the day at $$42.64- but all that tells me is that the recent run up in oil was a bit premature given the current glut and lack of a deal between the OPEC nations etc. So if oil trades within the current band - $39.50/$44 - it's all good.....Why should it break down or surge higher just yet? This morning we see oil up small as the dollar appears a bit weaker......(think no rate hike). Remember - we will get the weekly API (American Petroleum Institute) report this afternoon.Now yesterday we did get a broad measure of the housing mkt.....- but again - these stats are no longer the mkt moving events that they were......although - that could change...you see - yesterday was NEW HOME SALES....and typically this is good barometer of the state of the broader US economy...and guess what? Another disappointment.....New Home Sales FELL 1.5% vs. the exp of a rise of 1.6%.......and why should we be a bit concerned?Well - This is the time of the year when new home sales should be strong....so is this disappointment just another barometer of a weakening economic picture? What is really mind boggling is that we are now a decade into the housing collapse....a decade - that is 10 yrs of an incomplete recovery...as pockets of single family housing continue to stall..... New Home Sales on a total unit basis came in at 511k units - significantly below the 50 yr average of more than 650,000 units. During the Greenspan era - Subprime loans/mortgages propelled sales of New Homes into the stratosphere - sending them as high as 1.28 million units in 2005, - the yr before the beginning of the crash.......a crash created by the adjustable rate mortgages that managed to destroy so many people - triggering waves of foreclosures that then ignited the Great Financial Crisis of 2007 - 2010 (some say the crisis is still ongoing.....I'll leave that up to you...).US futures are up 2 pts in early trading...as the mkt gets ready to react to the slew of those earnings reports noted above. Whirlpool - which we noted missed the numbers is quoted down about $10 bucks in pre-mkt trading....quoted NOT trading just yet....so let's see what investors/traders think about that.....Today is also a big economic day...lots of macro data to consider....Durable Goods exp of +1.9%, ex trans of 0.5%, Cap Good Orders of +0.6%, Cap Goods Shipped of +0.9%, Markit US PMI of 52 and the Richmond Fed Survey of 12. The earnings will all be happening prior to the open while the macro data begins at 8:30 and goes until 10 am. This will create a lot of noise in early trading...but once it settles in after 11 am....then expect the discussion to revolve around the FED once analysts consider the implications of whatever today's macro data reveals.Again - I expect the broader mkt to hold tight within the 2080/2100 range until tomorrow. (Think FED paralysis). Individual names today will get rewarded or punished depending on what they reported and what they say about the future....All in a day's work.....Take Good Care

176,WHR,"Special Report: CES 2016 Tech Show NewsLAS VEGAS — IBM's ([STOCK[IBM]]) cognitive computing system, Watson, has graduated from winning ""Jeopardy"" to predicting hypoglycemic events for diabetes patients and providing the brains for a customer service robot.IBM CEO Ginni Rometty discussed three partnerships involving IBM's Watson during her keynote speech at CES 2016 on Wednesday in Las Vegas. The massive annual Consumer Electronics Show ends Saturday.Rometty talked about how Medtronic ([STOCK[MDT]]), Under Armour ([STOCK[UA]]) and SoftBank Robotics are using Watson's big data analytics capabilities in vastly different ways.Medtronic CEO Omar Ishrak said his company is using Watson [PAGE[technology]] for diabetes [PAGE[management]]. In a new app rolling out this summer, medical technology firm Medtronic will track a diabetes patient's blood-sugar levels and predict life-threatening hypoglycemic events up to three hours in advance of symptoms.Under Armour CEO Kevin Plank said his company hooked up to IBM's Watson because he wanted his customers to get more meaningful data-backed health and fitness insights.The company's UA Record app will provide athletes with timely, evidence-based coaching around their sleep, fitness, activity and nutrition, including outcomes achieved based on others ""like you.""The app can act as a personal health consultant, fitness trainer and assistant, he said.Plank said he was driven to create the app because he was frustrated by the fact that people have more data about the health of their cars or investments than their own bodies.Watson also is providing artificial intelligence for a social humanoid robot called Pepper from SoftBank Robotics. Pepper currently is being used as a customer service robot in a limited number of Mizuho Financial Group's ([STOCK[MFG]]) bank branches and Nestle ([STOCK[NSRGY]]) coffee shops in Japan.Watson's cognitive computing capabilities are ready to be put to use in a host of industries, Rometty said.Also at CES, IBM announced ventures involving Watson with medical diagnostic firm Pathway Genomics and home appliance maker Whirlpool ([STOCK[WHR]]).Pathway Genomics unveiled a test version of the Pathway Genomics OME app, powered by Watson. The app merges cognitive computing and deep learning with precision medicine and genetics to enable Pathway Genomics to provide consumers with personalized wellness information.Meanwhile, connected appliances from Whirlpool, such as kitchen and laundry machines, will use Watson services, including cognitive analytics, to provide more personalized services to consumers.

191,WHR,"Many retailers, especially those largely dependent on brick-and-mortar stores for sales and profits, are suffering through a rough patch, but home improvement chains such as Home Depot (HD) and Lowe's (LOW) should do just fine, analysts say.Home Depot will report third-quarter results Tuesday, followed by Lowe's on Wednesday. Both are expected to log double-digit profit growth on sales gains in the mid-single digits.The home improvement sector marches to its ""own drummer"" — the housing market — ""and should be less impacted by the recent retail malaise,"" said analyst Scot Ciccarelli of RBC Capital Markets in a client note.Private fixed-residential investment, viewed as a proxy for U.S. housing-related spending, was up 10.7% in the third quarter from a year earlier, the fourth straight quarter of double-digit growth, he noted.Home Depot's earnings are seen rising 19% from a year ago to $1.32 per share on revenue of $2.18 billion, up 6%, according to analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. Lowe's is expected to earn 78 cents per share, up 32% from last year, on revenue of $1.43 billion, up 5%.While an unseasonably warm autumn can disrupt retail sales patterns, it might actually have benefited the two home improvement chains by extending the busy summer/fall selling season, he said.And he noted ""fairly positive"" commentary from vendors such as Sherwin-Williams (SHW), Fortune Brands (FBHS) and Whirlpool (WHR) during the third quarter.However, rural lifestyle chain Tractor Supply (TSCO) faced ""modest weather-related headwinds"" on heat-related products during the warmer-than-usual quarter. But overall, Tractor Supply benefited from the extended summer selling season, the analyst said.Shares of Home Depot, which tumbled 3% on Friday, closed up 0.7% on the stock market today. Lowe's finished 2.2% higher after losing 3.6% Friday.Home Depot and Lowe's both earn Composite Ratings from IBD of 82 out of a best-possible 99, based on metrics such as growth in earnings and stock, but that is down from the low 90s three months ago.Follow Marilyn Alva on Twitter @IBD_MAlva.

A 16% EPS gain, a 15% rise in revenue and a $5.1 billion share buyback initiative were all part or the third-quarter package. Paid click volume, a carefully monitored metric, jumped a better-than-expected 23%. Alphabet finished Thursday's regular session a bit less than 5% below a 713.33 buy point in a 14-week cup base.Amazon.com (AMZN) held up a 10% advance ahead of Friday's open after soaring in extended trading on Thursday.

The Oakland, Calif.-based operation reported earnings rose 11%, in line with consensus expectations. A 30% revenue increase was smaller than forecast, and management lowered Q4 revenue guidance to well below consensus views.

Shares rose 4% on the stock market today and still ranks No. 1 on the IBD 50 list of top-performing growth stocks.Nvidia CEO Jen-Hsun Huang kicked off CES with a rousing opening-night keynote speech that detailed his company's efforts to lead in the race to build self-driving cars. At the show, Nvidia announced partnerships with auto parts suppliers ZF and Bosch and automakers Audi and Mercedes-Benz.Qualcomm showed off its first 10-nanometer-node processor, the Snapdragon 835, at the show. Also, in a keynote speech, Qualcomm CEO Steve Mollenkopf touted his company's role in bringing superfast 5G wireless technology to the masses.Meanwhile, voice command-and-control technology was the talk of CES 2017. And Amazon led the way with Alexa, the technology that powers its Echo smart speakers.Voice-based user interfaces allow for hands-free control of devices. Consumers can use spoken commands to control TVs, streaming music players, thermostats, lighting and other things. With gadgets like Echo, users can ask questions and do web searches by asking questions aloud and getting spoken responses.At CES 2017, consumer electronics products using Alexa included smart speakers from Lenovo and Monster, refrigerators from LG Electronics, washers and dryers from Whirlpool (WHR), lamps from General Electric (GE), and robotic vacuum cleaners from Samsung, to name just a few.Apple and Microsoft were left in the dust in terms of broadening the use of their voice-based virtual assistants, based on third-party products shown at CES. While Amazon, Google and Microsoft had some level of official participation in CES, Apple was a no-show, as usual. It didn't exhibit, have a private meeting room or participate in panel discussions at the show.Several news articles noted that Apple's lack of a presence at CES was particularly damaging for the company if it wants to create an ecosystem around its Siri voice assistant or HomeKit smart home software.Still, Apple stock rose 0.92% to 119 in the stock market today, in a buy zone from a buy point of 118.12 first touched on Friday, and trading at a 13-month high. Microsoft stock fell 0.32%, while Nvidia stock rose 4.1%.RELATED:Nvidia Leads Broad Chip Sector Gains, Gets CES BounceCES 2017: News From The World's Largest Consumer Tech Show

266,WHR,"As a teenage farmhand in 19th-century Iowa, Frederick Maytag often heard from elders that alcohol and machinery don't mix.
"
267,WHR,"He learned why.
"
268,WHR,"Arms, legs and sometimes whole bodies were mangled when workers fell into the mouths of rickety threshing machines that separated grain from stalks and husks.
"
269,WHR,"Some accidents happened because farm laborers guzzled beer as they worked in hot weather.
"
270,WHR,"Disturbed by the scene, Maytag (1857-1937) aimed to develop a thresher that would sift more grain while saving lives and limbs.
"
271,WHR,"As an entrepreneur, his resolve led to safer farm equipment. It also spurred the invention of the first washing machine operated by an outside power source.
"
272,WHR,"Maytag Co., which he founded, went on to churn out millions of eponymous washing machines that became household names.
"
273,WHR,"Maytag ""had a vision for everything. When he developed a product, he wanted it to be a quality product. He wanted it to be the best,"" Leland Smith, a member of the Jasper County Historical Society in Iowa, where Maytag's factory was based, told IBD.
"
274,WHR,"Frederick Louis Maytag was born in Cook County, Ill., of German immigrant stock and moved to Iowa in a covered wagon as a boy. The first of 10 children, he worked the family farm and moonlighted as a coal delivery boy.
"
275,WHR,"Maytag had little formal education. But he learned early from his old-country parents that hard work and quality go hand in hand.
"
276,WHR,"""If something wasn't right, he'd make it right,"" Smith said.
"
277,WHR,"A bit of old-time religion from his parents also helped Maytag grow into a compassionate adult eager to improve the lot of local farmers.
"
278,WHR,"He took a job at 24 at a farm tool firm in Newton, Iowa, and increased his knowledge of the trade by selling products door to door.
"
279,WHR,"He bought a share in the farm firm and dabbled in local politics before making his next move.
"
280,WHR,"Firmly On The Ground
"
281,WHR,"In 1893, Maytag, his two brothers-in-law and a local inventor named George Parsons pooled $2,400 to found a farm implement company.
"
282,WHR,"Maytag had an eye for talent. While not an inventor himself, he could quickly grasp the potential of a cutting-edge device.
"
283,WHR,"Maytag joined the venture because he knew that Parsons had designs for a new kind of threshing machine. Parsons also had plans for a band cutter that severed the cords on tied bunches of wheat straw, as well as a thresher attachment called a self-feeder.
"
284,WHR,"The self-feeder made it unnecessary to manually feed straw through a threshing cylinder — a frequent source of farm mishaps.
"
285,WHR,"The new device was one of the first machines meant to make farm work safer, not just more efficient.
"
286,WHR,"The self-feeder was an instant hit with farmers, and by 1902 the company was the largest feeder maker in the world. It soon pulled itself out of the red and amassed capital.
"
287,WHR,"Not one to rest on his laurels, Maytag followed up with other product lines. In 1905, the company introduced the Success Corn Husker & Shredder, making it possible to mechanically process ears of corn. Hay presses and other ingenious farm gadgets followed.
"
288,WHR,"But Maytag and his partners faced a nagging problem: Some of their devices had design flaws and broke easily. They were soon fending off customer complaints and charges of poor quality.
"
289,WHR,"What to do? Maytag searched, and soon his eye for business patterns led to a discovery. The entrepreneur noticed that hardly any service complaints came from a specific area of Minnesota where the firm sold its machinery.
"
290,WHR,"Following up, Maytag found that a sharp mechanic named Howard Snyder was fixing the machines.
"
291,WHR,"Specifically, Snyder had a knack for repairing the attachments on Maytag's devices. He also had a slew of ideas for improving the machines to make them work better.
"
292,WHR,"Maytag hired Snyder and had him overhaul the firm's products.
"
293,WHR,"Smart move. The mechanic removed design flaws and enlarged the capacity of Maytag's huskers and shredders.
"
294,WHR,"Snyder was so successful, Maytag was able to guarantee that his new huskers and shredders would have twice the capacity of similar machines on the market and would cost less in repairs.
"
295,WHR,"Maytag moved fast, especially when he spotted voids. He searched for years for a product to sell during the winter when sales of farm equipment dragged.
"
296,WHR,"After careful reflection, he found one: a washing machine.
"
297,WHR,"The idea rose as Maytag tried to address the hardship of washing clothes. Plenty of crude contraptions did laundry. All of them mimicked the scrubbing action of human fingers on a washing board.
"
298,WHR,"Maytag sought a better way.
"
299,WHR,"In 1907 he came out with the Pastime washer. It consisted of a wooden tub with a hand crank that turned a dolly inside with wooden pegs. This gizmo pulled dirty clothes through the water and against the sides of a corrugated tub.
"
300,WHR,"A pulley mechanism was added that made it the first washing machine that could operate with an outside power source. And by 1911, Maytag had unveiled a washing machine that ran on an electric motor.
"
301,WHR,"Open The Floodgates
"
302,WHR,"Snyder, who was working as Maytag's chief engineer, came up with a revolutionary improvement. He developed a way to force water through the clothes with a vaned agitator at the tub's bottom, rather than drag the clothes through water with a dolly.
"
303,WHR,"Snyder's idea, with upgrades, lives as the basic design with which most clothes are washed today.
"
304,WHR,"Aware that many U.S. rural areas weren't electrified, Maytag kept pushing to improve his product.
"
305,WHR,"In 1915, he met with a local businessman who was trying to start a gasoline engine firm.
"
306,WHR,"Maytag agreed to finance the venture and had Snyder design a solid gasoline engine that could also operate their washing machines.
"
307,WHR,"The Multi-Motor gasoline engine worked so well, it was used to churn butter and perform other farm tasks.
"
308,WHR,"Maytag kept his foot on the gas.
"
309,WHR,"He saw that the wooden tubs in his washing machines sprang leaks from the constant exposure to water. Aluminum was the best fallback. But the industrial processes of the day couldn't cast aluminum tubs of suitable size. Snyder again came to the rescue, figuring out a way to cast the tubs in one piece without seams.
"
310,WHR,"Clean Move
"
311,WHR,"Maytag Gyrafoam washers, with their new aluminum tubs, sold so well that by 1923 the firm had discontinued selling farm equipment and was producing washing machines full time. The washers helped the company rise to the forefront of the growing laundry appliance business in America.
"
312,WHR,"Sales jumped from $2 million in 1921 to $53 million in 1926. Maytag was listed on the New York Stock Exchange in 1925.
"
313,WHR,"By 1927, Maytag's company had produced 1 million washing machines at its Newton plant. The company went on to make over 40 million laundry and kitchen appliances by the early 21st century, raking in sales of $4.7 billion. It was acquired by Whirlpool (WHR) in April 2006.
"
314,WHR,"Maytag had a penchant for risking all on innovations. From 1907 to 1912 he dabbled in making cars, vacuum cleaners and even fountain pens. With those ventures failing, washing machines were his greatest calling.
"
315,WHR,"Maytag used his wealth to elevate the community. He helped build the YMCA, hospital and park, as well as the first air-conditioned hotel west of the Mississippi in Newton.
"
316,WHR,"And on his 75th birthday in 1932, he distributed among his 1,500 employees $150,000, worth $1.4 million today.

320,WHR,"Whirlpool Corporation (WHR  -  Free Report) reported dismal first-quarter 2018 results as both earnings and sales missed estimates. However, top and bottom lines improved year over year, driven by progress on its global cost-based price increases and fixed cost-reduction initiatives. With this, the company reported negative earnings in six of the last seven quarters. Moreover, this marked its fourth straight quarter of top-line miss.Shares of this leading home-appliances manufacturer declined nearly 0.5% in the after-hours session yesterday, mainly due to the dismal results. Though this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) stock lost 16.9% in the past year, it fared better than the industry’s decline of 29.2%.Q1 HighlightsWhirlpool delivered adjusted earnings per share of $2.81, lagging the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.92. However, its bottom line rose 12% from $2.50 per share earned in the year-ago quarter. Bottom-line results gained from smooth progress on its global cost-based price increases and fixed cost reduction initiatives, which also boosted adjusted EBIT.Whirlpool Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Whirlpool Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Whirlpool Corporation QuoteOn a GAAP basis, the company reported earnings of $1.30 per share, down 35.3% from $2.01 in the prior-year quarter.Revenues of $4,911 million rose nearly 2.6% from the comparable year-ago quarter revenues of $4,786 million. However, the top line fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5,003 million. On a currency-neutral basis, sales declined 0.7%.Further, adjusted operating profit (EBIT) improved 3.5% to $295 million from $285 million in the year-ago quarter. However, operating margin remained flat with last year at 6%. Apart from the aforementioned gains, operating margin was aided by favorable product price/mix and restructuring benefits, partly negated by raw material inflation, unit-volume declines and unfavorable currency.Regional PerformanceRevenues from North America rose 4.2% to $2.5 billion while it increased 2.5% on a currency-neutral basis. Adjusted operating profit margin expanded 20 bps to 11.4%. In dollar terms, operating profit grew 4.7% to $288 million. Notably, operating profit gains reflected from favorable product price/mix and unit-volume growth, which mitigated the negative impact of raw material inflation.Revenues from Latin America declined 2.5% year over year to $898 million. Excluding currency translations, it dipped 3.2%. Adjusted operating margin of 6.3% contracted 90 bps, mainly due to raw material inflation and unfavorable cost productivity, partly neutralized by favorable product price/mix and restructuring benefits. In dollar terms, operating income declined 13.6% to $57 million.Meanwhile, revenues from EMEA increased 10% to $1.1 billion. On a currency-neutral basis, it dropped 8.1%. Whirlpool reported adjusted operating loss of $27 million in the first quarter compared with an operating loss of $23 million in the year-ago quarter. The decline can be attributed to raw material inflation, unit-volume declines and unfavorable currency, offset by favorable product price/mix and cost productivity gains.Revenues from Asia improved nearly 3% to $448 million from $435 million in the prior-year quarter. Excluding currency effects, revenues decreased 1.9%. Moreover, the segment reported adjusted operating profit of $19 million, down 20.8% from the year-year quarter. Further, adjusted operating margin contracted 140 bps to 4.2%. Raw material inflation and negative-currency movements were the main culprits for the decline, partly offset by the favorable impact from cost productivity.Financial PositionWhirlpool had cash and cash equivalents of $1,041 million as of Mar 31, 2018, and long-term debt of $4,190 million.The company used $713 million cash in operating activities in first-quarter 2018 and reported negative free cash flow of $756 million. Capital expenditures for the first quarter totaled $66 million.Going forward, the company remains committed to its balanced capital-allocation approach. Consequently, it expects to continue buying back shares in 2018 while hoping to return more value to shareholders through its recently raised quarterly dividend.On Apr 16, Whirlpool declared a quarterly cash dividend of $1.15 per share, marking an increase of 5 cents from the previous rate of $1.10 per share. This dividend is payable on June 15, to shareholders with record as of May 18.GuidanceFollowing the not-so-impressive first quarter, Whirlpool slightly lowered its GAAP earnings per share forecast while retaining adjusted earnings view for 2018. It continues to envision adjusted earnings per share of $14.50-$15.50. On a GAAP basis, it now anticipates earnings in a range of $12.30-$13.30 per share compared with $12.45-$13.45 per share expected earlier.Further, the company revised its full-year tax-rate expectation to nearly 20%, which along with favorable product price/mix is likely to aid earnings. However, this will be partly offset by lower global-revenue growth and increased raw material inflation.The company reiterated its forecast of generating free cash flow of $1-$1.1 billion in 2018 while operating cash flows are projected to be $1.7-$1.8 billion. This guidance includes restructured cash outlays of approximately $300 million, pension contributions of $35 million and capital expenditures of $675 million related to free cash flows.Looking for Attractive Consumer Discretionary Stocks?

321,WHR,"Whirlpool Corp. (WHR  -  Free Report) is slated to release first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 23, after the closing bell. Last quarter, the company reported a positive earnings surprise of 2.2%.However, Whirlpool missed estimates in three of the last four quarters, with an average negative earnings surprise of 3.2%. Though the company delivered earnings beat in fourth-quarter 2017, it recorded negative surprises in the preceding five quarters. Moreover, the company delivered negative sales surprise in the last three quarters. The primary concerns for the company in recent quarters are raw material cost inflation and unfavorable price/mix. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.What to Expect?The question lingering in investors’ minds now is whether Whirlpool will be able to post positive earnings surprise in the to-be-reported quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is $3.02, reflecting year-over-year growth of 20.8%. We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate declined in the last 30 days. Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $5.02 billion, up nearly 5% from the year-ago quarter.Whirlpool Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Whirlpool Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Whirlpool Corporation QuoteMoreover, we note that the stock has declined 2.8% in the past month. However, this compares better than the industry’s 5.7% downside.Factors at PlayWhirlpool is gaining significantly from its commitment toward long-term goals, supported by robust product pipeline, solid innovations and cost-productivity initiatives. Also, the company outlined significant long-term targets through 2020, driven by brand strength and product portfolio.Through 2020, Whirlpool aims to deliver organic revenue growth of 3-5% annually. Moreover, it targets EBIT margin to exceed 10% by 2020 and envisions earnings per share to grow by 10-15% each year. By 2018, it anticipates free cash flow generation of 5-6% of revenues.Additionally, the company is striving to improve margin through several measures, including cost-based price increments and cost-reduction initiatives, which should also boost business efficiency. The company recently introduced global cost-based pricing for trade customers to mitigate raw-material inflation. Furthermore, it is on track to cut down fixed overhead expenses by $150 million, which will add to the company’s ongoing cost-productivity program.Also, Whirlpool’s focus on boosting consumer demand has increased global price/mix by 50 basis points (bps) in fourth-quarter 2017. This marked the company’s first quarter of positive global price/mix since fourth-quarter 2015. Moreover, its renewed focus on inventory management is expected to boost earnings and free cash flow in the future.However, Whirlpool has been witnessing soft top-line performance as is clear from the negative sales surprise in the last three quarters. The top-line lag can be attributed to weaker demand in the United States and certain countries in Europe. Further, its operating margins continue to be hurt by unit-volume declines and raw-material inflation.Though management expects improved global price/mix and cost savings to benefit margins in 2018, this is likely to be offset by continued raw material inflation. In 2018, the company expects the combined 125 bps margin improvement from favorable price/mix, fixed cost reduction and improved cost productivity, to be more than offset by nearly $200-$250 million increase in raw-material inflation from the prior-year.Let’s wait and see if the company’s strategic efforts can turnaround the top line and margin-related constraints.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Whirlpool is likely to beat estimates this quarter.

Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Whirlpool Beats on Q4 Earnings, Sales LagWhirlpool reported mixed fourth-quarter 2017 results with earnings topping estimates while sales missing the same.

However, the top line fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5,836 million. On a currency-neutral basis, sales declined of 1.6%.

Adjusted operating margin of 7.1% contracted 120 bps, mainly due to raw material inflation, which was partly neutralized by cost productivity and the sale and monetization of some tax credits.Meanwhile, revenues from EMEA increased 1.5% to $1.4 billion. On a currency-neutral basis, it dropped 5.6%. Whirlpool reported adjusted operating profit of $4 million in the fourth quarter, versus adjusted operating profit of $45 million in the year-ago quarter. Further, adjusted operating margin came in at 0.3%, which fell 300 bps from the year-ago period. The decline can be attributed to raw material inflation and adverse product price/mix, negated by favorable cost productivity and restructuring gains.Revenues from Asia declined 5.4% to $333 million from $352 million in the prior-year quarter. Excluding currency effects, revenues decreased 8.3%. Moreover, the segment reported adjusted operating loss of $1 million against operating profit of $19 million in the prior-year quarter. Unit volume declines and raw material inflation were the main culprits for the decline, partly offset by favorable product price/mix.Financial PositionWhirlpool had cash and cash equivalents of $1,196 million as of Dec 31, 2017, and long-term debt of $4,392 million.The company generated cash from operating activities of $1,264 million in 2017.

This guidance includes restructured cash outlays of approximately $300 million, pension contributions of $35 million and capital expenditures of $675 million related to free cash flows.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?It turns out, fresh estimates flatlined during the past month.

323,WHR,"Whirlpool Corporation (WHR  -  Free Report) has been gaining momentum lately on the back of its stringent focus on long-term goals for 2020, innovation strategy as well as global cost-based pricing and fixed cost reduction strategies. However, higher raw material inflation and lower volumes remain impediments.Notably, shares of Whirlpool have gained 3% in the past six months against the industry’s decline of 11.7%. Let’s analyze the pros and cons of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock.Long-Term Goals: A Key Growth DriverWhirlpool is gaining significantly from its commitment toward long-term goals supported by its robust product pipeline, solid innovations and cost productivity initiatives. Also, the company has outlined significant long-term targets through 2020 driven by brand strength and product portfolio.Through 2020, Whirlpool aims to deliver organic revenue growth of 3-5% annualy. Moreover, the company targets EBIT margin to exceed 10% by 2020 and envisions earnings per share to grow by 10-15% each year. By 2018, it anticipates free cash flow generation of 5-6% of revenues.Cost-Productivity Programs Aid MarginsWhirlpool is striving to improve margin through several measures including cost-based price increments and cost-reduction initiatives, which should also boost business efficiency. The company recently introduced global cost-based pricing for its trade customers in order to mitigate raw material inflation. Furthermore, it is on track with initiatives to cut down fixed overhead expenses by $150 million, which will add to the company’s ongoing cost productivity program.Also, Whirlpool’s focus on boosting consumer demand has increased global price/mix by 50 basis points (bps) in fourth-quarter 2017. This marked the company’s first quarter of positive global price/mix since fourth-quarter 2015.In 2018, Whirlpool’s positive global price/mix along with significant progress on cost-saving initiatives is likely to result in margin expansion. Additionally, the company’s renewed focus on inventory management is expected to boost earnings and free cash flow going forward.Innovation Driving GrowthWhirlpool is among one of those companies that have successfully implemented its innovation strategies into the business model. It invests heavily in technologies to produce differentiated products to suit the needs of their end consumers. Also, the company is keen on boosting revenues at its core appliance business through expansions and investments. This, in turn, is expected to fuel growth of its high-margin categories.Bottom LineWhile all seems well with Whirlpool, it has been suffering from soft top-line performance and higher raw material inflation. Notably, the company’s top line has lagged estimates for three straight quarters now. Moreover, Whirlpool’s operating performance continues to be impacted by raw material cost inflation and unit volume declines. This caused adjusted operating margin to contract 70 bps in the preceding quarter.Though the company expects improved global price/mix and cost savings to benefit margins in 2018, this is likely to be more than offset by continued raw material inflation. In 2018, Whirlpool aniticipates the combined 125 bps margin improvement from favorable price/mix, fixed cost reduction and improved cost productivity, to be more than offset by nearly $200-$250 million increase in raw material inflation from the prior year.Nonetheless, Whirlpool’s ongoing strategic initiatives and cost savings program provide visibility for growth in the future. This is further supported by its long-term earnings growth rate of 12.2% and a VGM Score of A.Do Consumer Discretionary Stocks Grab Your Attention?

324,WHR,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put Whirlpool Corporation (WHR  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Whirlpool Corporation has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 12.4, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 compares in at about 20.2. If we focus on the stock’s long-term PE trend, the current level puts Whirlpool Corporation’s current PE ratio slightly below its midpoint (which is 13.9) over the past five years.Further, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with the sector’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 24.4. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that Whirlpool Corporation has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 11.2, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for Whirlpool Corporation’s stock in the near term too.  P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, Whirlpool Corporation has a P/S ratio of about 0.6. This is significantly lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.6 right now. Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is somewhat below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.If anything, this suggests some level of undervalued trading—at least compared to historical norms.  Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Whirlpool Corporation currently has a Value Style Score of A, putting it into the top 20% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes WHR a solid choice for value investors, and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too.For example, the PEG ratio for Whirlpool Corporation is just 0.9, a level that is considerably lower than the industry average of 1.4. The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock’s earnings growth rate. Additionally, its P/CF ratio (another great indicator of value) comes in at 7.2, which is slightly better than the industry average of 8.8. Clearly, WHR is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles.What About the Stock Overall?Though Whirlpool Corporation might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of A and a Momentum score of F. This gives WHR a VGM score—or its overarching fundamental grade—of A. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been disappointing. The current quarter has seen one estimate go higher in the past sixty days and one lower, while the full year estimate has seen two upward and one downward revisions in the same time period.This has had a noticeable impact on the consensus estimate, as the current quarter consensus estimate has fallen about 4.6% in the past two months, while the full year estimate has dipped 0.3%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:Whirlpool Corporation Price and Consensus  Whirlpool Corporation Price and Consensus | Whirlpool Corporation QuoteThis somewhat bearish trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and why we are looking for in-line performance from the company in the near term.Bottom LineWhirlpool Corporation is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. Moreover, a strong industry rank (top 26% out of more than 250 industries) further supports the growth potential of the stock. However, with a Zacks Rank #3, it is hard to get too excited about this company overall. In fact, over the past one year, the sector has clearly underperformed the broader market, as you can see below:So, value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn favorable in this name first, but once that happen, this stock could be a compelling pick.Don’t Even Think About Buying Bitcoin Until You Read This The most popular cryptocurrency skyrocketed last year, giving some investors the chance to bank 20X returns or even more.

326,WHR,"Shares of Whirlpool Corporation (WHR  -  Free Report) opened more than 5% higher on Tuesday following President Donald Trump’s decision to impose tariffs on imported washing machines.The Trump administration will slap a 20% tariff on the first 1.2 million imported large residential washing machines in the first year of the new policy. The tariff will increase to 50% on any additional machines above that number.The tariffs will help Whirlpool compete with Asian competitors like Samsung and LG, although Credit Suisse analyst Susan Maklari said that these two competitors already have plans to increase U.S.-based manufacturing.“All those producing in the US will now face a similar cost structure, creating a more level playing field,” Maklari wrote in a note to clients. “That said, [Samsung and LG] have commenced construction of U.S.-based capacity, which is expected to come on line over the next 12-18 months. As such, we expect this decision to become less impactful in time.”Still, Samsung has expressed its disappointment with the decision shortly after the tariff was announced on Monday. In a statement, the South Korean manufacturing giant described the policy as “a great loss for American consumers and workers.”On the other hand, Whirlpool promised to add jobs and increase investments in manufacturing and innovation in the wake of the tariff. The home appliance behemoth said on Monday that it will add 200 full-time jobs at a factory in Clyde, Ohio.The Trump administration’s new tariff policy also includes a penalty on imported solar cells. These fees will include a 30% charge on anything after the first 2.5 gigawatts of imported cells, which will fall to a 15% charge by the fourth year.Shares of several American solar parts makers, including First Solar (FSLR  -  Free Report), were in the green during morning trading Tuesday.Want more analysis from this author?

327,WHR,"Whirlpool Corporation (WHR  -  Free Report) is among the few stocks that are displaying mixed sentiments. While the company’s long-term goals and strategies hold promise, recent quarterly performances and near-term view keep us on the sidelines.Whirlpool Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Whirlpool Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Whirlpool Corporation QuoteEvidently, the company’s shares have declined as much as 22.3% in the past year due to its negative earnings surprise trend in six of the last seven quarters, with sales miss in four straight quarters. However, the share performance fared better than the industry’s decline of 32.9%. The company’s stock has been getting momentum from its stringent focus on long-term goals for 2020, innovation strategy as well as global cost-based pricing and fixed cost-reduction strategies. Meanwhile, the industry continues to face a downturn, due to the volatility in commodity prices.Let’s analyze the pros and cons of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock.Strategies to Aid GrowthWhirlpool’s robust product pipeline, solid innovations and cost productivity initiatives keep it on track to deliver on long-term goals. The company has outlined significant long-term targets through 2020, backed by brand strength and product portfolio. It aims to deliver organic revenue growth of 3-5% every year. Additionally, the company targets EBIT margin to exceed 10% by 2020 and envisions earnings per share to grow by 10-15% each year. Furthermore, Whirlpool anticipates free cash-flow generation of 5-6% of revenues by 2018.Additionally, Whirlpool is striving to improve margins through a series of measures, including cost-based price increments and cost-reduction initiatives focused on improving business efficiency. Recently, the company introduced global cost-based pricing for its trade customers, to mitigate raw material inflation. Moreover, it is on track with the initiatives to cut down fixed overhead expenses by $150 million, which will add to its ongoing cost productivity program.The company’s efforts to boost consumer demand led to 100 basis points (bps) improvement in global price/mix for first-quarter 2018. This marked the company’s second straight quarter of positive global price/mix since fourth-quarter 2015. Positive global price/mix, along with significant progress on cost-saving initiatives, is likely to result in margin expansion in 2018. These margin recovery actions, along with renewed focus on inventory management, are also likely to boost earnings and free cash flow in the coming years.Dismal Surprise Trend & Soft Margins Remain DeterrentsAs stated, Whirlpool has been delivering dismal top- and bottom-line performances for the past few quarters. Though Whirlpool’s top and bottom lines improved year over year, both earnings and sales lagged estimates in first-quarter 2018. This could be mainly attributed to the fall in unit volumes, unfavorable currency and raw material inflation. Also, the company witnessed soft demand for washers and refrigerators along with weak global demand for compressor.Further, Whirlpool’s operating results continued to be hurt by significant raw material cost inflation. Though operating margin remained flat year over year, it was somewhat marred by raw material inflation, unit-volume declines and unfavorable currency. While management expects favorable product price/mix to aid earnings in 2018, this will be partly offset by lower global-revenue growth and increased raw material inflation.In fact, management raised its raw material inflation outlook by nearly $50 million for 2018, mainly owing to U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum. Raw material cost inflation is expected to be $250-$300 million.Moreover, the company’s earnings estimates continue to roll down as the company reduced its earnings view for 2018. In the last seven days, the company’s Zacks Consensus Estimate of $15.30 and $17.52 for 2018 and 2019 moved south by 12 cents and 5 cents, respectively. Management now envisions GAAP earnings per share of $12.30-$13.30 compared with $12.45-$13.45 expected earlier.Bottom LineNonetheless, Whirlpool’s ongoing strategic initiatives and cost-saving programs provide visibility for growth in the future. This is further supported by the company’s long-term earnings growth rate of 9.5% and a Value Score of B.Looking for Attractive Consumer Discretionary Stocks?

328,WHR,"As a part of its protectionist agenda, U.S.president Donald Trump levied tariffs on imported solar panels and washing machines. The government will now impose new duties of as much as 30% on foreign-made solar equipment, as reported by the U.S. Trade Representative’s office on Jan 22, 2018. The President also seeks to slap tariffs starting as high as 50% on imported washing machines, according to USTR.Trump’s motto is to ""buy American and hire American."" Trump is highly expected to bring U.S. manufacturing jobs back to the country. “The president’s action makes clear again that the Trump administration will always defend American workers, farmers, ranchers and businesses in this regard,” U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said in a statement, as quoted on Reuters.Also according to Reuters, the solar tariffs are lower than the 35% of what the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) suggested in October having noticed that imported panels were threatening American manufacturers. The commission was notified of this issue by a “Suniva Inc., a bankrupt U.S. panel maker that sought duties on solar cells and panels.”Same was the case for washing machines, as there was a complaint by Whirlpool Corp. (WHR  -  Free Report), which held Samsung Electronics Co. and LG Electronics Inc. responsible for its sufferings as the duo is said to sell washing machines in the United States below fair-market value.In any case, the Trump era has flared up uncertainties in the alternative energy industry. He is far from supporting the renewable sector and adding incentives to the space. Taking a completely difference stance from President Obama, Trump is ready to push for more fossil fuel generation, be it from crude oil, natural gas or coal (read: Welcome Trump Era with These ETFs).Against this backdrop, investors may be interested in knowing what might be in the store for the following stocks and ETFs.Solar Trump’s non-supportive nature toward the solar industry raised concerns about the future of clean ETFs like First Trust NASDAQ Clean Edge Green Energy Index Fund (QCLN  -  Free Report) and Guggenheim Solar ETF (TAN  -  Free Report).However, as per an article published on barrons.com, “Arizona–based solar-panel maker First Solar (FSLR  -  Free Report) is likely to benefit from the decision, because its solar panels are made with a unique process that is exempted from the tariffs.”But solar firms like Sunrun (RUN  -  Free Report) that develops, owns, manages and sells residential solar energy systems may have to pay more for imported solar cells. This is likely eat up some of its profits. But since, Sunrun shares were also up after hours, Barron’s.com analyst believes that “investors are relieved by the relatively low tariffs.”Small CapsSince small caps generate most of their revenues from the domestic market, these are more closely tied to the U.S. economy and its increased hiring. This will make small-cap ETFs like iShares Russell 2000 (IWM  -  Free Report) winners (read: Why Small Cap ETFs are Betting Big on Trump?).Small-Cap Manufacturing Stocks & ETFsAlso, with Trump highly expected to promote U.S. hiring in the industrial sector, First Trust RBA American Industrial Renaissance ETF (AIRR  -  Free Report), which focuses on small and mid-cap U.S. industrial and community banking companies, is expected to benefit (read: Industrial ETFs at All-Time Highs: Any Value Left for 2018?).Washing Machine Companies As per statista.com, Whirlpool dominated the U.S. washing machine consumer market with about 29% share followed by General Electric Company (GE  -  Free Report) which owns about 14% of market share. If these import duties make Samsung and LG products costlier, many consumers may shift to WHR and GE. This in turn may result in higher sales of WHR and GE washing machines.Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week. Get it free >>

329,WHR,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put Whirlpool Corporation (WHR  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Whirlpool has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 10.3, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 stands at about 20.1x. If we focus on the long-term PE trend, Whirlpool’s current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years, with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months.Further, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with its industry’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 10.1. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that Whirlpool has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 9.4, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for Mohawk stock in the near term too.P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, Whirlpool has a P/S ratio of about 0.5. This is a bit lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.3x right now. Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.If anything, WHR is roughly in the lower end of its range in the time period from a P/S metric, suggesting some level of undervalued trading—at least compared to historical norms.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Whirlpool currently has a Value Score of B, putting it into the top 40% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes Whirlpool a solid choice for value investors, and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too.What About the Stock Overall?Though Whirlpool might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of F and a Momentum Score of F. This gives WHR a Zacks VGM score — or its overarching fundamental grade — of D. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been downbeat. The current quarter has seen one estimate go higher in the past sixty days compared to one lower, while the full year estimate has seen two up and two down in the same time period.This has had a significant impact on the consensus estimate as the current quarter consensus estimate has decreased by 7% in the past two months, while the full year estimate has inched lower by 0.6%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:Whirlpool Corporation Price and Consensus  Whirlpool Corporation Price and Consensus | Whirlpool Corporation QuoteThe stock has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and we are looking for in-line performance from the company in the near term.Bottom LineWhirlpool is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. However, with a sluggish industry rank (among Bottom 25% of more than 250 industries) and a Zacks Rank #3, it is hard to get too excited about this company overall. In fact, over the past two years, the broader industry has clearly underperformed the market at large, as you can see below:So, value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first, but once that happens, this stock could be a compelling pick.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.     Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

330,WHR," Benchmarks closed at record levels on Wednesday, boosted by strong earnings results and the Fed’s decision not to raise rates at the end of its two-day meeting. Splendid second quarter earnings from Boeing helped close the Dow at a record high. Furthermore, AT&T performed better than expected and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Riding on the overall success of telecom stock, the S&P 500 also closed at a record level. The tech rally continued to help the Nasdaq end in the green. For a look at the issues currently facing the markets, make sure to read today’s Ahead of Wall Street article. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) rose 0.5% or 97.58 points, closing at 21,711.01. The S&P 500 Index (INX) increased by a meager 0.70 points to close at 2,477.83. This apart, the Nasdaq Composite Index (IXIC) closed 6,422.75, adding 10.57 points and rising by 0.2%. A total of around 6.6 billion shares were traded on Monday, above the last 20-session average of 6.1 billion shares. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by a 1.02-to-1ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.07-to-1 ratio favored advancing issues. Boeing and AT&T Post Upbeat Earnings in Q2 Shares of Boeing (BA  -  Free Report) soared to an all-time high on Wednesday morning after the company posted its second-quarter financial results. Boeing reported earnings of $2.55 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.32 per share. Shares surged nearly 10% to hit an all time high, helping the Dow to post a record finish. Though total sales were less than expected, the aerospace giant generated strong cash flows during the quarter due to high demand for Boeing's 787 Dreamliner. (Read More: Boeing (BA  -  Free Report) Stock Flies to All-Time High After Q2 Earnings) U.S. telecom major AT&T Inc. (T  -  Free Report) reported impressive financial results for second quarter of 2017. The company’s top and bottom lines each outpaced their Zacks Consensus Estimates. However, quarterly total revenue dropped 1.68% year over year to $39,837 million, primarily due to declines in legacy wireline services and consumer mobility. However, revenues were above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $39,799 million. As a result, the Utilities Sector SPDR moved up nearly 1.0% and the S&P 500 closed at a record level. (Read More: AT&T (T  -  Free Report) Tops Q2 Earnings & Revenues, Gains Subscribers) Tech Rally and Positive Expectations from Earnings Meanwhile, the tech rally continued following positive expectations regarding earnings of tech behemoths like Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) and Facebook (FB  -  Free Report) which are scheduled to report later this week. This helped the Nasdaq Composite close at a record level of 6,422.75. Fed Leaves Rate Unchanged, Warns on Inflation The Fed opted to leave interest rates unchanged at the end of its two-day policy meeting on Wednesday. The Fed maintained the benchmark lending rate and hinted that it will start trimming its $4.5 trillion balance sheet in ""relatively soon"". Market watchers believe that such language indicates that the Fed will begin the process of unwinding in September. Additionally, the central bank’s statement dropped the word “somewhat” from its June statement instead choosing to directly state that inflation continued to remain ""below 2%"". This only represents a slight shift but is significant because it acknowledges a negative view on one of the Fed’s key objectives. The Fed’s recognition of low inflation levels bodes well for rate-sensitive sectors. Consequently, the Utilities and Real Estate Select SPDR moved up nearly 1.0% and 0.8% respectively as the rate-sensitive sectors seized on this opportunity.

331,WHR,"Whirlpool Corporation (WHR  -  Free Report) posted second-quarter 2017 results, wherein both earnings and sales lagged estimates. This marked the company’s fourth consecutive quarter of earnings miss. Moreover, the company slashed earnings guidance for 2017 due to amplified raw material inflation and inferior product price/mix in China and Europe.Consequently, stock price of this world’s largest home-appliances manufacturer dipped 4% in the after-hours session yesterday. Moreover, Whirlpool’s shares have underperformed the Consumer Discretionary sector in the past one year. While the stock declined 1.1%, the sector witnessed growth of 16.9%.Q2 HighlightsWhirlpool’s quarterly adjusted earnings per share of $3.35 declined 4.3% year over year and missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.60.Whirlpool Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Whirlpool Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Whirlpool Corporation QuoteOn a reported basis, the company’s earnings fell 39.3% to $2.52 per share from $4.15 earned in the prior-year quarter. The decline can mainly be attributed to higher income tax expenses due to the timing of tax planning activities in the prior-year period.Revenues came in at $5,347 million, an increase of 2.9% from the comparable year-ago quarter revenues of $5,198 million. However, revenues were short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5,361.2 million. On currency-neutral basis, Whirlpool registered sales growth of over 3%. The top line benefited from strength in North America and Latin America. Further, the company remains on track for reaching long-term revenue growth targets.Adjusted operating profit in the quarter dropped 14.6% to $373 million from $437 million in the year-ago quarter, while the operating margin contracted 150 basis points (bps) to 6.9%. During the quarter, an adverse product price/mix and raw material inflation almost fully negated the gains from increased unit volumes and ongoing cost productivity. However, the company reported sequential operating margin improvement in the EMEA region.Regional PerformanceRevenues from North America went up 7.1% year over year to $3 billion, while revenues grew 9% on a currency-neutral basis. Adjusted operating profit margin contracted 50 bps to 11.8%, while in dollar terms operating profit grew 4.1% to $354 million. Operating profit gains reflected from strong unit volume growth in core and adjacent businesses. However, the negative impact of raw material price inflation and foreign currency hurt operating margins. The company retained North-American industry shipments guidance of an increase 4–6% for 2017.Revenues from Latin America rose 2.7% year over year to $848 million. Excluding the effects of currency translation, revenues dipped 1%. Adjusted operating margin of 7% increased 90 bps, on the back of favorable price/mix and cost productivity gains, slightly offset by raw material inflation and unit volume declines. The company anticipates industry unit shipments in Brazil to be flat in 2017.Revenues from EMEA descended 7.7% from the prior-year quarter to $1.2 billion. On currency-neutral basis, revenues dropped 5%. The company reported breakeven adjusted operating profit in the second quarter compared with adjusted operating profit of $60 million in the year-ago quarter. However, the segment reported sequential operating profit improvement of $17 million on account of better product availability versus last quarter. Additionally, the company expects solid operating profit recovery in the second half on the back of simplified brand structure, additional product availability improvements and the deployment of marketing initiatives to support new product launches. Consequently, Whirlpool estimates industry unit shipments growth in 2017 in the range of flat to up 2%.Revenues from Asia slipped 1.4% to $358 million in second-quarter 2017 from $363 million in the prior-year quarter. Excluding currency effects, revenues remained flat. Adjusted operating margin contracted 610 bps to 2%. Adverse product price/mix and raw material price inflation more than offset the gains from cost productivity, unit volume growth and foreign currency.Going forward, the company expects cost-cutting initiatives and product price/mix to aid in operating margins growth in the second half, through innovative product launches and previously announced cost-based price increases. The company projects industry shipments in the region to be flat to up 2% in 2017.Financial PositionWhirlpool had cash and cash equivalents of $1,041 million as of Jun 30, 2017, and long-term debt of $3,631 million.The company used $191 million in operating activities in first-half 2017. Meanwhile, the company’s capital expenditure in the period was $210 million. As of Jun 30, 2017, Whirlpool had negative free cash flow of $356 million due to the company's focus on working capital optimization.In the second quarter, the company rewarded shareholders with increased cash dividend of $1.10 per share and $200 million worth of share buybacks.GuidanceManagement remains pleased with ongoing growth strategies, disciplined operational execution and balanced capital allocation. Further, it anticipates profitable growth in the EMEA region in the second half of 2017 and expects to navigate through the volatility in emerging markets.However, Whirlpool slashed earnings forecasts for 2017 based on elevated raw material inflation and lower product price/mix in China and Europe. The company now envisions adjusted earnings per share for 2017 in a range of $14.50–$15.00, compared with $14.75–$15.50 guided earlier. On a GAAP basis, Whirlpool anticipates earnings in a range of $12.40–$12.90 per share for 2017, compared with the previous estimate of $12.65–$13.40.Nonetheless, the company continues to anticipate generating free cash flow of about $1 billion for 2017, while it revised operating cash flows guidance to range from $1.65–$1.7 billion. Earlier, the company had anticipated operating cash flows of $1.7–$1.75 billion. The revised guidance includes restructured cash outlays of up to $165 million, legacy product warranty and liability costs of $70 million, pension contributions of $45 million and capital expenditures of $650–$700 million (down from $700–$750 million expected earlier).Further, the company approved an additional share repurchase authorization worth $2 billion. This brings the company’s total available share repurchase authorization to $2.35 billion. The company expects to continue rewarding shareholders through increased dividends and share repurchases.Zacks Rank & Other Key PicksCurrently, Whirlpool carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

332,WHR,"Whirlpool Corp. (WHR  -  Free Report) is slated to release second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 26. Last quarter, the company posted a negative earnings surprise of 6.4%.In fact, Whirlpool has reported negative surprise in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average miss of 2.9%. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Whirlpool Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Whirlpool Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Whirlpool Corporation QuoteWhat to Expect?The question lingering in investors’ minds now is whether Whirlpool will be able to post positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is $3.56, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 1.7%. We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate has been declining ahead of the earnings release. Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $5.4 billion, up 3.1% from the year-ago quarter.We note that the stock has outperformed the Zacks categorized Consumer Discretionary sector in the last three months. The company’s shares have increased 5.7%, while the sector grew 2.4%.Factors at PlayThough Whirlpool’s surprise history is not very impressive, its stock performance remains solid backed by the cost productivity initiatives, solid innovations and robust product pipeline. The company remains focused on its innovation strategy that aids in tapping additional sales and significant market share gains. Moreover, its solid integration and cost-productivity activities have been enhancing performance. These factors, along with a robust brands portfolio have been catalysts for the stock.These initiatives keep the company on track to deliver upon its long-term goals, which include EBIT margin growth of over 10% by 2020, organic sales growth of 3–5% every year, annualized earnings per share growth of 10–15% and generating free cash flows at 5–6% of revenues by 2018.Further, the company’s cost productivity programs are in place to deliver improved margins in 2017 and ahead. Evidently, the company delivered solid top-line growth in first-quarter 2017 driven by strength in North America and Latin America.However, the company’s results in the last reported quarter were impacted by raw material inflation and temporary integration challenges in Europe. Further, the company anticipates the integration related challenges to continue in the near term. Consequently, the company trimmed earnings forecasts for 2017.While Whirlpool’s long-term plans and solid brands portfolio reflect strength, we cannot ignore the near-term challenges hurting the results. That said, let’s wait and see if the company’s strategic efforts can aid in sustaining the stock momentum.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Whirlpool is likely to beat estimates this quarter.

Whirlpool has an Earnings ESP of -3.93% as the Most Accurate estimate of $3.42 is pegged lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.56 per share.

333,WHR,"Whirlpool Corp. (WHR  -  Free Report) is slated to release fourth-quarter 2017 results on Jan 24, after the closing bell. Last quarter, the company reported a negative earnings surprise of 1.8%.In fact, Whirlpool has missed estimates in the last four quarters, with an average negative earnings surprise of 4.8%. Notably, third-quarter 2017 marked the company’s fifth straight quarter of negative earnings surprise and second consecutive quarter of sales lag. The primary concern for the company in recent quarters has been raw material cost inflation and unfavorable price/mix. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.What to Expect?The question lingering in investors’ minds now is whether Whirlpool will be able to post positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is $4.01, reflecting a year-over-year decline of 7.4%. We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate has been stable ahead of the earnings release. Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $5.8 billion, up 3.2% from the year-ago quarter.Whirlpool Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Whirlpool Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Whirlpool Corporation QuoteMoreover, we note that the stock has declined 13.6% in the last six months. However, this compares better than the industry’s 26.1% downside.Factors at PlayWhirlpool’s aforementioned dismal surprise trend has been a concern for investors. The company is clearly grappling with adverse product price/mix and raw material cost inflation has been denting the  operating margin for the last few quarters. Moreover, the company anticipates higher raw material prices to persist through 2018. This has resulted in a lowered earnings view for 2017.The company now envisions adjusted earnings per share for 2017 in a range of $13.60-$13.90 compared with $14.50-$15.00, guided earlier. On a GAAP basis, Whirlpool anticipates earnings in a range of $11.10-$11.40 per share compared with the previous estimate of $12.40-$12.90 for 2017.Further, we believe that volatility in commodity prices, particularly steel, may adversely affect the company’s operating performance. Additionally, Whirlpool derives a significant portion of revenues from international operations, which exposes it to risks in global market. Whirlpool’s customer concentration is also high which is likely to hurt the margins.However, Whirlpool’s robust product pipeline, solid innovations and cost productivity initiatives keep it on track to deliver long-term goals. It aims to deliver organic revenue growth of 3-5% every year through 2020. Further, it anticipates growth efforts to boost consumer demand and lead to enhanced price mix, which encouraged management to target EBIT margin to exceed 10% by 2020.Moreover, Whirlpool has been riding on innovation strategy that helps it to tap additional sales and gain market share. Further, the company is striving to improve margins through a series of measures including cost-based price increments and cost-reduction initiatives focused on enriching business efficiency.That said, let’s wait and see if the company’s strategic efforts can turnaround the aforementioned near-term challenges.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Whirlpool is likely to beat estimates this quarter.

334,WHR,"Whirlpool Corporation (WHR  -  Free Report), the world’s leading manufacturer of home appliances, has been making strategic partnerships and innovations to provide consumers with the best-class service and seamless experience. In this regard, the company said that users will now be able to distantly operate their home appliances through Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report) Watch. Notably, this deal makes Whirlpool the first ever appliance manufacturer that has connected the smart home devices with Apple Watch and its capabilities.The activation of Apple Watch functionality across the company’s appliances will be executed in early 2018, thereby allowing Whirlpool’s customers to handle the household chores in a smarter way. Over 20 Whirlpool brand connected appliances to be rolled out this year will be compatible with Apple Watch. Whirlpool app in these smart watches will help consumers control  appliances remotely.Impressively, through the smart watches consumers can communicate with ovens, dryers as well as washers.Concurrent to this press release, Whirlpool has further enhanced its home appliance ecosystem by teaming up with the leading thermostats maker – Honeywell International Inc. (HON  -  Free Report).Per the deal, customers will be allowed to connect their home appliances to the Honeywell’s thermostats via Whirlpool app, hence remotely controlling these appliances and their energy levels. The service will start rolling out across over 25 Whirlpool brand appliances during 2018. Through this, users can auto-adjust their appliances to away mode, when Honeywell geofencing technology identifies a customer is not at home.Notably, the Whirlpool and Honeywell partnership dates back to 2014, where the former has utilized the latter’s low global-warming potential foam blowing agent in insulation in its US-made refrigerators as well as freezers.Additionally, Whirlpool consumers will be able to manage their appliances via voice commands to both Amazon.com, Inc.’s (AMZN  -  Free Report)'s Alexa and Google's home assistant.All these above-mentioned initiatives signify Whirlpool’s commitment toward producing innovative, environment-friendly and consumer-convenient products. Interestingly, it is among the few companies that heavily invest in technologies to produce differentiated products to suit the needs of their end consumers.We believe these strategic initiatives are necessary for the company to bring itself back on the growth trajectory.We note that the company has a dismal earnings surprise trend with five consecutive misses. Moreover, top line lagged estimates for the second straight time, when it reported third-quarter 2017. Raw material inflation and adverse product price/mix have been hurting its performance and are likely to continue throughout 2018. Consequently, this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) stock fell 8.1% in the past year, however, it fared better than the industry’s decline of 21.3%.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Zacks’ Best Private Investment IdeasWhile we are happy to share many articles like this on the website, our best recommendations and most in-depth research are not available to the public.Starting today, for the next month, you can follow all Zacks' private buys and sells in real time.

351,WHR,"Whirlpool Corporation (WHR  -  Free Report) reported third-quarter 2017 results, wherein both earnings and sales missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The quarter marked the company’s fifth consecutive negative earnings surprise and second straight sales miss. Additionally, management cut earnings guidance for 2017 due to higher raw material inflation and unfavorable price/mix.Consequently, shares of this world’s leading home-appliances manufacturer declined 6.6% in the after-hours session yesterday. Further, Whirlpool’s shares have lost nearly 4.5% in the past three months, narrower than the industry’s decline of 16.2%.Q3 HighlightsWhirlpool’s quarterly adjusted earnings per share came in at $3.83 that missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.90.  However, it increased 4.7% year over year.On a GAAP basis, the company’s earnings grew 20% to $3.72 per share from $3.10 earned in the prior-year quarter. The upside was driven by lower income tax expense versus year-ago period, owing to the timing of tax planning activities in the current year.Revenues were $5,418 million that rose nearly 4% from the comparable year-ago quarter revenues of $5,248 million. The top line fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5,487 million. On a currency-neutral basis, Whirlpool registered sales growth of 2%. Markedly, the top line benefited from strength in North America, Asia and Latin America.  Further, adjusted operating profit in the quarter dropped 9.8% to $376 million from $417 million in the year-ago quarter. Also, the operating margin contracted 100 basis points (bps) to 6.9%. During the quarter, ongoing cost productivity and increased unit volumes were more than offset by the adverse product price/mix and raw material inflation.Regional PerformanceRevenues from North America went up 3.5% year over year to $3 billion while the same grew 4% on a currency-neutral basis. Adjusted operating profit margin contracted 40 bps to 11.7% while in dollar terms operating profit grew 1.2% to $350 million. Notably, operating profit gains reflected from higher unit volumes and cost productivity negated adverse currency impacts and raw material inflation. However, the negative impact of raw material price inflation dented operating margins. Yet, the company retained North-American industry unit shipments guidance of 4-6% growth for 2017.Revenues from Latin America rose 6.1% year over year to $849 million. Also, the same increased 5% excluding the effects of currency translation. Adjusted operating margin of 6.3% increased 50 bps, on the back of higher volumes and cost productivity gains, more than offset by raw material inflation and adverse product price/mix. The company reiterates its industry unit shipments in Brazil to be flat in 2017.Meanwhile, revenues from EMEA remained flat year over year at $1.3 billion. On a currency-neutral basis, the same dropped 8%. Whirlpool reported adjusted operating profit of $11 million in the third quarter versus adjusted operating profit of $48 million in the year-ago quarter. Further, its adjusted operating margin came in at 0.8%, which fell 290 bps from the year-ago period. The decline can be attributed to raw material inflation, adverse product price/mix as well as lower volumes that were more than offset by cost productivity benefits and restructuring gains. However, Whirlpool reaffirms its industry unit shipments growth in 2017 in the range of flat to up 2%.Revenues from Asia grew 5.6% to $357 million in third-quarter 2017 from $338 million in the prior-year quarter. Excluding currency effects, revenues rose 4%. However, adjusted operating margin contracted 430 bps to 0.6%. Cost productivity gains were more than compensated with adverse product price/mix in China and raw material inflation. Nevertheless, management maintains its industry unit shipments guidance in the range of flat to 2% growth for 2017.Financial PositionWhirlpool had cash and cash equivalents of $1,087 million as of Sep 30, 2017 and long-term debt of $3,669 million.The company used cash of $33 million in operating activities during the nine months of 2017. In the same period, the company’s capital expenditure was $371 million. As of Sep 30, 2017, Whirlpool had negative free cash flow of $348 million due to the company's focus on working capital optimization.In the reported quarter, management bought back shares for nearly $200 million and intends to repurchase in the remaining period of 2017. Moreover, Whirlpool bought back shares worth $550 million and paid cash dividend of $235 million in the nine months of 2017.Other DevelopmentsWe note that Whirlpool has been witnessing significantly higher raw material prices, which are expected further increase through 2018. In October, management announced to its trade customers, global cost-based pricing that will include most of the company’s operations in order to mitigate raw material inflation. This is anticipated to be implemented in the fourth quarter and the first quarter of 2018.Furthermore, Whirlpool took initiatives to cut down its fixed overhead expenses by $150 million. These initiatives are likely to be implemented in early 2018 and add to its ongoing cost productivity program.GuidanceWhirlpool slashed earnings forecasts for 2017 based on raw material inflation and adverse price/mix. This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company now envisions adjusted earnings per share for 2017 in a range of $13.60-$13.90 compared with $14.50-$15.00, guided earlier. On a GAAP basis, Whirlpool anticipates earnings in a range of $11.10-$11.40 per share compared with the previous estimate of $12.40-$12.90 for 2017.Whirlpool Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Whirlpool Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Whirlpool Corporation QuoteNonetheless, the company continues to anticipate generating free cash flow of about $900 million for 2017 while it revised operating cash flows guidance to range from $1.55–$1.6 billion. Earlier, the company had anticipated operating cash flows of $1.65-$1.7 billion.The revised guidance includes restructured cash outlays of approximately $175 million, legacy product warranty and liability costs of $70 million, pension contributions of $45 million and capital expenditures of $650-$700 million.Also, management stated that it reiterates 2020 goals and remains optimistic about ongoing growth initiatives as well as global cost-based pricing and fixed cost reduction strategies.Three Stocks Hogging the LimelightSome better-ranked stocks in the broader Consumer Discretionary sector include G-III Apparel Group, Ltd. (GIII  -  Free Report), Guess?, Inc. (GES  -  Free Report) and PVH Corp. (PVH  -  Free Report).

Per the Earnings Outlook dated Oct 18, nearly 52 of the S&P 500 members have already posted their financial numbers. Out of these companies, approximately 76.9% delivered positive earnings surprises while 73.1% surpassed the top-line expectations.Notably, earnings for the 52 S&P 500 companies have improved 13.3% from the same period last year, with revenues increasing by 6.9%. Total third-quarter earnings for the S&P 500 members are anticipated to increase 3% year over year, on 4.9% growth in revenues.A Look at Consumer Discretionary SectorThe performance of the index depends upon all 16 Zacks sectors, out of which eight sectors are expected to witness an earnings decline in the third quarter including the Consumer Discretionary space. Currently, the sector is placed at the bottom 38% (10 out of 16) of the Zacks classified sectors. Nevertheless, the sector has gained 10.7% year to date, which is lesser than the S&P 500’s growth of 14.3%.  According to the report, about 8.1% of the S&P 500 companies in the same sector have reported their results, wherein 66.7% companies delivered an earnings beat while all surpassed revenue estimates. Further, earnings for these companies increased 0.8% on a year-over-year basis while revenues improved 6.8%.Markedly, the Consumer Discretionary sector consists of household appliances, textile, apparel as well as toys, games and hobbies stocks, among others. So, let’s see what awaits these stocks that are slated to report third-quarter 2017 earnings releases on Oct 23.Notably, our research shows that when a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) stock is combined with a positive Earnings ESP, the chance of beating earnings estimates is high.

Additionally, the company’s international and direct-to-customer platforms, the Outdoor & Action Sports coalition and the company’s workwear business, which forms a part of the Imagewear coalition, look encouraging. However, adverse currency translations continue to be a hurdle and are expected to hurt margins and sales in 2017. (Read: Will V.F. Corp Strategies Facilitate Q3 Earnings Beat?)V.F.

Further, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.12 per share for the third quarter has been stable in the last 30 days.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s revenues is pegged at $3,413 million for the to-be-reported quarter, down more than 1% from third-quarter 2016. Also, the same for the Outdoor & Action Sports, Imagewear, Jeanswear and Sportswear segments are projected to be $2,379 million, $145 million, $689 million and $128 million, respectively. These estimates show a year-over-year decline of 48.5%, 1.8% and 9% for the Imagewear, Jeanswear and Sportswear segments, respectively. However, the same for the Outdoor & Action Sports segment implies an increase of 1.8% from the prior-year quarter.Let’s take a sneak peek at Whirlpool Corporation (WHR  -  Free Report), the leading manufacturer of home appliances in the world that is unlikely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. We believe that volatility in commodity prices, particularly steel, might have adversely affected the company’s operating performance. This is quite evident from Whirlpool’s second-quarter results, which were hurt by raw material cost inflation. However, the company has been riding on its innovation strategy that helps it to tap additional sales and gain market share. (Read more: Will Near-Term Challenges Mar Whirlpool's Q3 Earnings?)Whirlpool Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Whirlpool Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Whirlpool Corporation QuoteA look at Whirlpool’s surprise history reveals that its earnings have lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate for four straight quarters now. In fact, the company has an Earnings ESP of -0.90%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the impending quarter has also moved down by 9 cents to $3.90 in the last seven days. However, the company’s Zacks Rank #3, increases the predictive power of ESP.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s revenues is pegged at $5,487 million for the to-be-reported quarter, up 4.6% from third-quarter 2016. Notably, the same for North America, Latin America, EMEA and Asia regions are pegged at $3.1 billion, $0.8 billion, $1.3 billion and $0.3 billion, respectively. In the third quarter of 2016, revenues for North America, Latin America, EMEA and Asia regions were $2.9 billion, $0.8 billion, $1.3 billion and $0.3 billion, respectively.Lastly, Hasbro, Inc. (HAS  -  Free Report) is a company that together with its subsidiaries operates as a play and entertainment company. The company’s earnings have outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 10 straight quarters now. Also, its consistent efforts to establish global presence via strategic partnerships and rapid growth in emerging markets remain encouraging.Hasbro, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Hasbro, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Hasbro, Inc. QuoteHowever, Hasbro has an Earnings ESP of -4.06%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate of $1.89 is pegged lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.97. Also, the company’s Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) lowers the chances of an earnings beat.  As it is we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review has moved down by a penny to $1.97 in the last seven days. This estimate is also down from $2.03 reported in the third quarter of 2016. Further, the same for revenues is pegged at $1,774 million, indicating a year-over-year increase of 5.6%.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

363,WHR,"Whirlpool Corp. (WHR  -  Free Report) is slated to release third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 23, after the closing bell. Last quarter, the company posted a negative earnings surprise of 6.9%.In fact, Whirlpool has reported negative surprise in the last four quarters, with an average miss of 5.8%. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.What to Expect?The question lingering in investors’ minds now is whether Whirlpool will be able to post positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is $3.99, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 8.9%. We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate has been stable ahead of the earnings release. Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $5.5 billion, up 4.9% from the year-ago quarter.Whirlpool Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Whirlpool Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Whirlpool Corporation QuoteMoreover, we note that the stock has outperformed the broader industry in the past month. The company’s shares have increased 3.1%, while the industry dipped 10.5%.Factors at PlayWhirlpool’s surprise history remains unimpressive as it posted fourth consecutive negative surprise in second-quarter 2017. Further, we believe that volatility in commodity prices, particularly steel, may adversely affect operating performance. This was clearly reflected in Whirlpool’s second-quarter results which were hurt by raw material cost inflation. The company notes that costs of key raw materials, particularly steel and resins have increased worldwide in the first half of 2017.While these headwinds were fully offset in North America and Latin America due to favorable demand and productivity gains, Europe and Asia suffered as soft demand made it difficult to negate the challenges.Not surprisingly, the company slashed  earnings guidance for 2017 due to higher raw material costs and lower product price/mix in China and Europe. It now envisions adjusted earnings in the range of $14.50-$15.00 per share compared with $14.7-$15.50, guided earlier.However, Whirlpool has been riding on its innovation strategy that helps it to tap additional sales and gain market share. Moreover, the company's solid integration and cost-productivity activities have been enhancing performance. These factors, along with its robust brands portfolio, and continued strength across North America and Latin America have been growth drivers.While Whirlpool’s long-term plans and solid brands portfolio reflect strength, we cannot ignore the near-term challenges hurting the results. That said, let’s wait and see if the company’s strategic efforts can aid in sustaining the stock momentum.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Whirlpool is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. Whirlpool has an Earnings ESP of -5.90% as the Most Accurate estimate of $3.75 is pegged lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.99 per share. Moreover, the company’s Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) lowers the chances of a beat in the ensuing release. We caution against stocks with Zacks Rank #4 and #5 (Strong Sell). You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Stocks Poised to Beat Earnings EstimatesHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Ralph Lauren Corp.

364,WHR,"Whirlpool Corporation (WHR  -  Free Report), once an investors’ favorite, has been losing its sheen of late owing to the recent dismal performances. Though long-term strategy seems to bode well, recent performance suggests trouble down the road. In the past six months, shares of this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company have lost 10.2% compared with the industry's fall of 22.3%. Also, the stock has a  Growth Score of D.Let’s Delve DeepWhirlpool’s surprise history remains unimpressive as it posted fifth-straight earnings miss in third-quarter 2017. Further, the company’s top line lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate in four of the last seven quarters.  In fact, management slashed its earnings guidance for 2017 and expects it in the range of $13.60-$13.90 compared with $14.50-$15.00, guided earlier.Moreover, the adverse product price/mix and raw material inflation has been denting the company’s operating margin for the last few quarters. Evidently, adjusted operating margin contracted 100 basis points (bps), 150 bps and 90 bps in the third, second and first quarters of 2017. Unfortunately, these factors are likely to persist, going forward.Further, we believe that volatility in commodity prices, particularly steel, may adversely affect the company’s operating performance. Additionally, Whirlpool derives a significant portion of its revenues from international operations, which exposes it to risks in global market. Whirlpool’s customer concentration is also high that might hurt the company’s margins.Can the Tables Turn?Whirlpool’s robust product pipeline, solid innovations and cost productivity initiatives keep it on track to deliver long-term goals. In fact, the company has outlined significant long-term targets through 2020 backed by brand strength and product portfolio. It aims to deliver organic revenue growth of 3-5% every year. Further, it anticipates growth efforts to boost consumer demand and lead to enhanced price mix, which encouraged management to target its EBIT margin to exceed 10% by 2020.Moreover, Whirlpool has been riding on its innovation strategy that helps it to tap additional sales and gain market share. Also, the company is striving to improve its margins through a series of measures including cost-based price increments and cost-reduction initiatives focused on improving business efficiency.Bottom LineThough Whirlpool’s long-term plans and solid innovation strategy reflect strength, we cannot ignore the near-term challenges hurting the results. That said, let’s wait and see if the company’s strategic growth endeavors can spark a turnaround.Meanwhile, you can consider some better-ranked stocks in the broader Consumer Discretionary space that include Ralph Lauren Corporation (RL  -  Free Report), Guess?, Inc. (GES  -  Free Report) and Michael Kors Holdings (KORS  -  Free Report). While Ralph Lauren sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Guess? and Michael Kors carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

"
365,WHR,"A stock's Earnings Yield measures just that: the anticipated yield (or return) an investment in a stock could give you based on the earnings and the price paid for the stock. 
"
366,WHR,"The calculation is the inverse of the P/E ratio. The P/E of course is the Price / Earnings
"
367,WHR,"So a stock trading at a Price of $35 with Earnings of $3 has a P/E ratio of 11.67, which means it's selling at 11.67 times earnings. Another way of looking at it is you're paying $11.67 for $1 of earnings. The Earnings Yield is calculated as Earnings / Price
"
368,WHR,"Using the example above, a stock with $3 of Earnings trading at a Price of $35 ($3 / $35) has an earnings yield of 0.0857 or 8.57%. The Earnings Yield, also known as the E/P Ratio, is expressed as a percentage. So a yield of 8.57% would also mean 8.57 cents of earnings for $1 of investment.
"
369,WHR,"Of course, this is all potential because prices and earnings change.  
"
370,WHR,"The most common way people will use this ratio is to compare it to other stocks and to compare the yields to the 10 Year T-Bill.  
"
371,WHR,"Conventional wisdom has it that if the yield on the stock market (S&P 500 for example) is lower than the yield on the 10 Year Treasury (3.71% as of 3/15/10), then stocks might be considered overvalued.  
"
372,WHR,"If the yield on the S&P 500 is greater than the 10 Year T-Bill, stocks would be considered undervalued.  
"
373,WHR,"The theory behind this is that Bonds and Stocks are competing for investors' dollars. And to attract investment interest in stocks, a higher yield needs to be paid to the stock investor for the extra risk he's assuming compared to the virtual risk-free investment offered in US backed Treasuries.  
"
374,WHR,"If earnings go up, the yield goes up. If earnings go down, so does the yield.  
"
375,WHR,"Prices also affect the yield. If Prices go up, the yield goes down. And if prices go down, the yield goes up.  
"
376,WHR,"In June of 2007, the Yield on the 10 Yr. T-Bill was 4.95%.  
"
377,WHR,"However, the Earnings Yield on the S&P 500 was 4.19%.  
"
378,WHR,"Not much of a risk premium on a risk based investment.  
"
379,WHR,"Remember, if the Earnings Yield on stocks is below the T-Bill rate, stocks are considered overvalued. (I should point out that within months, the market began to falter.)  
"
380,WHR,"I also happened to write about this in March of 2009. At that time, the Earnings Yield on the S&P 500 using the 12 Month Projected Earnings Estimate was 9.51%, compared to the 10 Yr. Treasury of 2.89%.  
"
381,WHR,"With yields well above the 10 Year, conventional wisdom said that stocks were 'undervalued'. Of course, they could have continued to get more undervalued. But the market was quickly bid up  resulting in one of the largest rallies we've ever seen.  
"
382,WHR,"So where is it now?  
"
383,WHR,"Currently, the Earnings Yield for the S&P is 7.01%, compared to the 10 Yr. Treasury of 3.71%. 
"
384,WHR,"So the market isn't as much of a bargain as it was back in March of '09. But it's still way better than the 10 year and suggests that stocks are still the more attractive investment.  
"
385,WHR,"The screen I'm running today looks for the following: Price greater than or equal to $5 Volume (Avg. 20 Day Shares) greater than or equal to 100,000 Earnings Yield greater than or equal to 5%
"
386,WHR,"(For those using the Research Wizard, the calculation looks like this:  
"
387,WHR,"(i642/i5)*100

392,WHR,"Whirlpool Corporation (WHR  -  Free Report) remains committed to its innovation strategy that helps tap additional sales and gain market share. Also, the company’s long-term goals backed by its robust product pipeline, solid innovations and cost-productivity initiatives, bode well.Despite the company’s solid growth drivers, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock gained only a meager 1.5% in the last six months, in line with the industry's growth. However, its shares have underperformed the broader Consumer Discretionary sector’s growth of 4%, which is currently placed at the top 31% of the Zacks classified sectors (5 out of 16).Let’s take a deep look as why the company’s solid strategic efforts are not well reflected in its share price.What’s Weighing Upon the Stock?Dismal Performance & Bleak OutlookWhirlpool delivered fourth consecutive negative earnings surprise in second-quarter 2017. With this, the company has recorded an average miss of 5.8% in trailing four quarters. Further, the company’s top line lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate in four of the last seven quarters.Also, Whirlpool has slashed its earnings forecast for 2017 based on elevated raw material inflation and lower product price/mix in China and Europe. Management now envisions adjusted earnings per share in the range of $14.50–$15.00 compared with $14.75–$15.50, guided earlier. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 is currently pegged at $14.62.Other ConcernsWhirlpool’s operating performance is significantly dependent on the price of raw materials, particularly steel, oil, plastic resins, aluminum, copper, zinc and nickel. In fact, the volatility in commodity prices has been adversely affecting the company’s performance as evident from its second-quarter results.Notably, the costs of key raw materials, particularly steel and resins have also increased worldwide in the first half of 2017. While these headwinds were fully offset in North America and Latin America due to favorable demand and productivity gains, Europe and Asia suffered as soft demand made it difficult to offset these challenges.Furthermore, Whirlpool’s customer concentration is high, which is expected to negatively impact the company’s margins. Also, the current challenging global economic environment is weighing on the company’s performance in terms of volatility in currency and weak market demand, primarily in Brazil, China and Eastern Europe.Innovation Mantra – A Secret to Success?Whirlpool is among the few companies that heavily invest in technologies to produce differentiated products to suit the needs of their end consumers. Evidently, the company inked a deal with Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report), to introduce voice-controlled home appliances. Also, Whirlpool is keen on boosting revenues of its core appliance business through expansions and investments. This, in turn, is expected to fuel growth of its high-margin categories.Other Strategic EndeavorsWhirlpool is striving to improve its margins through a series of measures, including cost-based price increments and cost-reduction initiatives that are focused on improving business efficiency. Though second-quarter 2017 was disappointing from margins perspective, the company has very strong initiatives to facilitate operating margin expansion in the second half.Recently, management also outlined significant long-term targets through 2020, backed by brand strength and product portfolio. The company aims to deliver organic revenue growth of 3–5% every year.Going forward, Whirlpool anticipates growth efforts to boost consumer demand and lead to enhanced price mix. This, in turn encouraged management to target its operating margin to exceed 10% by 2020. Further, the company envisions earnings per share to grow by 10–15% each year.Bottom LineWe expect Whirlpool’s robust strategies to spark a turnaround in its performance. This is likely to bolster share prices and attract investors in the near term.3 Picks You Can’t MissSome better-ranked stocks in the broader Consumer Discretionary sector include Crocs, Inc. (CROX  -  Free Report), G-III Apparel Group, Ltd. (GIII  -  Free Report) and PVH Corp. (PVH  -  Free Report).Crocs, with a long-term earnings growth rate of 15% has pulled off average positive earnings surprise of 83.9% in the last four quarters. Also, it sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.    G-III Apparel, a Zacks Rank #1 stock, has delivered positive earnings surprise of 42.3% in the last quarter. Moreover, it has a long-term earnings growth rate of 15%.PVH Corp. carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and has a long-term earnings growth rate of 12.6%. Also, its earnings have surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters by an average of 3.6%.5 Trades Could Profit ""Big-League"" from Trump PoliciesIf the stocks above spark your interest, wait until you look into companies primed to make substantial gains from Washington's changing course.Today Zacks reveals 5 tickers that could benefit from new trends like streamlined drug approvals, tariffs, lower taxes, higher interest rates, and spending surges in defense and infrastructure.See these buy recommendations now >>
"
393,WHR,"After a fantastic 9 months, I thought now would be a good time to talk about paying attention to your portfolio  keeping an eye on your holdings, monitoring your watchlists, pulling profits and getting rid of losers or underperformers.  
"
394,WHR,"It's ironic but during great times like these, when it seems like all of your stocks are going up, investors can form bad habits or get lazy. Even bad decisions can sometimes get rewarded in a bull market.  
"
395,WHR,"But when the market stops going straight up, that's when you can really get into trouble.   
"
396,WHR,"So you need to keep paying attention and exercise common sense over your portfolio.  
"
397,WHR,"And as the title suggests, there's no particular magic in making money (or keeping it), just good old-fashioned common sense. The trick is exercising it!  
"
398,WHR,"Deciding on what stocks to get into is, of course, important. But once you're in, it doesn't mean your work is over.  
"
399,WHR,"Whatever your stocks are, whether they be actual holdings or stocks you're considering, don't stop monitoring the fundamentals of those stocks.  
"
400,WHR,"What I mean is: If one of the criteria for getting into a stock in the first place was that it had a low Debt-to-Equity ratio, but you then saw that ratio change to an unacceptable level (a level that would not have put it on your radar screen in the first place), then you should consider getting out of that stock and looking for a new stock to replace it. One that currently does meet your criteria. 
"
401,WHR,"For instance, let's say that you use the Zacks Rank as a timing indicator and you look at the Zacks #1 Rank List for immediate movers. If in a few weeks, earnings estimates are moving down and Zacks Ranks it a Zacks #4 ('sell') Rank, take note and consider dumping it.  
"
402,WHR,"Sure it was a Zacks #1 ('strong buy') Rank, but it's not a Zacks #1 Rank (or Zacks #2 ('buy') Rank) anymore.  
"
403,WHR,"Think about it, if you never would have gotten into a Zacks #4 Rank in the first place, why would you now want to hold onto one? 
"
404,WHR,"That's using your common sense.  
"
405,WHR,"What if youre a momentum investor and you generally look for stocks trading within 10% of its 52-week high (a great item by the way) and it suddenly falls below that level? Well, if you're only interested in focusing on stocks within 10% of its high and it's now 15% or 20% (or more) off its high ... then move on. The momentum has seemingly shifted and so should your focus.  
"
406,WHR,"And don't convince yourself to hang onto your losers either. If a company reported bad earnings and the stock is down 8% to -10% against you, get out. Don't let your love of a stock (or denial) ruin your portfolio. Almost every big losing trade anybody has ever had in their portfolio (-50%, -60% or even 90% or more) could have been exited when they were just beginning to crumble.  
"
407,WHR,"If you get out and it zips back up, you can always get back in if you want. But if it keeps going down, you're just losing more and more money. And the price you could have gotten out at earlier is now a price you only wish you could get out at now.  
"
408,WHR,"So once you've found the items that have proven to work well for you in picking profitable stocks, be sure to monitor those values. And if they no longer meet the winning criteria, get rid of them fast and find new ones that do.

415,WHR,"This week, I'm going to focus on a simple strategy that uses the PEG Ratio for determining a company's undervaluation or overvaluation. 
"
416,WHR,"Let's first start with a definition.  
"
417,WHR,"A PEG ratio is simply the: P/E Ratio divided by the Growth Rate  
"
418,WHR,"A value of 1 or less is considered good (at par or undervalued), while a value of greater than 1, in general, is not as good (overvalued). 
"
419,WHR,"Once again, the PEG Ratio is simply the P/E Ratio divided by the Growth Rate. Many believe this ratio tells a more complete story than just the P/E. 
"
420,WHR,"A company with a P/E Ratio of 25 and a Growth Rate of 20 would have a PEG Ratio of 1.25 (25 / 20 = 1.25).  
"
421,WHR,"While a company with a P/E Ratio of 40 and a Growth Rate of 50 would have a PEG Ratio of 0.8. 
"
422,WHR,"Traditionally, investors would look at the stock with the lower P/E Ratio and deem it a bargain (undervalued). But looking at it closer, you can see it doesn't have the growth rate to justify its P/E.  
"
423,WHR,"The stock with the P/E of 40, though, is actually the better bargain since its PEG Ratio is lower (0.8), implying it's undervalued with more potential value. (Undervalued in relation to its projected growth rate.)  
"
424,WHR,"In other words, the lower the PEG, the better the value because the investor would be paying less for each unit of earnings growth.  
"
425,WHR,"So for this week's screen, we're going to use the PEG ratio to find value.  
"
426,WHR,"Let's first start with: Zacks Rank equal to 1
"
427,WHR,"(Only stocks with a Zacks Rank of a 'Strong Buy' get through.) Average Broker Rating less than or equal to 2.5
"
428,WHR,"(The brokers have to be on board as well. Only companies in the better part of a Strong Buy or Buy are allowed.) Projected One Year Growth Rate greater than or equal to 20
"
429,WHR,"(Strong performers are what we're looking for.) PEG Ratio less than 1
"
430,WHR,"(P/E using F(1) divided by its F(1) projected growth rate.) (We're using a classic, text book example to identify undervalued stocks.) Price greater than or equal to $5Avg. 20 Day Volume greater than or equal to 100,000

445,WHR,"NIKE, Inc. (NKE  -  Free Report) is slated to release first-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Sep 26. The question lingering in investors’ minds is whether this athletic goods behemoth will be able to post a positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. Notably, NIKE has delivered positive earnings surprises for 20 straight quarters.  In the trailing four quarters, the company delivered an average positive surprise of 25%. So, let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.What to Expect?The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at 48 cents, which is way below the year-ago period figure of 73 cents. We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate has remained nearly stable over the past 30 days. Additionally, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of roughly $9.1 billion, up slightly by 0.2% from the year-ago quarter.Factors at PlayNIKE’s progress on its strategic initiatives has been reflected in every quarter’s results for over three fiscal years now. The company has been gaining from its robust growth and innovation efforts, which along with reduced expenses fueled the bottom line in the last quarter. The company is also benefiting from strong e-commerce initiatives. Notably, the enhancement of digital platform has led NIKE to nearly double its revenue contributions from NIKE.com and its apps in just two years, going over the $2 billion contribution mark in fiscal 2017. Incidentally, global Direct-to-Consumer businesses and growth at international locations largely augmented NIKE’s top line in fourth-quarter fiscal 2017.Nike, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Nike, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Nike, Inc. QuoteApart from this, management remains confident of growth drivers like efficient supply chain and enhanced sync between the digital and physical experiences. Moreover, the company is focused on Consumer Direct Offense (“CDO”) plan, which focuses on using digital methods for rapid innovation and product development, along with strengthening consumer relations by operating through core regions. This, in turn is backed by its “triple-double” strategy which is aimed at doubling innovation, speed and direct connection with customers. All these factors reflect Nike’s growth prospects.However, NIKE has been battling soft sales in North America owing to lackluster product assortments and intensified competition. The company’s wholesale business in the region has also been impacted due to increased focus on online sales. Moreover, the overall environment is expected to remain promotional in North America, which is likely to hurt results in this segment. Furthermore, adverse currency movements are expected to continue weighing upon NIKE’s performance, as evident from its outlook. Evidently, the company anticipates reported revenues to be flat in first-quarter fiscal 2018, with gross margin forecasted to contract 150-180 bps due to currency headwinds.Together, currency woes and difficult trends in North America make us cautious about the company’s overall performance. So, let’s see if NIKE’s robust strategies and e-commerce strength can manage to offset the hurdles and keep its splendid surprise streak alive. While the company’s shares have jumped 5.7% year to date, it has lagged the Zacks Consumer Discretionary Sector’s 13.8% growth.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not conclusively show that NIKE is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.NIKE currently carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%, as both the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 48 cents.

446,WHR,"The Finish Line, Inc.  is slated to release second-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Sep 22. The question lingering in investors’ minds is whether this specialty retailer of athletic footwear, activewear and accessories will be able to post a positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. Well, Finish Line's bottom line lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, by an average of 14.5%. This seems to be the reason as why the company has slumped 42.8% so far this year, wider than the industry’s 22.8% decline.  So, let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.What to Expect?The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at 11 cents, which is way below the year-ago period figure of 55 cents. Moreover, we note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate has declined sharply over the past 30 days. Additionally, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of roughly $470.5 million, down 7.6% from the year-ago quarter.Factors at PlayFinish Line recently posted disappointing preliminary numbers for the second quarter, which compelled management to lower its guidance for fiscal 2018. Management stated that the athletic space witnessed intense promotional activities in the quarter, which weighed upon sales and gross margin. Sales in the quarter dropped 3.3% to $469.4 million owing to a 4.6% fall in comparable store sales (comps). Further the gross margin remained pressurized on account of soft sales and greater markdowns. Consequently, the company envisions the second-quarter earnings to lie in a band of 8-12 cents per share. The company expects the retail space to remain extremely competitive and promotional in the remainder of fiscal 2018. The Finish Line, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  The Finish Line, Inc.

447,WHR,"Whirlpool Corporation (WHR  -  Free Report) has recently concluded the two-year expansion of its manufacturing unit in La Tablada city in Buenos Aires Province, Argentina. This facility is likely to manufacture front load washing machines with Sense Inverter technology.The latest expansion is in sync with the more than $20 million investment plan initiated last year, following commencement of manufacturing at the facility. With this expansion, the company has successfully introduced its global platform and innovations to the Argentina market, which is among its key business centers.Further, this calls for the addition of Argentina to Whirlpool’s roster of facilities that already include 70 manufacturing and technology research units across the globe. Not only this, the new facility is expected to add about 100 new and 300 indirect jobs in the region.Additionally, we expect this facility to enhance the sales of the company’s Latin America region. Notably, the Latin America segment contributed 15.7% to net sales in third-quarter 2017, reflecting a sales growth of 6.1% year over year. Though the region is performing well, its operating margin growth was somewhat hurt by raw material inflation and adverse product price/mix in the quarter.Notably, Whirlpool is among the few companies that heavily invest in technologies to produce differentiated products to suit the needs of their end consumers. Therefore, we believe the latest manufacturing facility strategically fits the company’s practice of providing innovative products to consumers, thereby helping them to develop the home ecosystem.However, this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company’s shares have lost 8.9% in the past six months, narrower than the industry’s plunge of 20.9%. Much of the stock’s decline can be attributed to Whirlpool’s dismal surprise history. While the bottom line delivered fifth consecutive negative earnings surprise in the third quarter, sales marked its second straight miss.Nevertheless, we remain optimistic about the company’s 2020 goals, ongoing growth initiatives, global cost-based pricing and fixed cost reduction strategies, which are likely to drive growth and make Whirlpool investors’ favorite.Looking for Trending Picks, Check TheseSome better-ranked stocks in the broader Consumer Discretionary sector include Ralph Lauren Corporation (RL  -  Free Report), Guess?, Inc.

448,WHR,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for Whirlpool Corporation (WHR  -  Free Report). Shares have lost around 8.7% in that time frame, underperforming the market.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to the stock's next earnings release, or is the stock due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Whirlpool Q3 Earnings & Sales Miss, Cuts ViewWhirlpool reported third-quarter 2017 results, wherein both earnings and sales missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The quarter marked the company’s fifth consecutive negative earnings surprise and second straight sales miss. Additionally, management cut earnings guidance for 2017 due to higher raw material inflation and unfavorable price/mix.Q3 HighlightsWhirlpool’s quarterly adjusted earnings per share came in at $3.83 that missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.90.  However, it increased 4.7% year over year.On a GAAP basis, the company’s earnings grew 20% to $3.72 per share from $3.10 earned in the prior-year quarter. The upside was driven by lower income tax expense versus year-ago period, owing to the timing of tax planning activities in the current year.Revenues were $5,418 million that rose nearly 4% from the comparable year-ago quarter revenues of $5,248 million. The top line fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5,487 million. On a currency-neutral basis, Whirlpool registered sales growth of 2%. Markedly, the top line benefited from strength in North America, Asia and Latin America.  Further, adjusted operating profit in the quarter dropped 9.8% to $376 million from $417 million in the year-ago quarter. Also, the operating margin contracted 100 basis points (bps) to 6.9%. During the quarter, ongoing cost productivity and increased unit volumes were more than offset by the adverse product price/mix and raw material inflation.Regional PerformanceRevenues from North America went up 3.5% year over year to $3 billion while the same grew 4% on a currency-neutral basis. Adjusted operating profit margin contracted 40 bps to 11.7% while in dollar terms operating profit grew 1.2% to $350 million. Notably, operating profit gains reflected from higher unit volumes and cost productivity negated adverse currency impacts and raw material inflation. However, the negative impact of raw material price inflation dented operating margins. Yet, the company retained North-American industry unit shipments guidance of 4-6% growth for 2017.Revenues from Latin America rose 6.1% year over year to $849 million. Also, the same increased 5% excluding the effects of currency translation. Adjusted operating margin of 6.3% increased 50 bps, on the back of higher volumes and cost productivity gains, more than offset by raw material inflation and adverse product price/mix. The company reiterates its industry unit shipments in Brazil to be flat in 2017.Meanwhile, revenues from EMEA remained flat year over year at $1.3 billion. On a currency-neutral basis, the same dropped 8%. Whirlpool reported adjusted operating profit of $11 million in the third quarter versus adjusted operating profit of $48 million in the year-ago quarter. Further, its adjusted operating margin came in at 0.8%, which fell 290 bps from the year-ago period. The decline can be attributed to raw material inflation, adverse product price/mix as well as lower volumes that were more than offset by cost productivity benefits and restructuring gains. However, Whirlpool reaffirms its industry unit shipments growth in 2017 in the range of flat to up 2%.Revenues from Asia grew 5.6% to $357 million in third-quarter 2017 from $338 million in the prior-year quarter. Excluding currency effects, revenues rose 4%. However, adjusted operating margin contracted 430 bps to 0.6%. Cost productivity gains were more than compensated with adverse product price/mix in China and raw material inflation. Nevertheless, management maintains its industry unit shipments guidance in the range of flat to 2% growth for 2017.Financial PositionWhirlpool had cash and cash equivalents of $1,087 million as of Sep 30, 2017 and long-term debt of $3,669 million.The company used cash of $33 million in operating activities during the nine months of 2017. In the same period, the company’s capital expenditure was $371 million. As of Sep 30, 2017, Whirlpool had negative free cash flow of $348 million due to the company's focus on working capital optimization.In the reported quarter, management bought back shares for nearly $200 million and intends to repurchase in the remaining period of 2017. Moreover, Whirlpool bought back shares worth $550 million and paid cash dividend of $235 million in the nine months of 2017.Other DevelopmentsWe note that Whirlpool has been witnessing significantly higher raw material prices, which are expected further increase through 2018. In October, management announced to its trade customers, global cost-based pricing that will include most of the company’s operations in order to mitigate raw material inflation. This is anticipated to be implemented in the fourth quarter and the first quarter of 2018.Furthermore, Whirlpool took initiatives to cut down its fixed overhead expenses by $150 million. These initiatives are likely to be implemented in early 2018 and add to its ongoing cost productivity program.GuidanceWhirlpool slashed earnings forecasts for 2017 based on raw material inflation and adverse price/mix. The company now envisions adjusted earnings per share for 2017 in a range of $13.60-$13.90 compared with $14.50-$15.00, guided earlier. On a GAAP basis, Whirlpool anticipates earnings in a range of $11.10-$11.40 per share compared with the previous estimate of $12.40-$12.90 for 2017.Nonetheless, the company continues to anticipate generating free cash flow of about $900 million for 2017 while it revised operating cash flows guidance to range from $1.55–$1.6 billion. Earlier, the company had anticipated operating cash flows of $1.65-$1.7 billion.The revised guidance includes restructured cash outlays of approximately $175 million, legacy product warranty and liability costs of $70 million, pension contributions of $45 million and capital expenditures of $650-$700 million.Also, management stated that it reiterates 2020 goals and remains optimistic about ongoing growth initiatives as well as global cost-based pricing and fixed cost reduction strategies.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?Following the release, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates. There have been two revisions lower for the current quarter. In the past month, the consensus estimate has shifted lower by 17.8% due to these changes.Whirlpool Corporation Price and Consensus  Whirlpool Corporation Price and Consensus | Whirlpool Corporation QuoteVGM ScoresAt this time, Whirlpool's stock has an average Growth Score of C, though it is lagging a lot on the momentum front with an F. However, the stock was allocated a grade of B on the value side, putting it in the top 40% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of C. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.Our style scores indicate that the stock is more suitable for value investors than growth investors.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock. The magnitude of this revision also indicates a downward shift. It's no surprise that the stock has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). We expect below average returns from the stock in the next few months.

449,WHR,"Conn's, Inc. (CONN  -  Free Report) is slated to release second-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Sep 7. The question lingering in investors’ minds is whether this specialty retailer of furniture, home appliances and consumer electronics, and provider of consumer loans will be able to post a positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. Notably, Conn's bottom line has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, by an average of 80.9%. So, let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Conn's, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Conn's, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Conn's, Inc. QuoteWhat to Expect?The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at a loss of 2 cents, compared with a loss of 4 cents reported in the year-ago period. We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate has remained stable over the last 30 days. However, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of roughly $371.9 million, down 6.6% from the year-ago quarter.Factors at PlayConn's has been gaining from its differentiated business strategy, which has also helped it surge 53.7% so far this year, outpacing the industry’s 24.2% growth. The company remains focused on undertaking strategic initiatives to solidify its credit division. Further, the company recently inked a deal with Aaron's, Inc.’s (AAN  -  Free Report) subsidiary — Progressive Leasing, per which the latter will offer lease-to-own payment solutions to those customers who are not eligible for Conn’s proprietary credit offering. The implementation of this deal was done ahead of plan, which makes management hopeful about tapping greater lease-to-own sales.However, some analysts remain skeptical, owing to Hurricane Harvey’s impact on Conn’s Houston stores. Also, unfavorable delinquencies and Trump’s immigration plan may impede results, per these analysts. Further, the company’s retail sales in the last quarter were hampered by soft consumer patterns and underwriting changes made in fiscal 2017. These factors may be a threat to Conn’s upcoming performance too. In fact, management expects comps to decrease in a range of 12-15% in second-quarter fiscal 2018. Given the mixed signals, we prefer to wait and see if Conn’s can pull a surprise this earnings season too.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Conn's is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESPand a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with ourEarnings ESP Filter.Conn's currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company has an Earnings ESP of -100.00%, as the Most Accurate Estimate of a loss of 3 cents is wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The combination of Conn's Zacks Rank #3 and negative ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.Stocks with Favorable CombinationHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Restoration Hardware Holdings Inc. (RH  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +2.88% and a Zacks Rank #3. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.G-III Apparel Group, Ltd.

450,WHR,"Shares of Whirlpool Corporation (WHR  -  Free Report) have dropped 6.5% since it reported lower-than-expected second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 26.Moreover, this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) stock has declined 5.2% in the last three months against the Zacks categorized Consumer Discretionary sector’s gain of 2.9%. Currently, the sector is placed at the bottom 44% of the Zacks classified sectors (9 out of 16).Let’s delve deeper to know the factors weighing upon the stock.Soft Q2 Results & GuidanceWhirlpool witnessed fourth consecutive negative earnings surprise in the second quarter, with a trailing four-quarter average miss of 5.8%. Moreover, earnings declined 4.3% year over year due to increased raw material inflation. While, the company’s revenues rose year over year owing to strength in North America and Latin America, it lagged estimates after two straight quarters of beat.Moreover, management slashed its earnings guidance for 2017 due to higher raw material cost and lower product price/mix in China and Europe. It now envisions adjusted earnings in the range of $14.50–$15.00 per share compared with $14.75–$15.50, guided earlier. (Read more: Whirlpool Falls on Q2 Earnings & Sales Miss, Cuts View)Consequently, estimates witnessed downward revisions in the last seven days. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $14.80 and $17.16 for 2017 and 2018, respectively, has moved down 32 cents and 36 cents. Also, estimates for the third quarter declined 2 cents to $4.20.Other HeadwindsWhirlpool’s operating performance is significantly dependent on the price of raw materials, and the volatility in commodity prices has been adversely affecting its performance. Evidently, adjusted operating profit in the reported quarter declined 14.6% year over year to $373, while the operating margin contracted 150 basis points to 6.9%.We note that Whirlpool’s customer concentration is also high, which is expected to negatively impact the company’s margins. Further, this world’s largest home-appliances manufacturer derives a significant portion of its revenues from international operations, which exposes it to risks such as currency headwinds, imposition of foreign tariffs and other trade barriers.In fact, the current challenging global economic environment is weighing on the company’s performance in terms of volatility in currency and weak market demand, primarily in Brazil, China and Eastern Europe.Can the Tables Turn?Whirlpool is amongst those few companies that heavily invest in technology for producing differentiated products for their end consumers. This is evident from the company’s deal with Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report), to introduce voice-controlled home appliances.Furthermore, its growth strategies, disciplined operational execution and balanced capital allocation bode well. Also, its significant long-term targets through 2020, backed by brand strength and product portfolio, remain encouraging.Now, let’s wait and see whether these growth endeavors can counter the company’s headwinds and aid it to spark a turnaround.Meanwhile, you can consider some better-ranked stocks in the broader Consumer Discretionary space that include Nutrisystem, Inc. (NTRI  -  Free Report) and The Container Store Group, Inc. (TCS  -  Free Report).Nutrisystem pulled off an average positive earnings surprise of 23.8% in the last four quarters and has a long-term earnings growth rate of 18.3%. Also, the stock sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The Container Store Group has delivered average positive earnings surprise of 34.9% in the last four quarters and carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Moreover, it has a long-term earnings growth rate of 8%.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers.

504,WHR,"In  2002 , the Zacks #1 Rank stocks returned just over 1%, with an average portfolio size of approximately 200 stocks. An impressive return when compared to the S&P 500s 22% loss. But holding onto 200 or so stocks isnt doable for most investors. But when adding the two aforementioned filters, the portfolio size shrinks to a tradable 10 stocks (on average), and a phenomenal 18.1% average annualized return.  
"
505,WHR,"In  2003 , the Zacks #1 Rank list (approximately 200 stocks) did nearly 75% in comparison to the S&P 500s almost 29%. But the filtered Zacks Rank narrowed that list down to only 10 stocks (on average) with a return of over 66%. (And while its true the filtered Zacks Rank produced a smaller return than the full Zacks Rank (66% vs. 75%), rebalancing only 10 stocks a month is far more manageable than 200.) 
"
506,WHR,"In  2004 , the returns for the Zacks #1 Rank stocks were up 28.8% with an average portfolio size of 202 stocks. (The S&P was up only 10.9%.) But the filtered Zacks #1 Ranks annualized returns were up 30.3%, with again only 10 stocks to hold on average. 
"
507,WHR,"In  2005 , the complete list of the Zacks #1 Rank stocks showed an average annualized gross return of 31.7% with an average portfolio size of 208 stocks. The Filtered Zacks Rank was up 42.4%, but with an average portfolio size of only 10-12 stocks. (And while both of these numbers are impressive, 10-12 stocks is way easier to trade than 208!) 
"
508,WHR,"In  2006 , the average annualized return for the Filtered Zacks Rank was up 34.3%, holding on average of only eight stocks in your portfolio. 
"
509,WHR,"And so far in  2007 , (YTD through 4/20/07), the Filtered Zacks Ranks average compounded gross return is already up 21% with an average of only 6-7 stocks held at a time.   
"
510,WHR,"I also ran these strategies using a one-week holding period with very impressive results. In fact, the Filtered Zacks Ranks compounded gross return is up 35.3% so far this year with an average portfolio size of only six stocks. 
"
511,WHR,"Heres a few of the stocks that qualified the Filtered Zacks Rank for 5/1/07:

"
514,WHR,"Previously in these articles, I've written on how a lot of people typically like to look for low beta stocks or lower volatility stocks.  
"
515,WHR,"But this week I want to focus on higher beta stocks. What is Beta? 
"
516,WHR,"First and foremost, 'beta' is a measure of an asset's risk relative to the 'market' (usually the S&P 500). (It's typically calculated as the 'performance a stock has experienced in the last 5 years as the S&P has moved up and down'.)  
"
517,WHR,"A beta of 1 means the stock's relative volatility is equal to that of the market. Therefore, a beta that's greater than 1 is more volatile than the market and a beta of less than 1 is less volatile. (It can also be explained as its excess movement or 'return'.)  
"
518,WHR,"For instance, a beta of 1.5 will have 1 1/2 times the market's movement (50% more movement than the market). But if the market is plummeting, more than likely you're dropping even more than the market.  
"
519,WHR,"Of course, if the market is going up, these stocks should be going up 1 1/2 times (or 50% more) than the market. Test Results 
"
520,WHR,"Let's take a look at some statistics.  
"
521,WHR,"I ran several tests on the Research Wizard. The first ones I did were for stocks with betas half as much as the market, and the other with betas 50% more than the market.  
"
522,WHR,"The results of this test didn't really surprise me that much, since the high beta stocks moved more than the market and the low beta stocks moved less than the market. But the high beta stocks didn't lose 50% more than the market and the low beta stocks didn't lose 50% less. But there was some interesting stuff.  
"
523,WHR,"The high beta stocks, using a 1-week rebalancing method between 1/4/08 and 3/6/09 (the low of the market), lost -59.9% while the market 'only' lost -51.0%, for an excess loss of -8.9 percentage points.
"
524,WHR,"The low beta stocks lost -42.8% versus the S&P 500's -51.0%, meaning it outperformed the S&P (lost less) by 8.2 percentage points.  
"
525,WHR,"However, during the periods of 3/6/09 thru 8/28/09 (the period immediately following the market's low), the high beta stocks showed a compounded return of 127.8% vs. the S&P's 52.5%, nearly two and a half times the market's return.  
"
526,WHR,"The low beta stocks, however, showed just a 29.1% return, well under the market's 52.5% performance. (All of the tests were applied to stocks with prices >= $5 and average daily share volume of >= 50,000.)  
"
527,WHR,"So, true to form, the high beta stocks DID show greater movement than their low beta counterparts  on both the upside and downside.  
"
528,WHR,"The reason why I'm singling out high beta stocks now is because they didn't lose as much on the way down as you might've expected, but the excess return on the way up is staggering.  
"
529,WHR,"And by focusing on the strongest of the high beta stocks, these should be the ones to outperform the most as the market continues on.  
"
530,WHR,"Here's a screen I'm currently using to scan for good stocks with betas 50% or higher than the market: Zacks Rank  =  1 (Only Strong Buys)Beta  >=  1.5 (At least 50% more than the market)Price  >=  5Avg. 20-day Volume  >= 50,000

"
534,WHR,"Every week, I usually either outline a unique way to screen for stocks or go over a proven, profitable trading strategy. 
"
535,WHR,"But this week, I thought Id start at square one and explain why screening is so important. But even more importantly, why backtesting is the most important step of all. Why Should I Use a Stock Screener?
"
536,WHR,"The short answer is: 
"
537,WHR,"Because there are over 10,000 stocks out there and you need a way to find the good ones. 
"
538,WHR,"The longer answer is: 
"
539,WHR,"Other than buying the stocks that are talked about on TV or written in the paper (not to mention tips from a friend), how else are you going to find stocks that meet certain fundamental characteristics? 
"
540,WHR,"Even if you dont use a screener now, most people still do their own screening one way or another. They may hear that a stock has a certain Growth Rate, or a certain P/E Ratio or Sales Surprise, for example. They then listen for or read about stocks that meet this criteria. 
"
541,WHR,"Well, if you want to find stocks that meet certain criteria, you can find them quickly and easily with a stock screener. 
"
542,WHR,"But, just because you narrow down 10,000 stocks to only a handful, doesnt necessarily mean that youve picked the best stocks on the planet. 
"
543,WHR,"You might have picked the worst ones.  
"
544,WHR,"But how will you know?  Backtesting! 
"
545,WHR,"Once youve created a screen, you can then backtest it to see how well your screening strategy has performed. 
"
546,WHR,"Does your screen generally find stocks that go up once theyve been identified? Or does your screen generally find stocks that get buried once theyve been identified? 
"
547,WHR,"This is good stuff to know. 
"
548,WHR,"With backtesting, you can see how successful your stock-picking strategy has performed in the past. Youll then have a better idea of your probability for success - now and in the future. 
"
549,WHR,"Of course, past performance is no guarantee of future results, but what else do you have to go by? 
"
550,WHR,"Think about it; if you saw that a stock picking strategy did nothing but lose money over and over again, theres NO WAY youd want to trade that strategy or use that screen to pick stocks. 
"
551,WHR,"Why?  
"
552,WHR,"Because its proven that it picks bad stocks. 
"
553,WHR,"Sure, it may turn around and start picking winners, but it may also continue to pick losing stocks the way it always has. 
"
554,WHR,"One the other hand; 
"
555,WHR,"... what if you saw a strategy that did great period after period, youd of course want to trade that strategy. 
"
556,WHR,"Why? 
"
557,WHR,"Because its proven to be a profitable trading strategy. 
"
558,WHR,"And while it may start picking losers all of a sudden, it may also continue to pick winning stocks, just like it had been doing over and over before. 
"
559,WHR,"Keep in mind, a screening and backtesting program isnt a box of magic.   But its a great way to see what works and what doesnt BEFORE you put your money at risk! 
"
560,WHR,"Dont get me wrong, just because you have a great strategy for picking winning stocks, it isnt going to preclude you from ever having another loser. On the contrary, even some of the best strategies only have win ratios of 70% or 80%. (NOT 100%.) 
"
561,WHR,"But if your strategy picks winners far more often than losers, you can feel confident that your next pick will have a high probability of success. 
"
562,WHR,"And dont be the guy who accidentally gets into one or two good stocks and thinks hes the next Warren Buffett. If your stock account is important to you, test your stock-picking strategies to see if your method for finding winners is a repeatable one. 
"
563,WHR,"And thats why someone should use a Screener and a Backtester. 
"
564,WHR,"As usual, Ill close with a few new picks from some of my favorite backtested screening strategies for the week of 02/18/08:

580,WHR,"Last Weeks Momentum Zacks Rank Buy StocksAmBev (ABV) has soared over 52% year to date, reflecting positive earnings estimate revisions for both 2007 and 2008. Look for the positive momentum to continue, with a breakout from near-term resistance being a particularly bullish technical development. ABV has returned an average of 41% over the last four years. After soaring to new highs in mid-June, the stock summarily slipped roughly 12% before rebounding from the 50-day moving average. ABV is currently trading at the 52-week high.

582,WHR,"Enbridge Inc. (ENB) has gained an average of 27.1% per year over the last four years. The stock is up just over 5.7% for 2007, compared to a gain of 9.2% for the S&P 500. This years return may not seem very impressive; however, the stock is up over 14% from year-to-date lows and is currently trading against 52-week highs, in-line with resistance levels. A strong break to the upside would be particularly bullish and would help confirm the stocks recent momentum. However, interested investors should wait for this break before taking action. Also, any breakout should also be accompanied by a cross of the 21-day moving average above the 50-day moving average. This technical indicator could spur other traders into action, further driving the stock to new highs.

584,WHR,"Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM) continues to benefit from the strong fundamentals in the global energy market. The stock has risen over 17% year to date, reflecting increasing full-year estimates and a track record of positive earnings surprises. On Jul 13, the International Energy Agency reported that global oil demand will increase 2.5% in 2008. The organization went on to demand that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) increase production to stabilize prices. However, OPEC has been unwilling to boost output due to the falling value of the dollar, which has reduced the purchasing power of the OPEC barrel. Also, despite rising prices, demand has not slowed, further reducing the likelihood of an increase in output.

586,WHR,"Monsanto Company (MON) continues to reach new highs, capitalizing on the companys increasing estimates and earnings momentum. Also, the strong fundamentals of the agricultural industry should further demand for the companys cutting-edge genetic and herbicidal products. Monsanto continues to trend higher and is currently trading near 52-week highs, well above the major moving averages. Furthermore, the MACD line recently made a fresh cross above the signal line, hinting at the possibility of additional momentum and price acceleration. Looking ahead, the ethanol induced agriculture boom should continue to support Monsantos earnings momentum and drive the stock to new highs.

624,WHR,"I ran a series of separate tests on the Filtered Zacks Rank strategy over each of the last five years (2002 through 2006). I rebalanced the portfolio every four weeks and started each run on different start dates so each test would be rebalanced over a different set of four-week periods. (This is done to eliminate coincidence and verify robustness.) 
"
625,WHR,"In  2002 , the Zacks #1 Rank stocks returned just over 1%, with an average portfolio size of approximately 200 stocks. An impressive return when compared to the S&P 500s 22% loss. But holding onto 200 or so stocks isnt doable for most investors. But when adding the two aforementioned filters, the portfolio size shrinks to a tradable 10 stocks (on average), and a phenomenal 18.1% average annualized return.  
"
626,WHR,"In  2003 , the Zacks #1 Rank list (approximately 200 stocks) did nearly 75% in comparison to the S&P 500s almost 29%. But the filtered Zacks Rank narrowed that list down to only 10 stocks (on average) with a return of over 66%. (And while its true the filtered Zacks Rank produced a smaller return than the full Zacks Rank (66% vs. 75%), rebalancing only 10 stocks a month is far more manageable than 200.) 
"
627,WHR,"In  2004 , the returns for the Zacks #1 Rank stocks were up 28.8% with an average portfolio size of 202 stocks. (The S&P was up only 10.9%.) But the filtered Zacks #1 Ranks annualized returns were up 30.3%, with again only 10 stocks to hold on average. 
"
628,WHR,"In  2005 , the complete list of the Zacks #1 Rank stocks showed an average annualized gross return of 31.7% with an average portfolio size of 208 stocks. The Filtered Zacks Rank was up 42.4%, but with an average portfolio size of only 10-12 stocks. (And while both of these numbers are impressive, 10-12 stocks is way easier to trade than 208!) 
"
629,WHR,"In  2006 , the average annualized return for the Filtered Zacks Rank was up 34.3%, holding on average of only eight stocks in your portfolio. 
"
630,WHR,"And so far in  2007 , (YTD through 4/20/07), the Filtered Zacks Ranks average compounded gross return is already up 21% with an average of only 6-7 stocks held at a time.   
"
631,WHR,"I also ran these strategies using a one-week holding period with very impressive results. In fact, the Filtered Zacks Ranks compounded gross return is up 35.3% so far this year with an average portfolio size of only six stocks.

635,WHR,"A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Whirlpool Corporation (WHR  -  Free Report). Shares have added about 9.7% in that time frame.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is WHR due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Whirlpool Q1 Earnings & Sales Miss, GAAP View TrimmedWhirlpool reported dismal first-quarter 2018 results as both earnings and sales missed estimates. However, top and bottom lines improved year over year driven by progress on its global cost-based price increases and fixed cost-reduction initiatives. With this, the company reported negative earnings in six of the last seven quarters. Moreover, this marked its fourth straight quarter of top-line miss.Q1 HighlightsWhirlpool delivered adjusted earnings per share of $2.81, lagging the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.92. However, its bottom line rose 12% from $2.50 per share earned in the year-ago quarter. Bottom-line results gained from smooth progress on its global cost-based price increases and fixed cost reduction initiatives, which also boosted adjusted EBIT.On a GAAP basis, the company reported earnings of $1.30 per share, down 35.3% from $2.01 in the prior-year quarter.Revenues of $4,911 million rose nearly 2.6% from the comparable year-ago quarter revenues of $4,786 million. However, the top line fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5,003 million. On a currency-neutral basis, sales declined 0.7%.Further, adjusted operating profit (EBIT) improved 3.5% to $295 million from $285 million in the year-ago quarter. However, operating margin remained flat with last year at 6%. Apart from the aforementioned gains, operating margin was aided by favorable product price/mix and restructuring benefits, partly negated by raw material inflation, unit-volume declines and unfavorable currency.Regional PerformanceRevenues from North America rose 4.2% to $2.5 billion while it increased 2.5% on a currency-neutral basis. Adjusted operating profit margin expanded 20 bps to 11.4%. In dollar terms, operating profit grew 4.7% to $288 million. Notably, operating profit gains reflected from favorable product price/mix and unit-volume growth, which mitigated the negative impact of raw material inflation.Revenues from Latin America declined 2.5% year over year to $898 million. Excluding currency translations, it dipped 3.2%. Adjusted operating margin of 6.3% contracted 90 bps, mainly due to raw material inflation and unfavorable cost productivity, partly neutralized by favorable product price/mix and restructuring benefits. In dollar terms, operating income declined 13.6% to $57 million.Meanwhile, revenues from EMEA increased 10% to $1.1 billion. On a currency-neutral basis, it dropped 8.1%. Whirlpool reported adjusted operating loss of $27 million in the first quarter compared with an operating loss of $23 million in the year-ago quarter. The decline can be attributed to raw material inflation, unit-volume declines and unfavorable currency, offset by favorable product price/mix and cost productivity gains.Revenues from Asia improved nearly 3% to $448 million from $435 million in the prior-year quarter. Excluding currency effects, revenues decreased 1.9%. Moreover, the segment reported adjusted operating profit of $19 million, down 20.8% from the year-ago quarter. Further, adjusted operating margin contracted 140 bps to 4.2%. Raw material inflation and negative-currency movements were the main culprits for the decline, partly offset by the favorable impact from cost productivity.Financial PositionWhirlpool had cash and cash equivalents of $1,041 million as of Mar 31, 2018, and long-term debt of $4,190 million.The company used $713 million cash in operating activities in first-quarter 2018 and reported negative free cash flow of $756 million. Capital expenditures for the first quarter totaled $66 million.Going ahead, the company remains committed to its balanced capital-allocation approach. Consequently, it expects to continue buying back shares in 2018 while hoping to return more value to shareholders through its recently raised quarterly dividend.On Apr 16, Whirlpool declared a quarterly cash dividend of $1.15 per share, marking an increase of 5 cents from the previous rate of $1.10 per share. This dividend is payable on Jun 15, to shareholders with record as of May 18.GuidanceFollowing the not-so-impressive first quarter, Whirlpool slightly lowered its GAAP earnings per share forecast while retaining adjusted earnings view for 2018. It continues to envision adjusted earnings per share of $14.50-$15.50. On a GAAP basis, it now anticipates earnings in the range of $12.30-$13.30 per share compared with $12.45-$13.45 per share projected earlier.Further, the company revised its full-year tax-rate expectation to nearly 20%, which along with favorable product price/mix is likely to aid earnings. However, this will be partly offset by lower global-revenue growth and increased raw material inflation.The company reiterated its forecast of generating free cash flow of $1-$1.1 billion in 2018 while operating cash flows are projected to be $1.7-$1.8 billion. This guidance includes restructured cash outlays of approximately $300 million, pension contributions of $35 million and capital expenditures of $675 million related to free cash flows.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?It turns out, fresh estimates flatlined during the past month. There has been one revision higher for the current quarter compared to one lower.VGM ScoresAt this time, WHR has a poor Growth Score of F, however its Momentum is doing a lot better with an A. The stock was allocated a grade of B on the value side, putting it in the top 40% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of C. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.Our style scores indicate that the stock is more suitable for momentum investors than value investors.OutlookWHR has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.
