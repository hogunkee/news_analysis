3,NKTR,"Nektar Therapeutics (NKTR) popped Wednesday after Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) said it would pay $1.85 billion upfront to test their immuno-oncology drugs across nine tumor types.X On the stock market today, Nektar rocketed 11% to close at 84. Bristol climbed 2.3% to finish at 65.35. The broader biotech group traded up for the fourth straight day following a market correction last week.The deal creates a broad clinical development plan to combine Nektar's drug, NKTR-214, with Bristol's drug Opdivo and its Opdivo-Yervoy regimen in more than 20 potential treatments across nine tumor types.""Bristol got a very good deal structure on this immuno-oncology program,"" Evercore analyst Umer Raffat said in a note to clients. ""Bristol was able to get 35% economics and yet not bet $16 billion upfront (to buy Nektar).""Under the terms, Bristol will pay Nektar $1.85 billion upfront comprised of $1 billion in cash and the purchase of about 8.28 million shares of Nektar stock at $102.60 apiece. Nektar is also eligible to receive an additional $1.78 billion in milestones.Nektar will book worldwide sales of NKTR-214. Nektar and Bristol will split the profits at 65%-35%, respectively. Bristol will keep all the revenue from Opdivo and Yervoy.For joint trials using NKTR-214 and Opdivo, Bristol will pay 67.5% of the costs. In studies using all three immuno-oncology drugs, Bristol will pay 78% of the costs with Nektar taking up the balance.IBD'S TAKE: Bristol's Relative Strength Rating has risen into the 70s from 68 earlier in the month. As of Wednesday, it had an RS Rating of 75 out of a best-possible 99, but still remains short of a benchmark. Head to IBD Data Stories for more on how to pick top-rated stocks.Both agreed to not begin development, for an unspecified period of time, of meds that would overlap in mechanism or treatment uses with those being tested in the deal. They plan to begin trials under the deal within 14 months.Nektar and Bristol will jointly commercialize NKTR-214 globally. Bristol will lead global efforts for NKTR-214 regimens with its drugs. Nektar will co-commercialize those combos in the U.S., major Europe markets and Japan. Nektar will lead global efforts for NKTR-214 regimens using Nektar or third-party drugs.For Bristol, the transaction is expected to be dilutive to adjusted earnings in 2018-19 by 2 cents and 10 cents, respectively. The transaction is expected to be complete in the second quarter.Raffat noted the deal allows Bristol to ""remain the company with the most immuno-oncology-immuno-oncology combinations in Phase 3."" Opdivo plus Yervoy is approved in melanoma but is also being tested for other uses, including in lung cancer.NKTR-214 is designed to selectively expand cancer-fighting immune cells and natural killer cells inside the tumor. It is also meant to increase the amount of PD-1 protein on the immune cells. The PD-1 proteins on immune cells seek out PD-L1 proteins on tumor cells.Bristol was likely intrigued by early data in November from a combination of NKTR-214 and Opdivo under an earlier collaboration plan. In the study, patients with melanoma, kidney cancer or lung cancer responded to the regimen regardless how much PD-L1 protein their tumors had.RELATED:These Biotech Could Spring Back After Market Correction: AnalystWhy Payers Won't Balk At $292,000 Price Tag For Vertex's New DrugRegeneron Could Benefit From 'Lackluster' Data Presented By These Rivals

But that was after a 42% crash on Monday amid disappointment for a regimen from Nektar and Bristol.The duo tested Nektar's NKTR-214 and Bristol's Opdivo in late-stage melanoma, kidney cancer and bladder cancer. In part one of the study, 85% of melanoma patients responded to treatment. But in the second part of the test, that dropped to 50%.""NKTR-214 data lowers confidence in the program for our (key opinion leader),"" Leerink analysts wrote in a note to clients.

6,NKTR,"Dow Jones component Merck (MRK) jumped to a five-month high Monday on strong data for cancer drug Keytruda in melanoma as shares of Nektar Therapeutics (NKTR) went into free fall on its combination with Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY).On the stock market today, Merck popped 2.4% to close at 62.02, outperforming the broader Dow Jones industrial average, which was up 0.7%. Bristol fell 3.2% to finish at 51.45. Shares of pharmaceutical companies broadly lifted a fraction.Merck followed Keytruda-treated patients for several years in a pair of tests. Cancer didn't worsen or progress in 86% of melanoma patients who completed two years of treatment with the cancer drug. That metric was taken at a median 20.3-month follow-up.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseGeorgina Long, co-medical director of Melanoma Institute Australia, noted Keytruda has already shown itself against Bristol's Yervoy in advanced melanoma patients. The cancer drug also shows persistent anti-tumor abilities in follow-up tests, she said in a written statement.""We're now seeing ongoing (effectiveness) for patients who complete the protocol-specified two years of (Keytruda) treatment, as well as additional anti-tumor activity for the patients who progress after a first course of treatment and complete a second course of treatment,"" she said.In a study called Keynote-006, Merck looked at Keytruda and Bristol's Yervoy as melanoma drugs. At a median follow-up of 45.9 months, the overall survival rate was 41.7% in Keytruda-treated patients. That dropped to 34.1% in those who received Yervoy.Overall, 42% of Keytruda patients responded to treatment vs. 17% of Yervoy patients, Merck said in a news release.Among those who'd never before received treatment, four-year overall survival rates were 44.3% and 36.4% in those treated with Keytruda and Yervoy, respectively. Tumors shrunk in 47% of Keytruda-treated patients and in 17% of Yervoy-treated patients.Another test called Keynote-001 looked at melanoma patients after a median follow-up of 55 months, including some who continued to receive Keytruda. The overall response rate was 41% in all patients and 52% in those who'd never been treated.The estimated five-year overall survival rate was 34% in all patients and 41% in the never-before-treated group. In both melanoma studies, Keytruda proved safe.In another study, Merck tested Keytruda in patients with a previously treated form of lung cancer. The overall response rate was 18.7%. That improved to 35.7% in patients whose tumors had more of a protein called PD-L1.""These new data for Keytruda in small cell lung cancer underscore why Merck is pursuing a broad clinical development program across all types of lung cancer,"" Jonathan Cheng, vice president of oncology clinical research for Merck Research Laboratories, said in a statement.Responses also appeared durable. Nearly three-quarters of patients, or 73%, continued to respond for 12 months or longer, Merck said in a news release. At the median, cancer didn't worsen or progress for two months. At six and 12 months, cancer didn't worsen for 23.7% and 16.8% of patients, respectively.Nektar tanked when its cancer drug combined with another from Bristol showed a drop-off in effectiveness in a later part of the study. Bristol and Nektar combined their drugs NKTR-214 and Opdivo, respectively, in patients with stage-four melanoma.The regimen shrunk tumors in 85% of never-before-treated patients with stage-four melanoma. But that effectiveness dropped to 50% in the second part of the study.Drugs like Opdivo likely work better in patients who have more of a protein called PD-L1. In the study, 42% of patients without that protein still responded to the regimen. The response rate in patients with that protein was better at 62%.JMP analyst Konstantinos Aprilakis boosted his price target on Loxo Oncology (LOXO) to 221 from 182 after the firm presented data for its caner drug on Saturday that was ""far above expectations with respect to both (effectiveness) and safety for a Phase 1 study.""Although Loxo initially popped 11.8%, shares dipped 2%, near 182.90, in recent action.Loxo studied cancers involving mutations of the RET gene. Across what are known as RET fusion-positive cancers, Loxo's drug LOXO-292, had a 77% overall response rate. That improved on a 69% response rate unveiled in mid-May.""We view the (effectiveness) data presented for LOXO-292 as exceedingly impressive and well above our own expectations and those of the Street,"" Aprilakis said in a note.

8,NKTR,"Some top international stock funds seek out companies that fit a specific growth trajectory. Others among the best foreign funds for 2018 want to find industry leaders that allocate capital smartly to provide both sustainable growth in earnings and a hefty return to shareholders. And still others take a blanket approach toward a single country, such as Japan.The very best foreign funds recognized in the IBD Best Mutual Funds Awards drummed up unique strategies to stay atop the heap in 2017. They also pose this critical question to the individual investor:""What type of investing style suits me best when trying to build solid long-term gains?""Answering the question may help an investor sit tight when markets get volatile, especially ones overseas. While the names of the best foreign funds may change, the importance of patience and the ability to sell shares near market tops, not at market bottoms, does not change.The MSCI EAFE index rose 25% in 2017. Scores of country-specific or region-focused mutual funds in IBD's annual survey soundly beat this benchmark.But Oppenheimer Global Opportunities (OPGIX), Matthews Asia Dividend Investor (MAPIX), DFA Japanese Small Company (DFJSX) and Wasatch World Innovations Investor (WAGTX) receive a standing ovation for delivering outstanding long-term compounded returns.The MSCI EAFE's average annual return from Jan. 1, 2008, to Dec. 31, 2017, was understandably poor at 1.94%. The Wall Street subprime loan crisis and bankruptcy of Lehman Bros., real estate crashes in Ireland and Spain, the solvency scare of Greece, and three separate bear market declines in mainland China equities — repeat, three — all clawed at equity prices around the globe.Yet $8.4 billion Oppenheimer Global scored an 11.64% annualized gain over that 10-year period through Dec. 31. Matthews Asia achieved a 9.03% gain, DFA Japanese Small Company 8.56%, and Wasatch World Innovations 8.5%.Hennessy Japan Small Cap Investor (HJPSX) took the top rung with a 12.01% average annual return. (See Lawrence Carrell's story for more on the fund.) Morgan Stanley Institutional Global Franchise (MSFAX), Oppenheimer International Small-Mid Company (OSMAX) and Franklin International Small Cap Growth (FKSCX) also hit annualized gains of 8% or more.Oppenheimer Global Opportunities parked more than 40% of its money in U.S. companies, as of Jan. 31. But look at the next seven countries and that group, including the U.K., Germany, Japan, France, Denmark, Italy and Sweden, makes up a slightly greater share of the entire fund's assets at 42.3%.""I'm trying to buy companies that are young in their life cycle, not old value traps,"" portfolio manager Frank Jennings said in an Oppenheimer-produced video. ""Very often there're three or four people running this little business. Altogether they don't know what they're doing, there's certainly no sophisticated management systems. They succeed, it achieves some scale, but it still has that entrepreneurial juice, and that's the powerful phase I am trying to capture before it becomes a saturated bureaucracy.""The average market cap of the holdings stands just below $14 billion, or in midcap range based on IBD's perspective. (IBD Big Cap 20 requires a company's market value to top $15 billion.) The fund's median market cap is even less at $7.8 billion. Global Opportunities tends to own companies with price-to-earnings ratios that exceed the S&P 500.Oppenheimer takes big bets on individual companies. San Francisco-based Nektar Therapeutics (NKTR) is the biggest holding, at 11.7% of the entire fund. Even after breaking out of a seven-month base at 25.88 in big volume on Nov. 6 and quadrupling in price, the market value of the developer of treatments that are commercialized by its Big Pharma and biotech partners is $17 billion, a far cry from the megacaps such as Amgen (AMGN) ($136 billion market cap) or Gilead Sciences (GILD) ($106 billion).Other large holdings that perhaps carry this ""lean yet mean"" corporate flavor include industrial laser maker Coherent (COHR), social media giant Twitter (TWTR), household carbonated beverage systems pioneer SodaStream (SODA) and 3-D computer-aided design software firm PTC (PTC).Matthews Asia Dividend benefited from what it called a ""Goldilocks scenario"" in Asian equities thanks to improving inflationary conditions and ""moderate monetary policy from Asia's central banks,"" the fund's managers wrote in a semiannual commentary to shareholders. ""Concerns over potential systemic risks also subsided, most evident in the stabilizing Chinese economy.

12,NKTR,"Eli Lilly (LLY) is trying to ""leapfrog"" Dow Jones stock Merck (MRK) and Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) with its $1.6 billion acquisition of cancer immunotherapy biotech Armo Biosciences (ARMO), an industry observer said Thursday.Drugmaker Lilly is late to the game in cancer immunotherapy, Brad Loncar told Investor's Business Daily. Loncar runs several biotech stock indexes including the Cancer Immunotherapy Sector Index, which contains Armo. The Loncar Cancer Immunotherapy exchange-traded fund popped 3.6% Thursday.""The leaders are Merck and Bristol-Myers Squibb and Roche (RHHBY),"" he said. ""If you're a company that has completely missed the boat and you want to play in this area, you have to do something to try to leapfrog the competition.""Early Thursday, Lilly made its first big move in the cancer immunotherapy space — an area of medicine in which drugs teach the immune system to fight cancer. Lilly said it would pay $50 per share of Armo in an all-cash deal.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseArmo shares rocketed 67% to close at 49.80, as Lilly stock rose 2% to 80.86. Fellow drug stocks, like Merck and Bristol, both rose less than 1%. Roche, which had a failure early in the day in colon cancer, dipped 1.6% to 27.63.Lilly expects the deal to close by the end of the second quarter. Armo, a late-stage biotech, went public at 17 in January and quickly popped. It was a ""hot"" initial public offering, Loncar said, noting that its price early Thursday indicates investors may expect another bid on it.Leerink analyst Jonathan Chang noted that the acquisition price is a 68% premium over Armo's closing price Wednesday. He initiated coverage of the stock with an outperform rating and 50 price target earlier in the year. On Thursday, he downgraded Armo to market perform.""The deal confirms our investment thesis on Armo and, in our view, could read positively to other emerging immuno-oncology stocks,"" he said. ""It is unclear if other bidders will emerge, given (the) short closing date.""The acquisition makes sense as pharmaceutical stock Lilly tries to assert itself in the cancer immunotherapy space, Loncar said. Armo's lead drug, called pegilodecakin, is known as a cytokine. It boosts the strength of drugs known as PD-1 inhibitors, like Merck's Keytruda and Bristol's Opdivo.Earlier this year, Bristol validated another cytokine drug called NKTR-214 by paying $1.85 billion upfront to partner with Nektar Therapeutics (NKTR) on it. The deal hit a record for an upfront payment in biotech, Loncar said. Now, it's of little surprise that Armo is to be taken out.Loncar has consistently predicted that 2018 would be a big year for biotech deals, mergers and takeouts. The year kicked off with news of Celgene's (CELG) plan to buy Juno Therapeutics and Sanofi's (SNY) bids on Bioverativ (BIVV) and Ablynx (ABLX).But this deal for Armo is a little different, he said.""I think this one would have happened if we were in the middle of a terrible, bear market,"" he said. On the other hand, ""this is also a good example of large companies like Eli Lilly, many of them have not been at the forefront of innovation and they're having to buy into that.""Still, Lilly isn't alone in its trailing position in cancer immunotherapy. Roche, AstraZeneca (AZN) and Pfizer (PFE) all have immuno-oncology drugs, but remain behind Merck and Bristol which are ""on a level of their own,"" he said.The cancer immunotherapy space desperately needed some good news, he said. Earlier this year, Incyte's (INCY) drug, known as an IDO inhibitor, failed in a late-stage combination with Merck's Keytruda in melanoma. Incyte's pain extended to other cancer immunotherapy stocks.Background volatility remains in the cancer immunotherapy space, Loncar said. The key, he said, is that these are all different pieces of technology. The Armo drug is different from the Incyte drug known as epacadostat.""Every news item sets people's moods,"" he said. ""Everybody is down on immunotherapy and thinks it's overrated. Then a deal like this happens and it causes the opposite reaction. Whenever you have an emerging technology like this it's going to be a roller coaster.""RELATED:Chart-Reading Basics: How A Buy Point Marks A Time Of Real OpportunityHow To Tame A Volatile Swing Trade With A Half PositionLooking For The Next Nvidia?

13,NKTR,"This year's top-performing U.S. diversified stock funds have regained or are very close to retaking their 50-day moving averages, thanks to Friday's market rebound.Though four small-cap exchange traded funds made the list of biggest year-to-date gainers through May 2, large caps still dominated. With the exception of one midcap ETF, First Trust Dorsey Wright Dynamic Focus 5 (FVC), the rest were big-cap names.PowerShares S&P 500 Pure Growth (RPG) topped the list with a 4.5% return, according to Morningstar Direct. The ETF tried to recaptured its 50-day line Friday as it works on a base with a potential 117.44 buy point. The $2.4 billion fund, which tracks the S&P 500 Pure Growth Index Total Return, provides access to S&P 500 stocks exhibiting strong growth traits. Growth is measured based on sales growth, earnings change to price and momentum.Information technology accounted for the biggest sector weighting at nearly 40% of assets, health care 21%, consumer discretionary 15%, and financials 9%. Top holdings as of May 3 included Netflix (NFLX), Adobe Systems (ADBE), Red Hat (RHT), Amazon.com (AMZN) and Nvidia (NVDA). Apple (AAPL) is also in its portfolio.PowerShares QQQ Trust (QQQ), which tracks the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 Index, came in second with a 4.1% year to date gain. The $59.8 billion fund reclaimed its 50-day line Friday, powered in part by a 4% jump by Apple, its biggest component. Apple, now on IBD's Leaderboard, soared twice during the week: Friday after billionaire investor Warren Buffett said he added to his Apple stake in Q1, and 4% Wednesday after an earnings and sales beat.

14,NKTR,"Biotech stocks rallied Friday after Nektar Therapeutics (NKTR), Sarepta Therapeutics (SRPT) and Puma Biotechnology (PBYI) reported strong fourth-quarter metrics and announced updates that could stoke shares in 2018.X On the stock market today, biotechs collectively jumped 3%, led by Nektar, which rocketed 21.7% to close at 102.87, a record high.Puma soared 15.1% to 71.05, as Sarepta flew 9.4% to 67.96. Loxo Oncology (LOXO) also advanced on its fourth-quarter report, rising 4.3% to 120.Fellow biotech Ligand Pharmaceuticals (LGND) grabbed some of the sector's luck and rose 2.9% to 159.01.And in an adjacent market, Veeva Systems (VEEV) — which makes software used by biotechs and drugmakers — enjoyed a 5.5% surge to 73.77, breaking out of a long consolidation.Nektar's stock pop followed its crushing fourth-quarter sales beat. Even without $60 million related to a nonrecurring sublicense agreement, Nektar's $95.5 million in sales still would have beat the Street's forecast for $31 million. Losses of 21 cents per share narrowed year over year and beat views for a 38-cent loss.Analysts are also bullish on Nektar's immuno-oncology drug, NKTR-214. The drug is designed to grow cancer-killing immune cells and natural killer cells in the body to fight cancer. Last month, Nektar said it would team up with Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) to test NKTR-214 in regimens using Bristol's drugs.Bristol's drugs, Opdivo and Yervoy, are also immuno-oncology compounds. Opdivo works by targeting interactions in the immune system involving the PD-1 and PD-L1 proteins. Yervoy is known as a CTLA-4 inhibitor. Combining immuno-oncology drugs is expected to offer a more potent response.Within 14 months, Nektar and Bristol have 20 registrational studies with 15,000 patients in nine tumor types slated to begin. The first studies will be in melanoma and kidney cancer. Importantly, the deal allows Nektar to continue combinations with drugs from Dow components Merck (MRK) and Roche (RHHBY).Canaccord analyst Arlinda Lee upped her price target on Nektar to 94 from 80 and kept her buy rating.Sales of Sarepta's Exondys 51, a drug to treat Duchenne muscular dystrophy, came in at $57.3 million, in line with the company's pre-announcement in January, RBC analyst Brian Abrahams said in a note to clients. Research and development expenses of $44.4 million were also in line, he said.""The company ended the quarter with $1.1 billion cash/equivalents, which we estimate will be sufficient to sustain operations along with revenues for the foreseeable future,"" he said.Sarepta also reiterated its 2018 guidance for $295 million to $305 million in Exondys 51 sales, which would represent about 100% year-over-year growth. Abrahams notes this supports a launch trajectory capable of reaching $1.2 billion in peak sales.Sarepta also seeks to have Exondys 51 approved in Europe, though analysts were split on whether officials would approve the drug. Sarepta is slated to present its argument in late April, Piper Jaffray analyst Edward Tenthoff said in a note. A positive opinion would offer upside, he said.But it wasn't Exondys 51 that had Sarepta stock popping Friday. Analysts are particularly excited about the potential for golodirsen, a drug being developed to treat about 8% of Duchenne muscular dystrophy patients. Sarepta recently met with the U.S.  Food and Drug Administration to discuss golodirsen.Golodirsen is being tested in a pivotal trial dubbed Essence. That trial should finish enrolling in April and have data in about two years, Needham analyst Chad Messer said in a note. The trial could possibly serve as a conformational study for golodirsen.Sarepta is also working on three investigational drugs including two gene therapies. By midyear, the firm plans to report preliminary data from both gene therapy studies, Leerink analyst Michael Schmidt said in his note to clients. These ""may provide a glimpse into Sarepta's future.""For the fourth quarter, sales of Puma's breast cancer drug Nerlynx were $20.1 million in the U.S., just short of the consensus for $20.8 million, Leerink's Schmidt said. But Puma pre-announced $11.6 million in January net sales, indicating the consensus view for $31.7 million in the first quarter could be too low.""We expect this to be a clearing event similar to the recent Clovis Oncology (CLVS) fourth-quarter earnings report,"" he said in a note. ""Fundamentally, Nerlynx U.S. launch metrics look solid.""On the call, Puma guided to 2018 sales of $175 million to $200 million in the U.S. Consensus figures are between $184 million and $204 million, RBC analyst Kennen MacKay said in a report. Leerink's Schmidt sees the outlook as conservative.Puma could also have some good news around midyear. The firm is expected to have data from a Phase 3 study of Nerlynx in an advanced form of breast cancer. Further, European officials are reconsidering Nerlynx in another form of breast cancer.RELATED:Chart-Reading Basics: How A Buy Point Marks A Time Of Real OpportunityHow To Build Long-Term Profits In Stocks?

16,NKTR,"Clovis Oncology (CLVS) popped midday Friday after the Food and Drug Administration approved another use for its ovarian cancer drug Rubraca — prodding shares of rival Tesaro (TSRO) to topple and other smaller players to crash.On the stock market today, Clovis jetted up 5.9% to close at 55.52. Tesaro, on the other hand, slid 3.1% to 54.70. AstraZeneca (AZN), which also makes a rival drug, rose a fractionto 35.42.All three make drugs known as PARP inhibitors, approved to treat ovarian cancer. U.S. regulators approved Clovis' drug Rubraca — which it makes under a partnership with Merck (MRK) — on Friday as a maintenance treatment for patients who either partially or fully responded to treatment with chemotherapy.""We are grateful that the FDA expedited review of this maintenance treatment indication, so that physicians can begin offering it to appropriate patients beginning today,"" Clovis Chief Executive Patrick Mahaffy said in a prepared statement.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe news reverberated through immuno-oncology stocks. NewLink Genetics (NLNK), which makes a drug similar to epacadostat, collapsed 42.6% to 4.20. Nektar Therapeutics (NKTR) and Armo Biosciences (ARMO), both of which make immuno-oncology drugs, crashed 7.5% to 93.87, and 10.1% to 35.89, respectively.Armo makes a drug known as AM0010. In the wake of epacadostat and Keytruda's failure in melanoma, Armo management argued AM0010 has shown promise as a monotherapy in several tumor types, whereas epacadostat didn't, Leerink analyst Jonathan Chang said in a note. Further, AM0010 has a different mechanism and approach from epacadostat, he said.""Although competition in the emerging immuno-oncology space is fierce and Armo's target markets, especially in the (advanced lung cancer) and (kidney cancer) are highly competitive and dynamic, we believe AM0010 has the potential to address a large commercial opportunity,"" he said.Clovis is third behind AstraZeneca and Tesaro to grab approval to treat the broader group of patients. But the label for Rubraca doesn't include warnings of liver enzyme elevations, which had previously been a concern.The label for AstraZeneca's Lynparza warns against pneumonitis, or inflammation of the lungs that occurs without an infection. Patients treated with Tesaro's Zejula are cautioned about blood toxicity and cardiovascular effects, he said.Rubraca is the cleanest and safest drug in its class, RBC analyst Kennen MacKay said in a note to clients.""We see these dynamics driving Rubraca's competitive positioning in the recurrent maintenance market despite being third to market behind AstraZeneca and Tesaro,"" he said.Piper Jaffray analyst Christopher Raymond kept his neutral rating on Tesaro stock in his report to clients.""Competition and lack of differentiation in the PARP inhibitor space has long been one of our primary concerns for Tesaro's Zejula,"" he said.

17,NKTR,"The best growth stock mutual funds rewarded investors with returns between 26% and 46% in 2017, handsomely beating the S&P 500's advance of 21.83%. This strong performance partly explains why 113 funds landed an IBD Best Mutual Funds 2018 Award in the growth category vs. just nine the prior year.By comparison, no value stock funds made the winners' list this year, and the number of award-winning blend funds that have both growth and value components got cut in half to just 11.One year's outperformance is not all that's needed to win a Best Mutual Funds Award. Mutual funds need at least $100 million in assets and must beat their benchmark for the past one, three, five and 10 years ended December 2017, showing they can do well as stock market trends and conditions evolve over the long haul.So, what exactly contributed to these results and what's in store for the rest of 2018?Among the top five award winning growth funds, Primecap Odyssey Aggressive Growth (POAGX) tops the list with one- and 10-year average returns of 33.59% and 15.06%, respectively. The S&P 500 returned an average annual 8.5% in the past 10 years. The $11 billion fund invests in stocks across all sectors and market caps, targeting companies with prospects of rapid earnings growth that may not be reflected in their stock prices.At the end of 2017, the fund held 22% in small and micro caps — a significant overweight vs. the index's 1%. It also had major overweights in health care and technology — both sectors that were strong performers. Managers are not afraid to make strong sector or stock bets if they see solid long-term potential.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseTop 10 holdings represent 33% of assets and include Nektar Therapeutics (NKTR), Sony (SNE), Abiomed (ABMD), BlackBerry (BB) and Micron Technology (MU), which rallied between 52% and 386% last year.T. Rowe Price New Horizons (PRNHX) came in second, with returns of 31.49% for one year and an average annual 13.16% for 10 years. Midcaps and small caps comprise 69% and 25% of the $23 billion fund. Manager Henry Ellenbogen seeks out small companies that can become much larger. This usually includes disrupters and companies that promise durable growth.""Market leadership is likely to narrow as the bull market ages. As always, unforeseen risks, such as geopolitical turmoil, also pose challenges,"" Ellenbogen said in an email. ""Global macroeconomic events, including commodity price volatility, could affect performance."" He also pointed out that a regulatory attack on leading technology and internet companies is possible, which could have unintended consequences and heighten inflationary concerns.""As such, we will closely monitor global economic and political conditions and be cautious around new bouts of risk taking,"" Ellenbogen added. ""Nevertheless, we remain confident in our ability to find and hold smaller companies that can compound wealth by becoming durable and sustainable businesses, even through the downturns and valuation adjustments that are part of every market cycle.""American Century Select (TWCIX) surged 28.93% last year and an average annual 8.62% for the past 10 years. Veteran manager Keith Lee and his team run the $3 billion large-cap growth fund by selecting high-quality companies with strong growth prospects, while also limiting risk. As a result, the fund sports a turnover of just 19%.""We're looking for very long-term, durable franchises that have sustainable growth over long periods of time, and that allows us to really limit the amount of turnover we have,"" said co-portfolio manager Chris Krantz. Traits of such companies include strong management teams, strong competitive positions, good returns on capital and the ability to achieve a higher return on capital over time, he added.In addition, the fund is valuation-sensitive, so it looks to buy stocks that are reasonably priced. Top 10 holdings represent 43% of the fund and comprise leading stocks such as Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL), Mastercard (MA), Facebook (FB) and Amazon (AMZN).Last year, the fund benefited from consumer staples companies that have ""stronger-growing franchises that weren't as impacted by consumer preferences,"" said Krantz.Beauty product maker Estee Lauder (EL) was a strong contributor with a 68% jump in share price. ""They have wonderful brands, a great management team and the ability to continue to grow. A lot of consumer staples companies are struggling to sustainably grow,"" Krantz said.Costco (COST), which rose 22% in 2017, ""is another company that while there are some concerns out there about online competition to Costco, Costco is a value proposition to the consumer, because the prices they offer is a competitive advantage that we think will be enduring. They provide value to the consumer that you just can't find anywhere else,"" explained Krantz.With consumers spending more money online, global electronic payment firms such as Mastercard and PayPal (PYPL) have a ""great business model that has high margins, high returns on capital and as consumers change their shopping preferences, whether by channel or by category, they're still spending with the same means. That's a secular growth area,"" he said.Blend funds are part of the mutual fund style box and combine growth and value investing. This year's cream-of-the-crop blend funds include Carillon Scout Mid Cap I (UMBMX), sporting a one-year return of 24.02% and a 10-year average annual return of 11.13%, and Primecap Odyssey Stock (POSKX) with 25.96% and 10.3%, respectively.T. Rowe Price's Institutional U.S. Structured Research (TRISX) and Capital Opportunity (PRCOX) rose 24% last year and an average annual 9% the past 10 years.Manager Ann Holcomb says that both funds follow the exact same strategy through a team-managed style where each research analyst is responsible for making the buy and sell decision within their own area of expertise. About 30 analysts are responsible for their own slice of the portfolio, overseen by three managers who oversee the big picture and make sure the portfolio is constrained in terms of the level of active risk.Top holdings include Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Facebook and JPMorgan Chase (JPM). Last year, about two-thirds of the fund's outperformance came from stock selection, plus one-third from being underweight energy and telecom and overweight information technology.For 2018, Holcomb has ""cautious optimism for the rest of the year. Valuations are still pretty full, but fundamental underpinnings for earnings growth are still there. We have tax reform — it hasn't really made its way into earnings yet. We should still be the beneficiaries of further regulatory relief. Rates are still low, though rising. The consumer is healthy.

18,NKTR,"This year is shaping up to be boisterous for biotech acquisitions after Celgene (CELG) and Sanofi (SNY), in a matter of days, announced plans to spend north of $25 billion to take over three companies, analysts say.X Celgene and Sanofi, in particular, are facing challenges in areas where insurance companies are pushing back on payments in rheumatology and diabetes. That also leaves the likes of Novo Novartis (NVO) and Eli Lilly (LLY) in trouble, said Brad Loncar, who manages an immunotherapy-based fund.""These companies have to buy growth,"" Loncar told Investor's Business Daily. ""They've been growing their revenue doing artificial things whether that's drug price increases, tax inversions or some kind of other type of financial engineering. Those things are going away.""In all of 2017, there was $50 billion spent in biotech deals, Mizuho analyst Salim Syed told IBD. This year, so far Celgene has said it would spend $9 billion to buy the remainder of Juno Therapeutics (JUNO) it doesn't already own. Sanofi is spending $11.6 billion and $4.8 billion to acquire Bioverativ (BIVV) and Ablynx (ABLX).""For companies who haven't bought anything, it's just a matter of opportunity,"" Syed said.The buying spree kicked off in August when Gilead Sciences (GILD) announced its plan to acquire cancer play Kite Pharma for $11.9 billion. Gilead has been suffering from a major slowdown in hepatitis C drug sales amid high cure rates and saturation in the U.S. and Europe.Celgene and Sanofi announced their plans to acquire Juno and Bioverativ on the same day in January. Days later, Sanofi said it would buy rare disease drugmaker Ablynx.For Celgene, the acquisition followed a disappointing third quarter in which sales of psoriatic arthritis and plaque psoriasis drug Otezla widely missed expectations. The biotech also cut its 2020 guidance on Otezla's shortfall and after terminating several trials in Crohn's disease.Loncar described Celgene's long-term growth prospects at the time as a ""bleak picture."" It's also facing a patent cliff in the mid-2020s for its cancer drug Revlimid.IBD'S TAKE: It's challenging holding on to a stock amid a market correction as it declines. But that could help shares form a new potential base. Is it still possible to capture a big gain? Head to the Investor's Corner for four tips on how to make gains during a correction.""So they really couldn't afford to wait,"" he said.Sanofi, on the other hand, was skunked twice in 2016 and 2017 as it tried to acquire Medivation and Actelion Pharma. Dow component Pfizer (PFE) beat out Sanofi for Medivation and Dow's Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) was able to acquire Actelion out from under Sanofi.Roy Behren, a fund manager for Westchester Capital Management, says Sanofi committed a faux pas in both acquisitions — it made a hostile bid for Medivation and went back on an initially higher bid for Actelion, filings show.""Hostile approaches are generally unsuccessful in this space because of the fact the scientists are such an important part of the value equation,"" he told IBD. ""In the case of Sanofi and Medivation, they couldn't arrive at a price unless it was friendly. It was very difficult to complete the acquisition.""Among the high profile acquisitions in late 2017 and early 2018, the acquirers have suffered from pressure on sales of key moneymakers. That, along with tax reform allowing companies to pay less in corporate taxes and repatriate cash at a lower rate, could prime the pump for acquisitions.""I'm a strong believer this is going to be a huge year for acquisitions,"" Loncar said. ""No. 1, for larger companies, their growth is slowing, and No. 2, this tax reform deal adds fuel to that fire. It makes it easier for them to do these deals.""Novo Nordisk lost out on Ablynx to Sanofi. Now, Loncar expects Novo Nordisk to go after other assets to contend with its deep exposure to the diabetes market. Lilly, too, is seeing challenges in diabetes. Meanwhile, Amgen's (AMGN) older drugs are facing new competition.""All big companies really need to do this,"" he said.But there are outliers, Mizuho analyst Syed said. Biogen (BIIB), for instance, guided to flat 2018 sales for its multiple sclerosis unit, including the impact of a royalty it will get on revenue from Roche's (RHHBY) new drug Ocrevus.""There's this perception that the franchises are dwindling,"" he said. ""That's the argument that investors make for a lot of these guys like Biogen, like Amgen — that their base business is going away. That's not necessarily the case. Biogen is stable for 2018.""Still, flat sales won't be enough to pique investor interest. Biogen's aducanumab, a potential treatment for Alzheimer's disease, is a ""carrot"" for investors until clinical trial data is available toward the end of 2019 or early 2020.""But as long as that carrot is out there, it becomes really difficult for the hedge fund community to short the stock,"" he said. ""Aducanumab can produce returns — if it works — that large-cap biotechs typically don't see.""Westchester's Behren notes biotechs seem to be fairly interested in immunotherapies and oncology. That includes Gilead's acquisition of Kite and Celgene's plan to acquire Juno. Both are working on drugs known as CAR-T therapies, which teach the immune system to identify and fight cancer.""There has been a lot of activity in the oncology space in terms of immunotherapies,"" he said. ""The larger companies are trying to gobble up any promising technology they can while it's still affordable. We are also seeing quite a few testing companies being acquired.""Celgene's acquisition of Juno followed a common storyline, Behren said. Celgene invested in Juno in 2015 to create immunotherapies in cancer and autoimmune diseases. The duo is furthest along with JCAR017, a potential treatment for non-Hodgkin lymphoma.When Celgene pulled the trigger on Juno on Jan. 22, it made sense that it was at a 28% premium to Juno's closing price on the prior trading day.""Biotechs — even more than high tech — tend to come at significant premiums to trading prices,"" he said. ""That's because they're somewhat risky, but could be a huge payoff in the event they're successful.""Nektar Therapeutics (NKTR) and Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) could be amid a similar plot. In September 2016, the duo paired up to test Nektar's drug called NKTR-214 with Bristol's Opdivo in patients with melanoma, kidney cancer and lung cancer. In November, Nektar presented strong early data from the combos.Loncar pegged Nektar as a potential takeover target in 2018, calling NKTR-214 ""revolutionary."" Days later, Bristol announced it would pay Nektar $1.85 billion upfront — comprised of $1 billion in cash and the purchase of 2.28 million shares — to test NKTR-214 with Opdivo and Opdivo plus Yervoy.The deal allows Bristol to remain the leader in immuno-oncology/immuno-oncology combinations without risking a $16 billion bid on Nektar, Evercore analyst Umer Raffat said in a Feb. 14 note to clients.""I have no doubt (Nektar's) phone has been ringing off the hook since (November) because their data was so interesting,"" Loncar said. ""If someone is bold enough to buy them, it could put the acquirer into a class of their own in immuno-oncology.""Drugs called PARP inhibitors also look interesting, Loncar said. Clovis Oncology (CLVS) and Tesaro (TSRO) both have drugs approved in this class and are small enough to acquire. AstraZeneca (AZN) also works in that space.Sarepta Therapeutics (SRPT), Neurocrine Biosciences (NBIX) and BioMarin Pharmaceutical (BMRN) have also had successful launches recently.""If a company wants revenue growth, buy a rare-disease drug,"" he said. ""They have the best sales ramps. I think those types of companies are really interesting right now. I wouldn't be surprised if some of them get bought out.""RELATED:Biotech Investors Flee In Droves As Market Correction Rocks The GroupThese Biotechs Could Spring Back After Market Correction: AnalystWhy These 3 Biotech Stocks Could Outperform Their Peers In 2018

22,NKTR,"Nektar Therapeutics (NKTR) launched to a nearly 17-year high Monday on strong combination data for its immuno-oncology drug combined with Bristol-Myers Squibb's (BMY) Opdivo in skin, kidney and lung cancers.XBy the closing bell on the stock market today, Nektar soared by more than 14% to close at 37.10, after earlier rising as much as 27.2% to touch a high last seen in January 2001. Meanwhile, Bristol ticked up 0.2% to close at 60.99.The data were presented at the 2017 Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer annual meeting. Nektar's drug, NKTR-214, is designed to grow specific cancer-killing immune system cells and natural killer cell populations in the body to fight cancer.Opdivo is what's known as a PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor, which works to block specific interactions in the immune system that would prevent an immune response. It competes closely against Dow's Merck (MRK), which makes a rival drug called Keytruda.A total of 38 patients were enrolled in the dose-escalation phase of the trial, dubbed Pivot.IBD'S TAKE: Keep tabs on the earnings season by bookmarking IBD's Investing Action Plan.As of Nov. 2, 63% of never-before-treated patients with advanced melanoma responded to the treatment. Of those, all signs of cancer disappeared in two patients and five had partial responses to the treatment.In never-before-treated kidney cancer patients with at least one baseline scan, responses were seen in 46%, including one complete response and five partial responses. For patients with two or more prior scans, 60% responded to the combination.Among advanced kidney cancer patients who'd already received at least two rounds of prior therapy, a partial response was observed in one of seven.Three of four advanced lung cancer patients responded to the regimen. All signs of cancer disappeared in one patient. The other two patients had partial responses.The most common side effects were low grade — including fatigue, flulike symptoms, rash and itching. There were no grade three or worse side effects at the dose recommended for testing in the continuing Phase 2 trial, Nektar said in a news release.""In the dose-escalation stage of the Pivot trial, we've observed important response rates across all three tumor types,"" said Mary Tagliaferri, senior vice president of clinical development at Nektar. ""All patients with responses in the trial continue on treatment.""Canaccord analyst Arlinda Lee boosted her price target on Nektar to 50 from 35 and kept her buy rating. She expects Nektar to target additional types of cancer using NKTR-214.""In 2018, we expect clinical data for NKTR-214 plus Opdivo in renal cell carcinoma and sarcoma and other solid tumors, as well as potentially NKTR-214 in combination with (Roche's (RHHBY)) Tecentriq and/or Keytruda,"" she said in a note to clients.RELATED:Nektar, Acadia Pop On Street-Crushing Quarters, But Tesaro DipsNektar Rockets To 16-Year High As Analyst Pegs It For SuccessNektar Therapeutics Earns Relative Strength Rating Update; Hits Key Benchmark

23,NKTR,"Nektar Therapeutics (NKTR) rocketed to a 16-year high Tuesday after an analyst initiated coverage of the biotech firm with an outperform rating ahead of its third-quarter earnings and a key presentation for its immuno-oncology drug.XAt the closing bell on the stock market today, Nektar popped 10.5% to finish at 26.84, hitting a high it last saw in June 2001. After hours, shares jumped nearly 8% more, approaching the 29 level.Nektar uses a technology called pegylation to create its drugs. Pegylation improves a drug's solubility and decreases its ability to provoke an immune response in the body. Nektar has partnered with other firms on a number of drugs using pegylation.Cowen analyst Chris Shibutani sees Nektar as uniquely positioned to ""capitalize on high value opportunities in immuno-oncology and pain"" using its pegylation technology. He sees the cancer drug known as NKTR-214 as possibly being transforming.NKTR-214 is being tested with Bristol-Myers Squibb's (BMY) Opdivo as a treatment in five tumor types and eight potential diseases. Data from combination trials in melanoma and kidney cancer will be presented at the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer meeting this week.""In the immuno-oncology refractory setting, our optimism regarding both melanoma and (kidney cancer) derives from proprietary expert survey work and consultant views,"" Shibutani said in a note to clients.Shibutani sees NKTR-214 pulling in risk-adjusted revenue of more than $950 million by 2023, above the upper end of consensus expectations. He also expects sentiment to improve on a drug known as NKTR-181, a potential treatment for lower back pain.NKTR-181 met its first and second goals in a Phase 3 trial presented in May. The drug is designed to provide pain relief without the high levels of euphoria associated with abuse and addiction of standard opioids.""We see potential for sentiment to improve on NKTR-181,"" Shibutani said. ""The debate on novel chronic pain drug NKTR-181 centers on regulatory timelines and (Drug Enforcement Agency) scheduling.""IBD'S TAKE: Nektar has an IBD Composite Rating of 56 out of a best-possible 99, meaning it outperforms just over half of all stocks in terms of key growth metrics. But it's still poorly ranked as a biotech. Head to IBD Stock Checkup for a look at better-rated biotech stocks.An update ahead of filing with the Food and Drug Administration as well as a potential partnership announcement should help reduce uncertainty on NKTR-181, Shibutani said.Also Tuesday, Nektar presented data for its drug dubbed NKTR-358, a potential treatment that could address underlying immune system imbalances in patients with a number of immune conditions.NKTR-358 is designed to target a specific set of receptors in the body to stimulate the proliferation of immune system cells, known as regulatory T cells, to help bring the immune system back into balance. The drug could be used to treat autoimmune conditions.In nonhuman primates, a single dose of NKTR-358 led to increases in regulatory T cells for over 14 days, according to the data Nektar released Tuesday. In mice, NKTR-358 proved efficient in treating the most common form of lupus.Nektar partnered with Eli Lilly (LLY) on NKTR-358 in July.Late Tuesday, Nektar is expected to release its third-quarter earnings. Analysts called for Nektar to report adjusted income of 21 cents per share on $125 million in sales. Earnings could grow from a 32-cent loss in the year-earlier period, and sales would be up 244%.RELATED:Mallinckrodt Dives After Sales Lag, Though Earnings Top ViewsTeva Survives Price Cut As Billionaire Reportedly Mulls StakeIs Big Pharma Addicted To Opioid Painkillers?

Nektar rocketed 8.1%, tacking on to a 10.5% rise to 26.84 during the regular session. Tesaro dipped 2.7% in late trading after closing down 0.4%, at 112.08.For its third quarter, Acadia reported losses of 53 cents per share, narrowing from a 61-cent loss in the year-ago period, and beating the consensus view for a 63-cent loss. Sales of $35.58 million grew from $5.27 million in the year-ago period and topped analysts' model for $32 million.Chief Executive Steve Davis credited Nuplazid for Acadia's growth in the quarter. Nuplazid is used to treat hallucinations and delusions associated with Parkinson's disease psychosis.IBD'S TAKE: Large-cap biotechs have offered largely mixed earnings results with one issuing third-quarter metrics that have been deemed ""alarming."" Head to IBD Industry Themes for more on this firm and its rivals.""Our results this quarter reflect strong growth for Nuplazid for Parkinson's disease psychosis,"" Davis said in a statement. ""We also recently advanced our clinical portfolio for the initiation of our Phase 3 study of pimavanserin (Nuplazid) for dementia-related psychosis.""Acadia also boosted its 2017 sales guidance to between $124 million and $127 million, crushing views for $112 million.Nektar wrapped its third quarter with profit of 39 cents a share on revenue of $152.93 million. Profit broke a streak of quarterly losses, turning around from a year-ago loss of 32 cents and beating forecasts for a 21-cent gain. Sales grew more than fourfold and topped the consensus for $125 million.Product sales totaled $4.45 million with royalty revenue coming in at $9.3 million. Nektar brought in $131.1 million in license, collaboration and other revenue. The balance of its quarterly sales stemmed from noncash royalty revenue related to the sale of future royalties.The firm also announced its plan to submit an application to the Food and Drug Administration by April 2018 for its painkiller known as NKTR-181. The drug is designed to provide pain relief without the euphoric and addictive side effects of opioids.Tesaro ended with losses of 47 cents a share and sales of $142.8 million. Losses were less severe than expectations for a $1.04 per-share deficit, and narrowed from the year-earlier when it posted a $1.72 per-share loss. Sales grew from $17 million in the year-ago period and topped views for $121 million.During the quarter, Zejula brought in $39.4 million in sales and Varubi/Varuby generated $2.4 million. Zejula belongs to a class of drugs called PARP inhibitors and is approved to treat some patients with ovarian cancer. Varubi/Varuby is used to treat nausea and vomiting associated with chemotherapy.AstraZeneca (AZN) and Clovis Oncology (CLVS) also have PARP inhibitors approved to treat ovarian cancer. But Zejula was the most prescribed PARP inhibitor in the U.S. in the quarter, Tesaro said in a news release. Tesaro is also looking to expand Zejula to other tumor types.RELATED:Nektar Rockets To 16-Year High As Analyst Pegs It For SuccessTeva Survives Price Cut As Billionaire Reportedly Mulls StakeMallinckrodt Dives After Sales Lag, Though Earnings Top Views

Core consumer prices, excluding food and energy, rose 1.8% from a year ago, with an annualized 2.4% gain over the past three months.

31,NKTR,"Imagine choosing to remain addicted to painkilling opioids like OxyContin, believing detox could kill you.""The fear for any opioid addict to come off of opioids is unimaginable,"" said Dr. Indra Cidambi, who runs a detox center in New Jersey. ""They think they are going to die. It's very uncomfortable.""XBut the opioid addict's struggle is not unlike the financial dependence Big Pharma has developed on the troublesome medications. Uncomfortably aware of the struggle patients face, the pharmaceutical industry is at a crossroads while political and regulatory pressures mount on how — and whether — to limit the addictive traits of the painkillers they market or curb sales.Sales of the drugs have quadrupled since 1999, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In the U.S., GBI Research expects opioid sales to hit $17.7 billion by 2021, up from $11 billion in 2014.Worldwide, painkillers overall were the second-largest therapeutic category in 2013, generating $57 billion in sales.According to the American Society of Addiction Medicine, roughly 2 million Americans were addicted to prescription painkillers in 2016. Whether opioids or other painkillers, the drugs eventually force the brain to stop producing its own dopamine and rely on outside sources for that ""reward,"" Cidambi told Investor's Business Daily.As a result, addicts often stay on a drug for years before seeking help — if they get help at all. The option of getting clean isn't inviting.""They're sweating, they have hot flashes, they're hot and cold,"" Cidambi said. ""They have a runny nose, muscle aches, diarrhea. They are totally sick.""President Trump has deemed the opioid crisis a national emergency. And the National Institute on Drug Abuse estimates 90 Americans die every day from opioid overdoses. Addiction to opioids like oxycodone — the generic version of OxyContin — as well as hydrocodone, fentanyl and morphine costs the U.S. $78.5 billion per year, the institute says.It's also a big business that serves a legitimate need for patients with cancer, surgical wounds, back injuries and other conditions. Among the companies thriving on sales are big opioid makers like Endo (ENDP), Mallinckrodt (MNK) and OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma, which is privately held.IBD'S TAKE: Biotechs that specialize in painkillers don't rank very high, with IBD Composite Ratings for Cara and Nektar shares at 50 and 56, respectively. But they are part of IBD's Biotech industry group, which recently ranked eighth out of 197 groups tracked by IBD. For a closer look at industry leaders, head to IBD Stock Checkup.A movement exists both within and outside the industry to make the painkillers less addictive. At least 17 states are working to limit the number of painkillers doctors can prescribe, according to the Washington Post. Six have passed laws limiting the initial prescription to five or seven days while others are passing dosage limits.The Food and Drug Administration says it is angling to undercut the problem by approving abuse-deterrent opioids and alternatives to opioid therapy.Small biotechs like Cara Therapeutics (CARA), Recro Pharma (REPH) and Nektar Therapeutics (NKTR) are among the pharmaceutical companies working on less addictive opioids and alternatives, analysts say.The incentives can be underwhelming or conflict with other initiatives like reducing drug costs. In 2013, the FDA banned generics of Purdue's OxyContin after Purdue spent about $100 million developing the abuse-deterrent version of its drug. The FDA decision came as a patent on OxyContin was about to expire. But since then, authorized generics of OxyContin have been allowed, introducing new competition for the abuse-deterrent version.Further, abuse-deterrent isn't ""abuse-proof,"" Cidambi says. Three years before the FDA banned OxyContin generics, Purdue introduced its difficult-to-crush OxyContin in 2010 to keep addicts from crushing and snorting the drug. As an unintended consequence, addicts began liquefying and injecting it.Making drugs abuse-deterrent is particularly challenging, Janney analyst Ken Trbovich says. To have the abuse-deterrent designation affixed to their labels, drugmakers must run additional trials estimated at $5 million to $10 million, and that's only if the trial succeeds on the first shot.""For generics, they're not used to spending that kind of money,"" he said. ""They're used to knocking off something that is going off patent. Why would you do it? If you're going to get 99% of the morphine market and you don't have to (run these tests), why do it?""Without a mandate that painkillers must be abuse-deterrent, generic-drug manufacturers will often skip that step and offer their versions at a lower price, Trbovich says. And doctors and payers don't always recognize that abuse-deterrent formulations are different.To that point, the long-acting morphine market included 7 million prescriptions in 2015, and 99% of those were filled by generics without abuse-deterrent properties, Trbovich says. Payers often push the cheaper generics or require that a patient try other medicines before approving the abuse-deterrent version.Mallinckrodt, Endo and Rhodes, a unit of Purdue, accounted for 80% of total prescription volume for morphine-based products in 2015, Trbovich says. Abuse-deterrent formulations could gouge those sales — if physicians and payers push for them, he says.""It just highlights the problem,"" he said. ""If, in fact, there was a commitment to try to move patients away from abusable products and to abuse-deterrent products, why is it we've got financial incentives that do the opposite?""The FDA says it's serious about tackling the problem.On June 9, Endo stock fell nearly 17% after the FDA asked it to remove its opioid Opana ER (extended-release) from the market. Opana ER was approved in 2006 without an abuse-deterrent label. In 2012, Endo replaced the old version with a new formula that prevents the pills from being crushed.But the new formula has been linked to breakouts of HIV and hepatitis C as drug users turn to injecting the pill rather than snorting it. The FDA also notes the abuse-deterrent formulation of Opana ER was created using INTAC technology, which has been linked to a blood-clotting disorder.Impax Laboratories (IPXL), though, sells a generic of the old version of Opana ER.It's a ""PR nightmare"" to fight the FDA on removal of the new version of Opana ER, but Endo could pull the abuse-deterrent formulation and rerelease the old pill, says Canaccord analyst Dewey Steadman.""If the FDA wants to pull abuse-deterrent formulations, the entire community will engage in risky behaviors,"" said Steadman.He proposes broader strategies that don't rely on just removing certain opioids from the market. These range from pharmacological solutions that prevent medicines from creating a quick high to social efforts that help prevent addiction in the first place.""We're just plugging holes into the dam at this point,"" he said. ""Then other holes show up.""Drugmakers like Cara, Recro, Nektar and others are working on creative solutions, including opioids that slowly — or don't — cross the blood-brain barrier, thereby limiting euphoric side effects. They also are working on non-opioids that have shown promise in reducing pain in patients following surgery.Cara stock rocketed 52% over six trading days in June as its intravenous drug called CR845 looked strong in treating chronic kidney patients who experienced itching related to hemodialysis. But it lost nearly 43% in two days after the oral version of that drug failed to reduce knee pain.Needham analyst Alan Carr says the drug's mechanism is interesting. He noted in a June 30 note to clients that the mixed results in the latter trial — the drug did help cut down on hip pain — don't mean an end to Cara's entire CR845 program.The drug is designed to be ""intrinsically poor at penetrating the blood-brain barrier,"" Cara says. That means it can still work as a painkiller, anti-inflammatory and anti-itch treatment without producing side effects like nausea, sedation, respiratory depression, abuse, addiction or euphoria.Meanwhile, Nektar's chronic drug pain treatment known as NKTR-181 has been shown to offer significantly less drug ""likability"" vs. oxycodone. NKTR-181 aims to reduce pain without inducing the euphoria associated with opioids. It does this through ""strategic alteration of brain-entry kinetics.""Recro is working on an intravenous version of meloxicam, an oral medication that belongs to a group of drugs called nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. The goal, Trbovich says, is to reduce the number of patients who need an opioid after surgery.In a Phase 3 study of intravenous meloxicam presented in May, the drug was able to statistically reduce pain in patients over the first 48 hours following the removal of a bunion compared with a placebo. The company filed an application for the drug with the FDA in late July.Other pharmaceutical companies are working on strong anti-abuse efforts. Collegium Pharmaceutical (COLL) has compared its Xtampza against OxyContin in a head-to-head trial. When crushed or chewed, Xtampza doesn't dump the entire dose immediately. Therefore, it's less ""likable"" than OxyContin when it's intact, crushed or a generic version is turned into an immediate-release tablet and crushed.Throwing drugmakers into one bucket is unfair, Trbovich says. Some — but not all — are working on meds to reduce pain without inducing opioidlike euphoria. For those, just replacing the morphine market could be a $2.5 billion opportunity over time.""We've got to be real. Stop waving your hands and telling me (regulators are) going after the industry,"" he said. ""Unfortunately, the industry has become the whipping child even though the industry, at some level, has tried. I'm not saying all of them, but there are huge differences (in these drugs).""RELATED:Why This Biotech Could Be Poised For A Run After Toppling 52% In JuneIs This Small Biotech Headed For A $1 Billion Market Cap — Or Pitfall?Biotech Plunges 40% On Mixed Trial — Is There A Silver Lining?How This Biotech Could Dethrone Oxycodone In Treating Pain

32,NKTR,"Tesaro (TSRO) beat on the top but was short on the bottom line in reporting second-quarter earnings after the close Tuesday, while Nektar Therapeutics (NKTR) missed on sales and reported wider-than-expected losses.XIn after-hours trading on the stock market today, Nektar popped 1.7%, after closing down 3%, at 19.64, at the closing bell. Tesaro ended the regular session down 2.4%, at 124.31, but lifted 1.1% in trading after hours.For its second quarter ended June 30, Tesaro reported adjusted losses of $2.82, widening from a $1.29-cent loss in the year-earlier period and missing views for a $2.52 loss. But $29.5 million in sales beat the model of analysts polled by Zacks Investment Research for $16 million, though they  fell 17.6%.Tesaro has two Food and Drug Administration-approved drugs — Zejula and Varubi. They pulled in a combined $28.8 million in product sales for the quarter, up from $1.2 million in the year-earlier period. Zejula, an ovarian cancer drug, accounted for 90% of those sales. Varubi is an anti-nausea med.IBD'S TAKE: Tesaro has an IBD Composite Rating of 32, meaning it underperforms more than two-thirds of all stocks in terms of key growth metrics. It trails better-rated biotechs like Celgene with a best-possible CR of 99. Head to IBD Stock Checkup for a look at the most highly-rated biotechs.Zejula is the most prescribed PARP inhibitor in the U.S., Tesaro said. It competes with other drugs in the PARP inhibitor class from AstraZeneca (AZN) and Clovis Oncology (CLVS). Tesaro expects to have a Zejula launch in Europe before the end of the year.Nektar reported adjusted losses of 39 cents per share on $34.6 million in revenue for the second quarter, compared with adjusted losses of 36 cents a share on $32.8 million in sales. Analysts modeled an adjusted loss of 34 cents per share on $36 million in sales.The biotech blamed the higher adjusted loss in the period on litigation-settlement expenses and increased research and development spending, which rose 15.1% in the quarter. R&D expenses are up as Nektar works to expand clinical and pre-clinical development of four drugs, the company said.RELATED:Will These Cancer-Focused Biotechs Surprise To The Upside Tuesday?Kite, Valeant Beat Views While Ionis, Mallinckrodt Light On SalesHow Teva's 40% Crash Over Three Days Is Hurting Generic Drugmakers

34,NKTR,"Nektar Therapeutics (NKTR) stock neared a breakout Monday after announcing a deal with Eli Lilly (LLY) to develop an drug that could stoke the immune system to fight autoimmune and inflammatory conditions.XIn morning trading on the stock market today, Nektar popped 3.2% to close at 22.95 after earlier rising as much as 7%. Shares are up 81% for the year, and began forming a cup with a 24.98 buy point in late March. At the same time, Lilly stock was up fractionally to 84.74.Lilly and Nektar will codevelop a drug known as NKTR-358. The drug works by stimulating a specific pathway in the body to generate a greater immune system response. By activating certain cells, NKTR-358 can act to bring the immune system back into balance, the firms said.The drug is entering Phase 1 testing to determine correct dosing. It is being developed as a once or twice monthly self-administered injection for a number of autoimmune diseases, the companies said in a news release.Evercore analyst Umer Raffat sees NKTR-358 as a potential treatment for Lupus, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, rheumatoid arthritis and ""perhaps even multiple sclerosis, graft-versus-host disease and Type 1 diabetes.""IBD'S TAKE: Nektar has an IBD Composite Rating of 56, meaning it outperforms just over half of all stocks in terms of key growth metrics. It lags leaders like Celgene (CELG), Corcept Therapeutics (CORT) and Supernus Pharmaceuticals (SUPN) which have best-possible CRs of 99. Head to IBD Stock Checkup for a list of the top-rated biotechs.Phase 1 trial information is due in the third quarter, Raffat wrote in a research report.Under the terms of the deal, Lilly will pay Nektar a $150 million upfront fee and make $250 million milestone payments. Lilly will foot the bill for 75% of the research and development costs after Phase 1 wraps up. Nektar is response for Phase 1 costs.Nektar will receive ""double-digit royalties that increase commensurate with their Phase 3 investment and product sales,"" the companies said. Nektar will be able to co-promote in the U.S. for certain treatments.Raffat noted Nektar's main program is actually a drug known as NKTR-214 which is being combined with drugs from Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) and Roche (RHHBY). Bristol and Nektar are looking at five tumor types. Roche and Nektar are working in lung and bladder cancer.RELATED:How This Biotech Could Dethrone Oxycodone In Treating PainIs This Small Biotech Headed For A $1 Billion Market Cap — Or A Pitfall?Bristol-Incyte Match Beats Dow's Merck In Combination Trials

35,NKTR,"Nektar Therapeutics (NKTR) stock popped to a three-month high Tuesday after the biotech said its chronic pain drug, NKTR-181, showed significantly less abuse potential compared with an oft-abused opioid.On the stock market today, Nektar stock lifted 4.6% to 21.60, after earlier rising as much as 5.9% to touch a high last seen in March. Nektar was among those leading biotech shares, alongside Puma Biotechnology (PBYI) which jumped 8.5%  to 93.45 on the approval of its cancer drug.The drug known as NKTR-181 proved to be less ""likable"" vs. oxycodone, a commonly abused chronic pain drug sold by Purdue Pharmaceuticals as OxyContin. NKTR-181 aims to treat pain without inducing euphoria associated with opioids.""It is clear from our new study results that NKTR-181 is highly differentiated in this respect from oxycodone, which is a choice drug of abuse,"" Nektar Chief Medical Officer Ivan Gergel said in a news release.Opioids act on specific receptors in the brain to relieve pain, but also target the dopamine reward system in the brain, producing euphoria and psychoactive effects, Nektar said. In 2014, nearly 2 million Americans either abused or were dependent on prescription opioids.IBD'S TAKE: Nektar stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 48 out of a best-possible 99, meaning it performs near the middle of all stocks in terms of key growth metrics. IBD's 438-company Biotech industry group is led by Celgene (CELG), which has a CR of 99. Visit IBD's Stock Checkup for a look at other strong names in the sector.In a Phase 3 study unveiled in March, patients with lower back pain treated with NKTR-181 reported an average pain score reduction of more than 65%, Nektar said. NKTR-181 avoids the abuse potential through ""strategic alteration of brain-entry kinetics.""Nektar's results follow a month after the Food and Drug Administration asked Endo (ENDP) to pull its opioid pain medicine, the extended-release version of Opana, from the market.

37,NKTR,"Cara Therapeutics (CARA) stock popped to a record high Tuesday, but could be exposed to volatility later this quarter when it's expected to unveil the Phase 2 results of a drug to treat chronic pain, an analyst said Wednesday.On the stock market today, Cara stock lifted 2% to close at 26.95, a new closing high. Shares touched 28.50 intraday on Tuesday, though closed at 26.42. Cara stock has ended on new closing highs over each of the past four days.Janney analyst Ken Trbovich credits the spike in Cara stock, in part, to a biotech rally that prodded IBD's 432-company Biotech industry group to a 17-month high earlier this month. Shares are up 1.8% today after falling 3.2% on Tuesday.Trbovich expects Cara stock to be particularly volatile when it unveils the results of a midstage trial of its oral drug known as CR845 in osteoarthritis, a chronic joint condition caused by ""wear and tear.""""The long-term potential of oral CR845 for chronic pain is a tantalizing opportunity for a company with a market cap that remains below $1 billion even after its amazing run over the past week,"" Trbovich wrote in a note to clients. Cara's market cap is $885 million.Earlier this year, Nektar Therapeutics (NKTR) added $1 billion to its market cap after releasing the results of a Phase 3 trial of a drug to treat chronic back pain. Nektar stock climbed 42.7% on the release. Trbovich doesn't expect that kind of spike for Cara stock.Nektar has ""about five times as many shares outstanding compared to Cara,"" he said. ""Putting this into perspective, such a move — adding $1 billion in market cap — would be like Cara's share price going up by $32 per share, which we do not anticipate.""IBD'S TAKE: Generalist investors could be returning to the biotech space as worries that President Trump will pressure drug prices have started to subside. Head to IBD Industry Themes for a look at which stocks benefited most in the rally.But Cara stock could rise as much as $16 per share if the results for oral CR845 in osteoarthritis turn out positive. On the other hand, if the data aren't strong, Cara stock could topple down near 15. If results are really bad, the stock could land near 10-12, Trbovich said.That's because bad results for oral CR845 could reflect poorly on the intravenous version which, earlier this month, was granted breakthrough designation to treat chronic liver disease patients who experience itching as a result of hemodialysis. Shares jumped 13.9% in one day on the news.""If the results are negative, we expect the stock to give up all of the value it has captured in the move up from 17 and then a couple of dollars more,"" he said. But Trbovich kept his buy rating and 22 price target on Cara stock.RELATED:Biotech Rally Gets Second Wind As This Small Cap Nears Break OutThis Small Biotech Is Defying Today's Sectorwide DoldrumsBiotechs Hit Pause On 5-Day Rally As Regeneron, Bluebird Topple

38,NKTR,"Incyte (INCY) stock enjoyed a fifth consecutive day of gains Friday after its immuno-oncology drug, epacadostat, proved robust in combination trials with Dow component Merck (MRK) and Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY).Between the two, Merck's Keytruda and Bristol-Myers' Opdivo were tested in combination with Incyte's epacadostat in eight forms of cancer. Among those, Bristol-Myers' matchup in melanoma grabbed the best response and disease control rates.At the 100-milligram dose, melanoma patients treated with the Opdivo and epacadostat combination saw a 75% response rate and a 100% disease control rate, according to Janney analyst Debjit Chattopadhyay.Merck's top response rate was 47% in kidney cancer with its best disease control rate at 63% in bladder cancer. But melanoma is well known to be an immuno-oncology sensitive disease. Bristol's Opdivo and Yervoy are approved jointly to treat some forms of melanoma.The results were released ahead of the American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting next month in Chicago. In total, Merck tested Keytruda and epacadostat in six types of cancer at varying doses.IBD'S TAKE: Keep tabs on IBD's Biotech And Pharma Industry And Stock News page as more from the American Society of Clinical Oncology pulls new headlines.In head and neck cancer, Opdivo plus epacadostat achieved a 70% disease control rate. Merck's Keytruda with epacadostat hit a 62% disease control rate in patients who had already undergone two prior therapies, and 43% in patients who'd already been treated three times.Kidney cancer is ""clearly"" an immuno-oncology sensitive tumor type, Chattopadhyay wrote in a note to clients. The combination of Keytruda and epacadostat had 47% response and 58% disease control rates in patients who'd either never been treated or had one prior therapy.In bladder cancer, 35% of patients treated with Keytruda and epacadostat responded to treatment with the disease under control for 57% of patients. The numbers for breast cancer, though, were less robust. Response rates hit 9%-12% with disease control rates of 29%-41%.Bristol and Roche (RHHBY) are also combining their immuno-oncology drugs with Nektar Therapeutics' (NKTR) drug known as NKTR-214. The drug is what's known as a CD122-biased agonist which grows cancer-killing immune system and ""natural killer"" cells within a patient's body.Chattopadhyay kept a buy rating on Nektar stock, though noted data are still early. Bristol and Nektar are looking at Opdivo and NKTR-214 in five tumor types. Roche's Tecentriq is being combined with NKTR-214 in lung and bladder cancer.More data are expected from Tesaro's (TSRO) combination with Merck during the conference in June. Tesaro's Zejula, which is what's known as a PARP inhibitor, is being combined with Merck's Keytruda in breast cancer.Though it won't be the first ""hints"" of what an immuno-oncology-PARP inhibitor pairing could do, Chattopadhyay said. BeiGene, looked at a similar combination in 38 patients. The match, a PARP inhibitor and what's known as a PD-1 inhibitor, decreased tumor burden in 16 patients.At least one patient in BeiGene's (BGNE) trial went into remission with partial responses from seven patients. The trial looked at patients with ovarian, uterine and pancreatic cancer. But the overall response rate of 21% was just shy of the 30% ""needed to justify a Phase 3 program, in our view,"" Chattopadhyay said.Incyte stock closed 2% higher at 131.43 on the stock market today, after rising 6.9% on Thursday. Bristol edged up 0.45% to 54.02. Merck, a member of the Dow Jones industrial average, inched down 0.2% to 63.78.RELATED:Incyte Teams Up With Dow's Merck To Trounce Roche In CancerMerck's Immuno-Oncology Star Tacks On 2 New Bladder Cancer ApprovalsConference Spotlights Drug Giant Donnybrooks In Cancer Treatments

39,NKTR,"How do you get a handle on the biotech market when an unknown stock like Esperion Therapeutics (ESPR) — up nearly 200% since January — outperforms the likes of the industry's top name, Amgen (AMGN)?Sure, Esperion has had some breakthroughs in cholesterol medication. But Amgen recently had its own moment with one of its cholesterol drugs, proving that decreasing ""bad"" LDL cholesterol also cuts the risk of heart attack and stroke. Still, Amgen isn't getting the respect that smaller biotech players are getting, up a comparatively paltry 11% this year.Don't get discouraged, though, analysts say. Just because Amgen isn't getting a lot of love, it doesn't mean other biotech stocks are slouches. It's really a question of navigating what can be a complex sector.Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges says biotechs have done well since the election, though the stocks are subject to the whims of political debate over drug pricing and health care.""We're worried about Donald Trump and health care reform ... we're worried about FDA reform and now we're worried about drug-pricing regulations,"" he said. ""And it just doesn't seem as though the accumulated worries are going to go away in a hurry.""The overall group, though, looks strong.

Some biotechs are bound to do well in 2017 with a number of catalysts still ahead of them, while others are more likely to struggle with macroeconomics and politics.""There are still some pressures that investors need to be cognitive of, like drug pricing,"" Syed told IBD. ""Some folks thought that was a presidential platform topic, but it keeps coming up now in the postelection.""IBD's 425-company Biomed/Biotech industry group is up 12% for the year. Major exchange traded funds iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology Index (IBB) and the SPDR S&P Biotech (XBI) are up 12% and 20%, respectively.The top five biotechs include Amgen, Gilead Sciences (GILD), Celgene (CELG), Biogen (BIIB) and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN). Each has been in the news in 2017, but none on stock price. Amgen has gained the most at 11% with Gilead lagging, down 6% since January.Syed has buy ratings on Amgen, Celgene and Gilead stocks and a neutral rating on Biogen stock.But the smaller players and potential takeout candidates like Incyte (INCY) and Tesaro (TSRO) have seen big gains on Wall Street. Tesaro is likely to remain a stand-alone company, though, after grabbing FDA approval for ovarian cancer drug, Zejula. Its stock rose as much as 43% through mid-February but is now up only 3% for the year.Incyte, on the other hand, has tacked on 24% since January on rumors that No. 2 biotech Gilead could be looking to acquire it. Incyte would open Gilead up to the oncology world as its hepatitis C franchise struggles amid high cure rates.""Once again, we're starting the year with the best-performing stocks being those that were cheapest and more of takeout candidates,"" Porges told IBD. ""So (making predictions has) definitely been somewhat challenging.""Earlier this month, Nektar Therapeutics (NKTR) stock hit an 11-year high on strong data for a pain pill that could be an alternative to potentially addictive Oxycodone. Nektar stock catapulted 43% in a single day. Shares extended 25% from a cup-with-handle formation in late March, but have since given back 20% of those gains. The stock remains up 58% for the year.Other big stock earners include Kite Pharma (KITE) and Bluebird Bio (BLUE), both of which are working on drugs that belong to a class called CAR T-cell therapies. These drugs engineer patients' immune cells to treat cancer. Kite stock is up a whopping 80%, leading a 42% rise in Bluebird stock.And as Esperion rocketed on Amgen's heart study, so too did The Medicines Company (MDCO). Shares are up 45% since January. Porges lists Medicines Co. as a stock to watch, noting its ""spectacular returns.""""If you have the right stock and the right set of events, then you can still generate incredibly attractive returns and that's the excitement of biotech,"" Porges said. ""These are companies that are approaching critical readouts of ongoing development programs where investors think there's a reasonable chance a critical trial or a critical milestone turns out positively.""Mizuho's Syed suggests looking at individual stocks and equities, rather than hoping for a broad biotech resurgence. He sees a ""good number of catalysts"" in 2017 for the market, but notes the drug-pricing debate is likely to still weigh on the market.President Trump has keyed in on the drug-pricing debate and, though limited on details, says he has plans for a competitive-based system that would bring down the prices of drugs. Trump's pick to run the FDA, Scott Gottlieb, has said drug-pricing needs to be more transparent.As that struggle unfolds, Porges laid out some rules for picking biotech stocks likely to have better returns.""You want to be in growth companies early in their life cycle treating very serious illnesses,"" he said. ""And if you follow those three rules, you are generally going to end up with a portfolio that's going to perform better than the average, better than the index, better than the benchmarks.""Under those rules, Porges says Epizyme (EPZM), Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) and Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) are interesting. Epizyme stock is up 44% since January, having topped a 12.70 buy point out of a cup-with-handle formation in early February. Vertex stock has gained 23% this year.Alexion stock is actually down 3% year to date, but the stock fits the bill using Porges' rules. The rare-disease company is working on drugs to treat disorders of the central nervous system, blood diseases and genetic disorders.The worst thing to do in biotech investing is to sell just because a stock is up, Porges said. And don't hesitate to buy a stock for the same reason.""One of the axioms of investing in biotech is always you never want to say, 'I'm not going to buy the stock because it's up,' because this is an industry where you can routinely see five-to-tenfold increases in value over the cycle of the emergence of a product,"" he said.""So often we see a stock where investors say, 'It's up 50%, but it's only gone from a $500 million market cap to a $750 million market cap,' which in the scheme of things is pretty small,"" he said. ""If you have a real drug, you're going to be a $5 billion or $6 billion company.""RELATED:Esperion And Medicines Co.

40,NKTR,"Nektar Therapeutics (NKTR) stock soared more than 40% to an 11-year high Monday after unveiling strong data for a pain-relief pill that could be an alternative to the potentially addictive oxycodone.In a phase three study of 600 patients, Nektar's drug, known as NKTR-181, significantly improved chronic low back pain vs. a placebo in patients never treated with an opioid. The trial ran 12 weeks and included a dosing schedule in which patients received 100 milligrams up to 400 milligrams of the drug.During that period — in which dosing was gradually adjusted for best results — average pain scores dropped by 65%, Nektar said in a news release. Average pain scores for patients on the placebo increased more than for those who received NKTR-181.Statistically significant proportions of patients on NKTR-181 experienced pain reductions that topped 30% and 50%. A statistically significant proportion of patients on NKTR-181 reported that their general overall status and quality of life had ""improved"" or ""very much improved.""The drug was well tolerated and proved safe, the study showed. Most commonly, patients experienced nausea and constipation in both the drug and placebo arms.At the closing bell on the stock market today, Nektar stock catapulted 42.7% to 22.11.IBD'S TAKE: Nektar stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 37 out of a best-possible 99, meaning that it underperforms six in 10 stocks in terms of key growth metrics. A better stock bet would be Celgene, which tops the biotech industry group with a CR of 99. Visit the Stock Checkup for a list of strong biotechs.Full data will be presented at a medical meeting in the second half of the year. Nektar didn't identify the meeting in which it plans to release the results. Clinical investigator Dr. Martin Hale sees NKTR-181 as a safer method of pain treatment than opioids like oxycodone.""While standard opioid analgesics, including abuse-deterrent formulations, have been the most effective way to treat chronic pain, they are associated with serious safety concerns and many opioid-naive patients fear taking them because of the potential for abuse and addiction,"" he said.NKTR-181 data suggests ""it is a transformational pain medicine,"" he said in the release. In a human abuse potential study, even the highest dose of NKTR-181 was barely distinguishable from the placebo in terms of feeling high. The effects were modest compared to oxycodone's.Nektar's stock move, a gain of more than 44% at one point, was one of several biotechs to make massive gains Monday. Among IBD's 422-company Biomed/Biotech industry group, Nektar's stock climb was only behind Esperion Therapeutics (ESPR) stock, which launched 64.3%, near 38.90, on news related to its cholesterol drug.RELATED:Bristol-Myers Partner Hits 18-Month High On Immuno-Oncology DealJazz Pharma Isn't Dozing; Stock Breaks Out On Sleep Apnea Trial

41,NKTR,"The second annual IBD Best Mutual Fund Awards came down decidedly in favor of small-cap funds over their mid- and large-cap peers, as small caps overcame a roller-coaster stock market in 2016 to produce outsize gains.Winning an IBD Best Mutual Fund Award is not easy. Funds must have at least $100 million in assets and must beat a benchmark — in this case the S&P 500 — in the past one, three, five and 10 years.When you look at U.S. equity mutual funds organized by market capitalization — large, mid- and small cap — 1,200 are big enough and old enough. But only 49 emerged as winners by beating the S&P 500 over all four periods.Nearly half of those — 23 — were small-cap funds. Why so many?Part of the explanation is that they won the numbers game. They outperformed big-time in 2016 and in four earlier years of the decade, says Christopher Lo, a manager of $3.8 billion Columbia Small Cap Index (NMSCX), the ninth-best-performing portfolio on the Best Mutual Fund Awards winners small-cap list. Those five years of outperformance more than made up for years when they stood out less, he adds.Another reason small-cap funds predominate among cap-size outperformers is that in 2016 alone, they benefited more than other cap-size groups from the election results. ""Small caps tend to have higher shares of domestic revenues,"" Lo said. ""So they benefited from the prospect of policy changes, such as lowering corporate taxes — small caps tend to pay higher tax rates — and increasing infrastructure spending.""A third reason: Small caps tend to outperform in periods of rising interest rates. When rates rise because the economy is strengthening, that often coincides with strengthening fundamentals for U.S. small caps, Lo said.In addition, coming out of economic downturns — such as in 2010 — small caps tend to outperform because they are less burdened by balance-sheet debt. They borrow less than large caps do during downturns, Lo said.A fifth reason for small-cap excellence is the prevalence of small-cap innovators.The 108 Best Mutual Fund Award winners last year have dwindled to 49 the latest year. Why the big drop-off? The stock market in 2016 was a pivotal factor, as the Brexit and elections caught many fund managers on the wrong side of the broad market benchmark. The number of large-cap winners fell to 11 from 94, midcap winners edged up to 15 from 10 and small-cap winners rose to 23 from 4.Return winners among the three cap-size categories also got mowed down by a volatile market in 2016. Large-cap funds did best, with three of their 11 winners this year repeating from 2015. Just one midcap winner was a repeat performer. And not a single small-cap portfolio was a veteran award winner.So how can you use our lists of award winners to build a better portfolio? When you're building or reviewing a portfolio, your investment profile is likely to call for various weightings in large-, mid, and small-cap funds. Consider filling those portfolio slots with IBD Best Mutual Fund Award winners. If the winners aren't available in your 401(k) plan, you can ask your plan provider why not.What made these funds winners? For one thing, to become a winner it helps if a fund can minimize its losses in market downturns. Otherwise, its long-term returns suffer, potentially knocking it out of contention over the longer time periods.""It takes discipline,"" said Mark Oelschlager, manager of $213 million Pin Oak Equity Fund (POGSX), a top-five standout in the U.S. diversified equity, blend (where it is No. 1) and large-cap categories. He also runs $420 million Red Oak Technology (ROGSX), tops among sector funds. ""It takes a willingness to go against the crowd. And it takes conviction.""Oelschlager showed those traits in recent years when he bet big on financials as they sold off in the financial crisis. ""We had confidence that eventually conditions would change and we would be rewarded,"" he said. He has already started to take profits in the sector, trimming his weighting, he says.Independent thinking is another trait that fuels outperformance, Oelschlager says. His reaction to the market's postelection advance is a case study. While many other investors are seeking pure plays on the widely expected boost in infrastructure spending and corporate tax cuts, Oelschlager is looking elsewhere. ""We've been looking in the opposite direction from the Trump bump,"" he said. ""We're moving incrementally toward stability. We still have significant exposure to financials and some other cyclical sectors, but we're generally favoring stability in consumer staples, health care, even in technology and financials.""Bank of New York Mellon (BK) is a financial he still likes. ""Its valuation is still attractive,"" he said. ""It's relatively stable. It doesn't have the same issues with lending cycles as many other banks because it's not focused on lending. It's more of a trust bank.""Paychex (PAYX) and Amdocs (DOX) are two more examples. Paychex provides payroll and other employee-benefits services for customers. Amdocs is a leader in back-end software systems for telecom enterprises. ""Both are relatively stable companies in what are considered cyclical sectors,"" Oelschlager said.Valero Energy (VLO) refines and markets fuels and other petroleum products. ""Energy is considered a cyclical, and energy is expected to benefit from Trump,"" Oelschlager said. ""But Valero has less leverage to this cycle. They are further downstream. They are not an E&P. They don't have the same volatility. And their results are more consistent than an E&P company's.""Oelschlager isn't the only advocate of discipline. Jerry Dodson, manager of $3.7 billion Parnassus Endeavor (PARWX), shows another way that discipline contributes to outperformance. Dodson buys stocks only once they have tumbled 33% below what he determines their intrinsic value to be.He must also satisfy himself that the stock's setback is just temporary and not a sign of something that has crippled the company. In addition, he wants bargains that can rebound within three years.""Part of the beauty of this process is that all we need is for the stock to rebound to its fair market value,"" Dodson said. ""We're not asking it to do anything extraordinary.""Dodson is a returning winner for good reason. Parnassus Endeavor posted a 12.23% average annual return over the 10 years ended Dec. 31. That was tops among all U.S. equity funds. It was also No. 1 in both the growth and large-cap categories. Its pace was nearly double the S&P 500's 6.95% yearly average return.There's no single path to consistent outperformance. Dodson achieved that goal with just 25 large-cap holdings as of Dec. 31. William Coleman and Gerry O'Reilly, managers of $5.2 billion Vanguard Tax-Managed Small Cap (VTMSX), reached the brass ring with 597 small stocks as of Jan. 31.The Vanguard fund ranks in the top five in both the small-cap and blend categories.Coleman and O'Reilly's strategy hinges on dumping holdings that are losing ground. They do it to minimize tax losses. But the strategy has the added benefit of constantly pumping up their weighting in their best performers. ""Some of our outperformance comes from selling names before they head farther south,"" O'Reilly said. ""We take those proceeds and spread them over winning names in our benchmark, which boosts our performance.""It's a strategy that wins by hitting singles, not home runs. The portfolio holds nearly 600 names, and just one had a weighting higher than 0.58% as of Dec. 31.Nektar Therapeutics (NKTR), with a weighting of about a quarter of 1%, gapped up 43% on March 20, and is now up 91% so far this year. The biotech jumped on the release of data from its main clinical trial, which involves a search a practical alternative to addictive opioid therapies for managing pain. Opioid abuse is an epidemic. The company has yet to notch an annual profit, going back to 2008.Nutrisystem (NTRI), which markets weight-loss products and services, is up 57% this year. Shares gapped up 19% on Feb. 28, the day after the company reported fourth-quarter and full-year results. The company reported 29-cent Q4 earnings per share, a 53% gain vs. 20% in Q3, topping analysts' estimates. It also offered bullish guidance for 2017.Lumentum Holdings (LITE), a fiber optics provider, is up 40% this year. The stock is ranked No. 2 in IBD's No. 1-rated Telecom-Fiber Optics industry group. It has a top-notch 99 Composite Rating from IBD — 99 is the highest rating. And it has four years in a row of annual EPS growth.IBD'S TAKE: See how Lumentum's easy-to-understanding fundamental and technical data stack up against rivals' at IBD's Stock Checkup.There are many paths to consistent outperformance. One fund's winning way may be fine for some shareholders but too volatile or too risky for others, says Gary Miller, lead manager of $8.2 billion Victory Sycamore Established Value Fund (GETGX), the No. 1 winner in the value funds category and a top-five winner in the midcap group.RELATED:Introducing IBD's Best Mutual Funds 2016 Awards

62,NKTR,"Nektar Therapeutics (NKTR  -  Free Report) reported a loss of 14 cents per share in the fourth quarter of 2017, substantially narrower than both the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 38 cents and the year-ago figure of 28 cents.Shares of Nektar have significantly outperformed the industry in a year’s time. The stock has skyrocketed 471.6% while the industry has decreased 2.6%.Quarterly revenues substantially soared 154.7% to $95.5 million from the year-ago period. This upside can mainly be attributed to a massive rise in license and collaboration revenues. The top line also significantly beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $31 million.Quarter in DetailThe top line comprised product sales, royalty revenues, non-cash royalty revenues besides license, collaboration and other revenues.In the fourth quarter, product sales tumbled 43.1% to $7.8 million from $13.7 million a year ago.  However, non-cash royalty revenues increased 17.9% to $9.2 million.The company reported royalty revenues of $9.6 million in the quarter under review, registering a huge improvement of 50% from $6.4 million a year ago. This uptrend was mainly on the back of royalty revenues received under a license agreement with AstraZeneca for Movantik and Shire plc for Adynovate.License, collaboration and other revenues came in at $68.9 million compared with $9.6 million in the prior year. This upside was mainly due to a receipt of $60 million in non-recurring revenues related to a new sublicense agreement.Research and development (R&D) expenses mounted 62.2% to $81.4 million, primarily due to investments in pipeline including key candidates NKTR-358, NKTR-214 and NKTR-181.General and administrative (G&A) expenses were down 3.9% to $12.3 million in the reported quarter.2017 ResultsFull-year sales jumped 86% year over year to $307.7 million. Sales outpaced the consensus mark of $243.7 million as well as the previously guided range of $250-$255 million.The 2017 loss of 35 cents per share was narrower than both the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 78 cents and the year-earlier figure of 80 cents.Pipeline UpdateThe most advanced candidate in the company’s portfolio is Onzeald, currently under evaluation in a phase III (ATTAIN) study for treatment of adults with advanced breast cancer, having brain metastases.Apart from Onzeald, another candidate in the company’s immuno-oncology portfolio is NKTR-214. Last year in September, Nektar announced initiation of phase I/II PROPEL study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of NKTR-214 in combination with Roche’s (RHHBY  -  Free Report) Tecentriq (atezolizumab) and Merck’s (MRK  -  Free Report) Keytruda (pembrolizumab). Data from the trial is expected in the second half of 2018.A phase I/II study evaluating NKTR-214 as a potential combination treatment regimen with Bristol-Myers Squibb’s (BMY  -  Free Report) Opdivo is also underway. The candidate is being examined across nine tumor types including melanoma, renal cell carcinoma, non-small cell lung cancer, bladder and triple negative breast cancer. The combo therapy will also be evaluated in more than 20 potential indications.Another candidate, NKTR-181, is being evaluated in a phase III program for chronic pain management. Last July, the company reported positive top-line results from an oral human abuse potential study, evaluating NKTR-181, to assess the opioid abuse potential compared with oxycodone. The company is planning to submit a new drug application (NDA) for the candidate by April 2018.2018 OutlookNektar estimates revenues in the range of $100-$110 million excluding payments from the collaboration with Bristol-Myers, entered last month. Per the agreement, both companies will jointly develop and commercialize the lead immuno-oncology candidate, NKTR-214, of the former in combination with the latter’s Opdivo and Opdivo plus Yervoy (ipilimumab).Nektar anticipates cash of approximately $1.9-$1.925 billion at year-end 2018 including upfront payments from the collaboration with Bristol-Myers.Notably, cash and investments in marketable securities as of Dec 31, 2017 were $353.2 million in comparison to $389.1 million as of Dec 31, 2016.Nektar Therapeutics Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Nektar Therapeutics Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Nektar Therapeutics QuoteZacks RankNektar carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

64,NKTR,"Nektar Therapeutics’ (NKTR  -  Free Report) shares increased more than 11% on Feb 14 after the company announced a global strategic collaboration agreement with Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY  -  Free Report). Per the agreement, both companies will jointly develop and commercialize the lead immuno-oncology candidate, NKTR-214, of the former in combination with the latter’s Opdivo (nivolumab) and Opdivo plus Yervoy (ipilimumab).Pursuant to the contract, Nektar is entitled to receive an upfront payment of $1.85 billion, which includes a payment of $1 billion in cash and an equity investment of $850 million. Nektar will also get an additional $1.78-billion potential payment on achievement of certain developmental and sale-based milestones.Both Nektar and Bristol-Myers will share profits in the respective ratios of 65% and 35% from the potential sales of NKTR-214, worldwide.On a positive note, Nektar not only retains its ownership of the candidate but can also continue to collaborate with other companies for its further development. While Nektar will jointly commercialize NKTR-214/Opdivo combinations in the United States as well as major markets in the EU and Japan, Bristol-Myers is entitled to solely commercialize the combinations in the other global markets.We remind investors that Nektar is already evaluating NKTR-214/Opdivo in phase I/II PIVOT studies across five tumor types (melanoma, kidney, colorectal, bladder and non-small cell lung cancer) and eight potential indications. With this latest deal with Bristol Myers, it has been agreed upon by both companies to evaluate NKTR-214/Opdivo and NKTR-214/Opdivo plus Yervoy combinations in more than 20 cancer indications across nine tumor types.In November 2017, the two companies reported a positive interim data from dose-escalation part of the study, evaluating the safety and efficacy of the combo therapy on patients with melanoma, renal cell carcinoma and non-small cell lung cancers.Nektar’s shares have significantly outperformed the industry in a year’s time. The stock has skyrocketed 532.9% compared with the industry’s 2.5% increase.Importantly, Nektar is also conducting a phase I/II PROPEL study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of NKTR-214 in combination with Roche's (RHHBY  -  Free Report) Tecentriq (atezolizumab) and Merck's (MRK  -  Free Report) Keytruda (pembrolizumab). Notably, this PROPEL study complements the company’s ongoing PIVOT trial.Additionally, in May 2017, Nektar had entered into a research collaboration with Takeda Pharmaceuticals to explore the combination of NKTR-214 with five oncology compounds from Takeda’s cancer portfolio.Nektar Therapeutics Price Nektar Therapeutics Price | Nektar Therapeutics QuoteNektar carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

65,NKTR,"The biotech sector took the credit in the first month of 2018 as Loncar Cancer Immunotherapy ETF (CNCR  -  Free Report) topped the list of the best-performing ETFs of January, with impressive returns of about 21%. The fund has a Zacks ETF Rank #2 (Buy) with a High risk outlook.The impressive rally was mainly driven by encouraging industry fundamentals including mergers and acquisitions, earnings growth, promising drug launches, faster drug approvals, cost-cutting efforts, an aging population and Trump’s tax reform. In particular, the new tax legislation enticed companies to bring offshore cash back home, leading to a wave of mergers and acquisitions. Additionally, the slower growth in mature drugs has compelled prominent biotechs to acquire smaller ones with promising pipelines (read: M&A Waves Pushing Biotech ETFs Higher).Let’s take a closer look at the fundamentals of CNCR.CNCR in FocusThis product tracks the Loncar Cancer Immunotherapy Index and provides exposure to the basket of companies that develop therapies to treat cancer by harnessing the body’s own immune system.

66,NKTR,"U.S. equity markets have been on a tear since President Donald Trump’s election, owing to his pro-growth policies. However, various concerns over geopolitics and political stability in the United States bother the markets (read: U.S. ETFs in Focus as Market Cap Hits $30 trillion).Trump ImpactTrump’s tax reform was recently signed into law, driving U.S. equity markets higher. As a part of the measures introduced in the reform, the corporate tax rate was slashed to 21% from the previous 35%. Small-caps are significantly expected to benefit from this move, as the median effective tax rate is higher for small-cap stocks than large caps.The Trump administration indicated last month that it now plans to work on infrastructure spending, after the massive tax overhaul was passed. We might see developments in the infrastructure space, as recently a copy of Trump’s infrastructure plan got leaked. ""We are not going to comment on the contents of a leaked document but look forward to presenting our plan in the near future,"" White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters told CNBC (read: US Industrial Production Beats Expectations: ETFs in Focus).Coming to regulation cut down, Trump aims to cut down on stringent regulations for ease of doing business. He especially targets to cut a lot out of the Dodd Frank Act, as he thinks it restricts business growth. The bill, if passed, would allow small banks to avoid certain elements of federal oversight, such as stress tests, which measure an institution’s ability to withstand economic downturns. “We’re looking at Dodd-Frank very strongly and I think we’ll have something on that,” Trump told the Wall Street Journal.Geopolitical RisksGeopolitical risks have been on the rise. In his New Year’s address, North Korean premier, Kim Jong-un, warned the United States of potential nuclear action in case his country is threatened (read: What Does Kim Jong-Un's Speech Hold For Safe Haven ETFs?).Moreover, rising concerns in the Middle East are bothering the markets. Rising political unrest in Iran and Venezuela are driving fear among investors. Since small-cap stocks have more domestic exposure, the capitalization is not likely to be disturbed by geopolitical risks.Let us now discuss a few ETFs focused on providing exposure to U.S. small-cap equities.iShares Russell 2000 ETF (IWM  -  Free Report)This fund seeks to provide exposure to small cap U.S. companies and tracks the Russell 2000 index.It has AUM of $43.2 billion and charges a fee of 20 basis points a year.

67,NKTR,"Shares of Nektar Therapeutics (NKTR  -  Free Report) have increased a massive 483.7% in a year’s time, substantially outperforming the industry’s gain of 11.9%. Let’s analyze the factors that led to this massive rally.Nektar’s rapid progress on a robust pipeline in a year accompanied with several study initiations, positive readouts and strategic collaborations has driven its share price consistently.The company’s PEGylation technology also facilitated development of several approved products in the United States and the EU through partnerships with healthcare companies namely AstraZeneca's (AZN  -  Free Report) Movantik, UCB’s Cimzia and Amgen's (AMGN  -  Free Report) Neulasta, among others.Furthermore, it has a robust pipeline of early and late-stage candidates. Nektar has made a significant progress with its lead candidate Onzeald (formerly known as NKTR-102), which is currently under accelerated assessment in the EU, for treating adults with advanced breast cancer as well as brain metastases. A response is anticipated within the first half of 2018.Meanwhile, a randomized phase III confirmatory study (ATTAIN) began on Onzeald, late last year. The study compares Onzeald with the single-agent chemotherapy of physician’s choice on patients with advanced breast cancer having brain metastases of late. Positive results from the program are likely to support a regulatory filing in the United States.Apart from Onzeald, Nektar is working on developing other candidates. In September 2017, the company announced initiation of phase I/II PROPEL study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of its immuno-oncology candidate, NKTR-214, in combination with Roche’s Tecentriq (atezolizumab) and Merck's (MRK  -  Free Report) Keytruda (pembrolizumab).A phase I/II PIVOT study, evaluating NKTR-214 as a potential combination treatment regimen with Bristol-Myers Squibb’s Opdivo, is also underway across five tumor types (melanoma, kidney, colorectal, bladder and non-small cell lung cancer) and eight potential indications.In November 2017, the company announced positive data from PIVOT study for treating patients with melanoma, renal cell carcinoma and non-small cell lung cancers.Also, Nektar entered into a research collaboration with Takeda Pharmaceuticals to explore the combination of NKTR-214 with five oncology compounds from Takeda’s cancer portfolio in May 2017.Another candidate, NKTR-181, is being examined in a phase III program for treatment of chronic pain. In July 2017, the company reported positive top-line findings from an oral human abuse potential study, analysing NKTR-181, to assess the opioid abuse potential compared with oxycodone. It is planning to submit a new drug application for the candidate by April 2018.In March 2017, the company initiated a phase I clinical study, evaluating NKTR-358, to treat a wide range of auto-immune diseases and inflammatory disorders.Subsequently, in July 2017, Nektar sealed a co-development deal with Elly Lilly and Company for NKTR-358. Pursuant to this agreement, the company will own responsibility for completing the ongoing phase I study on the candidate. Both the companies will share phase II development costs with Lilly acquiring the lion share (75%) of the total expenses.This year looks extremely favorable for the stock with several updates lined up. The expected approval of Onzeald in the EU for breast cancer and the submission of NDA for NKTR-181 should act as a catalyst to further drive the stock in 2018.Nektar Therapeutics Price Nektar Therapeutics Price | Nektar Therapeutics QuoteZacks RankNektar carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?

69,NKTR,"Nektar Therapeutics (NKTR  -  Free Report) has announced initiation of dosing in a phase I/II study, evaluating the combination of its two novel immuno-oncology agents, NKTR-262 and NKTR-214, on patients with advanced solid tumors.While NKTR-262 is a toll-like receptor agonist designed to invite an innate immune response to fight the cancer, NKTR-214 is an immuno-stimulatory CD122-biased agonist.Shares of Nektar have soared 72.1% so far this year, substantially outperforming the industry’s decrease of 2.2%. The phase I/II REVEAL study is an open-label, multicenter dose escalation program, designed to evaluate the NKTR-262/NKTR-214 combination regimen, administered as an initial intratumoral (directly into the tumor) injection of NKTR-262 followed by an intravenous (IV) infusion of NKTR-214. The company believes that this combination therapy will enable it to provide an alternative treatment option to its patients.Moreover, the company also plans to assess this NKTR-262/NKTR-214 combination with Bristol-Myers’ (BMY  -  Free Report) Opdivo (nivolumab) in the given patient population.We remind investors that in September 2016, Nektar entered into a clinical collaboration agreement with Bristol-Myers under which, Nektar’s NKTR-214 will be examined in combination with the latter’s Opdivo across nine tumor types including melanoma, kidney, colorectal, bladder and non-small cell lung cancer plus 20 potential indications in phase I/II trials.Meanwhile, in September 2017, the company announced initiation of phase I/II PROPEL study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of NKTR-214 in combination with Roche’s (RHHBY  -  Free Report) Tecentriq (atezolizumab) and Merck’s (MRK  -  Free Report) Keytruda (pembrolizumab).It is also important to note that Nektar is developing several other candidates across important therapeutic areas including oncology, pain, anti-infectives and immunology aong others. The company has made a significant progress with its lead candidate Onzeald (formerly known as NKTR-102), currently under accelerated assessment in the EU for treating adults with advanced breast cancer as well as brain metastases. A response is anticipated within the first half of 2018.A couple of other interesting candidates is NKTR-181 and NKTR-358. While NKTR-181 is being analyzed in a phase III program for treatment of chronic pain, the company initiated a phase I clinical study on NKTR-358 to treat a wide range of auto-immune diseases and inflammatory disorders.Nektar Therapeutics Price Nektar Therapeutics Price | Nektar Therapeutics Quote Zacks RankNektar carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

70,NKTR,"If you're interested in broad exposure to the Small Cap Growth segment of the US equity market, look no further than the Vanguard Russell 2000 Growth ETF (VTWG  -  Free Report), a passively managed exchange traded fund launched on 09/22/2010.The fund is sponsored by Vanguard. It has amassed assets over $247.13 M, making it one of the average sized ETFs attempting to match the Small Cap Growth segment of the US equity market.Why Small Cap GrowthSitting at a market capitalization below $2 billion, small cap companies tend to be high-potential stocks compared to its large and mid cap counterparts, but come with higher risk.Growth stocks have higher than average sales and earnings growth rates. While these are expected to grow faster than the broader market, they also have higher valuations. Something to keep in mind is the higher level of volatility that is affiliated with growth stocks. Even though growth stocks are more likely to outperform their value counterparts in strong bull markets, value stocks have a record of delivering better returns in almost all markets than growth stocks.CostsSince cheaper funds tend to produce better results than more expensive funds, assuming all other factors remain equal, it is important for investors to pay attention to an ETF's expense ratio.Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.20%, making it one of the cheaper products in the space.It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 0.61%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsEven though ETFs offer diversified exposure that minimizes single stock risk, investors should also look at the actual holdings inside the fund. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.This ETF has heaviest allocation to the Information Technology sector--about 25.10% of the portfolio. Healthcare and Industrials round out the top three.Looking at individual holdings, Nektar Therapeut (NKTR  -  Free Report) accounts for about 0.81% of total assets, followed by Sage Therapeutic (SAGE  -  Free Report) and Exact Sciences (EXAS  -  Free Report).The top 10 holdings account for about 5.34% of total assets under management.Performance and RiskVTWG seeks to match the performance of the Russell 2000 Growth Index before fees and expenses. The Russell 2000 Growth Index measures the performance of those Russell 2000 companies with higher price/book ratios and higher predicted and historical growth rates.The ETF return is roughly 3.16% so far this year and was up about 21.31% in the last one year (as of 04/11/2018). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $114.36 and $145.53.The ETF has a beta of 1.14 and standard deviation of 17.18% for the trailing three-year period, making it a high risk choice in the space. With about 1192 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.AlternativesVanguard Russell 2000 Growth ETF carries a Zacks ETF Rank of 3 (Hold), which is based on expected asset class return, expense ratio, and momentum, among other factors. Thus, VTWG is a good option for those seeking exposure to the Small Cap ETFs area of the market.

71,NKTR,"The S&P 500 entered correction territory in early February, as it declined more than 10% from the record high set in January. Robust wage growth and jobs data introduced fears of inflation making a comeback and led investors to bet on aggressive rate hikes.The markets recovered some of its losses from early February, as the S&P 500 was down 3.8% and Dow Jones 4.4% in February.  However, March was not a sweet beginning for stocks across the globe, as President Donald Trump’s plans to impose tariffs didn’t go down well with investors.Trump’s America First agenda has sparked fears of a trade war, as he told steel and aluminum industry executives in a meeting about his intention of implementing a 25% tariff on steel imports and a 10% tariff on aluminum imports (read: Trump Tariffs Put These Sector ETFs & Stocks in Focus).Small-Cap AppealTrump’s tax reform was signed into law late last year, driving U.S. equity markets higher. As a part of the measures introduced in the reform, the corporate tax rate was slashed to 21% from the previous 35%. Small-caps are significantly expected to benefit from this move, given their domestic exposure.Being domestically focused, the current market scenario also bodes well for small-cap stocks. Since these stocks have less international exposure, they are less exposed to fears of trade wars and benefit from the economic scenario at home (read: Watch These ETFs as Trade War Risks Rise).Although the tariffs might lead to an increase in raw material cost for manufacturers who use these metals, since they might need to pass on a certain percentage of the rise to consumers, domestic steel producers are expected to derive benefit. Moreover, at a time when geopolitical risks in the Middle East are bothering the markets, small-caps which are less exposed to changes due to geopolitics might come under investors’ radar.  Small caps provide a greater growth potential than large and mid caps in an improving domestic economy. Although GDP growth in the final quarter of 2017 was revised down to 2.5% compared with 3.2% in the previous quarter, the economy is expected to gain momentum in the coming months. As the impact of Trump’s tax cuts and spending kick in, the economy is expected to pick up speed and report strong economic growth.Let us now discuss a few ETFs focused on providing exposure to U.S. small-cap equities.Vanguard Small-Cap ETF (VB  -  Free Report)This fund seeks to provide exposure to small cap U.S. companies and tracks the CRSP US Small Cap Index.

73,NKTR,"Nektar Therapeutics (NKTR  -  Free Report) along with partner Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY  -  Free Report) announced positive interim data from dose-escalation part of a phase I/II study, evaluating the safety and efficacy of the combination of its lead candidate, NKTR-214, with Bristol-Myers’ Opdivo (nivolumab). The combination therapy is being evaluated for treatment of patients with melanoma, renal cell carcinoma and non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC).Data from the study was presented at the 2017 annual meeting of Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC).Notably in September last year, Nektar had entered into a clinical collaboration agreement with Bristol-Myers for evaluating the Opdivo/NKTR-214 combination therapy across five tumor types (melanoma, kidney, colorectal, bladder and non-small cell lung cancer) and eight potential indications in phase I/II studies. While both companies share cost of the combination studies equally, Nektar retains the global commercial rights to NKTR-214.Nektar’s shares have significantly outperformed the industry so far this year. The stock has skyrocketed 164.9% while the industry has increased 0.9%.The PIVOT-02 phase I/II study was conducted on a total of 38 patients across a number of dose cohorts. Data from the trial demonstrated positive response rates across all three tumor types in both PD-L1 positive and PD-L1 negative patients.The company reported no treatment discontinuation due to adverse events.Importantly, NKTR-214 is a CD122-biased agonist, while Opdivo is a PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor. The two different and complementary mechanisms, which comprise the combination regimen, could provide new treatment options for cancer patients.We remind investors that Nektar is also conducting a phase I/II PROPEL study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of NKTR-214 in combination with Roche's (RHHBY  -  Free Report) Tecentriq (atezolizumab) and Merck's (MRK  -  Free Report) Keytruda (pembrolizumab). The PROPEL study complements Nektar’s ongoing PIVOT trial.Earlier in May, Nektar had entered into a research collaboration with Takeda Pharmaceuticals to explore the combination of NKTR-214 with five oncology compounds from Takeda’s cancer portfolio.Nektar Therapeutics Price Nektar Therapeutics Price | Nektar Therapeutics QuoteZacks RankNektar carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

74,NKTR,"Bristol-Myers Squibb Company’s (BMY  -  Free Report) first-quarter 2018 earnings of 94 cents per share exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 85 cents and the year-ago quarter earnings of 84 cents.Total revenues of $5.19 billion were slightly higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.18 billion and increased 5% from $4.93 billion recorded in the year-ago period. Strong sales of Opdivo and Eliquis contributed to the top line in the reported quarter.Shares of the company were up almost 0.5% in pre-market trading, possibly on better-than expected earnings. However, Bristol-Myers’ shares have declined 17% so far this year, which compares unfavorably with the industry’s decrease of 4.9%.Quarterly DetailsRevenues were up 1% year over year when adjusted for foreign exchange impact. Revenues increased 1% to $2.8 billion in the United States and 10% outside the country. Ex-U.S. revenues were up 1% when adjusted for foreign exchange impact.Leukemia drug Sprycel raked in sales of $438 million, down 5% year over year. U.S. sales for the drug were down 13% to $214 million. A label expansion of the drug in pediatric patients in the United States last November presumably did not have much impact on sales.Rheumatoid arthritis drug, Orencia, was up 11% in first-quarter 2018 to $593 million. Melanoma drug, Yervoy contributed $249 million to the top line during the reported quarter, down 25%. U.S. sales for the drug were down 33% to $162 million.Opdivo, which is approved for multiple cancer indications, generated revenues of $1.51 billion, up 34% from the year-ago period.Sales of cardiovascular drug, Eliquis, were $1.51 billion during the reported quarter, up 37% year over year. Multiple myeloma drug, Empliciti recorded sales of $55 million, up 4% year over year.However, the performance of key drugs in the Virology unit continues to disappoint. Sales of Baraclude declined 20% to $225 million. The Reyataz and Sustiva franchises deteriorated 36% and 54% year over year to $124 million and $84 million, respectively. The Hepatitis franchise lost 98% of its year-ago quarter sales and contributed a mere $3 million to revenues.Research and development (R&D) expenses in the quarter decreased 4.1% to $1.25 billion. Marketing, selling and administrative expenses declined 9.7% to $980 million.Gross margin was 69.5% in the quarter compared with 74.3% in the year-ago quarter due to change in product mix.Regulatory UpdateSubsequent to the quarter in April, the FDA approved Opdivo+Yervoy combination regimen for treating intermediate- and poor-risk advanced renal cell carcinoma in patients who have not received any prior treatment. In March, the FDA had granted priority review to a supplemental biologics license application (sBLA) seeking approval of the combination regimen for treating microsatellite instability-high or mismatch repair deficient metastatic colorectal cancer.Also, in April, the FDA granted priority review to the sBLA seeking approval of Opdivo monotherapy in patients with small cell lung cancer in third or later line setting. A new dosing regimen for Opdivo, 480 mg every four weeks, was also approved for the majority of indications.CollaborationsIn April 2018, Bristol-Myers collaborated with Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) subsidiary, Janssen, to develop and commercialize its Factor Xia inhibitor program, including BMS-986177, for treating major thrombotic conditions. In the same month, Bristol-Myers and privately-held Illumina, Inc. announced a collaboration to utilize the latter’s next-generation sequencing technology.In February, Bristol-Myers Squibb and Nektar Therapeutics (NKTR  -  Free Report) entered into a strategic development and commercialization collaboration for Nektar’s lead immuno-oncology program, NKTR-214. Per the collaboration, the companies will develop and commercialize NKTR-214 in combination with Opdivo and Opdivo plus Yervoy in more than 20 indications across nine tumor types, as well as potential combinations with other anti-cancer agents from either of the respective companies and/or third parties. Both the companies plan to initiate studies in renal cell carcinoma and melanoma in mid-2018.Pipeline UpdateIn April 2018, Bristol Myers announced data from a phase III study, Checkmate-227, which showed superior progression-free survival in first-line non-small cell lung cancer (“NSCLC”) treated with Opdivo – Yervoy combination compared to chemotherapy. In January 2018, Bristol-Myers announced positive data from Phase II CheckMate-142 study evaluating the combination of Opdivo and Yervoy in patients with DNA mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) or microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC).The company also announced data from the phase III study, CheckMate-078, evaluating Opdivo in Chinese population. Data showed that the drug achieved superior overall survival in previously-treated patients with NSCLC as compared to docetaxel.Data from a long-term follow up phase III study – CheckMate -141 – showed that Opdivo reduced risk of death by 32% in metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck after a minimum two years of follow-up compared to standard chemotherapy.In March, Bristol-Myers along with Pfizer Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) announced data from a real-world data analysis of different direct oral anticoagulants including Eliquis, J&J’s Xarelto and Boehringer Ingelheim’s Pradaxa. Data showed that Eliquis achieved significantly lower rates of both stroke/systemic embolism and major bleeding compared to both Xarelto and Pradaxa.2018 Guidance UpdatedBristol-Myers increased its adjusted earnings expectations for 2018. The company now projects earnings in the range of $3.35 to $3.45 per share (previously $3.15 to $3.30). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at $3.22. The company expects worldwide revenues to increase in mid-single digits.Our TakeBristol-Myers beat earnings expectations, primarily on robust sales of Opdivo and Eliquis in the quarter. The increase in 2018 guidance for adjusted earnings was also encouraging. We are positive on Bristol-Myers’ efforts to develop its pipeline, especially Opdivo. Several label expansion applications for Opdivo are under review in the United States and Europe. Potential approval will further boost the prospects of this blockbuster drug. Also, superiority of Eliquis in real world data analysis is expected to further boost sales of the drug.Bristol-Myers Squibb Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Bristol-Myers Squibb Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Bristol-Myers Squibb Company QuoteBristol-Myers carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

It has amassed assets over $327.98 M, making it one of the average sized ETFs attempting to match the Small Cap Growth segment of the US equity market.Why Small Cap GrowthSitting at a market capitalization below $2 billion, small cap companies tend to be high-potential stocks compared to its large and mid cap counterparts, but come with higher risk.While growth stocks do boast higher than average sales and earnings growth rates, and they are expected to grow faster than the wider market, investors should note these kinds of stocks have higher valuations. Also, growth stocks are a type of equity that carries more risk compared to others. Compared to value stocks, growth stocks are a safer bet in a strong bull market, but don't perform as strongly in almost all other financial environments.CostsCost is an important factor in selecting the right ETF, and cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive counterparts if all other fundamentals are the same.Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.20%, making it one of the cheaper products in the space.It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 0.84%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsIt is important to delve into an ETF's holdings before investing despite the many upsides to these kinds of funds like diversified exposure, which minimizes single stock risk. And, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.This ETF has heaviest allocation to the Healthcare sector--about 23.60% of the portfolio. Industrials and Information Technology round out the top three.Looking at individual holdings, Nektar Therapeutics Class A (NKTR  -  Free Report) accounts for about 3.49% of total assets, followed by Cantel Medical Corp. (CMD  -  Free Report) and Chemed Corp. (CHE  -  Free Report).The top 10 holdings account for about 11.97% of total assets under management.Performance and RiskVIOG seeks to match the performance of the S&P Small-Cap 600 Growth Index before fees and expenses. The S&P SmallCap 600 Growth Index represents the growth companies of the S&P SmallCap 600 Index.The ETF has added about 4.64% so far this year and was up about 17.52% in the last one year (as of 04/24/2018). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $128.65 and $154.96.The ETF has a beta of 1.01 and standard deviation of 15.70% for the trailing three-year period, making it a medium risk choice in the space. With about 340 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.AlternativesVanguard S&P Small-Cap 600 Growth ETF carries a Zacks ETF Rank of 3 (Hold), which is based on expected asset class return, expense ratio, and momentum, among other factors. Thus, VIOG is a sufficient option for those seeking exposure to the Small Cap ETFs area of the market. Investors might also want to consider some other ETF options in the space.The Vanguard Small-Cap Growth ETF (VBK  -  Free Report) and the iShares Russell 2000 Growth ETF (IWO  -  Free Report) track a similar index. While Vanguard Small-Cap Growth ETF has $7.42 B in assets, iShares Russell 2000 Growth ETF has $9.65 B. VBK has an expense ratio of 0.07% and IWO charges 0.24%.Bottom-LinePassively managed ETFs are becoming increasingly popular with institutional as well as retail investors due to their low cost, transparency, flexibility and tax efficiency.

76,NKTR,"Nektar Therapeutics’ (NKTR  -  Free Report) shares increased more than 10% on Nov 7 after reporting better-than-expected third-quarter results with both earnings and sales surpassing estimates.Quarterly earnings of 37 cents beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 21 cents. Notably, the company reported a loss of 32 cents in the year-ago quarter.Nektar’s shares have significantly outperformed the industry so far this year. The stock has skyrocketed 144.1% while the industry has registered an increase of 1.3%.Quarterly revenues substantially rose 321.2% to $152.9 million from the year-ago quarter. This upside can mainly be attributed to a massive increase in license and collaboration revenues. The top line also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $125 million.Quarter in DetailThe top line comprised product sales, royalty revenues, non-cash royalty revenues besides license, collaboration and other revenues.In the third quarter, product sales tumbled 70% to $4.4 million from $14.7 million a year ago. However, non-cash royalty revenues increased 5.2% to $8.1 million.The company reported royalty revenues of $9.3 million, thereby registering a huge improvement of 66.1% in the third quarter compared with $5.6 million in the year-ago quarter. This uptrend was mainly on the back of royalty revenues received under a license agreement with AstraZeneca for Movantik and from Shire plc for Adynovate.License, collaboration and other revenues came in at $131.1 million compared with $8.4 million a year ago. In the quarter, Nektar received an upfront payment of $150 million from Eli Lilly & Company for development and commercialization of NKTR-358. Of this amount, $127.6 million has been recognized this time around.Research and development (R&D) expenses climbed 26.3% to $65.7 million, primarily due to investments in pipeline, including key candidates NKTR-358, NKTR-214 and NKTR-181.General and administrative (G&A) expenses were up 17.5% to $12.1 million in the quarter under review.Pipeline UpdateThe most advanced candidate in the company’s portfolio is Onzeald, currently under accelerated assessment in the EU for treatment of adults with advanced breast cancer, having brain metastases. Nektar also initiated a randomized phase III confirmatory study (ATTAIN) on Onzeald compared with the single-agent chemotherapy of physician’s choice in patients with advanced breast cancer, having brain metastases shortly. Positive results from the study could support a regulatory filing in the United States.Apart from Onzeald, another candidate in the company’s immuno-oncology portfolio is NKTR-214. In September, Nektar announced initiation of phase I/II PROPEL study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of NKTR-214 in combination with Roche’s (RHHBY  -  Free Report) Tecentriq (atezolizumab) and Merck’s (MRK  -  Free Report) Keytruda (pembrolizumab).A phase I/II study evaluating NKTR-214 as a potential combination treatment regimen with Bristol-Myers Squibb’s (BMY  -  Free Report) Opdivo is also underway. The candidate is being examined across five tumor types (melanoma, kidney, colorectal, bladder and non-small cell lung cancer) and eight potential indications.Another candidate, NKTR-181, is being evaluated in a phase III study for treatment of chronic pain. In July, the company reported positive top-line results from an oral human abuse potential (HAP) study, evaluating NKTR-181, to assess the opioid abuse potential compared with oxycodone. The company is planning to submit a new drug application (NDA) for the candidate by April 2018.2017 Outlook UpdatedNektar raised its revenue outlook for 2017 to account for the $150 million upfront payment it received from Eli Lilly & Company in the reported quarter. The company now estimates revenues in the range of $250-$255 million compared with $215-$225 million, projected previously.Cash and investments in marketable securities as of Sep 30, 2017 were $412.2 million in comparison to $389.1 million as of Dec 31, 2016. Nektar continues to expect cash for year-end 2017 at approximately $350 million.Nektar Therapeutics Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Nektar Therapeutics Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Nektar Therapeutics QuoteZacks RankNektar carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

78,NKTR,"Investors in Nektar Therapeutics (NKTR  -  Free Report) need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Nov 17, 2017 $33 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Nektar shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Nektar is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Medical - Drugs industry that ranks in the Top 43% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, four analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while none have dropped their estimates. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from 14 cents per share to 21 cents in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Nektar right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Each week, our very own Dave Bartosiak gives his top options trades.

79,NKTR,"On Sep 26, 2017, we issued an updated report on Nektar Therapeutics (NKTR  -  Free Report), a biopharmaceutical company, focused on developing treatments, utilizing PEGylation and advanced polymer conjugate technology platforms.The company’s portfolio comprises two drugs — Movantik for opioid-induced constipation (OIC) and Adynovate for treating hemophilia A. Both drugs are showing impressive performance.Nektar shares a global license agreement with AstraZeneca (AZN  -  Free Report) under which, the latter was granted worldwide, exclusive, rights to develop, market and sell for Movantik as well as fixed-dose combination products.The company also has a licensing, collaboration and manufacturing contract with Shire plc (SHPG  -  Free Report) for Adynovate. It receives royalties and sales milestones related to both the drugs. These licensing agreements are expected to provide regular funds to the company.Also, Nektar has made a significant progress with lead candidate, Onzeald (formerly known as NKTR-102), currently under accelerated assessment in the EU for treating adults with advanced breast cancer as well as brain metastases. A response is anticipated soon.Nektar has also initiated a randomized phase III confirmatory study (ATTAIN) on Onzeald compared with the single-agent chemotherapy of physician’s choice. The trial is being conducted on patients with advanced breast cancer, who shortly complain of brain metastases. Positive results from this evaluation could support a regulatory filing in the United States.The company is further developing several other candidates across important therapeutic areas including oncology, pain, anti-infectives and immunology. Interesting ones include NKTR-181 (phase III – chronic pain), NKTR-214 (phase I/II – solid tumor) and NKTR-358 (phase I-autoimmune disease).We remind investors that in July, Nektar announced positive top-line results from an oral human abuse potential (HAP) study on NKTR-181 in order to assess the abuse potential compared with oxycodone. Notably, the FDA granted a Fast Track designation to the NKTR-181 development program.Successful development and commercialization of these candidates will in turn drive the company’s top line, considering the lucrative markets they target.Importantly, Nektar entered into a co-development deal with Eli Lilly and Company (LLY  -  Free Report) for NKTR-358 earlier in July. Pursuant to this agreement, Nektar will be responsible for completing the ongoing phase I study on the candidate. However, going forward with the phase II study on the same, Lilly will be capturing 75% of the total costs which should lower Nektar’s  development expenses on NKTR-358.However, Nektar’s proprietary market products as well as its underdeveloped candidates are subject to stiff competition from various other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies.The company is expected to face intense rivalry in the pain market with several manufacturers developing pain therapies. Competitors include Collegium Pharmaceutical’s Xtampza and Teva Pharmaceutical’s naproxen to name a few. Also, players in PEGylation and polymer conjugate chemistry technology space are Biogen (BIIB), Savient Pharmaceuticals, Dr. Reddy’s and Novo Nordisk among others.Nektar’s heavy reliance on partners for revenues still remains a huge concern, since partnership-related setbacks may seriously weigh on the company.4 Stocks to Watch after the Massive Equifax Hack Cybersecurity stocks spiked on recent news of a data breach affecting 143 million Americans.

81,NKTR,"The Q4 earnings season has reached its tail end with 97.1% of the S&P 500 index market capitalization that has reported so far up 14% on 8.5% revenue growth, with 77.2% beating EPS estimates and 76% coming ahead of top-line expectations. Earnings and revenue growth rates are much higher for the same group of companies than in the past few quarters. Additionally, earnings and revenue surprises are also tracking above historical levels.Investors should note that the gap between adjusted operating earnings and GAAP earnings is the widest in recent years due to huge one-time charges related to the new tax law.Given this, several equity ETFs have impressed with their performances and generated handsome returns over the trailing one month even after being hit by the market rout triggered by inflation fears and higher-than-expected rates hike. While there are winners in many corners of the space, below are five ETFs that buoyed up on robust earnings results.In addition, we have given a chart for their one-month performance and compared them with the broad market fund (SPY  -  Free Report) and the broad sector.First Trust Nasdaq Semiconductor ETF (FTXL  -  Free Report)This fund offers exposure to the most-liquid U.S. semiconductor securities based on volatility, value and growth. Total earnings for the broad technology sector are up 23.4% on 10.8% higher revenues with a blended beat of 86.4%. Most of the growth comes from semiconductor companies, expected to post 68.8% earnings growth in Q4, representing an incredible surge from 33.8% earnings growth in the year-ago quarter. Given this, FTXL has gained 15.5% in the past month and boasts a Zacks ETF Rank #1 (Strong Buy) (read: 5 ETF Ways to Tap Hot Semiconductor Stocks). Loncar Cancer Immunotherapy ETF (CNCR  -  Free Report)This product provides exposure to a basket of companies that develop therapies to treat cancer by harnessing the body’s own immune system. The wave of mergers and acquisition talks as well as solid earnings from companies like Nektar Therapeutics (NKTR  -  Free Report), Jounce Therapeutics (JNCE  -  Free Report), Macrogenics (MGNX  -  Free Report) and Gilead Sciences (GLD  -  Free Report) provided a boost to the fund’s portfolio. As a result, CNCR was up 13.3% over the past month and carries a Zacks ETF Rank #2 (Buy) with a High risk outlook (read: Biotech Crushing the Market: Best ETFs & Stocks YTD).Guggenheim Solar ETF (TAN  -  Free Report)This ETF offers exposure to the global companies involved in the solar power industry. It has gained 9.6% over the past month on strong Q4 earnings. In particular, earnings from First Solar (FSLR  -  Free Report) and SolarEdge Technologies (SEDG  -  Free Report) have been strong. These stocks occupy the top two positions and dominate the fund’s holdings with nearly double-digit exposure each (read: Alternative Energy ETFs to Gain From First Solar Q4 Results).Amplify Online Retail ETF (IBUY  -  Free Report)This ETF offers global exposure to companies that derive 70% or more revenues from online and virtual retail. It has risen 8.8% in the past month. Both retail and e-commerce have reported robust Q4 results. Earnings and revenues for the retail sector are up 8.9% and 9.4%, respectively, while the beat ratios are lower than many other sectors.

82,NKTR,"Investors in Nektar Therapeutics (NKTR  -  Free Report) need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the August 18, 2017, $11 Put had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Nektar shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Nektar is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Medical - Drugs industry that ranks in the Top 48 % of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from a loss of 35 cents per shareto a loss of 34 cents in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Nektar right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Often times, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Each week, our very own Dave Bartosiak gives his top options trades.

83,NKTR,"Key biotech stocks, Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report) and Biogen (BIIB  -  Free Report) reported second quarter results yesterday -- both companies surpassed earnings and sales estimates. There were several other key updates as well from companies like Incyte (INCY  -  Free Report) and The Medicines Co. (MDCO  -  Free Report).  Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesAmgen, Biogen Q2 Earnings: Biogen’s results were strong with the company’s most recent offering, Spinraza (spinal muscular atrophy - SMA), doing better than expected. Meanwhile, the company’s multiple sclerosis (MS) franchise continued to grow. MS is Biogen’s key area of expertise. Biogen expects the early 2020s to be an inflection point for the company with its key pipeline candidates expected to launch during that period (Read more: Biogen Tops Q2 Earnings & Sales, Spinraza Sales Up).  Amgen also topped estimates and updated its guidance. Recently launched products including Prolia (the second and fourth quarters are typically the strongest for this product), Repatha and Kyprolis recorded strong volume-driven growth. Amgen is working on improving Repatha patient access across the world. Meanwhile, mature products like Enbrel, Epogen, Neulasta and Neupogen declined with Neupogen being impacted by short-acting biosimilar competition that will continue affecting sales.While Amgen stock has gained 23.7% year to date (YTD), outperforming the 11.5% rally of the industry it belongs to, Biogen has lagged with shares declining 0.2% YTD.Incyte/Lilly RA Drug Faces At Least 18-Month Delay in Resubmission: Incyte and partner Lilly announced that there will be a delay of at least 18 months in the resubmission of the regulatory application for their investigational rheumatoid arthritis (RA) treatment, baricitinib. This means the resubmission will not take place this year. Incyte and Lilly will discuss the path forward with the FDA and evaluate options for resubmission including the possibility of conducting an additional study as required by the FDA.The FDA had issued a complete response letter (CRL) for baricitinib earlier this year in April. At that time, the agency had told the companies that it is unable to approve baricitinib, a once-daily oral medication for the treatment of moderate-to-severe RA, in its current form. The FDA had asked for additional clinical data to determine the most appropriate doses as well as to further characterize safety concerns across treatment arms.We note that baricitinib was approved in the EU under the trade name Olumiant in Feb 2017. The European Medicines Agency's (EMA) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) recently agreed that the label should be updated to include a precaution for patients who have risk factors for deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). Incyte’s shares were down 3.4% on the baricitinib update.Nektar Up on Lilly Deal: Nektar (NKTR  -  Free Report) entered into a deal with big pharma company Lilly which will see Nektar receiving $150 million upfront as well as up to $250 million in the form of milestone payments. The deal covers the co-development of an early stage asset, NKTR-358, in Nektar’s pipeline. NKTR-358, which has the potential to treat a number of autoimmune and other chronic inflammatory conditions, works by targeting the IL-2 receptor complex in the body. By activating regulatory T cells, NKTR-358 has the potential to bring the immune system back into balance.Other deal terms include sharing of phase II development costs (Lilly: 75%; Nektar: 25%), an option for Nektar to participate in late-stage development on an indication-by-indication basis and double-digit royalties for Nektar. The deal is a major win for Nektar considering the early-stage nature of the candidate and the hefty upfront fee. Lilly will make a strong partner for the company. Nektar’s shares were up following the deal announcement.  Ironwood Down on Heartburn Drug Data: Ironwood’s (IRWD  -  Free Report) shares were down even though the company reported positive data on IW-3718 from a mid-stage study conducted in patients with uncontrolled gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). The study met its primary endpoint but failed to impress investors with the efficacy results falling short of expectations. Ironwood intends to conduct end of phase II meetings with the FDA and move the candidate into phase III studies in the second half of 2018. According to the company, IW-3718 represents immense commercial potential with annual peak sales opportunity of more than $2 billion (Read more: Ironwood Reports Positive Data on Reflux Candidate).CHMP Positive on Regeneron/Sanofi Eczema Drug: Regeneron and Sanofi are a step closer to gaining EU approval for their eczema treatment, Dupixent, with the CHMP adopting a positive opinion for the drug. The companies are seeking approval for use in adults with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (AD) who are candidates for systemic therapy. A final decision regarding approval should be out in the coming months. Dupixent gained FDA approval earlier this year in March. Dupixent has blockbuster potential and is being investigated for other indications as well.Detailed Data on Gilead HIV Regimen: Gilead (GILD  -  Free Report) announced detailed 48-week results from a couple of late-stage studies on a fixed-dose combination of bictegravir (a novel investigational INSTI) and emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (FTC/TAF, a dual-NRTI backbone) for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in treatment-naïve adults. The bictegravir-containing regimen was found to be non-inferior to dolutegravir-containing regimens. Gilead holds a strong position in the HIV market and is working on strengthening its franchise. There is significant demand for a simple, convenient dosing regimen that can sustain virologic suppression with a safety profile that is appropriate for most HIV patients.MDCO’s TANGO-2 Stopped Early on Superior Benefit-Risk: The Medicines Co. got some good news with an independent data safety and monitoring board stopping a late-stage study on its investigational antibiotic, Vabomere (previously referred to as Carbavance) based on an interim analysis. Interim results from the TANGO-2 study showed that Vabomere improved clinical cure rates across all infection types and reduced rate of renal adverse events compared to best available therapy.Vabomere is currently under priority FDA review with a response expected in the third quarter. A marketing application was filed in the EU as well. The Medicines Co. is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock -- you can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.PerformanceMedical - Biomedical and Genetics Industry 5YR % Return Medical - Biomedical and Genetics Industry 5YR % ReturnEarnings season for the biotech sector is off to a strong start with big players like Amgen and Biogen reporting better than expected results.

84,NKTR,"Nektar Therapeutics (NKTR  -  Free Report) shares increased more than 4% on Tuesday after the company announced positive top line results from an oral human abuse potential (HAP) study, evaluating its opioid analgesic candidate, NKTR-181, to assess the abuse potential compared with oxycodone.NKTR-181 is a new chemical entity (NCE), designed to treat pain without inducing euphoria associated with opioids that can lead to abuse and addiction. Notably, the FDA had granted a Fast Track designation to the NKTR-181 development program, back in May 2012. So far, the drug has not been approved by the FDA or any other regulatory agencies.Nektar’s shares have significantly outperformed the Zacks classified Medical-Drugs industry so far this year. The stock has soared 76.1% compared with the broader industry’s advance of 6.9%.The HAP study was designed to compare therapeutic (400 mg) and supratherapeutic dosings (higher than its analgesic dose range of 100 mg-400 mg) of NKTR-181 versus a Schedule II opioid, oxycodone dose.The trial was conducted on 54 healthy non-dependent recreational drug users and has met both its primary and secondary endpoints. It demonstrated lower rating of peak liking and lower area under effect (AUE) for drug liking compared with oxycodone across every doses. In other words NKTR-181 shows a significantly less abuse potential compared with oxycodone.Per the company’s press release, opioid abuse is widespread in the U.S., with one in five having been an addicted patient to prescription painkillers. It is estimated that approximately two million Americans are either abused or dependent on prescription opioid pain relievers in 2014. Hence the drug’s approval will provide the company with a huge commercial opportunity in the U.S.We remind investors that in Mar 2017, Nektar announced positive results from SUMMIT-07 phase III efficacy study, evaluating NKTR-181 in patients with moderate to severe chronic low back pain. The study met the primary endpoint and demonstrated a significantly improved chronic back pain relief on treatment with NKTR-181 compared with placebo. Key secondary endpoints were also of high statistical significance.However, Nektar is expected to face intense competition in the pain market with several companies developing pain therapies. Competitors include Collegium Pharmaceutical, Inc.’s (COLL  -  Free Report) Xtampza and Teva Pharmaceutical’s (TEVA  -  Free Report) naproxen to name a few.Meanwhile, Endo International plc (ENDP  -  Free Report) recently announced that it will withdraw opioid pain medication Opana ER (oxymorphone hydrochloride extended release) from the market following FDA’s request in June. Hence, withdrawing the drug from the market will provide a potential opportunity for NKTR-181 in the coming times.Nektar Therapeutics PriceNektar Therapeutics Price | Nektar Therapeutics QuoteZacks RankNektar currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

85,NKTR,"U.S. equity funds witnessed outflows of about $10.3 billion in March, per an etf.com article, citing FactSet data. Investors pulled out $22.1 billion of large-cap focused funds. The outflows chart was led by SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY  -  Free Report) and iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV  -  Free Report), which witnessed a respective $12.2 billion and $9.8 billion in outflow in March.The high trading volumes of the popular S&P 500 ETFs also make it an attractive bet to gain short exposure to the markets, which might be one reason for the relative high volatility in fund flows.However, the damage caused was lesser than the prior month. Net outflows decreased to $2.7 billion compared with $4.4 billion in February. The primary reason for these outflows was the reallocation of capital by investors, owing to the high degree of market volatility and events affecting the markets.What’s Driving Outflows?The first quarter was dismal for the United States equity markets. Moreover, Wall Street saw a glum start to the second quarter, with stocks tumbling to record lows amid continued pessimism in the market.After a correction in early February owing to interest rate and inflation fears, markets recovered some of its losses to end the month on a slightly better note. However, March was not welcoming for stock bulls across the globe, as new concerns started bothering the markets.President Trump’s plans to impose tariffs on various goods with its major trading partners introduced a sense of fear among investors, as they braced themselves up for a potential trade war (read: Safe Haven ETFs to Buy Amid Extended Selloff).“The outflows reflect a reallocation of capital given what’s been going on in the market over the past several weeks. There’s a lot of headline risk, which caused the market to hit a bit of a banana peel in the final weeks of the quarter,” per a Market Watch article citing Matthew Bartolini, Head of SPDR Americas Research at State Street Global Advisors.U.S. small-cap funds and international ex-US funds saw inflows in the month, with $2.84 billion and $5.5 billion flowing in, respectively. “The inflows into international and small-cap funds shows that investors were just reducing their large-cap exposure, they weren’t shying away from ETFs in general,” per Matthew Bartolini.Let us now discuss some ETFs that witnessed volatile fund flows in March.SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY  -  Free Report)This fund is the most popular ETF traded in the U.S. markets.

87,NKTR,"Nektar Therapeutics' (NKTR  -  Free Report) shares increased more than 11% on Feb 14 after the company announced a global strategic collaboration agreement with Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY  -  Free Report). Per the agreement, both companies will jointly develop and commercialize the lead immuno-oncology candidate, NKTR-214, of the former in combination with the latter’s Opdivo (nivolumab) and Opdivo plus Yervoy (ipilimumab).Pursuant to the contract, Nektar is entitled to receive an upfront payment of $1.85 billion, which includes a payment of $1 billion in cash and an equity investment of $850 million. Nektar will also get an additional $1.78 billion potential payment on achievement of certain developmental and sale-based milestones.Both Nektar and Bristol-Myers will share profits in the respective ratios of 65% and 35% from the potential sales of NKTR-214, worldwide.On a positive note, Nektar not only retains its ownership of the candidate but can also continue to collaborate with other companies for its further development. While Nektar will jointly commercialize NKTR-214/Opdivo combinations in the United States as well as major markets in the EU and Japan, Bristol-Myers is entitled to solely commercialize the combinations in the other global markets.We remind investors that Nektar is already evaluating NKTR-214/Opdivo in phase I/II PIVOT studies across five tumor types (melanoma, kidney, colorectal, bladder and non-small cell lung cancer) and eight potential indications. With this latest deal with Bristol Myers, it has been agreed upon by both companies to evaluate NKTR-214/Opdivo and NKTR-214/Opdivo plus Yervoy combinations in more than 20 cancer indications across nine tumor types.In November 2017, the two companies reported a positive interim data from dose-escalation part of the study, evaluating the safety and efficacy of the combo therapy on patients with melanoma, renal cell carcinoma and non-small cell lung cancers.Nektar's shares have significantly outperformed the industry in a year's time. The stock has skyrocketed 513.2% compared with the industry’s 0.4% increase. Importantly, Nektar is also conducting a phase I/II PROPEL study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of NKTR-214 in combination with Roche's (RHHBY  -  Free Report) Tecentriq (atezolizumab) and Merck's (MRK  -  Free Report) Keytruda (pembrolizumab). Notably, this PROPEL study complements the company’s ongoing PIVOT trial.Additionally, in May 2017, Nektar had entered into a research collaboration with Takeda Pharmaceuticals to explore the combination of NKTR-214 with five oncology compounds from Takeda’s cancer portfolio.Nektar Therapeutics Price Nektar Therapeutics Price | Nektar Therapeutics Quote Zacks RankNektar carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

89,NKTR,"On Jan 16, 2018, we issued an updated report on Nektar Therapeutics (NKTR  -  Free Report), a biopharmaceutical company, focused on developing treatments and utilizing PEGylation plus advanced polymer conjugate technology platforms.The company’s portfolio comprises two drugs — Movantik for opioid-induced constipation (OIC) and Adynovate for treating hemophilia A. Both drugs are showing impressive performance.Nektar shares a global license agreement with AstraZeneca (AZN  -  Free Report) which granted the latter worldwide, exclusive rights to develop, market and sell Movantik as well as fixed-dose combination products.The company also has a licensing, collaboration and manufacturing contract with Shire plc (SHPG  -  Free Report) for Adynovate. It receives royalties and sales milestones related to both the drugs. These licensing agreements are expected to provide regular funds to the company.Nektar’s shares have substantially outperformed the industry in a year, skyrocking 466.6% while the industry has registered a rise of 10.4%.  We are pleased with Nektar's efforts to build its pipeline. The company has a robust pipeline of early and late-stage candidates. Nektar has made a significant progress with its lead candidate Onzeald (formerly known as NKTR-102), currently under accelerated assessment in the EU for treating adults with advanced breast cancer as well as brain metastases. A response is anticipated within the first half of 2018.Nektar has also initiated a randomized phase III confirmatory study (ATTAIN) on Onzeald compared with the single-agent chemotherapy of the respective physician’s choice. The trial is being conducted on patients with advanced breast cancer, who shortly complain of brain metastases. Positive results from this evaluation could support a regulatory filing in the United States.The company is further developing several other candidates across important therapeutic areas including oncology, pain, anti-infectives and immunology. Interesting ones include NKTR-181 (phase III – chronic pain), NKTR-214 (phase I/II – solid tumor) and NKTR-358 (phase I-autoimmune disease).We remind investors that in July 2017, Nektar had announced positive top-line results from an oral human abuse potential study on NKTR-181 in order to assess the abuse potential compared with oxycodone. Notably, the FDA granted a Fast Track designation to the NKTR-181 development program.Successful development and commercialization of these candidates will in turn drive the company’s revenues, considering the lucrative markets they target.Importantly, Nektar entered into a co-development deal with Eli Lilly and Company (LLY  -  Free Report) for NKTR-358 last July. Pursuant to this agreement, Nektar will be responsible for completing the ongoing phase I study on the candidate. However, going forward, with the phase II trial on the same, Lilly will be capturing 75% of the total costs, which should further lower Nektar’s development expenses on NKTR-358.However, Nektar’s proprietary market products as well as its underdeveloped candidates are subject to stiff competition from various other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies.The company is expected to face intense rivalry in the pain market with several manufacturers developing pain therapies. Competitors include Collegium Pharmaceutical’s Xtampza and Teva Pharmaceutical’s naproxen to name a few. Also, players in PEGylation and polymer conjugate chemistry technology space are Biogen, Savient Pharmaceuticals, Dr. Reddy’s and Novo Nordisk among others.Nektar’s heavy reliance on partners for revenues still remains a huge concern, since partnership-related setbacks may seriously weigh on the company.Nektar Therapeutics Price Nektar Therapeutics Price | Nektar Therapeutics Quote Zacks RankNektar carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

90,NKTR,"Shares of Nektar Therapeutics (NKTR  -  Free Report) have skyrocketed almost 368% this year so far, substantially outperforming the industry’s increase of 8.2%. Let’s analyze the factors that led to this massive rally.Nektar’s rapid progress on a robust pipeline this year including several study initiations with positive readouts and strategic collaborations has driven its share price consistently.The company’s PEGylation technology has facilitated development of its several approved products in the United States and the EU through partnerships with healthcare companies namely, AstraZeneca's (AZN  -  Free Report) Movantik, UCB's Cimzia and Amgen's (AMGN  -  Free Report) Neulasta among others.Notably, a randomized phase III confirmatory study (ATTAIN) began on the company’s lead candidate, Onzeald, late last year. The trial compares Onzeald with the single-agent chemotherapy of physician’s choice in patients with advanced breast cancer having brain metastases shortly. Positive results from the program could support a regulatory filing in the United States.Apart from Onzeald, Nektar is working on developing other candidates. In September, the company announced initiation of phase I/II PROPEL study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of NKTR-214 in combination with Roche's Tecentriq (atezolizumab) and Merck's (MRK  -  Free Report) Keytruda (pembrolizumab).A phase I/II trial, evaluating NKTR-214 as a potential combination treatment regimen with Bristol-Myers Squibb’s Opdivo, is also underway. The candidate is being examined across five tumor types (melanoma, kidney, colorectal, bladder and non-small cell lung cancer) and eight potential indications.In November, the company announced positive data from the study for treating patients with melanoma, renal cell carcinoma and non-small cell lung cancers.Significantly in May, the company entered into a research collaboration with Takeda Pharmaceuticals to explore the combination of NKTR-214 with five oncology compounds from Takeda’s cancer portfolio.Another candidate, NKTR-181, is being examined in a phase III program for treatment of chronic pain. In July, the company reported positive top-line findings from an oral human abuse potential study, analysing NKTR-181, to assess the opioid abuse potential compared with oxycodone. The company is planning to submit a new drug application for the candidate by April 2018.Meanwhile, in March, the company initiated a phase I clinical study, evaluating NKTR-358, to treat a wide range of auto-immune diseases and inflammatory disorders.Subsequently, in July, Nektar sealed a co-development deal with Elly Lilly and Company for NKTR-358. Pursuant to this agreement, the company will own responsibility for completing the ongoing phase I study on the candidate. Both the companies will share phase II development costs with Lilly acquiring the lion share (75%) of the total expenses.Successful development and commercialization of undertrial candidates will boost the company’s top line, considering the lucrative markets they are targeting.Nektar carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

This is because the disease is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality across the world preceded only by heart disease.The five-day ASCO conference in Chicago, which is basically the most important annual cancer research event, concluded yesterday. The conference featured clinical updates from several companies about the latest developments in treating the disease.Merck (MRK  -  Free Report) stole the limelight at ASCO after presenting data from several cancer studies of its PD-L1 inhibitor, Keytruda.The data presentation from Merck, which garnered the most attention from physicians and investors was from a second interim analysis of a pivotal lung cancer study on Keytruda — phase III KEYNOTE-407 study. The study evaluated Keytruda in combination with chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of metastatic squamous NSCLC, which is a difficult-to-treat lung cancer patient population. The data from the study showed that the combination of Keytruda plus chemotherapy led to significant improvement in both overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival regardless of PD-L1 expression. PD-L1 is a protein present on the surface of cells.The risk of death (OS) was reduced by 36% compared to chemotherapy alone. The PFS improvement was nearly half for patients in the Keytruda combination group compared with chemotherapy alone.The data was termed “practice changing” by CNBC – changing the way doctors look at prescribing these drugs to cancer patients. It further cemented Merck’s position in the lung cancer market, which is the most lucrative oncology sector.In this context, we must mention that Roche (RHHBY  -  Free Report) also presented data from a similar late-stage study, which showed that Tecentriq (atezolizumab) plus chemotherapy reduced the risk of disease worsening or death (PFS) by 29% in advanced squamous NSCLC patients versus chemotherapy alone.Coming back to Merck, the company also presented data from another pivotal lung cancer study (KEYNOTE-042) evaluating Keytruda monotherapy in first-line NSCLC patients with PD-L1 expression of at least 1%. This study also showed that treatment with Keytruda led to improved survival. Meanwhile, four and five years follow-up data presented from two advanced melanoma studies showed that treatment with Keytruda led to long-term survival benefit. Interim data from a cohort of a phase II study, KEYNOTE-158, evaluating Keytruda as a monotherapy in patients with previously treated advanced small cell lung cancer (SCLC) demonstrated encouraging response rates in the overall population of SCLC patients as well as in patients whose tumors express PD-L1.Meanwhile, Keytruda also demonstrated encouraging ORR in studies evaluating the Lenvima/Keytruda combination in four different tumor types and Keytruda monotherapy for the first-line treatment of advanced clear cell RCC. Merck & partner AstraZeneca also presented positive Lynparza combo data in breast cancer. Shares of Merck have gone up by more than 3% since Friday, Jun 1 on ASCO strength.Nektar Therapeutics (NKTR  -  Free Report) was the biggest loser at ASCO. Nektar along with partner Bristol-Myers (BMY  -  Free Report), presented preliminary data from a mid-stage study evaluating NKTR-214 in combination with Bristol-Myers’ PD-L1 inhibitor Opdivo in several tumor types. The response rates in melanoma and kidney cancer patients did not impress investors, resulting in a 42% fall in Nektar’s stock on Jun 4, which was probably the worst performance by an S&P 500 Index member in the last five years. (Read more: Nektar and Bristol-Myers Present Data on Cancer Study).Merck, Bristol-Myers and Nektar currently have a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Bristol-Myers also presented data on Opdivo at ASCO. In a late-stage study evaluating Opdivo versus Yervoy in a broad range of patients with resected stage III or IV melanoma, Opdivo demonstrated sustained, superior recurrence-free survival versus Yervoy. In the study, Opdivo plus chemotherapy showed improved PFS versus chemotherapy in first-line lung cancer patients with PD-L1 expression <1%.Celgene (CELG  -  Free Report) and partner Bluebird Bio presented early-stage data for the CAR-T cell therapy bb2121 in patients with late-stage relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma. Though the study showed a median PFS of 11.8 months in this heavily pre-treated patient population, the data did not impress investors.Celgene also presented data on another CAR-T therapy - liso-ce (JCAR017) - which it acquired from its acquisition of Juno earlier this year. The data showed that at six months, 49% of the patients with relapsed/refractory aggressive B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) remained in remission while 46% maintained a complete response. (Read more: Celgene Presents Data on CAR T Therapy, Revlimid & Pomalyst)Novartis (NVS  -  Free Report) announced positive data from a combination study on breast cancer drug Kisqali and from two long-term leukemia studies on Tasigna. (Read More: Novartis Announces Positive Data on Kisqali and Tasigna).AbbVie (ABBV  -  Free Report) presented early data from a phase II study evaluating a combination of its cancer drugs Imbruvica plus Venclexta (venetoclax) for the first-line treatment of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).  The data demonstrated high rates of responses in such patients. Also, interim data from a late-stage study evaluating Imbruvica plus Roche’s Rituxan in Waldenström’s macroglobulinemia, a rare form of Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, showed that the combination significantly reduced the risk of disease progression or death by 80% compared to placebo plus Rituxan.Pfizer, Amgen, AstraZeneca and J&J also made some cancer data presentations at the meeting.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

93,NKTR,"Investors in Nektar Therapeutics (NKTR  -  Free Report) need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Dec 15, 2017 $20 Put had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Nektar shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Nektar is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Medical - Drugs industry that ranks in the Top 40% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, three analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while one analyst has dropped the estimates. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from a loss of 19 cents per share to a loss of 34 cents in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Nektar right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Often times, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Each week, our very own Dave Bartosiak gives his top options trades.

94,NKTR,"Shares of Nektar Therapeutics (NKTR  -  Free Report) have been up almost 306% this year so far, substantially outperforming the industry’s increase of 3.9% during the period. Let’s analyze the factors that led to this massive rally.Nektar’s rapid progress on a robust pipeline this year including several study initiations and strategic collaborations, has pushed up its share price consistently.The company’s PEGylation technology has facilitated development of its several approved products in the United States and the EU through partnerships with healthcare companies namely, AstraZeneca's (AZN  -  Free Report) Movantik, UCB's Cimzia and Amgen's (AMGN  -  Free Report) Neulasta, among others.Notably, a randomized phase III confirmatory study (ATTAIN) began on the company’s lead candidate, Onzeald, late last year. The trial compares Onzeald with a single-agent chemotherapy of physician’s choice in the patients with advanced breast cancer, having brain metastases shortly. Positive results from the program could support a regulatory filing in the United States.Apart from Onzeald, Nektar is working on developing other candidates. In September, the company announced initiation of phase I/II PROPEL study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of NKTR-214 in combination with Roche's Tecentriq (atezolizumab) and Merck's (MRK  -  Free Report) Keytruda (pembrolizumab).A phase I/II study, evaluating NKTR-214 as a potential combination treatment regimen with Bristol-Myers Squibb’s Opdivo, is also underway. The candidate is being examined across five tumor types (melanoma, kidney, colorectal, bladder and non-small cell lung cancer) and eight potential indications.Notably in May, the company entered into a research collaboration with Takeda Pharmaceuticals to explore the combination of NKTR-214 with five oncology compounds from Takeda’s cancer portfolio.Another candidate, NKTR-181, is being examined in a phase III study for treatment of chronic pain. In July, the company reported positive top-line results from an oral human abuse potential (HAP) study, evaluating NKTR-181, to assess the opioid abuse potential compared with oxycodone. The company is planning to submit a new drug application (NDA) for the candidate by April 2018.Meanwhile, in March, the company initiated a phase I clinical study, evaluating NKTR-358, to treat a wide range of auto-immune diseases and inflammatory disorders.Subsequently, in July, Nektar entered into a co-development deal with Elly Lilly and Company for NKTR-358. Pursuant to the agreement, the company will be responsible for completing the ongoing phase I study on the candidate. Both companies will share phase II development costs with Lilly capturing the lion share (75%) of the total costs.Successful development and commercialization of these candidates will boost the company’s top line, considering the lucrative markets they are targeting.Nektar carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

95,NKTR,"Nektar Therapeutics ((NKTR  -  Free Report) and Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY  -  Free Report) announced preliminary data from the ongoing PIVOT phase I/II study at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) annual meeting. The study is evaluating the combination of Nektar's lead immuno-oncology candidate, NKTR-214 with Bristol-Myers Squibb's Opdivo (nivolumab).  The company presented data for patients enrolled in the phase I dose-escalation stage of the study and for the first patients consecutively enrolled in select dose expansion cohorts in phase II.   The PIVOT study showed that pre-specified efficacy criteria were achieved in three tumor types: first-line melanoma, first-line renal cell carcinoma (a type of kidney cancer) and first-line urothelial cancer. Both the companies plan to commence a phase III registrational study in first-line advanced melanoma patients in the third quarter of 2018, and pivotal studies are also being designed in renal cell carcinoma and urothelial cancer.  If the efficacy criteria at the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) is met in the first stage (N1) of patients consecutively enrolled or in the second stage (N1 + N2) of patients consecutively enrolled, the combination regimen would be advanced to registrational trials in that tumor type.   Results in treatment-naïve patients with Stage IV metastatic melanoma showed that the objective response rate (ORR) in the first part of the study was 85% in 13 treated subjects, while responses were observed in 50% of 28 patients in stage two of the study.Further, data showed that in treatment-naïve patients with Stage IV metastatic renal cell carcinoma-, the ORR in stage one of the study was 64% in 11 patients, while responses were seen in 46% of 26 patients in the second phase of the study. Finally, results in treatment-naïve patients with Stage IV metastatic urothelial carcinoma showed that the ORR in the first part of the study was 60% in 10 patients, with the same response rate in both PD-L1 negative patients and in those with PD-L1 positive tumours.The companies added that enrolment is also continuing in the second stage of the PIVOT trial with over 400 patients with melanoma, renal cell, urothelial, non-small-cell lung and triple negative breast cancers. The companies added that overall in the study, at week three, 53% of 17 patients with a PD-L1 negative status at baseline were converted to PD-L1 positive status. Results showed that of these subjects, 78% achieved either stable disease, partial response or a complete response.Shares of the company were down by more than 40% as the response rates in melanoma and kindney cancer studies were below market expectations.       The companies believe that NKTR-214 in combination with Opdivo can potentially expand the treatment benefits we can bring to patients with cancer. The companies added that enrolment is also continuing in the second stage of the PIVOT trial with over 400 patients with melanoma, renal cell, urothelial, non-small-cell lung and triple negative breast cancers.Shares of Nektar have decreased 33.3% year to date, compared with the industry’s gain of 3%.We note that, Opdivo, became the first PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor to gain regulatory approval in July 2014. It is currently approved in several countries including the United States, the EU and Japan for several cancer indications. Opdivo became the first PD-1 inhibitor to be approved for a hematological malignancy — classical Hodgkin lymphoma in both the United States (May 2016) and the EU (November 2016).In November 2016, Opdivo gained FDA approval for the treatment of patients with recurrent or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck with disease progression on or after platinum-based therapy.We also note that in February 2018, Nektar inked an agreement with Bristol-Myers Squibb to jointly develop and commercialize NKTR-214 in combination with the Bristol-Myers Squibb's Opdivo and Opdivo plus Yervoy (ipilimumab) in more than 20 indications across 9 tumor types.Nektar is also conducting a phase I/II PROPEL study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of NKTR-214 in combination with Roche's (RHHBY  -  Free Report) Tecentriq (atezolizumab) and Merck's (MRK  -  Free Report) Keytruda (pembrolizumab). Notably, this PROPEL study complements the company’s ongoing PIVOT trial.Stocks That Warrant a LookNektar carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

96,NKTR,"Nektar Therapeutics (NKTR  -  Free Report) announced initiation of phase I/II PROPEL study to evaluate efficacy and safety of its lead immuno-oncology candidate, NKTR-214, in combination with Roche's (RHHBY  -  Free Report) Tecentriq (atezolizumab) and Merck's (MRK  -  Free Report) Keytruda (pembrolizumab).Notably, the checkpoint inhibitor, Tecentriq, is approved for the treatment of metastatic urothelial carcinoma in the United States and Keytruda was recently approved for refractory classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) in both the United States and the EU.Nektar’s shares have significantly outperformed the industry so far this year. The stock has surged 78.2%, much above the broader industry’s 4% increase.The PROPEL study complements Nektar’s ongoing PIVOT trial under which, NKTR-214 is being evaluated in combination with Bristol-Myers' (BMY  -  Free Report) Opdivo (nivolumab) across five tumor types (melanoma, kidney, colorectal, bladder and non-small cell lung cancer) and eight potential indications in phase I/II studies. The PROPEL study is aimed at establishing synergy of NKTR-214 when combined with either Tecentriqor Keytruda.The study will be conducted into two separate arms with 30 patients in each. The first arm will evaluate the combination of NKTR-214 with Tecentriq dose regimen of every three weeks in patients adhering to approved treatment settings of Tecentriq, including patients with non-small cell lung cancer or bladder cancer. On the other hand, the second arm will assess dose regimen of NKTR-214 in combination with Keytruda per three weeks in approved treatment settings of Keytruda including patients with melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer or bladder cancer.Per the company, these combination therapies could provide cancer patients suffering from multiple tumor types with new treatment options combined with approved checkpoint inhibitor therapies.Apart from NKTR-214, another interesting candidate in the company’s portfolio is Onzeald, currently under accelerated assessment in the EU for treating adults with advanced breast cancer having brain metastases. However, in July 2017, Nektar filed a request for re-examination of the negative opinion adopted by CHMP on the same.Meanwhile, Nektar initiated a randomized phase III confirmatory study (ATTAIN) on Onzeald, compared with single-agent chemotherapy of the physician’s choice in patients with advanced breast cancer having brain metastases shortly. Positive results from the study could support a regulatory filing in the United States.Other pipeline candidates in the company’s portfolio include NKTR-181 (mu-opioid analgesic candidate for chronic pain conditions; phase III) and NKTR-358 (autoimmune disease; phase I).Successful development and commercialization of these candidates will boost the company’s top line considering the lucrative markets they are targeting.Nektar Therapeutics Price Nektar Therapeutics Price | Nektar Therapeutics QuoteZacks RankNektar currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Further, growth stocks have a higher level of volatility associated with them. Compared to value stocks, growth stocks are a safer bet in a strong bull market, but don't perform as strongly in almost all other financial environments.CostsWhen considering an ETF's total return, expense ratios are an important factor, and cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive counterparts in the long term if all other factors remain equal.Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.20%, making it one of the cheaper products in the space.It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 0.59%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsWhile ETFs offer diversified exposure, which minimizes single stock risk, a deep look into a fund's holdings is a valuable exercise.

(GRUB  -  Free Report) and Sage Therapeutics Inc. (SAGE  -  Free Report).The top 10 holdings account for about 6.4% of total assets under management.Performance and RiskVTWG seeks to match the performance of the Russell 2000 Growth Index before fees and expenses. The Russell 2000 Growth Index measures the performance of those Russell 2000 companies with higher price/book ratios and higher predicted and historical growth rates.The ETF has gained about 6.82% so far this year and was up about 21.03% in the last one year (as of 05/16/2018). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $116.93 and $145.53.The ETF has a beta of 1.14 and standard deviation of 17.10% for the trailing three-year period, making it a high risk choice in the space. With about 1194 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.AlternativesVanguard Russell 2000 Growth ETF carries a Zacks ETF Rank of 3 (Hold), which is based on expected asset class return, expense ratio, and momentum, among other factors.

While Vanguard Small-Cap Growth ETF has $7.63 B in assets, iShares Russell 2000 Growth ETF has $10.01 B.

101,NKTR,"Nektar Therapeutics (NKTR  -  Free Report) reported a loss of 60 cents per share for the first quarter of 2018, which was wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 52 cents and the year-ago figure of 42 cents due to higher R&D costs.Nektar’s stock was up 2.8% on May 11 following the earnings release. Shares of Nektar have outperformed the industry so far this year. The stock has risen 33% while the industry is up 0.6%.Quarterly revenues soared 53.8% from the year-ago period to $38 million. This upside can mainly be attributed to a $10 million milestone payment under the collaboration agreement with Shire plc (SHPG  -  Free Report) related to the approval of hemophilia drug, Adynovi, in Europe. The top line came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Quarter in DetailThe top line comprised product sales, royalty revenues, non-cash royalty revenues besides license, collaboration and other revenues.In the first quarter, product sales rose 32.4% to $6.3 million from $4.8 million a year ago.  Moreover, non-cash royalty revenues increased 3.9% to $6.9 million.The company reported royalty revenues of $11.1 million in the quarter under review, registering an improvement of 53.5% from $7.2 million a year ago.License, collaboration and other revenues came in at $13.7 million compared with $6.1 million in the prior year, an upside of 125.3%.Research and development (R&D) expenses escalated 62.8% to $99.4 million, primarily due to investments in pipeline including key candidates NKTR-358, NKTR-214 and NKTR-181.General and administrative (G&A) expenses were up 56% to $18.7 million in the reported quarter primarily due to higher stock-based compensation.Pipeline UpdateThe company received a major boost in February when it announced a global strategic collaboration agreement with Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY  -  Free Report). Per the agreement, the companies will jointly develop and commercialize Nektar’s lead immuno-oncology candidate, NKTR-214, in combination with Bristol-Myers’ Opdivo (nivolumab) and Opdivo plus Yervoy (ipilimumab).Moreover, pursuant to the contract, the company received $1.0 billion in upfront payment and proceeds of $850 million from share purchase in April.In the same month, Nektar began dosing in a phase I/II study – REVEAL – to evaluate a combination of its two candidates NKTR-262, a toll-like receptor agonist, and NKTR-214, an immuno-stimulatory CD122-biased agonist, in advanced or metastatic solid tumor cancers.Moreover, the company has also collaborated with Takeda to develop NKTR-214 in combination with the latter’s TAK-659, a dual SYK and FLT-3 inhibitor, in liquid and solid tumors. First study under this collaboration is expected to start in the second half of 2018, which will evaluate the combination in non-Hodgkin lymphoma.In May, Nektar initiated a dose ranging phase Ib study to evaluate NKTR-358, a regulatory T cell stimulator, in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus, an autoimmune disease. The company has a worldwide license agreement with Eli Lilly (LLY  -  Free Report) related to the development of NKTR-358.Apart from these, the company’s pipeline includes two late stage candidates, Onzeald and NKTR-181.Onzeald is currently under evaluation in a phase III (ATTAIN) study for the treatment of adults with advanced breast cancer, having brain metastases. The company is developing NKTR-181 for the treatment of chronic pain.

102,NKTR,"Nektar Therapeutics’ (NKTR  -  Free Report) shares have declined almost 9% since Aug 8 after the company reported second-quarter results. The biotech reported a wider-than-expected loss while sales missed estimates.Nektar’s second-quarter 2017 loss of 39 cents per share was wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 35 cents. This reported loss was also wider than the year-ago loss of 36 cents per share.Nektar’s shares have significantly outperformed the industry so far this year. The company’s shares have surged 46.3% while the industry has registered a decrease of 4.1%.Quarterly revenues rose 5.5% to $34.6 million from the year-ago quarter. This increase in revenues can mainly be attributed to the rise in product sales and royalty revenues. However, the top line missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $36 million.Quarter in DetailThe top line comprised product sales, royalty revenues, non-cash royalty revenues, license, collaboration and other revenues.In the second quarter, product sales increased 21.7% to $15.7 million from $12.9 million a year ago. However, non-cash royalty revenues decreased 18.5% to $6.6 million.The company reported royalty revenues of $7.4 million, registering a huge improvement of 111.4% in the second quarter compared with $3.5 million in the year-ago quarter. This was mainly thanks to royalty revenues from Movantik sales.License, collaboration and other revenues came in at $4.8 million, down 42.2% compared with $8.3 million a year ago. This fall in revenues can mainly be attributed to the recognition of $3.2 million, received from Daiichi Sankyo for the sublicense of Onzeald (formerly known as NKTR-102) in Europe in second-quarter 2016.Research and development (R&D) expenses climbed 15.1% to $60.3 million, primarily due to investments in pipeline, including key candidates, NKTR-358 and NKTR-181.General and administrative (G&A) expenses were up 45.5% to $16 million. This massive jump can mainly be attributed to a payment of $7 million for settlement of a litigation regarding a cross-license agreement with Enzon, Inc., a Florida-based pharma company.Pipeline UpdateThe most advanced candidate in the company’s portfolio is Onzeald, currently under accelerated assessment in the EU for treatment of adults with advanced breast cancer, having brain metastases. However, the company was informed last month by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) that it had adopted a negative opinion for the conditional marketing application for the candidate in the EU. Subsequently, in the same month, the company filed a request for examining the opinion adopted by the CHMP.Apart from Onzeald, another candidate in the company’s immuno-oncology portfolio is NKTR-214. A phase I/II study evaluating NKTR-214 as a potential combination treatment regimen with Bristol-Myers Squibb’s (BMY  -  Free Report) Opdivo is underway. During the second quarter, Nektar announced that it has started dosing patients in the trial and plans to enroll up to 260 patients in eight target cancer indications. The company expects to report initial data from the dose-escalation part of the study soon.Notably, in May, Nektar announced a research collaboration agreement with Japanese pharma company, Takeda Pharmaceuticals, to explore the combination of NKTR-214 with five oncology compounds from Takeda’s cancer portfolio.Last month, Nektar announced that it has entered into a strategic collaboration contract with Eli Lilly and Company (LLY  -  Free Report) to co-develop NKTR-358 (phase I study ongoing) for treatment of a number of autoimmune and other chronic inflammatory conditions.2017 Outlook UpdatedNektar raised its revenue outlook for 2017 to account for a $150 million upfront payment it expects to receive from Lilly. The company now estimates revenue in the range of $215-$225 million compared with $145-$155 million, projected previously.Driven by the same reason, Nektar also raised its expected cash position for the year ending 2017 with approximately $350 million compared with $225 million, estimated previously.Nektar Therapeutics Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseNektar Therapeutics Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Nektar Therapeutics QuoteZacks Rank & Key PicksNektar currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

103,NKTR,"On Aug 11, 2017, we issued an updated report on Nektar Therapeutics (NKTR  -  Free Report), a biopharmaceutical company, focused on development of treatments by utilizing PEGylation and advanced polymer conjugate technology platforms.Nektar’s shares have significantly outperformed the industry so far this year, having surged 48.9%, while the industry registered a decrease of 3.4%.The company’s portfolio comprises two drugs – Movantik for opioid-induced constipation (OIC) and Adynovate for treating hemophilia A.Nektar has a global license agreement with AstraZeneca (AZN  -  Free Report) under which, the latter was granted with a worldwide, exclusive, license to develop, market and sell rights for Movantik as well as fixed-dose combination products.The company also has a licensing, collaboration and manufacturing contract with Shire plc (SHPG  -  Free Report) for Adynovate. It receives royalties and sales milestones related to both the drugs.Also, Nektar has made a significant progress with its lead candidate, Onzeald (formerly known as NKTR-102), currently under accelerated assessment in the EU for treating adults with advanced breast cancer as well as brain metastases. A response is anticipated soon.Nektar has also initiated a randomized phase III confirmatory study (ATTAIN) on Onzeald, compared with the single-agent chemotherapy of physician’s choice. The trial is being conducted on patients with advanced breast cancer, who shortly complain of brain metastases. Positive results from this study could support a regulatory filing in the U.S.The company is further developing several other candidates across important therapeutic areas including oncology, pain, anti-infectives and immunology. Interesting ones include NKTR-181 (phase III – chronic pain), NKTR-214 (phase I/II – solid tumor) and NKTR-358 (phase I-autoimmune disease).We remind investors that in July, Nektar announced positive top-line results from an oral human abuse potential (HAP) study on NKTR-181 in order to assess the abuse potential compared with oxycodone. Notably, the FDA granted a Fast Track designation to the NKTR-181 development program.Successful development and commercialization of these candidates will in turn boost the company’s top line, considering the lucrative markets they are targeting.Importantly, Nektar entered into a co-development deal with Eli Lilly and Company (LLY  -  Free Report) for NKTR-358 this month. Pursuant to this agreement, Nektar will be responsible for completing the ongoing phase I study on the candidate. However, going forward with the phase II study on the same, Lilly will be capturing 75% of the total costs to possibly lower the company’s development expenses on NKTR-358.However, Nektar’s proprietary market products as well as the candidates under development are subject to stiff competition from various pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies.The company is expected to face intense rivalry in the pain market with several manufacturers developing pain therapies. Competitors include Collegium Pharmaceutical’s Xtampza and Teva Pharmaceutical’s naproxen to name a few. Also, players in PEGylation and polymer conjugate chemistry technology space are Biogen (BIIB), Savient Pharmaceuticals, Dr. Reddy’s and Novo Nordisk among others.Nektar’s heavy reliance on partners for revenues remains a concern, since partnership-related setbacks may seriously weigh on the company.Nektar Therapeutics Price and ConsensusNektar Therapeutics Price and Consensus | Nektar Therapeutics QuoteZacks RankNektar currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).
