43,CNP,"We're all income investors now. Or so it would seem given the massive surge in popularity for ETFs holding dividend stocks and certain bonds.Income investing has grown beyond its traditional fan base: retirees or Americans planning for retirement. Stuck between low bond yields and low portfolio returns, investors in exchange traded funds are discovering afresh the appeal of companies that deliver equity income.Most dividend ETFs invest in a subset of dividend payers on the stock market: either high yielders or dividend growers. One suite of ETFs takes a different tack. It invests in every dividend payer in a target slice of the U.S. market.In the summer of 2006, WisdomTree (WETF) launched its first family of 20 ETFs that pioneered dividend weighting.As they turn 10, most funds in this suite are outperforming both dividend peers and comparable cap-weighted benchmarks. For example, the $1.95 billion WisdomTree MidCap Dividend (DON) has produced an average annual return of 9.5% over the past 10 years vs. 9.1% for SPDR S&P MidCap (MDY).It also has outperformed every other dividend-paying equity ETF with a 10-year history except for First Trust Value Line Dividend (FVD), which averaged a 10.5% gain over that period.WisdomTree LargeCap Dividend (DLN) and WisdomTree SmallCap Dividend (DES) averaged a 7.5% and 7.8% gain, respectively, over the past decade.DON and its siblings invest in every U.S. dividend payer in their respective markets subject to minimum size and liquidity thresholds. Then stocks are weighted by the dollar value of the dividends each company pays, a strategy WisdomTree calls dividend weighting.Basically, a stock with a greater share of the entire dividend stream -- or the total amount of cash dividends paid by all the companies in the market -- gets a bigger weighting in the index.""Weighting stocks in the portfolio by dividends balances yield against market capitalization,"" Michael Rawson, a Morningstar analyst, wrote in a 2015 report on WisdomTree's large-cap dividend ETF. ""As a result, the portfolio isn't dominated by either low-yielding mega-cap stocks or very high-yielding, risky names.""The goal, said Luciano Siracusano, WisdomTree's chief investment strategist, is to give investors exposure to the broad asset classes while shifting the weight of stock holdings from market value to dividends. That approach has shown, in real time, to produce consistently higher risk-adjusted returns over time vs. traditional cap-weighted strategies, according to WisdomTree.While dividend-weighted strategies offer more downside protection as well as the potential for alpha, they may not capture all the stock market's upside in a very big up year. These ETFs also tend to have higher expense ratios than cap-weighted rivals.Bottom line: These ETFs can serve as alternatives to traditional, cap-weighted funds that track the large-cap Russell 1000 or S&P MidCap 400 or small-cap Russell 2000 indexes.Investors continue to search for yield as Brexit has all but nixed the odds of an U.S. interest-rate hike in 2016. So ""people may continue to pay up a little to own the dividend-paying part of the market,"" Siracusano said, noting that WisdomTree's small-cap dividend fund yields 2.9% -- nearly twice as much as the 10-year Treasury and Russell 2000.Dividend weighting has been especially effective in the less efficient markets -- midcaps and small caps. Both DON and DES track proprietary indexes that have outperformed their cap-weighted peers over each of the past one, three, five and 10 years, WisdomTree's research shows. That's especially impressive given that the vast majority of actively managed mutual funds struggle to outperform their cap-weighted benchmarks.And it shows that dividend-weighted strategies held up under extremely tough market conditions, such as the financial crisis of 2008-09.There's another benefit too.""You can squeeze more dividend income out of the market"" with WisdomTree's dividend-weighted ETFs than by using cap-weighted rivals, Siracusano said. CenterPoint Energy (CNP), a highly rated IBD utility stock, is the third largest of 391 holdings in WisdomTree's midcap dividend fund.

45,CNP,"There's been a lot of hand-wringing lately that the iconic S&P 500 has gone more than a year without marking a new all-time high.Don't despair. You're a smart ETF investor who spots opportunities even when others agonize that stocks are stuck in a rut.The geniuses at indexing shops don't just offer products that track a broad basket of assets, such as the S&P 500 for U.S. large caps and the Russell 2000 for U.S. small caps.They also slice and dice those indexes into finer segments with the aim of boosting returns or reducing risk. Sometimes they aim to do both.To achieve these aims, they may screen stocks for ""factors"" or characteristics such as low volatility or high quality.Several exchange traded funds tracking indexes based on the S&P 500 have scored all-time highs recently. They're not only outperforming the bellwether SPDR S&P 500 (SPY), but also attracting gobs of new investor money.PowerShares S&P 500 High Dividend Low Volatility (SPHD), ProShares S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats (NOBL) and PowerShares S&P 500 Quality (SPHQ) made all-time highs April 27.PowerShares S&P 500 Low Volatility (SPLV) did the same on May 10, with PowerShares S&P 500 ex-Rate Sensitive Low Volatility (XRLV) following suit on May 11.SPHD ""cherry-picks the market rather than delivering the whole basket,"" according to industry research firm ETF.com. It invests in the 50 least risky, highest yielding stocks in the S&P 500. That indexing method skews it toward defensive sectors such as utilities.CenterPoint Energy (CNP) is a top-five stock holding. The stock is trading near a 52-week high as investors have favored the defensive cast and income potential of the utility sector this choppy year.This ETF has outperformed SPY both year-to-date and over the past three years. It's up 9.6% in 2016 through May 23 vs. a 1.2% gain for its better-known S&P 500 peer.SPHD also saw $805 million in net inflow over the first four months of the year. By comparison, SPY leaked $1 billion.ProShares S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats holds 50 stocks from the parent index that have hiked dividend payments for at least 25 consecutive years. It then equal-weights those holdings, which accounts for a big midcap stake.Irish medical device maker Medtronic (MDT) is one of the ""dividend aristocrats"" in the portfolio. The company makes heart valve products just as an IBD Leaderboard aristocrat, Edwards Lifesciences (EW), does.NOBL has advanced 6.4% year to date, while absorbing a net $633.7 million from January through April.Despite the ""dividend"" in its name, NOBL yields a relatively modest 1.9%. That's less than 2.10% for SPY and 3.33% for SPHD.

88,CNP,"Xcel Energy Inc. (XEL  -  Free Report) received the approval from Federal Aviation Administration (“FAA”) to use drones beyond the operators’ vision and utilize them to survey the transmission lines and perform other operations that require consistent monitoring.Over the past three years, Xcel Energy is using drones in their coal-fired plants to inspect equipments. In 2017, the company got the approval from FAA to use them for power lines inspection, within the operator’s vision. Following the approval, Xcel Energy will deploy the drones for the survey of their transmission line in Denver area. The company plans to seek further permission from FAA to inspect its 320,000 miles of electricity and natural gas infrastructure located in different regions.Technology to Boost Operations    Xcel Energy operates in eight Western and Midwestern States. Half of the states are tornado prone areas. The electric transmission and distribution lines as well as natural gas pipelines are expected to be weather resistant. Proper maintenance and repair of infrastructure enables the company to provide 24x7 services amid difficult climatic conditions. Drones ensure early detection of faults and damages of the electric transmission and distribution lines, which lower chances of outages and increase reliability of services.However, the drones will not replace previous modes of inspection and detection. The company believes that drones have advantages over trucks, helicopters or fixed-wing aircraft.  The inspection of lines will be completed at a faster pace and lower related costs, which will benefit consumers.Drone used by PeersUtility companies are investing regularly to provide safe, clean and reliable service to customers. Additionally, the companies are adopting new technologies to maintain and inspect their expansive infrastructure. Usages of drones are yet to become common among all utility service providers in the United States. However, we have seen FirstEnergy Corporation (FE  -  Free Report) and PPL Corporation (PPL  -  Free Report) among others to use drones for the maintenance of infrastructure.Considering the advantage of drones over traditional methods of inspection and maintenance of essential electrical infrastructure, we expect to witness increasing usage of the same among other providers as well.    Price MovementIn the last 12 months, shares of Xcel Energy have returned 4.7% compared with its industry’s rise of 2.3%. Zacks Rank & Other Stock to ConsiderXcel Energy has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Investors can consider CenterPoint Energy (CNP  -  Free Report) from the same space, which flaunts a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

89,CNP,"Companhia Paranaense de Energia – COPEL  reported impressive results for the fourth quarter and full-year 2017. Its net earnings for the quarter totaled R$160.2 million ($49.3 million), marking an improvement over the net loss of R$271.1 million ($82.2 million) recorded in the year-ago quarter.The quarter’s earnings per share were R$0.37 versus the net loss per share of R$0.77 in the year-ago quarter. The American Depository Receipt (ADR) equivalent for fourth-quarter 2017 earnings was 11 cents, while that for the year-ago quarter’s loss was 23 cents.For 2017, the company’s net earnings grew 41.6% year over year to R$1,118.3 million ($350.6 million). On a per-share basis, earnings of R$3.78 showed an increase of 24.8% over the previous year, while its ADR equivalent was $1.18 versus 87 cents in 2016.Revenues Improve Y/YIn the fourth quarter, COPEL’s net operating revenues totaled R$3,910.7 million ($1,203.3 million), increasing 18.6% year over year.The top-line improvement was primarily driven by growth of 14.4% in electricity sales to final customers, 29.2% in electricity sales to distributors, 3.3% in sales derived from the use of main distribution and transmission grid, 10.3% in revenues from telecommunications and rise in gains from sectorial financial assets and liabilities.However, these positives were partially offset by the decline of 19.9% in construction revenues, 7.9% in sales derived from the distribution of piped gas and 34.4% in other operating revenues.For the full year, the company’s net operating revenues grew 7% year over year to R$14,024.6 million ($4,396.4 million).Electricity Sales WeakCOPEL’s electricity sales to final customers include Copel Distribuicao’s sales in the captive market and Copel Geracao e Transmissao’s sales in the free market.In the fourth quarter, COPEL’s electricity sales to final customers decreased 2% year over year to 6,124-gigawatt hours. The fall was due to the 10.9% decline in Industrial consumption segment, partially offset by growth of 3.5% in Residential, 0.3% in Commercial, 5.7% in Rural and 3% in Other segment.Expenses Increase, Margin Falls Y/YCOPEL’s operating costs and expenses in the fourth quarter totaled R$3,618.1 million ($1,113.3 million), increasing 6.5% year over year. As a percentage of net operating revenues, these expenses were at 92.5% versus 86.7% in the year-ago quarter.Increase in operating costs and expenses was due to the rise of 42.4% in costs related to electricity purchased for resale, 24.4% in charge of the main distribution and transmission grid, 32.3% in materials and supplies costs, 754.4% in costs related to materials and supplies for power electricity, 0.7% in natural gas and supplies costs, 3.4% rise in depreciation and amortization and 12.7% surge in other costs and expenses.However, the impact of higher costs and expenses was partially offset by a decline of 7.5% in personnel and management costs, 7.9% in costs related to pension and healthcare plans, 8.1% in third-party services costs, 55.6% in provision and reversals and 15.8% in construction costs.Adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) were R$665.8 million ($204.9 million), up 5.1% year over year. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 17% in the quarter versus 19.2% in the year-ago quarter.Balance Sheet & Cash FlowExiting the fourth quarter, COPEL had cash and cash equivalents of R$1,040.1 million ($314.2 million), down from R$1,305.4 million ($413.1 million) at the prior-quarter end. Loans, financing and debentures increased 18.6% sequentially to R$7,413.8 million ($2,239.8 million).In 2017, the company generated net cash of R$1,013.4 million ($317.7 million) from its operating activities, reflecting the year-over-year decline of 31.4%. Capital used for the addition of property, plant and equipment in the year decreased 6.1% year over year to R$1,205.5 million ($377.9 million).During the year, COPEL distributed approximately R$506.4 million ($158.7 million) as dividends and interest on equity.OutlookFor 2018, COPEL plans to use R$2,928.6 million in capital expenditures. Of the total, roughly R$743.6 million will be used for the Generation and Transmission business, R$790 million will be used for the Distribution business and R$340.2 million for the Telecommunications business. The rest will be utilized for improving other businesses.Market Capitalization & Key PicksCOPEL currently has roughly $2-billion market capitalization.

90,CNP,"Wall Street is off to a disastrous start in the second quarter. Major bourses tumbled into correction for the second time this year and closed below key technical levels. Elevated trade tensions between the United States and China along with weakness in large-cap tech stocks are cited to be the reasons for the free fall. The prospect of rising interest rates and lofty valuations are expected to trigger another stock market correction in the near term.Given the turmoil, investing in defensive companies seems prudent. Such stocks provide risk-adjusted returns, consistent dividend and steady earnings growth regardless of the state of the equity market.How Did the Benchmarks Perform?The S&P 500 finished 2.2% lower at 2,581.88 on Apr 2, down 10.1% from its record high in Jan 26. The broader index closed below its 200-day moving average for the first time since the U.K.’s vote for Brexit in June 2016. The Dow Jones also closed below the aforesaid technical level, indicating further downtrend in the near future.Unlike the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones, the Nasdaq somehow managed to avoid a correction but it did lose more than 10% from its record high attained in March. This leaves all the three major indices in negative territory for the year, while the CNNMoney’s Fear & Greed Index slipped further into “extreme fear” territory.Global Trade WarSelling in stocks intensified after China decided to impose tariffs on about 130 U.S. goods, including a 25% charge on U.S. pork and 15% on fruits. The world’s second largest economy retaliated against Trump’s plan to slap tariffs on Chinese steel and aluminum shipments.All these have not only weighed on U.S. meat producers as well as industrial stocks, investors panicked as a full-fledged trade war might deal a heavy blow to economies, resulting in widespread unemployment. It may also dent first-quarter corporate earnings results slated to release this month.Big Tech SelloffAdding to the downbeat tone is a sharp selloff in the technology sector. Investors remained concerned about tighter regulations for large tech companies. The sector took a beating following the backlash over Facebook, Inc’s (FB  -  Free Report) handling of user data. Everyone raised questions as to how Cambridge Analytica, which worked on Trump’s election campaign, had gained access to personal data on roughly 50 million Facebook users without their knowledge.Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report), in the meantime, slipped after Trump lashed out at the e-commerce company on its tax policy and subsequent effect on bricks-and-mortar retailers. Another tech major Intel Corporation (INTC  -  Free Report) took a beating after Apple Inc. decided to break away from the chip maker and make its own chips in its Mac computers as early as 2020.Electric car maker Tesla, Inc. (TSLA  -  Free Report) is also sinking after one of its driverless technology vehicles was involved in a fatal crash, while it recalled 123,000 Model S vehicles because of an issue related to a power steering component.Rate Hike FearsAmid all these, Jerome Powell-led Federal Reserve has hiked rates by a quarter-percentage point and projected a steeper path of rate hikes in 2019 and 2020.This hasn’t gone down well with investors as we all know that they had piled up on U.S. stocks with the notion that quantitative easing will help the domestic economy grow at a better rate than emerging economies like China. After all, rate hikes will raise borrowing costs, eventually denting corporate profits and affecting the U.S. economy.How to Prepare for the SetbackAs the markets seem to be plagued with widespread uncertainty, defensive stocks seem to be the safest investment option. Such stocks are generally non-cyclical, or companies whose business performance and sales are not highly correlated with the activities in the larger market. Their products are in constant demand irrespective of market volatility and such names include companies from the utilities and consumer staples sectors.Utilities are deemed defensive stocks as electricity, gas and water are essentials. Food, beverage and tobacco companies are true defensive plays as demand for such staple stocks remains unaltered during market gyrations.5 Solid ChoicesWe have, thus, selected five solid stocks from the aforementioned defensive sectors that boast a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).UtilitiesCenterPoint Energy, Inc. (CNP  -  Free Report) operates as a public utility holding company in the United States. The stock has a Zacks Rank #1 and a dividend yield of 4.2%.

91,CNP,"Duke Energy’s (DUK  -  Free Report) subsidiary Duke Energy Progress recently proposed to increase electricity rates for customers residing in North Carolina. If approved by the North Carolina Utilities Commission, residential customers will have to pay an additional $5.22 a month for availing services.Details of the Rate HikePer the terms of the proposal, the company aims to hike electric rates by 4.7% in the first four years and an additional 1.3% thereafter. As a result, the annualized bill for a residential customer will increase from the current rate of $10.8.27 per month to $113.49. This hike will also include an increase in the basic customer charge from $11.13 to $14.00 per month.The average net rate increase for the first four years will be 6.2% for residential customers, 5.1 % for the small general service group, 3.1 % for medium general service group and 3.6% for large general service group. After the fourth year, the rates are expected to change to 7.3% for the residential customer group, 6.1 % for the small general service group, 4.7 % for medium general service group and 5.6% for large general service group.Our ViewThe current rate request filing by the company is in sync with its aim of investing in and generating cleaner electricity by responsibly managing coal ash and improving energy reliability. This, in turn is likely to increase value for customers and shareholders for a smarter energy future.Usually, utility providers like Duke Energy files for rate increase to recover costs of investment and thereby extend operations and provide better services. The tax reform implemented by the U.S. government last December, set the stage for this utility’s increased rate base. Notably, lower tax rate and elimination of bonus depreciation resulting in lower deferred taxes increases the rate base. As a result, the company expects to witness higher rate base growth for the same level of capital it earlier used to spend, thereby resulting in substantial earnings growth.Notably, the company’s robust five-year capital plan and current plans of investing about $30 billion in electric utilities and infrastructural growth projects over the 2018-2022 time frame supports this notion. Webelieve such rate base increase, which in turn leads to notable earnings growth, will allow the company to duly achieve its long-term investment targets.Price MovementDuke Energy has lost 7.9% in the last 12 months, compared with the broader industry’s decline of 5.6%. The underperformance may have been caused by the potential volatility in market prices of fuel, electricity and other renewable energy commodities that could further create operational risks for the company.   Zacks Rank & Key PicksDuke Energy currently has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Some better-ranked stocks in the same industry include CenterPoint Energy (CNP  -  Free Report), NextEra Energy (NEE  -  Free Report) and Entergy Corporation (ETR  -  Free Report), all of them carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

92,CNP,"Alliant Energy Corporation (LNT  -  Free Report) is well positioned for long-term growth on strong economic development in its service areas, and ongoing investment in regulated natural gas and renewable energy assets.Alliant Energy has plans to invest nearly $5 billion during the 2018-2021 time frame. The company is successfully completing major construction projects on time and at or below budget. Constructive regulatory environment will enable the company to recover capital expenditures and thus improve earnings.Alliant Energy currently targets long-term annual earnings growth in the range of 5% to 7%. We expect Alliant Energy to keep up the good performance and achieve the earnings growth target on the back of a number of strategic initiatives undertaken by the company.Nearly 98% of the earnings of the company are generated from regulated operations. The regulated nature of Alliant Energy's operation provides strong earnings visibility, which has enabled the company to increase the annual dividend rate for more than a decade.Despite the strong positives, demand for the utility continues to vary with weather conditions, on which the company has no control. Milder summer and winter months could adversely impact earnings and performance of the company.Alliant Energy is subject to extensive environmental regulations at both federal and state levels. This could impact the company’s operations and its ability to recover costs from customers on a timely basis and hence the rate of return.Price MovementIn the past year, shares of Alliant Energy have lost 1.7% narrower than the industry's decline of 5.5%.Alliant Energy has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

101,CNP,"CenterPoint Energy Corp (CNP  -  Free Report) will release fourth-quarter 2017 results before the market opens on Feb 22.Last quarter, the company reported a negative earnings surprise of 4.88%. However, CenterPoint Energy outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing four quarters with an average beat of 6.42%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for the company prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayCenterPoint Energy witnessed increased customer count during third-quarter 2017, primarily driven by the acquisition of Atmos Energy Marketing (AEM). The AEM acquisition has been accretive to the company’s results as of Sep 30, 2017, which in turn bolstered its Energy Services segment’s growth. We expect the company’s fourth-quarter results to also benefit from the same.Per management, customer growth, rate relief, energy services and midstream segments are likely to drive CenterPoint Energy’s fourth-quarter performance.Major regions of CenterPoint Energy’s service territory witnessed warmer-than-normal winter during the fourth quarter. This led to lower expenditure for consumers which are likely to dent the company’s sales in the to-be-reported quarter.Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 30 cents for fourth-quarter earnings marks a 15.4% increase year over year, while revenue estimate of $2.15 billion hints at an improvement of almost 3.4%.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not show that CenterPoint Energy is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — for this to happen. This is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: CenterPoint Energy has an Earnings ESP of -7.29%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: CenterPoint Energy carries a Zacks Rank #2, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company’s negative Earnings ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.Conversely, we caution against Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.CenterPoint Energy, Inc.

104,CNP,"Electric utility firm Southern Company (SO  -  Free Report) is set to release its fourth-quarter 2017 results before the opening bell on Wednesday, Feb 21. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is a profit of 46 cents on revenues of $5,410 million.In the preceding three-month period, the Atlanta, GA-based service provider reported stronger-than-expected earnings due to robust performance of its wholesale unit and lower costs.As far as earnings surprises are concerned, the utility is on a solid footing, having gone past the Zacks Consensus Estimate thrice in the last four reports. This is depicted in the graph below:Southern Company (The) Price and EPS Surprise Southern Company (The) Price and EPS Surprise | Southern Company (The) QuoteInvestors are keeping their fingers crossed and hoping that Southern Company surpasses earnings estimate this time too. Let’s delve deeper and find out the factors impacting the results.Factors to Consider This QuarterA leading utility holding entity in the U.S., Southern Company dominates the power business across the Southeast. With a strong rate base growth and constructive regulation, we expect the firm to generate steady earnings.Also, with operations in a stable and growing industry, Southern Company has a steady stream of cash flow. The utility’s history of consistent dividend payments indicates its confidence in itself.We further believe that the AGL Resources acquisition will be accretive to Southern Company earnings.However, with customer growth tepid and likely to remain so for some time, sales might be affected. This together with a large base, might make it difficult for Southern Company to manage rates. Higher operating and maintenance expenses is another concern.The utility is also bearing the brunt of continued delays and cost overruns over two of its large construction projects — Vogtle and Kemper — which are again expected to weigh on Southern Company's fortunes.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Southern Company will beat estimates this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to be able to beat consensus estimates. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, for this company stands at +0.36%. A favorable Zacks ESP serves as a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise.Zacks Rank: However, Southern Company’s Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), when combined with a positive ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.As it is, we caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Ranks #4 and 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderWhile earnings beat looks uncertain for Southern Company, here are some utilities you may want to consider on the basis of our model, which shows that they have the right combination of elements to post earnings beat this quarter:CenterPoint Energy, Inc.

However, the company missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the past four quarters, the average earnings miss being 0.24%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayHurricane Irma led to wide-spread catastrophic losses in Florida during the third quarter of 2017. In relation to this, Duke Energy filed an application with the Florida Public Service Commission (“FPSC”) in December 2017, to recoup the expenses incurred to restore normalcy of utility services in the state post the hurricanePer this filing, the company has requested for a restoration cost recovery of $381 million and an additional $132 million to replenish its storm reserve account. However, the company believes that due to the latest federal tax reform, its customers’ electricity bill will no longer increase on FPSC approving it.Owing to these factors, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Duke Energy’s earnings of 91 cents reflects an improvement of 12.4% year over year, while sales are anticipated to rise 4% to $5.85 billion.However, adverse outcome from pending regulatory cases may negatively impact results. Notably, the company incurred expenses in relation to coal ash release which in turn may weigh on its financials.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Duke Energy will beat estimates this quarter.

However, DTE Energy surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing four quarters, the average beat being 3.81%.Let’s see how things are shaping up at the company prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayDuring the third-quarter earnings call, DTE Energy’s management announced that it expects to witness higher revenues from the company’s subsidiary DTE Gas in the fourth quarter, primarily driven by higher gas main renewal revenues at base rates. We expect the yet-to-be-reported quarter’s results to reflect this.However, the company’s service territories as a whole faced warmer-than-normal temperature in the fourth quarter, which in turn is expected to weigh down on revenues. In line with this, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for DTE Energy’s fourth-quarter revenues of $1.91 billion reflects a year-over-year decline of 33.7%.On a brighter note, banking on its stronger year-to-date results as of Sep 30, 2017, DTE Energy raised its 2017 bottom-line guidance.

In line with this, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Ameren’s fourth-quarter earnings of 33 cents per share reflects an annual growth of 153.9%.Moreover, we expect the company’s yet-to-be reported quarter’s result to duly reflect the increase in revenue recognition, resulting from the Future Energy Jobs Act.  Also the company expects to incur low interest expenses driven by the refinancing of debt in 2017, which is likely to get reflected in the upcoming results, partially.Further, the company’s service territories witnessed almost normal temperatures during the fourth quarter.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at break-even earnings in the to-be-reported quarter.Meanwhile, the company has a mixed earnings surprise history. Earnings lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the previous four quarters and surpassed the same in the remaining two quarters, with an average beat of 61.46%Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors Likely to Influence Q4 EarningsWe appreciate Cincinnati Bell’s efforts to transform itself from a legacy copper-based telecommunications company to an IT company with contemporary fiber assets, offering flexible data, video, voice and IP solutions to both consumer and business customers.In the Entertainment and Communications business, the company’s investments in Fioptics products helped it to witness revenue growth and subscriber addition in third-quarter 2017. In this regard, the introduction of MyTV through its Fioptics high-speed Internet service bodes well. Additionally, increased investments in strategic products, the creation of a new business division for small and mid-sized businesses as well as the development of its IT Services and Hardware division have raked in more profits. We expect to see a similar uptrend in the Fioptics Internet and video segment in the to-be-reported quarter.Its eero’s WiFi products should expand FTTH customer base. We appreciate the company’s decision to expand its call center base by hiring more workers. Buyout of OnX Enterprise Solutions will expand Cincinnati Bell’s network and enterprise IT services.However, in the past three months, the company’s shares have declined 20.4% compared with the industry’s decline of 0.9%. Cincinnati Bell continues to experience erosion in high-margin local access lines. Expansion and maintenance of its networks require significant capital expenditures. Intense competition in the company’s operational region can be a drag on the company’s pricing power, thereby putting pressure on its margins.Estimated Subscriber StatisticsThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Cincinnati Bell’s residential voice lines is 0.184 million for fourth-quarter 2017. The figure shows a decline from 0.188 million and 0.201 million in third-quarter 2017 and fourth-quarter 2016, respectively.Business voice lines estimates of 0.324 million are in line with the company’s reported figures in the previous quarter.Local access lines estimates of 0.507 million are lower than 0.512 million and 0.524 million in third-quarter 2017 and fourth-quarter 2016, respectively.Long-distance lines estimates of 0.262 million are pegged lower than 0.299 million and 0.317 million in third-quarter 2017 and fourth-quarter 2016, respectively.DSL internet subscribers are estimated to be 0.080 million, lower than 0.087 million and 0.106 million in third-quarter 2017 and fourth-quarter 2016, respectively.Fioptics internet customers estimates of 0.229 million are above 0.221 million and 0.198 million in third-quarter 2017 and fourth-quarter 2016, respectively.Fioptics video subscribers estimates of 0.146 million are higher than 0.144 million and 0.138 million in third-quarter 2017 and fourth-quarter 2016, respectively.

(ED  -  Free Report) to beat earnings expectation when it reports fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 15, after the closing bell.The company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the past four quarters, with an average beat of 0.06%.Why a Likely Positive SurpriseOur proven model shows that Consolidated Edison is likely to beat earnings this quarter. Notably, a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. Consolidated Edison possesses both these attributes, as mentioned below:Zacks ESP: Consolidated Edison has an Earnings ESP of +0.64%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Consolidated Edison currently carries a Zacks Rank #3, which along with a positive earnings ESP increases the chance of surprise prediction.Meanwhile, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisionsFactors at PlayOf late Consolidated Edison has been incorporating renewable energy in its grid at an increasing rate. As a result, its third-quarter results reflected higher revenues from renewable electric production projects. We expect the company’s fourth-quarter results to reflect the same.Consolidated Edison’s regulated based utilities provide it with a stable earnings base. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s fourth-quarter earnings of 78 cents per share reflects an improvement of 13% year over year.Moreover, the company's service territories witnessed colder-than-normal temperatures during the quarter. This is likely to result in higher household expenditure on heating and, in turn, will most likely boost the revenues for this energy provider. Consolidated Edison Inc Price and EPS Surprise  Consolidated Edison Inc Price and EPS Surprise | Consolidated Edison Inc Quote Other Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some other companies from the Zacks Utility sector you may want to consider as our model shows that these also have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:NiSource (NI  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +1.45% and a Zacks Rank #3.

113,CNP,"CMS Energy Corporation (CMS  -  Free Report) is set to report fourth-quarter 2017 financial results on Feb 14, before the market opens.Last quarter, the company posted a positive earnings surprise of 12.73%. Notably, it surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing four quarters, the average beat being 0.61%.Let’s see how things are shaping up at the company prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayCMS Energy’s regulated electric power operations in Michigan generate relatively stable earnings and a growing earnings stream.In recent times, the company has been focusing on capacity maximization, reliability improvement and infrastructure upgrade. This in turn is expected to boost its bottom line as is evident from management’s raised guidance for 2017 earnings. Moreover, the absence of discretionary activities after the second half of 2016, such as debt pre-funding and relatively high volume of donations, may drive earnings in thesecond half of 2017.In line with this, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter earnings is pegged at 51 cents, reflecting a year-over-year surge of 75.9%.Weather conditions remain a key determinant. Michigan saw a wet winter in the fourth quarter. This is expected to result in lower household expenditures on heating, which might reflect in fourth-quarter revenues.CMS Energy Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  CMS Energy Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | CMS Energy Corporation Quote Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show an earnings beat for CMS Energy this quarter.

114,CNP,"PG&E Corporation (PCG  -  Free Report) is set to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 9, before the market opens.Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 19.15%. Moreover, the company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, with an average earnings beat of 14.71%.Let’s see how things are shaping up at the company prior to this announcement.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. PG&E Corp is likely to beat on earnings this quarter as it has the right combination.Zacks ESP: PG&E Corp has an Earnings ESP of +0.48%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: PG&E Corp currently carries a Zacks Rank #3, which along with a positive earnings ESP hints at possible earnings surprise.Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Factors at PlayPG&E Corp has a solid portfolio of regulated utility assets that provide a stable earnings base and poise the company for long-term growth.During third-quarter earnings call, the company announced that it expects to gain 5 cents in rate base earnings during fourth-quarter 2017 and a total of 20 cents in the full year. However, general rate case revenues were adjusted in 2017, resulting in a loss of incremental tax repair benefits of roughly 25 cents annually. This is likely to impact PG&E Corp’s fourth-quarter earnings.Moreover, the massive California wildfire that occurred last October is expected to weigh on PG&E Corp’s upcoming results. In fact, in December 2017, the company announced suspension of its dividend, citing uncertainty regarding its liability in the deadly California wildfires (per a CNBC report).To this end, almost 100 lawsuits have been filed against PG&E Corp for allegedly sparking wildfires in Northern California throughout October. With the Insurance Commission claiming damage worth $9.4 billion, there remains a fair chance that PG&E Corp might have to bear a part of that cost, if the results from the pending lawsuits go against the company.As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for PG&E Corp’s fourth-quarter earnings of 69 cents reflects a 48.1% year-over-year plunge.Earlier, PG&E Corp announced that it expects to incur insurance costs and legal expenses of $100 million in 2017, owing to the California wildfires. We may expect further updates related to this expense once the company releases fourth-quarter results.PG&E Corp’s fourth-quarter business was favorably impacted by warmer-than-average temperature which prevailed in most parts of California. This led to increased electricity demand, which in turn is expected to boost the company’s fourth-quarter revenues.In line with this, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for PG&E Corp’s revenues is pegged at $4.83 billion, reflecting a 2.4% year-over-year increase. Pacific Gas & Electric Co.

The company is also using free cash flow to increase quarterly dividend rate and increase value of its shareholders.Also, Exelon is expected to benefit from its cost management initiatives. Other Stocks to Consider Exelon is not the only stock in the Zacks Utility Power industry that is expected to report a positive earnings surprise.

116,CNP,"President Trump has threatened to expand tariffs on Chinese goods, which many fear will trigger a Chinese harassment of U.S. businesses. The trade spat between the two countries did take a toll on the iPhone maker, semiconductors, industrial behemoths, steel producers and automobiles.But, the same cannot be said about defensive players, regional producers and companies with strong growth narratives. Shares of such companies easily bucked the sharply negative tone of the broader market.          Trade Tensions SurgeTrump caught China off guard with his announcement of new tariffs. If China retaliates against U.S. trade policies, then the White House would impose tariffs of 10% on additional $400 billion of Chinese imports. White House senior trade adviser Peter Navarro and U.S. trade representative Robert Lighthizer argue that the Trump administration took this tough stance as China represents a fundamental threat to the United States in terms of technology and innovation.China, unfortunately, remained hell-bent on increasing its tariffs on $50 billion worth of U.S. exports and accused the United States for ratcheting a trade war. The Chinese Ministry of Commerce also pledged to apply qualitative retaliatory tactics. Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics added that ‘the qualitative thing they could do [would be to] devalue the currency — that would be even more extreme — to offset the impact of the tariffs on their products.”Tariff tantrums and the prospect of a global trade war have roiled Wall Street. But there are stocks that have benefited from the rising trade tensions (read more: 5 Top Stocks to Gain From Escalating Trade War Tensions).Trade Fears Force Investors to Play DefensiveDefensive stocks have been under tremendous pressure this year so far, partly due to rise in bond yields. But as the markets are plagued by trade related uncertainty, defensive stocks are moving north. After all, such stocks are generally non-cyclical, or companies whose business performance and sales are not highly correlated with the activities in the broader market. Their products are in constant demand irrespective of market volatility and such names include companies from utilities and consumer staples.Utilities are deemed defensive stocks as electricity, gas and water are essentials. Food, beverage and tobacco companies are true defensive plays as demand for such staple stocks remains unaltered during market gyrations.A notable company from the electric power industry, CenterPoint Energy, Inc.’s (CNP  -  Free Report) expected growth rate for the current year is 16.1% compared with the industry’s estimated rally of 6.4%. CenterPoint Energy flaunts a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).In the same way, Ollie's Bargain Outlet Holdings, Inc. (OLLI  -  Free Report) that offers food products, housewares, books and stationery, bed and bath products, is projected to gain 36.8% this year compared with the Consumer Products - Staples industry’s estimated rally of 12.1%. Ollie's Bargain Outlet also carries a Zacks Rank #2.Domestic Producers Outperform MultinationalsDespite escalating trade concerns, domestic producers remain fairly immune. This is because such stocks have high domestic exposure in terms of revenue generation, which shields them from the aftermath of international disputes. On the contrary, trade issues are headwinds for bigwigs as these erode overseas profits.One such domestic player as per Goldman is Roper Technologies, Inc. (ROP  -  Free Report). The conglomerate derives a meagre 10% of revenues from China. The company’s expected growth rate for the current quarter is 20.5% compared with the Manufacturing - General Industrial  industry’s estimated rally of 5.8%. Roper Technologies has a Zacks Rank #2.Companies with Solid Growth Narratives Emerge WinnersNot all multinationals, though, are bearing the brunt of escalating trade tensions. Notable, among them are Alphabet Inc., Facebook and Axon Enterprise, Inc. (AAXN  -  Free Report). This is because their long-term growth narrative will not be affected by a trade war. And why so? Google’s growth is dependent on an uptick in digital advertising, while Facebook’s growth is also mostly in digital advertising space. Needless to say that digital advertising industry is hardly affected by the implementation of tariffs.Axon Enterprise, in the meantime, sells an array of digital solutions including cloud data storage systems and mobile video apps to law enforcement agencies throughout the world. Such agencies are in desperate need of a technology makeover, which gives the stock a solid growth narrative and helped it earn a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The company’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 75.6% compared with the Security and Safety Services industry’s estimated rally of 16.4%.Let’s now take a look at those who aren’t as lucky, and why?The iPhone Maker & Chip Stocks Feel the Pain As trade tensions escalate, Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report) could be most at risk. After all, Apple has generated around 20% of its revenues or $44.7 billion from Greater China. It has also shipped nearly 41 million iPhones into China and is now the fifth largest player in the market, as per IDC. To top it, the company has 40 stores in China and operates services such as the App store and Apple Music.Not to forget, Apple is dependent heavily on its suppliers. The iPhones are assembled in China by Taiwanese firm Foxconn. Shares of Apple have been moving downward since the beginning of the trade spat between the two largest economies in the world. The iPhone maker saw its shares decline 1.6% on Jun 19.Apple Inc. Price and Consensus  Apple Inc. price-consensus-chart | Apple Inc. QuoteSemiconductor companies including QUALCOMM Incorporated and Intel Corporation were also taken aback after the U.S. government decided to impose tariffs, particularly, on computer chips imported from China. The Semiconductor Industry Association raised concerns by saying “while the U.S. semiconductor industry shares the Trump administration's concerns about China's forced technology transfer and intellectual property practices, the proposed imposition of tariffs on semiconductors from China, most of which are actually researched, designed, and manufactured in the U.S., is counterproductive.”Dow Tanks, Boeing BleedsTrade-sensitive industrial stocks including The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) compelled the Dow to close lower for the sixth straight session. Thanks to such a string of down days, the blue-chip index turned negative for the year so far.Boeing is caught in the crosshairs of the trade war. For Boeing, China is a big market. After all, the airline manufacturer previously said that it expects China to spend almost $1.1 trillion in the next 20 years by acquiring more than 7,200 new airplanes. Lest we forget that China had threatened to buy Airbus instead of Boeing if the United States gets involved in a trade fight. Shares of Boeing declined 3.8% on Jun 19.The Boeing Company Price and Consensus  The Boeing Company price-consensus-chart | The Boeing Company QuoteSteel Prices & Almost Anything Related to Auto Take a HitInvestors remained nervous and apprehensive about the future potential of heavy machine industries amid trade war rhetoric. Iron and steel for construction uses are included in the U.S. tariff list. Thus, steel and iron ore prices are taking a beating. While iron ore prices are at its lowest level in two months, steel continued its retreat from a three-month high. United States Steel Corp. (X  -  Free Report) and Steel Dynamics each slipped more than 3% on Jun 19. Meanwhile, concerns about auto part imports are weighing on the auto industry. Tariffs will lead to higher auto parts import costs and that in turn could squeeze the profit margin.General Motors and Ford Motor stocks declined 3.9% and 0.8%, respectively, on Jun 19. Tesla, Inc. (TSLA  -  Free Report) has a significant production base in China. Thus, Tesla was down 4.9%.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

117,CNP,"Following months of negotiations, the United States and China are again on the brink of an all-out trade war. The United States has targeted a flurry of Chinese goods, while China has vowed to respond with tariffs of its own, which could hurt U.S. businesses.Trade wars are never good for the economy and squeeze corporate profit margins. Thus, this escalating trade tension is weighing on investors’ risk appetite. This, in turn, calls for investing in low beta defensive companies. Such stocks provide risk-adjusted returns and steady earnings regardless of the state of the equity market.Trump Announces Tariffs on Chinese GoodsThe White House will impose a 25% tariff on $50 billion Chinese imports, which has increased the chances of a confrontation with China over trade.. The United States has decided to penalize China for stealing American technology and of course trade secrets. Chinese aerospace, robotics, manufacturing and auto makers will mostly be targeted.The tariffs will be passed in two phases. More than 800 Chinese exports, worth $34 billion, will be subject to tariffs beginning in July and another 280 or so will go through a public comment period and take effect later.Trump gave the green light after meeting top economic officials last week, including Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer.Trump said that trade between two of the world’s largest economies “has been very unfair, for a very long time” and that the “situation is no longer sustainable.”U.S.-China Trade Trump has, in fact, kept the doors open for further escalation if China imposes retaliatory tariffs. He had earlier suggested that tariffs could apply to as much as $100 billion worth of Chinese goods.China Vows to Retaliate, Blames U.S. of Firing the First ShotChina has accused the United States for ratcheting a trade war. The Chinese government said that it will respond accordingly to U.S. tariffs. China has vowed to impose tariffs on 545 U.S. goods worth $34 billion. These include agricultural products, automobiles and seafood. The tariffs are expected to get implemented from Jul 6. Beijing will impose tariffs on another 114 U.S. goods like chemicals, medical equipment and energy products later.Beijing confirmed that it “will immediately launch tariff measures that will match the scale and intensity of those launched by the United States.” Beijing added that “all economic and trade agreements reached by previous negotiations will be nullified at the same time.” That includes a deal to increase purchases of American energy and agricultural products.China’s Commerce Ministry, by the way, urged all the countries to act together to stop such a trade war for the benefit of business houses and “safeguard the common interest of all mankind.”American Businesses Brace for More PainAmerican companies are poised to bear the brunt of a trade war. They say that the cost of critical supplies needed to make products could jump in the near term. Multinationals, in particular, remain worried about their future ability to do trade in China. Needless to say that China is a massive market for them.Semiconductor companies including QUALCOMM Incorporated (QCOM  -  Free Report) and Intel Corporation (INTC  -  Free Report) were taken aback after the U.S. government decided to impose tariffs on computer chips imported from China.

Last quarter, this utility reported a positive earnings surprise of 5.7%. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayDespite the ill-effects of Hurricane Irma, that hampered the financial performance of many utilities, the economy of Florida remains sturdy, supporting ongoing customer growth in the last two quarters. This can be attributed to new construction and additional building permits. Overall, Florida's economy continues to flourish and could result in more customer additions.NextEra Energy anticipates lower growth in the fourth quarter due to refinancing initiatives. Further it anticipates the favorable economic conditions to drive NPV savings up to $150 million on a cash basis but with simultaneous reduction in net income.Despite an expected drop in net income, management believes that it is well positioned to achieve 6-8% annual adjusted earnings per share growth off 2016 base.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that NextEra Energy is likely to beat estimates this quarter.

127,CNP,"Shares of Southern Company (SO  -  Free Report) slipped to a 52-week low of $43.16 during the trading session on Jan 23. However, the stock recovered marginally to eventually close at $44.47, up around 1% from the closing price of Jan 22. The stock displayed weak price movement both in absolute and relative terms. Shares of the company have declined 8.5% over a year, underperforming the industry's rally of more than 2%.  Over the past 52 weeks, shares of Southern Company have traded between a low of $43.16 and a high of $53.51. The average volume of shares traded over the last three months is approximately 5.4 million.Currently, the electric utility firm is grappling with a number of challenges. Let’s take a detailed look at the factors that have resulted in the new low for the stock.Construction Projects — A KilljoyThe company is bearing the brunt of continued delays and cost overruns over two of its large construction projects — Vogtle and Kemper — which have weighed on Southern Company's fortunes.Though Southern Company won Georgia PSC's nod for the construction of Vogtle plant in December 2017, the decision to proceed with the project has increased the credit risk of the company. The Vogtle project is being bankrolled with more than $8 billion in federal loans and loan guarantees. The project, which has been missing milestone dates and suffering from poor productivity rates, is likely to suffer owing to escalated costs. The increasing capital intensity of operations is likely to result in reduced returns and hurt the already weak financials of the company.The weak economics of Kemper Project is also affecting the stock adversely. Kemper Project — touted to be a cutting-edge power plant which uses ‘clean coal’ technology — suffered a major setback with the suspension of all coal gasification operations. The project has been facing continuous criticism owing to its poor execution, cost overruns and multiple delays. The plant is already three years behind schedule and is over $4 billion beyond the stipulated budget. The overall cost of the plant was estimated to total to around $3 billion in 2010. However, with several delays adding to the project’s cost, the current price tag of the plant has ballooned over $7.3 billion, affecting the commercial viability of the project.Soft Sales Mar Growth ProspectsSouthern Company has been experiencing flat-to-low sales during the last few years from the impact of fluctuating weather conditions on overall consumer demand. Notably, the company's commercial, residential and industrial sales were down by 5.3%, 10% and 0.5% year over year, respectively, in the third quarter.High Debt Burden Plays Spoilsport Southern Company is reeling under high debt burden which restricts its financial flexibility and limits its ability to tap growth opportunities. The utility's long-term debt at the end of third quarter totaled over $44 billion, which represents a debt-to-capitalization ratio of more than 60%. Apart from a rise in immediate finance costs, the high debt level will also require significant cash flows for repayments.Zacks Rank and Key PicksGeorgia-based Southern Company carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).A few better-ranked players in the same industry include Pampa Energia S.A.

129,CNP,"American Electric Power Company, Inc. (AEP  -  Free Report) is set to release fourth-quarter and 2017 results on Jan 25, before the market opens. Last quarter, this electric utility saw a negative earnings surprise of 4.35%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors to ConsiderAmerican Electric is highly dependent on coal for production of electricity. Thus, President Trump’s emphasis on boosting the coal industry and relaxing environmental regulations in is likely to enhance thecompany’s prospects in the near term.In 2016, strong dollar and weak global demand were significant headwinds for the company. In 2017, American Electric witnessed an improvement in global economic conditions and the softening of the U.S.dollar. These are expected to help the company deliver improved results in the fourth quarter as well as full-year 2017.On the flip side, mild weather conditions impacted the company in the third quarter and are expected to do so in the fourth quarter as well. This might impede earnings growth. However, mild weather will lead toreduced operations and maintenance expenses for the company.These factors might nullify the effect of each other and even boost earnings, as is evident from the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter earnings that reflects 19.4% improvement. However, the company’srevenue estimate, pegged at $3.49 billion, reflects an annual decline of 8.1%.American Electric Power Company, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  American Electric Power Company, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | American Electric Power Company, Inc. Quote Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show an earnings beat for American Electric this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: American Electric has an Earnings ESP of -0.50%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: American Electric carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company’s negative ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderHere are a few companies in the utility sector that have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.BCE Inc.

131,CNP,"CenterPoint Energy, Inc. (CNP  -  Free Report) is investing substantially to expand its operations to address the increasing utility demand. The company is currently focused on upgrading infrastructure and improving reliability.To that end, the company recently unveiled a capital expenditure plan for the 2018-2022 period, wherein the energy provider plans to invest $8.3 billion. CenterPoint Energy aims to spend $1.66 billion in 2018 and almost the same amount in each of the following four years.Notably, to withstand severe weather conditions utilities have to keep their transmission and distribution systems upgraded. During third-quarter 2017 earnings call, the company hinted at increasing its next five-year capital expenditure for both electric as well as gas distribution businesses. The latest investment plan worth $8.3 billion duly reflects the company’s commitment toward offering improved and safe utility services to customers.Meanwhile, in the first week of January the company provided an updated 2017 guidance, which hints at an improvement in full-year earnings. The company currently expects earnings per share to exceed $1.25-$1.33 in 2017, compared to its prior guidance of earnings at or near the high end of this range.Recent adjustments made in CenterPoint Energy’s bottom line, including a re-measurement of deferred tax liabilities and a credit to income tax expenses, primarily led to the raised earnings projection.Coming to the company’s earnings performance, CenterPoint Energy delivered a positive earnings surprise in two of the last four quarters, with an average beat of 6.4%.Moreover, CenterPoint Energy judiciously utilizes funds in growth projects and at the same time maintains a stable financial position. As of Sep 30, 2017, the company had cash and cash equivalents of $201 million. Such a favorable financial position supports CenterPoint’s practice of paying regular dividends. In December 2017, management approved a quarterly dividend hike of approximately 3.7% for the company’s common stocks.All these may have led the company to outperform the broader industry over a year. Evidently, CenterPoint Energy’s shares gained 8.5%, compared to the broader industry’s gain of 1.4%. However, the performance of CenterPoint Energy’s regulated electricity and natural gas utilities depends upon rate relief at regular intervals in its different service areas. Any adverse decision in pending regulatory cases can impact the company’s earnings substantially.Zacks Rank & Other Key PicksCenterPoint Energy carriesa Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).A few other top-ranked stocks in the same space are Pampa Energia S.A.

132,CNP,"An unexpectedly sharp drop in temperatures seems to be the major reason for an increase in industrial production over the month of December. Extreme cold weather conditions, especially in the East and Midwest, have boosted demand for utilities substantially. Also, a rise in oil and natural gas output has led to an increase in mining production.A pickup in demand for utilities has raised expectations that consumer expenditure increased during the fourth quarter. The Fed’s Beige Book Report has also indicated that the outlook for the current year remains bright. Given this backdrop investing in utilities stocks, which provide lucrative dividends, remains a smart option at this point.Dip in Temperature Boosts Utilities DemandFresh predictions indicate that the blast of cold weather which has impaired refinery operations, closed poultry plants and resulted in a spike in energy prices could begin to recede by Friday. But as of now, large parts of the United States continue to suffer from extremely cold weather. Even as heaters are being pushed to their maximum, the price of natural gas has increased significantly.Meanwhile, demand for electricity in Texas and other parts of the southern U.S. touched a record level during the winter heating season. According to Genscape data, early on Jan 17, average wholesale power hit the $2,267 a megawatt-hour mark for a short time. Power utilization surged to 65,731 megawatts in Texas during 7-8 am. This is a considerable increase over the previous record of 62,855 megawatts.December’s Utilities, Mining Output SurgesAs a result, industrial production increased by 0.9% in December, despite a mere 0.1% increase in manufacturing output. This is an important development, since the metric had declined by 0.1% in November. Most of December’s increase was attributable to a 5.6% increase in utilities output, which comes after a 3.1% decline in November. Also notable was a 1.6% increase in mining output following a surge in oil and gas extraction.The rise in mining and utilities output compensated for a modest increase in factory output. The increase in manufacturing output, which makes up nearly 70% of the headline figure, came in at only 0.1% in December. However, readings for October and November were upwardly revised from 1.4% to 1.5% and from 0.2% to 0.3%, respectively.Ultimately, the step up in demand for utilities raised expectations of a subsequent rise in consumer expenditure in the fourth quarter. This has led a section of economists to increase their growth estimates for the last quarter of 2017. For instance, Barclays (BCS) has raised its fourth quarter GDP forecast from 3% to 3.1%. The Fed’s Beige Book report also indicates that the economic outlook for 2018 remains encouraging.Our ChoicesA sharp drop in temperatures has led to a substantial increase in utilities demand over last month. This development, along with the strong retail sales reading for last month indicates that consumer spending likely remained strong in the fourth quarter.Given the encouraging economic outlook for 2018, it is likely that utilities demand will continue to remain strong. This is why it may be a good idea to pick stocks from this sector. We have narrowed down our search to the following stocks based on a good Zacks Rank and other relevant metrics.MYR Group Inc.

134,CNP,"CenterPoint Energy, Inc. (CNP  -  Free Report) recently unveiled capital expenditure plan for 2018-2022 time period, wherein the energy provider plans to invest $8.3 billion. Notably, this represents 18% growth from the prior five-year plan (2017-2021).Details of the Capex PlanCenterPoint Energy aims to spend $1.66 billion in 2018, and almost the same amount in each of the following four years.Per management, solid growth, reliability and grid strengthening duly witnessed in operations enhanced the capital expenditure.The projected capital plan incorporates the Freeport transmission project worth $250 million that has been approved by the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, last month. CenterPoint Energy expects a decision from the Texas Public Utility Commission on the project in 2019.How Will CenterPoint Energy Benefit?The Utility sector is a fundamentally capital-intensive sector, where in service providers need to focus on strengthening their transmission and distribution lines. Since Center point Energy provides both electricity as well as natural gas, the company has to spend a lot for upgrading and strengthening its existing infrastructure, like replacing old distribution lines and repairing old gas pipelines.To withstand severe weather conditions as well utilities have to keep their transmission and distribution systems upgraded.

In fact, during the third-quarter earnings call, the company did give an indication that a favorable tax reform might result in a lower tax rate for CenterPoint Energy. So, shelling out less in form of tax will boost the bottom line.Moreover, the company had earlier projected income tax rate at 36% for 2017 despite witnessing a slightly higher rate of 37% in the third quarter. The latest tax reform might have pulled down the rate further for the company, thereby leading to the raised outlook.Moreover, CenterPoint Energy’s venture in Enable Midstream has been consistently boosting the bottom line. Considering the fact that Enable Midstream continues to see a strong level of activity on their system with 40, it must have also contributed to this raised bottom line guidance.What Lies Ahead?CenterPoint Energy has been investing substantially to expand its operations to cope with increasing utility demand. The company is currently focused on upgrading infrastructure and improving reliability. Toward this end, the company maintains its capital outlay of $7 billion from 2017 through 2021. With respect to bottom-line growth, CenterPoint Energy expects to witness 4-6% annual EPS growth or exceeding the high end of the range through 2018, inclusive of Midstream Investments.Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at $1.41 for 2018, reflecting year-over-year improvement of 7.8%.Price MovementCenterPoint Energy’s stock has moved up about 10.4% in the last 12 months compared with the broader industry’s gain of 4.7%. This outperformance must have been led by significant customer growth as well as investments to upgrade infrastructure.  Zacks Rank & Key PicksCenterPoint Energy carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Efficient management and skillful execution of plans have culminated in robust results, the best part being better-than-guided earnings for 12 years nonstop.The average positive earnings surprise of 3.08% for the trailing four quarters should encourage investors as would a 1.5% upward revision in the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter 2017 to 66 cents, in the last 30 days.WEC Energy projects capital expenditure of nearly $11.8 billion over 2018-2022. Of this, $5,514 million is allotted for Gas Delivery, $2,707 million for Electric Delivery, $2,691 million for Generation and $911 million for Energy Infrastructure. Since, more than 99% of the company’s earnings are generated from regulated operations, rate hikes give it the confidence to spend on infrastructure development and power to boost earnings.More good news comes from a swelling customer base thanks to the economy, which is gaining health. In third-quarter 2017, WEC Energy served 9,000 more electric and 18,000 more natural gas customers than it did in the year-ago quarter. Strong investment-grade credit ratings between A and A-, allows WEC Energy to enjoy superior credit worthiness. This, in turn, gives it access to cheaper funds for investment projects amid rising interest rates.Now, the company’s resolve is not just limited to its profits and performance. Its shareholder and environmental friendly ways are also worth mentioning. In December 2017, the company hiked its annual dividend rate by 6.25% to $2.21 from the 2016 level of $2.08. Also, it aims to cut down its emission in the state of Wisconsin nearly 40% below the 2005 levels by 2030.

137,CNP,"CenterPoint Energy, Inc.‘s (CNP  -  Free Report) board of directors has approved a quarterly dividend hike of approximately 3.7% for the company’s common stocks.Notably, the revised quarterly stock dividend of 27.75 cents per share, up from 26.75 cents per share distributed earlier, will be payable on Mar 8, 2018, to shareholders at the close of business on Feb 15, 2018. Post the hike, the company’s new annualized dividend will amount to $1.11 per share of common stock, up from $1.07 per share of common stock distributed previously.Consequently, the company’s current annual dividend yield is 3.9% based on the closing share price of $28.40 on Dec 13, 2017, significantly higher than the yield of 1.74% recorded by S&P 500 as well as that of industry average of 3.04%.Dividend Hike is Common for UtilitiesUtility operators generate more or less stable earnings, owing to endless need for electricity and utility services. This helps the stocks in the utility space to enjoy a steady flow of revenues. A steady flow of uninterrupted income in turn encourages the operators to reward shareholders from time to time, with notable dividend hikes.Toward this, we have witnessed a few utilities reward their shareholders with incremental dividends in the past few weeks. Evidently, PNM Resources, Inc. (PNM  -  Free Report) has raised its annual dividend by 9.3%, while another utility operator – WEC Energy Group (WEC  -  Free Report) decided to raise its dividend by 6.3%. Most recently, The AES Corporation (AES  -  Free Report) hiked its dividend by 8.3%.What led to Dividend Hike for Company?CenterPoint Energy has been more or less a steady performer in the past, as evidenced by its performance in the last four quarters. Notably the utility was successful in beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 6.4%.Further, the company maintains a stable cash flow financial position. As of Sep 30, 2017, it had cash and cash equivalents of $201 million. Such stability in financial position has supported the company’s practice of returning value to shareholders with regular dividend hikes. In the nine months of 2017, the company paid $346 million as dividends to shareholders, up from $332 million paid in the year-ago period. The latest dividend hike marks the 13th in a row in as many years, following the 4% hike that CenterPoint Energy made this January.Going AheadCenterPoint Energy aims to invest approximately $4.1 billion through the 2017-2021 period toward its Electric Transmission & Distribution division, for conducting system modernization initiatives, maintenance projects and installation of meter-reading technology. Additionally, it intends to spend $2.7 billion in natural gas utilities for replacing aging infrastructure, development of the Minnesota Belt Line Project and public improvement requirements. These investments are expected to collectively aid the company in achieving 4-6% annual EPS growth, or exceeding the upper end of its range through 2018. Notably, this will aid the company in making dividend hikes in future.Price MovementShares of CenterPoint Energy have outperformed the industry in the last one year. The company’s shares gained 22%, compared with the industry’s growth of 15.9%.The outperformance can be attributed to the company’s solid cash flow generating capability.Zacks RankCenterPoint Energy currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

138,CNP,"The much awaited spin-off of CONSOL Energy Inc. (CONSOL) is over, leading to the formation of two separate entities focusing on the Gas and Coal businesses of the company. While the gas business has been named CNX Resources Corp. (CNX  -  Free Report), the coal business which was formerly known as CONSOL Mining Corporation has been renamed CONSOL Energy Inc. (CEIX).The master limited partnership named CNX Coal Resources LP (CNXC) has been renamed to CONSOL Coal Resources LP and will trade on the NYSE under a new ticker symbol ""CCR.""Reasons Behind Spin-OffSoftness in demand for coal in the past few years has prompted CONSOL to concentrate more on natural gas operations. It is evident that natural gas operations along with coal have helped CONSOL to survive amid an uncertain environment.Notably, CONSOL has shifted focus to natural gas, and has acquired acreage in regions where large volumes of gas reserves are anticipated.Company Emerging from Spin-OffNatural gas focused CNX Resources Corp. will have over 1 million acres of holding in Marcellus and Utica shales. The planned 2017 E&P capital expenditure is expected to range between $620 million and $645 million. Additionally, it is currently enjoying the benefits of lower costs of production.Further, the company’s E&P business has excellent long-term prospects. This is due to increasing focus of utilities toward using natural gas to produce electricity. The company expects 2017 and 2018 E&P production to be in the range of 405-415 billion cubic feet equivalent (Bcfe) and 520-550 Bcfe, respectively. The company expects to drill nine additional wells in 2017 and modify production protocol, boosting 2018 production.Coal-focused CONSOL Energy Inc. will have interest in the Pennsylvania Mining Complex, the Baltimore Marine Terminal and approximately one billion tons of greenfield coal reserves.Thanks to the coal industry-friendly moves of the new administration, it is currently making a comeback. The U.S. Energy information Administration (EIA) predicts coal production in 2017 to increase 7.9% from 2016 level to 785.6 million short tons (MMst). Production is expected to rise 0.2% from 2017 level to 786.8 MMst in 2018. Given the improving scenario, we expect the coal-focused standalone company to gain going ahead.The shareholders of the new company will receive one share for holding eight shares in the old company at the close of business on the record date of Nov 15, 2017.Our ViewThe completion of the spin-off will allow management of these distinct companies to focus on a specific type of business. No doubt natural gas has become the preferred choice for energy due to its clean burning nature.  However, the gas company will have to compete with a major gas operator like CenterPoint Energy, Inc. (CNP  -  Free Report) among others.Coal is also gradually staging a comeback from its dark days, thanks to the friendly action taken by the new administration. A few coal companies like Arch Coal Inc. (ARCH  -  Free Report) and Peabody Energy Corp. (BTU  -  Free Report) have come out from bankruptcy and have started trading again. These two stocks carry a Zacks Rank 3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.So, there is ample opportunity for both gas and coal companies to gain and reward shareholders.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

139,CNP,"CenterPoint Energy, Inc.’s (CNP  -  Free Report) operations are subject to the impact of weather patterns. Toward this, the Hurricane Harvey that hit the city of Houston in August 2017 disrupted the company’s operations during the third quarter of 2017.The company estimates that as a result of Hurricane Harvey, total costs to restore the electric delivery facilities damaged will range from $110 - $120 million, while that for restoring natural gas distribution facilities damaged will range from $25 - $30 million.Surely this impacted the company’s third quarter results as is evident from the 4% decline observed in the operating income of its Electric Transmission & Distribution segment. Moreover, CenterPoint’s total expenses during the third quarter increased 13.3% year-over-year.Coming to its earnings performance, the company’s third-quarter 2017 earnings missed the Zacks Consensus estimate by 4.9%. Quarterly earnings also declined 4.9% on a year-over-year basis.Additionally, the company is subject to severe regulatory and judicial proceedings along with fluctuating commodity prices. Any adverse decisions in pending regulatory cases can affect CenterPoint Energy’s earnings substantially.These may have led the company's shares to underperform its broader industry in last three months. Evidently the company gained 1.1% in the last three months, compared with the broader industry's growth of 2.3%.Zacks Rank & Key PicksCenterPoint Energy currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

140,CNP,"Perennial demand for electricity and utility services has made the Utility Sector a safe haven for investors. Consistent demand enables a smooth flow of cash to utility operators. They in turn use this cash to reward shareholders by paying stable dividends.In fact, for income investors, this sector has always been a lucrative one with utility stocks generating strong dividend yields. As we near the end of 2017, it seems to be a good time for investors to review the prospects of utility stocks and accordingly reshuffle their portfolios.Rising Prices Boost Growth ProspectsIn a recent release, the U.S. Energy Information Administration predicted that the annual average U.S. residential electricity price will increase 3.4% in 2017 and 3.2% in 2018. This will surely benefit electric utility operators. Electricity prices are also projected to increase in commercial and industrial sector. Undoubtedly, such price increases will boost earnings of the utilities and enhance dividend payouts.Regular Dividends: A Major PositiveA major positive for utility stocks has been their regular dividend payout strategy. Even during times of recession, households and communities still need power, water, heat and telecommunications. This was evident during the economic crisis of 2008-2009, when utilities continued to pay dividends uninterruptedly.We have a long list of companies that are sharing profits consistently with shareholders. Notable among them are CenterPoint Energy (CNP  -  Free Report) and Duke Energy Corp. (DUK  -  Free Report), which have raised dividend rates annually for more than 10 years now.Trump Administration: A Boon Stringent regulations implemented by President Obama prompted utilities to take steps to lower emission levels. Although for environmental protection Clean Power Plan was an apt decision, it was putting pressures on utilities.  President Trump’s repeal of these stipulations on economic growth grounds are expected to give a new lease of life to utilities that produce a major part of their electricity from coal. After all, Coal still accounts for nearly 30% of the electricity produced in the United States.Trump’s promises to deregulate the sector and remove environmental hurdles will be beneficial for utilities. Fewer regulations will help to lower operating costs and increase the lives of power production facilities.Key BetsUtility operators are currently undergoing a transition as the primary fuel source, coal, is gradually being replaced by natural gas and other alternative energy resources like solar power as is evident from increased usage of clean energy to produce electricity.May be realizing that fact that our ultimate future lies in renewable resources, large utilities like NextEra Energy (NEE  -  Free Report) and Duke Energy continue to take initiatives to produce electricity from natural gas and alternative sources, even when Trump is against the Clean Power Plan.With only a month or so remaining before we step into 2018, let’s take a look at the utility stocks which continued with their dividend payout strategy amidst this transition.With the help of our Zacks Stock Screener, we have narrowed down our search to the following utility stocks each of which has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and a dividend yield of more than 3%.

145,CNP,"The third-quarter earnings season has crossed the half way mark. Total earnings for the 327 S&P members that have already released results are up 7.8% year over year on 6.5% higher revenues, with 74.9% beating earnings and 65.7% topping revenue estimates.Combining the results of the 372 S&P 500 members with the index’s members yet to report, we expect total third-quarter earnings to be up 5.6% year over year on 5.5% higher revenues.Amid this backdrop, let us focus on Zacks Utilities sector this earnings season. Earnings from the utility space were expected to drop 3.8% on 1.1% lower revenues as of November 1. Notably, 10 out of the 16 sectors in the Zacks coverage universe are expected to witness an earnings decline. Read more details in the weekly Earnings Outlook.Notably, capital intensive utilities were impacted by increased interest rates in March and June, this year. In addition, the utilities operating in Texas and Florida were severely hurt by the hurricanes (Harvey and Irma).With the rising interest rates, the stable, regular dividend payer utilities will face strong competition from bonds as these provide higher returns, consequently making them a more attractive option for investors.Therefore, to maintain their performance level, these utilities are resorting to cost savings initiatives, modernizing transmission and distribution lines, upgrading infrastructure and focusing more on renewable energy to generate electricity with lower emission.  Let us take a sneak peek at the four utility stocks scheduled to release third-quarter 2017 results on Nov 3.Duke Energy Corporation (DUK  -  Free Report) witnessed a negative earnings surprise of 0.98% in the previous quarter.Last month, Hurricane Irma led to catastrophic losses in Florida. As a result, Duke Energy’s electrical system suffered significant damages in Hardee and Highlands County. The company took several initiatives to address these issues and initiated repair work, which included rebuilding this system. These must have increased the third-quarter expenses of Duke Energy, which we believe might weigh down on its bottom-line.For the to-be-reported quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings reflects a decline of 7.8% year over year. The same for sales are anticipated to drop 1.1% to $6.75 billion.According to our proven model, stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) have higher chances of beating estimates. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Our proven model does not show that Duke Energy is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because the company has an Earnings ESP of -0.78% as the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at $1.55, lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.56. Moreover, it carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). (Read more: Will Irma's Impact Dent Duke Energy Q3 Earnings?).As it is we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Strong Sell) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Duke Energy Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Duke Energy Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Duke Energy Corporation QuoteAmeren Corporation (AEE  -  Free Report) delivered a positive earnings surprise of 14.49% in the last quarter.In soon-to-be reported quarter, Ameren’s earnings are expected to be affected by a non-cash estimated charge of 6 cents per share, primarily at the parent company. Again, owing to the change in timing of interim period revenue recognition in Ameren Illinois, the bottom line will decrease by approximately 23 cents per share.In this regard, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Ameren’s third-quarter earnings reflects 9.9% decline.Our proven model does not show that Ameren is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because the company has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% as the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at $1.31. Moreover, it carries a Zacks Rank #4.

(CNP  -  Free Report) pulled off a positive earnings surprise of 38.10% in the second quarter.In the third quarter, Hurricane Harvey has severely hit the city of Houston, TX – which is the primary service region of CenterPoint. Though the company didn’t announce any significant damage caused to its power plants, it is expected that the effect of the storm might weigh down on its profitability in the quarter.On the brighter note, the unemployment rate in CenterPoint Energy’s service territories is better than the national average. An improving economy is likely to boost future utility demand in the state, thereby improving the company’s performance.For the to-be-reported quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 41 cents for third-quarter earnings projects a decline of 1%. Meanwhile, the same for revenues of $2.02 billion hints at an improvement of almost 6.7% on a year-over-year basis.Our proven model does not show that CenterPoint Energy is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this quarter.

Price and EPS Surprise CenterPoint Energy, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | CenterPoint Energy, Inc. QuotePinnacle West Capital Corporation (PNW  -  Free Report) pulled off a positive earnings surprise of 28.45% in the previous quarter.In August, Arizona Corporation Commission approved the company’s first rate review agreement in five years. This decision is likely to act as a strong catalyst for the company’s growth, since it will boost Pinnacle West’s Arizona Public Service unit’s revenues by an estimated 3.3%. Notably the new rates, effective from Aug 19, will increase the residential bill by approximately 4.5% or about $6 per month. We may expect the rate increase to get reflected in improved revenues of APS in the to-be-reported quarter.Meanwhile, the company projects to witness extended outages at its Four Corners power plant, in the second half of this year for the installation of pollution control equipment. This is expected to push up its operating and maintenance cost for third and fourth quarters of 2017, which in turn may dent the bottom line for coming quarters.Our proven model does not show that Pinnacle West is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this quarter. This is because the company has an Earnings ESP of -0.07% and carries a Zacks Rank #2.  (Read more: What’s in the Cards for Pinnacle West in Q3 Earnings?).Pinnacle West Capital Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Pinnacle West Capital Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Pinnacle West Capital Corporation QuoteZacks’ Best Private Investment IdeasWhile we are happy to share many articles like this on the website, our best recommendations and most in-depth research are not available to the public.Starting today, for the next month, you can follow all Zacks' private buys and sells in real time.

Moreover, it outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average earnings beat of 10.34%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for the company prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayDuring the third quarter, one of the most devastating tropical storms in 50 years – Hurricane Harvey hit the city of Houston, TX – which is the primary service region of CenterPoint .Harvey’s impact on the state’s properties hampered the smooth flow of electricity through the transmission lines, leading to widespread outages. Though the company didn’t announce any significant damage caused to its power plants, it is expected that the effect of the storm might weigh down on its profitability in the third quarter.On the brighter note, CenterPoint had witnessed increased customer count and throughput during second-quarter 2017, primarily due to acquisitions of Atmos Energy Marketing (AEM) and the Energy Services business. Going ahead, similar solid performance from Energy Services is expected in third quarter and beyond, buoyed by increased operating income.Moreover, the unemployment rate in Ameren’s service territories is better than the national average.

Thus, we believe that the upcoming results are likely to be impacted by the developments of these rate cases.GDP growth in the company’s service territory exceeded that of the United States in the fourth quarter of 2017, courtesy of higher energy prices and the strong global economy. Moreover, rise in employment in its service territory hints at improved purchasing power and thus a notable residential sales growth for American Electric is expected in the near term.However, the company’s commercial sales were drab in the fourth quarter of 2017. Considering this trend to continue in the to-be-reported quarter as well, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for American Electric’s first-quarter revenue estimate of $3.74 billion, reflects an annual decline of 4.9%.On the other hand, lower tax rates courtesy of the latest tax reform is expected to boost American Electric’s quarterly bottom line.

154,CNP,"DTE Energy Company (DTE  -  Free Report) is slated to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 25, before the opening bell.Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 2.44%. DTE Energy surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 5.32%.Factors at PlayThe company’s service territories mostly witnessed colder-than-normal winters in the first quarter. In particular, Michigan had its wettest cold season on record this year, which indicates higher electricity demand. This in turn is expected to boost DTE Energy’s revenues in the quarter under review.On the bottom-line front, management expects the recent tax reform to be accretive to DTE Energy’s 2018 earnings by 10 cents. We believe part of this accretion to benefit the company’s first-quarter earnings and will duly get reflected in the form of higher quarterly earnings. In line with this, the consensus estimate for DTE Energy’s earnings of $1.89 per share for the yet-to-be-reported quarter reflects year-over-year growth of 5.6%.However, higher interest expense is expected to weigh on the company’s first-quarter results.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not show that DTE Energy will beat estimates this quarter.

156,CNP,"Entergy Corporation (ETR  -  Free Report) will release first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 25, before the opening bell.Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 90.95%. Also, Entergy surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 60.21%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayIn the first quarter, most of the company's service territories witnessed warmer-than-normal winters. This indicates reduced demand for electricity in these regions, which in turn, is expected to weigh on Entergy's first-quarter sales.Moreover, management expects the company’s Entergy Wholesale Commodity (EWC) segment to post lower net revenues throughout 2018. The downside can be attributed to lower energy prices, increased non-fuel operations and maintenance expenses on account of higher projected nuclear spending. We believe the upcoming results to reflect this trend, which in turn, is likely to be a drag on the company’s total revenues. In sync with this, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.46 billion for Entergy’s first-quarter sales reflects a year-over-year decline of 5.1%.On the bottom-line front, corporate income tax expense courtesy of the Tax Cut and Jobs Act is expected to boost Entergy’s earnings growth, in the first-quarter. Considering this, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Entergy’s first-quarter earnings of $1.31 per share reflects annual growth of 32.3%.In November 2017, Entergy Mississippi filed its redetermination of the annual factor to be applied under the energy cost recovery rider. The calculation of the annual factor included an under-recovery of approximately $61.5 million as of September 30, 2017. In January 2018, the Michigan Public Service Commission approved the proposed energy cost factors effective for February 2018 bills. So, a part of this $62 million will positively impact the company’s first quarter results.On the flip side, higher fuel costs are expected to weigh heavily on the company’s results in the yet-to-be reported quarter. The increase in fuel costs can be attributed to rise in nuclear spending that Entergy expects to incur in relation to its nuclear strategic plan like continuing operation of the Palisades plant through 2022.Entergy Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Entergy Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Entergy Corporation QuoteEarnings WhispersOur proven model does not show that Entergy is likely to beat earnings this quarter.

157,CNP,"The U.S. stock market mostly see-saws during the pre-midterm election period and rallies once the uncertainty fades, say analysts at The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (GS  -  Free Report). The scenario is not expected to be any different this time around. Investors should brace for increased turbulence as a divided government is highly expected this election.The last several months, in fact, have seen extreme levels of volatility as investors remained concerned about more protectionist trade policies and spike in bond yields after prices of essential commodities continued to move north. Given such uncertainty, investing in stocks that provide excellent risk-adjusted returns seems judicious.Brace for Months of UncertaintyInvestors should brace for neck-snapping volatility as midterm election approaches, per Goldman. The broader market has been on a roller-coaster ride for the past few months, thanks to trade and tax polic, along with geopolitical tensions. Controversies surrounding Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s probe into whether Trump colluded with Russia’s initiative to impede the 2016 presidential election have aggravated concerns.Thus, corporate profits and economic reports might have been crucial factors for stocks but political developments have continued to determine the direction of the market.In the last 11 midterm election years since 1974, the S&P 500 managed to eke out gains in April, but, mostly traded flat through September only to rally once political uncertainty waned, per Goldman. In fact, in those years, stock market volatility averaged 15% compared with the median of 12% in all years.This year is likely to be the same. After all, Democrats are poised to regain control over the House of Representatives even though Republicans are expected to maintain an upper hand in the Senate, based on recent polls. Goldman forecasts that Democrats will have nearly a 70% chance of repossessing the House but there is less than 40% chance of regaining a majority in the Senate. Goldman added that such a divided government doesn’t bode well for investors.Volatility Makes a Dramatic ComebackVolatility has already seen several days with sharp moves so far this year. The Cboe Volatility Index (VIX), the so-called Wall Street’s fear index, has seen a jump of no less than 20% in at least six trading sessions this year, according to the WSJ Market Data Group.The volatility index has experienced 19 sessions so far this year where it ended up at least 5%, the highest since 1994. In fact, volatility doubled on Feb 5 as inflation concerns dragged the broader market down.Such earth-shattering volatility followed a relatively calm 2017.  Last year, the stock market shrugged off political and economic uncertainty, and demonstrated almost nothing in the way of market pullbacks.Bond Yields Spike, Equities WobbleSpike in U.S. bond yields, by the way, have triggered market gyrations. The benchmark 10-year Treasury note hit its highest level since January 2014 at 2.97% in early European trade. The 10-year yield increased as treasuries came under pressure. Treasuries sold off as higher commodity prices diminish the value of a bond’s fixed interest payments. Rise in oil prices and business houses saying that the cost of steel and several other raw materials are increasing in the United States have induced inflation fears.Rise in bond yields affected the buying appetite for stocks. Uptick in bond yields increased the opportunity cost of investing in equities and therefore equities became less alluring. Selling pressure on U.S. equity benchmarks intensified on Apr 20, with all three major bourses retracing into the negative territory.5 Top Stocks to Counter Market GyrationsGiven the aforesaid factors, it seems like Wall Street is poised to face months of volatility with midterms just around the corner. Taking this into consideration, investors should build a strategy on low-risk assets and a combination of parameters that lead to better returns. The best way to go about doing this is by creating a portfolio of low-beta stocks, which are inherently less volatile than the markets they trade in. In this case, a low beta ranges from 0 to 1.These stocks are also dividend payers which boast immense financial strength and are immune to market vagaries. Such stocks reflect solid financial structure, healthy underlying fundamentals and better quality business.

161,CNP,"Alliant Energy Corp (LNT  -  Free Report) received approval from the Iowa Utilities Board to add 1,000 megawatts (MW) wind energy in Iowa by 2020. The company is planning to invest $1.8 billion to boost renewable energy, which can serve approximately 430,000 homes.In 2016, Alliant Energy received approval to add up to 500 MW of wind energy. Currently, Alliant Energy owns and operates four wind firms in the state, while it purchased power from other generators. The company has the capability to serve clean energy to 215,000 homes, which is expected to double once the wind generation assets commence operation.Rising Popularity of Wind EnergyIn the last few years, growth in the U.S. renewable energy industry was influenced by initiatives from the state and federal governments. Energy generation from traditional sources is being replaced by alternative sources — solar, wind, hydro etc. Courtesy of advancements in technology, costs of energy production from renewable sources are lowering. Declining cost and emission-less production are the primary reasons for increasing popularity of renewable sources.Per a recent report by Energy Information Administration (“EIA”), production from wind energy will increase in the near future. EIA expects wind energy to provide 6.4% and 6.9% of total utility-scale electricity generation in the United States in 2018 and 2019, respectively, up from 6.3% in 2017. With increasing asset installation, EIA expects wind to surpass hydro as the major source of renewable electricity generation.Price PerformanceAlliant Energy’s shares have rallied 8.5% in the last 12 months compared with 2.2% rise of the industry it belongs to. Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderAlliant Energy carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

163,CNP,"NiSource’s (NI  -  Free Report) subsidiary, Columbia Gas of Massachusetts, proposed to increase gas rates for natural gas customers in southeastern Massachusetts. If approved by the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities, without any changes, residential customers will have to pay an additional $4.95 in every month, up nearly 3.6% from the existing rate.The proposed rate hike of $24.1 million will be adjusted by $9.1 million in the first year, owing to the positive effect from the implementation of Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.Details of the HikeColumbia Gas of Massachusetts is planning to increase current operating revenues by 3.9%. The proposed $24.1-million increase will enable the company to recoup costs and comply with stringent federal and state regulatory regulations. Also, the unit will be able to redeem capital costs incurred for upgradation of gas infrastructure since 2016.Following an approval, the new rates will be effective from Mar 1, 2019.Necessity of Rate HikesNiSource, a fully-regulated utility company, is dependent on rate hike to continue with any kind of investment. To deliver safe and secure natural gas to customers, it is important to replace ageing pipelines, fix leakages and focus on operating services as well as maintenance of infrastructure, which require regular investments.A regulated utility is required to have hike rates on a regular basis to continue with long-term infrastructure spending. Upgraded infrastructure allows the utilities to provide better service and cater to rising demands.Along with NiSource, few companies from the Utility sector filed rate hike application in 2018. Public Service Enterprise Group Inc. (PEG  -  Free Report) requested to increase its electric and gas base delivery rates to the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities.

164,CNP,"Electric utility firm The Southern Company (SO  -  Free Report) traditionally makes an announcement to up its payout at this time of year.Let’s evaluate whether Southern investors can expect a dividend increase this time around.With their regulated business models and stability in earnings, utilities are among the most consistent dividend stocks in the market. Southern Company is one such blue-chip utility stock.Based in Atlanta, GA, Southern Company is one of the largest power suppliers in the U.S. Offering an enticing dividend yield, the company remains an attractive option for investors seeking for a steady stream of income. Positioned in a niche industry with high barriers to entry, Southern's less-volatile, recession-proof business model presents a unique opportunity to earn high returns and steady payout hikes each year.The Business & FinancialsFollowing its merger with AGL Resources on July 1, 2016, Southern Company serves approximately nine million customers through its eleven electric and natural gas distribution units in nine states. It boasts of a generating capacity of 46,000 megawatts, around 200,000 miles of electric transmission and distribution lines, and more than 80,000 miles of natural gas pipelines. Southern Company’s operations include wholesale electricity generation and natural gas services, retail energy services and natural gas storage operations throughout the country.A look at the company's 2017 financials suggest that Southern Company reported impressive business performance last year. The power supplier grew its revenues by 16%, while adjusted earnings per share was up by more than 4% despite an increase in operating expenses.Strong Dividend History and Above-Average YieldOne of the premier domestic utilities, Southern Company pays an annual dividend of $2.32 per share, yielding an attractive return of 5.3% and above most other utilities. To put things in perspective, the utility offers current yield of 5.3. Meanwhile, the average yields for the utility sector and S&P 500 stands at 3.6% and 1.9%, respectively.The firm hiked its dividend payout by 3.6% in April 2017, marking sixteen consecutive years of such increases. In particular, Southern Company boasts of an uninterrupted streak of paying dividends since 1948.Room for Modest Hike Despite High Payout RatioUsing Southern's 2017 adjusted EPS of $3.02, the utility pays out 76.8% of its earnings as a dividend, which is rather high compared to sector's average payout of 64.1%. Southern forecasts earnings to fall to $2.80–$2.95 per share in the current year. Considering the current annual dividend rate of $2.32 per share, this equates to a steep payout ratio of 79%-83% for 2018.However, Southern also announced its long-term earnings per share growth outlook of 4–6%, commencing with this year's midpoint of $2.87 per share. We believe this should be sufficient for modest dividend increases.Importantly, the utility is confident in its ability to sustain a payout ratio in the range of 80% for a few years, which it expects to eventually come back down in the 70s once construction of the Vogtle nuclear plant expansion project ends.What Exactly to Expect?As per Southern Company, its financial outlook allows for a dividend growth of 8 cents per year, or 2 cents on a quarterly basis. This seems quite doable, with a 2 cents hike taking the quarterly distribution to 60 cents per share ($2.40 per share annualized), which would represent a payout ratio of around 84% and in line with the firm’s expectations.Therefore, going by Southern’s target, we see the quarterly dividend increase to 60 cents per share (or 3.4%) during the next few days.Zacks Rank & Stock PicksDespite being a top dividend-growth stock, Southern Company currently retains a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), ostensibly due to continued timing and cost overrun issues over two large construction projects -- Vogtle and Kemper.Georgia PSC's nod for the construction of the half-finished Vogtle nuclear plant expansion in Georgia notwithstanding, doubts remain about the $20 billion initiative that has gone well over budget and is years behind schedule. Southern is also facing challenges to place its Kemper, Mississippi project in service, which suffered yet another setback with the suspension of all coal gasification operations amid additional cost burden.We believe the financial stress from these projects, together with Southern’s hefty expenses to comply with environmental controls/regulations will cause an underperformance in the utility's shares relative to the market as well as the sector in the coming quarters.Not surprisingly, the stock has underperformed its industry in a year, having declined 7.4% versus the industry's 0.7% loss.Meanwhile, one can look at better-ranked utilities like CenterPoint Energy, Inc. (CNP  -  Free Report), The AES Corp. (AES  -  Free Report) and OGE Energy Corp.

166,CNP,"The lull in the markets with sporadic price swings is over. This year, the U.S. stock market has seen three of the Dow's major daily point drop in its 122-year history, including the 1,175-point record fall on Feb 5. Last Friday’s 572-point collapse has been another nail in the coffin. The U.S. stocks are witnessing massive volatility as investors apprehend a trade war from the bitter exchanges between the Unites States and China over tariffs.Hedge Against UncertaintyIn an attempt to calm investors' frayed nerves, selecting stocks from the defensive utility space seems prudent. Rising urbanization and an ever-expanding global population show how indispensable electricity and utility services are with basically no viable substitute. This lends revenues and cash flow of such companies a high level of stability and visibility.Utilities have long been a staple for low-risk income investors. This is specifically true for those that live off dividends during retirement as most utilities have long track records of highly secure and gradually growing dividends, courtesy of their stable cash flows.In fact, in the recent tumultuous times, the Dow Jones Utility Average index has gained 2.9% in the past month against 5.5% decline of the Dow and 6.5% fall of the S&P 500.Should a Rate Hike Vex Investors?In the past decade, record low interest rates have acted as a tailwind, helping electric, water, and gas companies borrow at reduced interest rates.On Mar 21, the Federal Reserve or Fed has raised its benchmark interest rate by a quarter point to the range of 1.5% to 1.75% in its first policy meeting under the new chief Jerome Powell. This is the sixth time since the first hike was announced in December 2015 when the U.S. economy had pulled itself out of the Great Recession. The central bank also indicated that there will be at least two more hikes in 2018, highlighting its rising confidence that tax cuts and government spending will boost the economy.Interest rates are now rising and as the pace of increases will potentially accelerate in the coming years, many investors are worried about how utilities will do in the days ahead. Rising rates could drive financing costs and reduce their appeal as dividend investments.Although it is true that utilities are likely to face the above-mentioned headwinds, it doesn’t mean that there is a dearth of long-term opportunities in this sector. Here, investors need to understand the underlying quality of the utility stocks they own. The best utility companies in a higher interest rate environment are those that are able to gain regulatory approval to bump up the rates they charge from customers.Per the latest report from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the annual average U.S. residential electricity price is expected to increase 2.1% in 2018 and 3% in 2019. Electricity prices are also projected to increase in the commercial and industrial sectors. This will surely give a boost to electric utility operators as such a price surge will drive profits for utilities and enhance dividend payouts.Again, President Trump’s repeal of the regulations (as imposed by President Obama) on economic growth grounds are expected to give a new lease of life to utilities that produce a major part of their electricity from coal. After all, Coal still accounts for nearly 30% of the electricity produced in the United States.Meanwhile, the utility sector is undergoing a massive transition with more focus on clean energy generation. The relaxed emission regulations under the Trump administration are likely to act as a driving factor for the sector. Stable operations, highly visible revenues and cash flows, combined with the sector’s income/yield attributes are some of its key features.There has been increasing focus on electricity storage facilities that will provide more support to the grid during peak demand period. Utilities are also regularly investing in infrastructure to better serve customers.Investing in Utilities: Our ChoicesUtility stocks with a low beta make for a judicious investment approach at this time. Beta, also known as the beta coefficient, measures the volatility of a stock in comparison to broader markets. It measures the extent to which a stock’s return may be affected or how much the price can fluctuate owing to market conditions. Stocks having a beta ranging from 0 to 1 mainly show less volatility than the broader markets.So, risk-averse investors would prefer to neutralize losses with low correlation beta as they are less prone to day-to-day fluctuations. For these investors, we have handpicked five low-beta stocks that also carry a favorable rank, making them potential investment options. These stocks carry either a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) as we expect them to outperform peers in the near future.

167,CNP,"Just when the key indexes ended three straight trading days in the green and market watchers thought that chances of a trade war have finally dimmed after a fearful month, the tables turned. Investors encountered new shockwaves late on Thursday when President Donald Trump announced a new set of $100 billion worth of tariffs against China. Following this announcement, market futures plummeted after the bell.Renewed fears of a trade war may find investors scurrying toward safe-haven sectors, which have already emerged as preferred investments. One of the most-popular, safe-haven sectors is utilities. This sector comprises companies that provide telephone, gas, water and electricity services. In this context, investors looking for stable dividend and interest income can invest in utilities.Tariffs on China Could Add Up to $153 BillionOn Thursday night, the President called China’s decision an “unfair retaliation,” and instructed the United States Trade Representative (USTR) to decide whether new tariffs of $100 billion should be imposed on Chinese goods. Trump added that these additional tariffs will be suitable per Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 and that the products will be selected accordingly.On Tuesday, the White House had announced new tariffs of $50 billion on more than 1,300 new Chinese products. Tariffs of 25% will be imposed on products ranging from aircraft batteries and parts to medical devices and flat-screen televisions. U.S.-China tensions started when Trump initially announced tariffs of around $3 billion on steel and aluminum imports from China in March.The reason for this war-like situation is China’s staggering $375-billion trade surplus with the United States in 2017, which the Trump administration is looking to reduce by at least $100 billion. Total U.S. tariffs on China now add up to around $153 billion. Following the United States’ tariff announcements, China also retaliated with similar moves.China Set To “Fight Back”China is clearly in no mood to sit back when the United States is gearing up to impose new tariffs on its imports. In fact, a spokesperson for China’s Ministry of Commerce said that the country does not want to enter into a trade war with the United States At the same time, China is “not afraid to fight a trade war.” He added that in case the United States sticks to its “protectionist trade practices,” China will not refrain from fighting back and instead will respond with “new comprehensive measures.”Most recently, China declared that it will levy tariffs on around 106 U.S. productsincluding soybeans, aircraft, chemicals and automobiles, with a total trading value of over $50 billion. Following the announcement of Trump’s steel and aluminum tariffs, China imposed tariffs of $3 billion on 128 American goods, with 15% duty levied on 120 products and 25% duty on other eight goods.China’s latest tariffs will definitely affect the U.S. economy as the exports to China were significant at $130 billion in 2017. China is the largest importer of soybeans from the United States, which was around $14 billion last year. Additionally, China’s import of aircraft equipment, oil seeds and oleaginous fruits, and motor vehicles was $16.3 billion, $12.4 billion and $10.6 billion, respectively in 2017.Buy These 5 Utility StocksWhile the recent trade war between the United States and China refuses to find any closure, investors should clearly look for defensive sectors. Utility stocks are good options in this regard.

168,CNP,"Dynegy Inc.  announced the closure of $180 million sale of its Lee Energy Facility to an affiliate of Rockland Capital, in Illinois. The deal has received approvals from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.Per the aforementioned deal, proceeds generated will be utilized toward debt reduction purposes.What Caused Dynegy’s Debt Levels to Rise?Since 2013, Dynegy has increased scale and shifted portfolio mix, from a coal-based portfolio to a gas-based one, with the support of several acquisitions. All of these were funded through a significant portion of the company’s existing debt. This caused considerable stress to the company’s balance sheet structure.Since then, the company has been working consistently to reduce its outstanding debt level.  Additionally, it has been taking steps to maintain a diverse liquidity program to support ongoing operations and commercial activities by issuing notes.Focus on Debt ReductionGoing forward, Dynegy is primarily focused on debt reduction, which is anticipated mainly from operating cash flows. Further, PRIDE initiatives and asset sales will aid in maintaining a healthy balance sheet, while managing debt maturities and improving leverage position.The company exited with total long-term debt of $9.2 billion as of Jun 30, 2017 compared with nearly $8.8 million at the end of 2016. Soon after, it completed the sale of its Dighton & Milford energy facilities to Starwood Energy Group Global for approximately $119 million, proceeds of which were used toward paying off debt. (Read more: Dynegy Continues to Lower Debt Burden, Sells $119M Assets).Our ViewThe power industry is a capital intensive and companies operating in this industry try to maintain a balance sheet with manageable debt levels supported by a flexible and diverse liquidity mix.We believe, Dynegy should continue with debt restructuring steps to improve current capital standing structure. Its aim of lowering debt burden, focus on making the most of its current fleet and efforts to deliver cost efficient power to customers will boost its performance in the long run.Going ahead, we expect the company’s ongoing debt restructuring steps will aid in bolstering the its efforts to maintain adequate cash balances, sufficient lines of credit and revolving credit facilities for supporting ongoing liquidity needs.Price MovementDynegy has underperformed the industry in the last 12 months.

169,CNP,"CMS Energy Corporation’s (CMS  -  Free Report) principal subsidiary, Consumers Energy recently announced that it will invest approximately $250 million to boost small businesses in Michigan over the next two and a half years, under the Pure Michigan Business Connect (PMBC) initiative.About PMBCThe Pure Michigan Business Connect (PMBC) developed by the Michigan Economic Development Corporation (MEDC) began as a multi-billion dollar public/private initiative in 2011. The initiative aims at connecting Michigan goods and service suppliers with corporate purchasers free of charge.Our ViewWe note that, being one of the founding members of PMBC, Consumers Energy has already spent approximately $2.9 billion with Michigan businesses under the initiative since June 2015. CMS Energy’s robust financial commitment toward the PMBC program not only reflects the solid financial flexibility it boasts but also is a testament to the company’s focus on expanding its business across Michigan.Moreover, PMBC’s commitment to generate new jobs is in line with the company’s aim of stimulating economic growth in the state. This in turn will aid small businesses to flourish.We believe CMS Energy aims at expanding customer base by boosting the small businesses. Indeed if business expansion takes place in the state, need for energy consumption will rise and CMS Energy being the largest energy provider in Michigan will surely benefit from that.As of 2015, Michigan is ranked 11th among the U.S. states in terms of energy consumption and with gradual growth in economy, the energy consumption is likely to grow. To tap this expanding market, energy providers like CMS Energy are taking varied initiatives to instil growth in the state and consequently enhance their business.Toward this, another utility provider, DTE Energy Company (DTE  -  Free Report) has recently commenced operations in its Lapeer solar park — one of the largest utility-owned solar parks, located in Michigan. On completion, the park is expected to generate sufficient clean energy to power 11,000 homes. (Read more : DTE Energy (DTE  -  Free Report) Brings Lapeer Solar Park Online in Michigan.) Price MovementCMS Energy has outperformed the industry in the last 12 months. The company’s shares have gained 19.4% compared with the industry’s growth of 13.3%.The company’s ongoing capital investments to strengthen infrastructure and initiatives to lower operation and maintenance expenses are driving its performance.Zacks Rank & Key PicksCMS Energy carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

170,CNP,"DTE Energy Company (DTE  -  Free Report) has recently started the commercial operation of its Lapeer solar park — one of the largest utility-owned solar parks, located east of the Mississippi River. The construction of the project started on the spring of 2016.Located in Lapeer, MI, the 200,000-panel array solar project covers over 250 acres. On completion, it is expected to generate sufficient clean energy to power 11,000 homes.Scope of Alternate EnergyRegulations pertaining to pollution control are becoming increasingly stringent, making it crucial for utilities to spend more on emission control infrastructure. Meanwhile, because of their clean-burning nature, investment in the alternate energy space could prove to be profitable over the long run. In particular, solar energy, which presently contributes to only 1.2% of the total electricity generation in the United States, represents ample scope of improvement in the days to come.Our ViewDue to declining costs of solar and wind energy producing technologies the global renewable energy market has been witnessing enhanced growth in the last two years. The trend to curb energy production from fossil fuel is gaining traction these days. DTE Energy is striving to position itself in this ever-expanding market.In an initiative to transform itself into a full-fledged renewable energy provider, DTE Energy in May announced its plan to get rid of all coal-fired units by 2040. The company is gradually trying to reduce carbon emissions by more than 80% by 2050 (compared to 2005 levels).Notably, the latest news was reported at a crucial time, when the United States slipped to the third position in the latest EY (Ernst &Young) Renewable energy country attractiveness index (RECAI). In fact, the new U.S. Government's decision to roll back many of the past administration's climate change policies, reviving the coal industry and repealing the U.S. Clean Power Plan has been hampering the growth trajectory of alternative energy industry.We believe that DTE Energy’s promise of sumptuous investment in the renewable energy space may uplift the nation on the RECAI. However, we remain on the sidelines considering the fact that President Trump has been calling the climate change a “Chinese Hoax” and has long been in favor of reviving the coal industry. It also remains a matter of question as to whether his newly made policies, if approved, will let energy providers like DTE Energy to wholly shift to renewable resources. In that case, the entire investment plan of DTE Energy will go down the drain, causing a loss for the company. The company has already spent more than $2 billion in wind and solar resources since 2009.Price MovementIn the last six months, shares of DTE Energy have returned 16.9% outperforming the industry’s growth of 8.7%.The company’s focus on expanding its renewable portfolio and gradual recovery of Michigan’s economy has most likely boosted its performance.Zacks Rank and Stock to ConsiderDTE Energy carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

171,CNP,"The AES Corporation (AES  -  Free Report) made an announcement regarding its operations in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, following the impact of Hurricanes Irma and Maria.AES Corp has aided and provided assistance to its employees and local communities in Puerto Rico that were critically impacted due to the devastating nature of the hurricanes.Impact of the HurricanesBoth the hurricanes caused significant disruptions to the AES Corp’s Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands operations. Notably, three of the company’s Puerto Rico power plants sustained damages. Its Puerto Rico’s 24 megawatt (MW) solar plant and one of the two units of its 524 MW coal-fired plant were impacted massively. Despite the damages, other unit is still able to generate electricity, while the damaged one is being reviewed.Details of the UpdateAES Corp has provided an update and reaffirmed 2017 guidance for all metrics. The company expects adjusted EPS to be in the lower half of the $1.00 to $1.10 range. An adverse impact of 3 cents to 5 cents is expected on the 2017 adjusted EPS guidance, primarily stemming from the sustained damages to aforementioned power plants and other business interruptions.How Have Utilities Been Impacted?According to BBC News, analysts had initially estimated that the United States will bear an economic cost of $300 billion from hurricane Irma alone. Meanwhile, hurricane Maria has been placed among the top 10 most intense Atlantic hurricanes on record, consequently hitting the company’s business in Puerto Rico quite hard.Toward this, utility operators like Duke Energy Corporation (DUK  -  Free Report) and NextEra Energy, Inc. (NEE  -  Free Report) the operations of which have been impacted due to the hurricanes have started undertaking several restoration steps to normalize operations.We expect impact of the hurricanes to show in third-quarter earnings of most utilities in the broader sector as it has severely affected the infrastructure of the state; nevertheless, investment toward restoration of service areas and infrastructure are likely to hurt the sector a little less than as previously anticipated.Price MovementShares of AES Corp have gained 3.6%, compared to the industry’s increase of 5.4% in the last three months.Weakness in overseas operation is adversely impacting the prospects of the company and cost of adherence to stringent environmental regulations can hurt margins.Zacks Rank & Key PickAES Corp currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

172,CNP,"CMS Energy Corporation’s (CMS  -  Free Report) subsidiary, CMS Enterprises, is set to buy Delta Solar, a 24-megawatt (MW) solar power project that comprises two phases. The project will offer sufficient energy to the Lansing Board of Water & Light to power 3,300 homes through a power purchase agreement.Details of the ProjectLocated on about 190 acres in Delta Township in Eaton County next to the General Motors Co.’s (GM  -  Free Report) Lansing Delta Assembly Plant, the Delta Solar project is currently under construction by Vermont-based groSolar, a subsidiary of EDF Renewable Energy. This latest project will become operational by the summer of 2018, which in turn will help the Lansing Board of Water & Light to attain its renewable energy goals.Once its work gets completed in 2018, Delta Solar will become Michigan’s second-largest solar power plant and is expected to create about 150 construction jobs.It represents CMS Energy's capability to help meet Michigan's need for new renewable energy sources as the state continues to grow.Other Renewable Projects of CMS EnergyAt present, CMS Energy has two solar power plants in Michigan, at Western Michigan University and Grand Valley State University. Also, it owns the Flambeau Solar plant in Wisconsin.Notably, the company's renewable energy commitment consists of wind farms in the Thumb and near Lake Michigan, besides the three biomass facilities in Michigan and North Carolina.Moreover, in order to meet the requirements of the renewable energy plan, the company signed a 15-year agreement in 2015 to purchase renewable capacity, energy, and RECs from a 100-MW wind park to be constructed in Huron County, MI. The wind park is expected to be online by 2017-end.Our ViewWith the increasing demand for renewable energy resources, companies are adopting clean energy procurement as a strategic business decision to support their growth and business bottom line. In this line, CMS Energy  has also increased its focus on clean power generation, apart from infrastructural upgrade, reliability improvement and capacity maximization. With renewable assets as the ultimate energy resources for our future, surely the Delta Solar project will prove to be beneficial for the company in the long run.  Moreover, groSolar has 20 years of leading solar development, engineering and construction experience. In fact, earlier in 2017 CMS Enterprises and groSolar had worked jointly to develop the 2.5-megawatt Flambeau Solar power plant in northern Wisconsin, the largest solar project in that state. We believe the latest project in Michigan will further strengthen the partnership between these two companies and once the power plant is completed, it will increase CMS Energy’s customer base.Price MovementCMS Energy has outperformed the industry in the last 12 months. The company’s shares have gained 13.6% compared with the industry’s growth of 8.1%.The company’s ongoing capital investments to strengthen its infrastructure and initiatives to lower operation and maintenance expenses are driving its performance.Stocks to ConsiderCMS Energy carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

173,CNP,"Alliant Energy Corp.’s (LNT  -  Free Report) Iowa Utility recently entered into an agreement with Apex Clean Energy for the construction of the 300-megawatt Upland Prairie Wind Farm, located in Clay and Dickinson counties, IA. The project is expected to power approximately 130,000 homes a year. The farm’s construction is anticipated to commence in the spring of 2018.Other DetailsAlliant Energy expects the wind farm to provide local tax benefits approximately worth $40 million over the life of the project. The company also forecasts to makelease payments of $45 million for the next 25 years to landowners, on account of this project.Notably, the company had received approval to add up to 500 megawatts (MW) of wind energy in 2016. In 2017, it filed for expansion of another 500 MW wind energy from the Iowa Utilities Board, which in turn will add new wind generation of 1,000 MW in Iowa. Cumulatively, the wind energy thus generated will be sufficient to power up to 430,000 Iowa homes a year. The combined projects represent an investment worth $1.8 billion.Our ViewWe believe that the above deal is in line with Alliant Energy’s long-term plans to invest heavily in natural gas and renewable assets over the next 10 years. Evidently, it has plans to invest nearly $11.3 billion over the 2016-2025 time frame. The company is currently concluding major construction projects on time and at or below budget.With the increasing demand for renewable energy resources, companies are adopting clean energy procurement as a strategic business decision to support their growth and business bottom line similar to Alliant Energy’s efforts to introduce cost-competitive wind energy for its customers. The latest project can be expected to boost up its future growth trajectory. Notably, such projects also enhance the company’s service reliability by adding more customers to its grid.Further, its expectation to add more construction and jobs is a testament to the fact that the company is focused to achieve its desired long-term growth through economic development in service areas.Price MovementAlliant Energy’s shares rallied 5.1% in the last three months compared with 4.3% gain of the industry it belongs to.The new electricity rates which were implemented during the month of April bolstered performance.Zacks Rank & Stocksto ConsiderAlliant Energy currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

174,CNP,"The Southern Company (SO  -  Free Report) recently received additional federal loan guarantee of $3.7 billion for Vogtle Project, emphasizing the government’s faith in the future of nuclear energy in the nation. Georgia Power, subsidiary of Southern Company, is the chief owner of the project with a 45.7% interest. The other co-owners include Oglethorpe Power, MEAG Power and Dalton Utilities.The Department of Energy (DOE) guaranteed $1.67 billion to Georgia Power for the project. Oglethorpe Power Corporation and three subsidiaries of Municipal Electric Authority of Georgia will also receive loan guarantees of $1.6 billion and $415 million, respectively. These additional loan guarantees extend the $8.3 million loan guarantees already issued for the project. The DOE had already granted loan guarantees of $6.5 billion to Georgia Power and Oglethorpe Power in 2014 and an additional support of $1.8 billion in 2015.The Vogtle nuclear reactors have been grappling with cost overruns and scheduling delays since the commencement of the construction of the project. Further, bankruptcy of Westinghouse, the major construction contractor of the two nuclear reactors of the plant, aggravated costs and led to additional delays. Since then a cloud of uncertainty has been hovering over the beleaguered plant. The project is already running three years behind schedule and is over budget by more than $10 billion which can go up to $20 billion by 2022.In June, Westinghouse’s parent company Toshiba Corporation agreed to provide a financial assistance of $3.68 billion for the development of two nuclear reactors. Moreover, the loan guarantees by the DOE is also likely to provide substantial support and encouragement in the completion of the construction of the nuclear reactors. The U.S. Secretary of Energy believes that such nuclear energy projects are important in promoting economic growth and strengthening the country’s energy and national security.The DOE believes that the plant will make the United States nuclear competitive, helping the nation catch up with the likes of Russia and China. Many nuclear proponents have also supported the company’s commitment toward nuclear power with zero emissions, finding it more reliable than solar and wind energy. With the decision to continue with the project, Vogtle plant in Georgia will be the only project which is under construction in the United States.The Georgia Public Service Commission is soon to complete the review process and take a final call regarding the expansion of the Vogtle project in February.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderSouthern Company is one of the largest and best-managed electric utility holding companies in the United States.

183,CNP,"DTE Energy Company (DTE  -  Free Report) unveils plans to double its electricity generation capacity from renewable resources of energy in the State of Michigan by 2022. The proposal is part of the company’s 2018 Renewable Energy Plan, which was submitted to the Michigan Public Service Commission on Mar 30.  The plan is in sync with DTE Energy’s earlier announced initiative to lower carbon emissions. Notably, the company projects to achieve this goal by reducing carbon emissions from its power plants up to 30%, 45%, 75% and more than 80% by early 2020s, 2030, 2040, and 2050, respectively.If approved, these projects will enable DTE Energy to produce 2,000 megawatts (MW) of renewable electricity along with boosting investments of more than $1.7 billion in Michigan. The entire work is scheduled to be completed by 2022, post regulatory nod.2018 Renewable Energy PlanPer the recently submitted Renewable Energy Plan, DTE Energy intends to generate additional 1,000 MW of electricity from new wind and solar projects in Michigan. These projects include the company’s Pine River and Polaris wind parks, which have the combined capacity to generate 330 MW. While Pine River is expected to commence commercial operations later in 2018, Polaris will be operational in 2019.The company plans to build two wind parks by 2022 that will produce around 375 MW of electricity and begin operations in 2021 and 2022. This includes a wind project with a capacity to generate 300 MW for large commercial customers.The plan has provisions for the installation of approximately 15 MW of new Michigan-based solar capacity over the next three years, which will enhance DTE Energy’s solar capacity by almost 25%. This includes the launch of a pilot program for battery storage technology to improve the overall reliability of energy resources.Our ViewThe recent filing outlines DTE Energy’s efforts to meet Michigan's Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) that requires the state’s electricity providers to generate 15% of their retail electricity sales from renewable energy resources by 2021. Notably, the company successfully lowered its carbon emissions in the last decade up to 25%, courtesy of investments worth $2.5 billion in Michigan and the addition of 1,000 megawatts of wind and solar capacity.In fact, DTE Energy is investing steadily to enhance its renewable generation assets. Over the next 15 years, DTE Electric plans to lower coal-fired generation and boost natural gas-fired generation and renewables mix. In this context, DTE Electric retired four coal-fired generation units at its Trenton Channel, River Rouge and St. Clair facilities and announced plans to retire by 2023. The units at the Belle River and Monroe facilities are expected to be retired by 2040. These facilities will be replaced with natural gas-fired generation and renewables.Moreover, the recent tax reform has compelled the company to reduce electricity and gas rates. On Jan 23, 2018, DTE Energy announced that it has reduced its electricity and gas rates by 3% to pass on the tax savings to its customers. This is expected to widen the company’s customer base. The gains from lower tax rate will enable it to upgrade its infrastructure and invest in clean energy generation.We expect the recent developments to enable DTE Energy to achieve its target of reducing, carbon emissions by 80% in 2050 by incorporating new renewable energy projects and eventually transitioning its power sources from coal to natural gas as well as renewable.Price PerformanceDTE Energy’s shares have gained 2% in the last 12 months, against the broader industry’s decline of 2.9%. The outperformance can be attributed to the company’s disciplined capital spending program and investments to enhance renewable generation assets.Zacks Rank & Key Picks    DTE Energy carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in the same space are CenterPoint Energy (CNP  -  Free Report) and Dynegy  and Exelon Corporation (EXC  -  Free Report).

186,CNP,"Dominion Energy, Inc. (D  -  Free Report) announced that it has already taken steps to lower its present debt levels. The company decided to sell its non-core assets, issue equity and go ahead with its planned capital reduction to achieve targeted leverage ratio.In February 2018, Dominion Energy borrowed $950 million under a 364-Day Term Loan Agreement that bears interest at a variable rate. In addition, the agreement contains a maximum allowed total debt to total capital ratio of 67.5%. So, the initiatives undertaken by the company will allow it to trim debt levels and meet its target.At present, the total debt-to-capital ratio of the company stands at 74.18%, much higher than its industry average of 55.03%. The decision to lower debt levels amid rising interest rates is a well-timed one by management.At 2017 end, Dominion Energy’s total interest expenses and other related charges were $1,205 million, up 19.3% from 2016 levels.  Reaffirms GuidanceTaking into consideration the initiatives to reduce its current debt levels, Dominion Energy reaffirmed its first quarter and full-year 2018 earnings per share guidance of 95 cents-$1.15 and $3.80-$4.25 per share, respectively.

Quite naturally, the Fed expects to increase interest rates two more times in 2018.The capital intensive Utility sector might cringe at the thought of it for it takes recourse to external sources of financing to meet its capital requirements. In a way, rising interest rates increase this sector’s cost of capital, leaving an adverse impact on margins.

187,CNP,"U.S. stocks not only suffered their worst week in more than two years but are also on the brink of logging the worst March. Trump-China trade war rhetoric is threatening global economic growth, while a tighter monetary policy is about to hinder the bull run that began almost a decade ago.A third party firm improperly keeping Facebook, Inc.

This in turn disrupted tech’s growth trajectory, which for long helped the broader market scale north.With the markets going through a rough patch, investing in stocks that provide excellent risk-adjusted returns seems judicious.Stocks to Face Worst MarchIt has been a rough month for the broader market. The Dow Jones is on the verge to see its worst March after it had tanked 8.97% almost 40 years back, per the WSJ Market Data Group. In fact, the blue-chip gauge lost more than 1,400 points over the last five trading sessions, marking the index’s steepest weekly percentage loss since 2016.The broader S&P 500 is also on the brink of its ugliest March in 17 years, when it had slumped 6.4%. The benchmark index turned negative for the year and is around 10% below its all-time high hit earlier this year. In addition, the tech-laden Nasdaq will witness an excruciating March decline since 2001. Meanwhile, Wall Street’s so-called fear-gauge, the Cboe Volatility Index, soared 57% last week, well above its long-term average of 20. This invariably shows that bearish bets continue to outdo their bullish counterparts in the indices so far this month.But, what has triggered such a selloff leading to U.S. stocks ending in their worst week in years?Restrictive Trade Policy, Rising Interest RatesSelling in stocks intensified after the Trump administration announced that it will levy tariffs on tens of billions of dollars of Chinese imports on top of imposing duties on foreign steel and aluminum. In response to Trump’s tariffs, Beijing said that it will target 128 U.S. products with an import value of $3 billion. These products mostly include U.S pork, fresh fruit, dried fruits, steel pipes, modified ethanol, ginseng and wine.Such heated trade rhetoric doesn’t bode well for the American economy. If a full-fledged trade war takes place, the United States might slip into a recession in the near future and the jobless rate might more than double from current levels. Tariffs on the U.S. will lead to rise in inflation along with an uptick in import prices, provoking the Fed to hike rates. And we all know that easy monetary policy so far has helped the U.S. stock market celebrate its nine-year bull run. Investors had piled up on U.S. stocks with the notion that quantitative easing will help the domestic economy grow at a better rate than emerging economies like China.Fed, by the way, has tightened its monetary policy. At the conclusion of the FOMC meeting on Mar 21, Jerome Powell-led Federal Reserve hiked interest rates by a quarter-percentage point and projected a steeper path of rate hikes in 2019 and 2020. The vote to lift the benchmark lending rate was a unanimous 8-0. Thus, the broader market might keep falling as long as the Fed continues to remain hawkish.The Facebook FiascoAdding to the downbeat tone is a sharp selloff in the technology sector. Investors remained concerned about tighter regulations for large tech companies. Lest we forget, tech shares have gained the most so far this year.However, the sector took a beating following the backlash over Facebook’s handling of user data. Everyone raised questions as to how Cambridge Analytica, which worked on Trump’s election campaign, had gained access to personal data on roughly 50 million Facebook users without their knowledge. Facebook shares saw a weekly decline of 14%, the biggest since 2012. Other tech behemoths, including Apple and Google-parent Alphabet, lost more than 7% in the week.Time to Buy 5 Ultra-Safe StocksAs March is plagued by fears of a trade war, rising rates and data mining scandal, investing in low-risk assets and a combination of parameters that lead to better returns seems judicious.The best way to go about doing this is by creating a portfolio of low-beta stocks, which are inherently less volatile than the markets they trade in.

192,CNP,"Entergy Corp.’s (ETR  -  Free Report) subsidiary, Entergy New Orleans, has recently received the New Orleans City Council’s approval to construct a natural-gas fired power plant in the city. Notably, this latest development is in sync with the company’s efforts to include renewable energy in its generation resource portfolio for diversification.About the Plant The New Orleans power station, composed of seven natural gas-fired reciprocating engines, comes with an electricity generation capacity worth 128 megawatt (MW). Entergy expects the plant to commence its services by January 2020.Entergy will invest $210 million in this project, which includes transmission and other project-related costs and contingency. Moreover, it expects to issue a full notice to proceed to the engineering, procurement and construction contractor by end of March 2018.Impressively, the reciprocating engines installed in this plant have self-start capability, thus enabling the company to start the unit even when there is no power on the electric grid. These engines will also help in grid stability and storm restoration by providing a local source of power generation. Markedly, the New Orleans Power Station will use minimal groundwater.Economic Benefits of the PlantApart from generating clean energy, the power plant will help in boosting New Orleans’ economic development. According to Louisiana economist, Dr. Loren Scott, the plant's construction phase will generate new business sales worth $206 million in Orleans Parish and new household earnings worth more than $28 million in for parish residents.Moreover, during the construction, an average of 92 people will get employment per year while the Orleans Parish treasury will gain approximately $1 million in the form of new sales taxes into. On completion, the plant will employ approximately 20 people.Our ViewAfter realizing the fact that alternative energy sources like solar, wind and natural gas are important for future, many electric utilities have started restructuring their generation resource portfolio to include renewable energy. In this context, Entergy is no exception. In fact, we believe the New Orleans power plant is part of the company’s commitment toward pursuing up to 100 MW of renewable resources to serve its New Orleans customers, which account for more than 20,000 individuals.Notably, retail sales of electricity in Louisiana, the state in which New Orleans resides, are among the highest in the United States.  Per a U.S. Energy Information Administration (“EIA”) report,  total renewables used in the electric power sector are projected to increase 41% in 2018.  Naturally, electricity providers will try to make most of this opportunity and enhance their renewable resource portfolio in this state. Therefore, in line with this, the construction of the natural-gas fired power plant seems to be a strategically efficient decision by Entergy.Furthermore, with Louisiana being one of the top five natural gas-producing states in the country, the New Orleans plant is expected to never run out of natural-gas reserve. This will allow Entergy to cater to the growing demand for electricity in the city and in turn boost its profit margin.Price MovementIn a year’s time, Entergy’s shares have gained 4.2% against the broader industry’s decline of 3.7%. The outperformance can be attributed to the company’s disciplined investment in growth projects for the modernization of grid along with evolving customer demand and regulatory support to recover investments. Zacks Rank & Key PicksEntergy has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

194,CNP,"Power supplier Southern Company’s (SO  -  Free Report) subsidiary, Georgia Power’s customers are expected to gain from the federal Tax Reform Legislation passed in December 2017. The cutback in the federal corporate income tax rate to 21% from 35% is likely to result in a savings of $1.2 billion for the Georgia Power customers. The savings would take place over the next two years. Georgia Public Service Commission (""PSC"") has also confirmed the benefits as part of the agreement with Georgia Power.The legislative reform will lower the taxes by $130 million on financing costs of the company’s controversial Vogtle Plant.  It would also result in $330 million of direct credits to customers over the next two years. Additionally, it will include $700 million in future benefits to be incorporated in Georgia Power's next rate case.The lower tax rate is likely to result in a residential customer (consuming an average of 1,000 kilowatt-hours per month) to receive around $70 per month in refunds over the two-year period.Early this year, Georgia Power announced a cost reduction of $139 million for its consumers in 2018 related to the Vogtle expansion.  Effective from April, the customers will pay $2.70 less than expected per month in financing costs for the Vogtle project.Zacks Rank and Key PicksSouthern Company carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

195,CNP,"Avista Corp.’s (AVA  -  Free Report) operating division Avista Utilities, recently filed an Electric Integrated Resource Plan (IRP) for 2017 with the Washington and Idaho public utility commissions. The IRP is a 20-year plan to cater to the needs of customers by providing them a source of safe and cost-effective energy.The recently filed IRP is in sync with the company’s strategy of meeting customers’ energy demands by 2026, which it intends to achieve through adequate resources and controlled generation contracts.Details of the PlanThe company submits an electric IRP with the authorities every two years containing the details regarding projected growth in energy demand along with new resources required to serve customers over the next 20 years.Per the latest IRP, Avista’s existing generation resources are cost effective and reliable enough to meet the needs of customers over the next 20 years. Additionally, the company is going to develop of a 15 megawatt MW (DC) solar facility for its commercial and industrial customers.Outcome of 2017 IRPAvista’s projected greenhouse gas emissions associated with the generation portfolio in this IRP is 29% lower than the projected greenhouse gas emissions as identified in the 2015 IRP. Along with this, the company’s current energy storage costs are also significantly lower than the last IRP, per the current IRP plan.Additionally, the company anticipates customer load growth to decrease to 0.5% in the 2018-2037 IRP timeframe, replacing the 0.6% projected growth in the 2015 IRP. The company currently derives more than 50% of total generation capacity from hydro, wind and biomass renewable sources. Given Avista’s focus on generating more electricity from renewable sources, we expect renewable energy contribution to increase further from the present level.With the help of the new IRP, the company aims to add newer solar resources and additional renewable options to cater to the needs of its customers. Taking into consideration the above factors, the company seems well poised to fulfill the customers’ needs along with balancing environmental responsibility.Price MovementIn the past year, Avista has outperformed the industry.

196,CNP,"We issued an updated research report on Entergy Corporation (ETR  -  Free Report) on Aug 29. Of late, Entergy is gradually shifting from being a hybrid to a pure-play utility.The company began this process by closing Vermont Yankee power plant in 2014. Going forward, it plans to shut down its Palisades power plant in October 2018 and its Pilgrim plant in May 2019. In April 2020 and 2021, the company plans to close Indian Point Units 2 and 3. The company aims to increase investments toward the modernization of grid buoyed by rising customer demand and favorable regulatory support.Of the recently made investments, in April 2017, the company signed a purchase and sale agreement with a subsidiary of Calpine Corporation. Per the deal, Calpine will construct the plant, which will consist of two natural gas-fired combustion turbine units with a total nominal capacity of approximately 360 MW. Once completed in 2021, Entergy will purchase the plant for $261 million.To diminish the risk and volatility in the EWC business, the company is gradually reducing its EWC footprint. In line with this, the EWC earned 10.2% less net income in second-quarter 2017 for the company compared to the prior-year quarter’s level.On the flip side, higher nuclear labor costs are hampering the company’s operational growth, which in turn is escalating its nuclear generation expense. Moreover, Entergy recently witnessed lower generation from its nuclear plants, primarily due to an increase in outage days and lower fuel expense which resulted from impairments.This might have lead the company to underperform its broader market. Evidently, Entergy’s share price has gained 2.8% in the last one year, compared to its broader industry's gain of 8%.The company also faces tough competition from its peers like Ameren Corporation (AEE  -  Free Report), CenterPoint Energy, Inc.

197,CNP,"Xcel Energy Inc. (XEL  -  Free Report) announced that it has filed a stipulation with the Colorado Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) to invest in clean energy in rural Colorado. The filed stipulation is a broad collaboration between Xcel Energy and 14 other diverse groups.According to the filing, Xcel Energy seeks permission from CPUC to invest approximately $2.5 billion in rural Colorado, to increase its clean energy portfolio. The company has vouched that the approval will not increase customers’ bill.The Colorado Energy PlanXcel Energy stated that their aim is to provide low-cost power and increase the use of cleaner energy in its service area. If approved, the proposal will increase the company’s renewable energy portfolio to 55% by 2026. It will also be very effective in enabling customers to save money and reduce carbon emission by almost 60% by 2026 as compared with 2005 level. As of now, Xcel Energy has lowered its emission level by 30% from 2005 levels and is on track to lower it by 45% through 2021.

Xcel Energy is currently diversifying its generation portfolio with emphasis on renewable sources. To this end, it is planning to invest about $4.2 billion in wind assets over the next three years.Focus on Green Energy by Utility Service ProvidersXcel Energy is not the only company undertaking additional measures to reduce carbon emission by reducing coal usage and increasing use of renewable energy, even when President Trump is actively promoting the usage of coal, to revive the industry.NextEra Energy's (NEE  -  Free Report) subsidiary, Florida Power & Light Company (FPL), has bought out existing contracts with two independent coal-fired power plants with the goal of shutting down both plants, thereby saving hundreds of millions of dollars for customers and reducing green house gas emission.Another utility giant who is investing heavily in clean power is Duke Energy (DUK  -  Free Report). The company’s five-year plan includes investment of $3.3 billion in highly-efficient natural gas-fired combined-cycle plants. The company has brought down emission level by almost 30% compared to the 2005, by retiring coal plants and bringing on more natural gas and renewable.With clean energy as the ultimate future, such initiatives adopted by utilities like Xcel Energy will surely help them to capture increased shares in the renewable energy market, which boasts a multi-billion dollar opportunity.Price MovementShares of Xcel Energy have returned 20.1% in the last one year outperforming the industry’s growth of 7.8% in the same time period.Xcel Energy’s disciplined investments in infrastructure projects and focus on renewable expansion might have led to this outperformance.Zacks Ranks and Other Stock to ConsiderXcel Energy currently holds a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

205,CNP,"The AES Corporation (AES  -  Free Report) is set to release second-quarter 2017 results before the opening bell on Aug 8.Last quarter, the company posted a negative earnings surprise of 15.00%. Moreover, the company missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, with an average negative surprise of 6.59%.Let’s see how things are shaping up at the company prior to this announcement.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that AES Corp is likely to beat estimates this season because it has the right combination of two key ingredients. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to be able to beat estimates, and AES Corp has the right mix.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP for the company is +4.76%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate stands at 22 cents, higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 21 cents. This is a meaningful indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: AES Corp holds a Zacks Rank #2, which, when combined with a positive ESP, makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat this quarter.Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Ranks #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.The AES Corporation Price and EPS Surprise The AES Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | The AES Corporation QuoteFactors at PlayDuring the second quarter, AES Corp entered into a joint venture (JV) with ENGIE to market and sell LNG from the former’s Panamanian LNG terminal to third parties in Central America. This JV will utilize the tank’s remaining capacity by selling additional LNG using its terminal. Its success is likely to get reflected in the company’s increased revenues from selling more LNG, in the upcoming results.During the first quarter earnings call, the company announced a handful of strategies in its pipeline. These include merging its European and Asian strategic business units as a cost saving initiative as well as repositioning its portfolio towards businesses that are less carbon-intensive and have long-term US dollar-denominated contracts. Further updates on these strategies can be witnessed once the company releases its second-quarter numbers.Also, in addition to $300 million that AES Corp has already received from the sale of its Sul business in Brazil, management expects to get $500 million in asset sale proceeds. A part of these proceeds can be anticipated in the soon-to-be reported results.For the second quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings projects growth of 23.5%, while the consensus for revenues hints at a decline of 0.6% on a year-over-year basis.Other Stock that Warrant a LookHere is another Utility stock worth considering on the basis of our model, which shows that it has the right combination to pull off a beat.TELUS Corp.

207,CNP,"In one of the most devastating tropical storms in 50 years -- Hurricane Harvey -- the city of Houston was the worst hit. The storm ravaged through the city causing widespread damage to properties as well as human lives. Catastrophic flooding further added to the woes.Among the 16 sectors in our Zacks Coverage Universe, Energy and Insurance sectors have lost the most. In addition, Utility sector also suffered since catastrophic flooding affected transmission lines in many regions of the state, forcing thousands to deal with power cuts.Harvey’s Effect in TexasAccording to Texas Governor Greg Abbott, the impact of Harvey was far greater than that of Hurricane Katrina, which affected New Orleans in 2005.The U.S. government requested Congress for an aid of $7.85 billion for rescue operations in Texas and Louisiana. However, Governor Abbott, in his latest interview to BBC News, claimed that Texas will need an assistance of $180 billion to recuperate from the loss. Notably this is higher than his earlier provided estimate of $125 billion worth aid.Harvey’s Impact on UtilitiesPer the latest report provided by the Electric Reliablity Council of Texas (ERCOT), as of Sep 1, certain areas in the state of Texas will continue to experience outages due to Harvey. This is because two major 345-kV transmission lines in the state are still out of service, including the one in Houston.Moreover, about 7,500 MW of generation resource capacity remains unavailable or is operating at reduced capacity.According to ERCOT’s report, none of the major utilities in this area have suffered any notable damages in their generation fleet or power generating system, thanks to advanced infrastructural development. However, most of their customers suffered significant power outages, which in turn may impact their third-quarter bottom-line results.Although, utility providers are trying their best to restore the system, it is difficult to exactly forecast the time of full restoration as it depends on the extent of damage and location of the outage. Moreover, continued flooding is likely to delay restoration in many areas and lead to new outages.Naturally, electricty flow from utility providers that operate in Texas suffered extensively due to this category 4 hurricane, which had earlier been predicted to be a category 3 storm.Utilities Hit by HarveyConsidering the fact that Houston is the fourth most populous city of the United States, demand for electricity is also high. Coming to the state’s statistics, Texas is the second-largest economy among the U.S. states and is the largest electricity consumer, as per latest report by the U.S. Energy Information Administration. This made the state a well desired abode for utility players to expand their business.However, Harvey’s impact on the state’s properties hampered the smooth flow of electricity through the transmission lines, leading to widespread outages and are expected to affect the growth of the following three utilities.American Electric Power Company, Inc. (AEP  -  Free Report): AEP Texas, a subsidiary of American Electric Power, is engaged in the transmission and distribution of electric power to approximately 1 million retail customers in west, central and southern Texas. It encompasses the AEP service territory in the ERCOT.The company’s shares have lost 0.8%, following the impact of Harvey. It currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).CenterPoint Energy, Inc. (CNP  -  Free Report): Houston Electric, a subsidiary of CenterPoint Energy,engages in the electric transmission and distribution business in the Texas Gulf Coast area including the city of Houston. It is also a member of the ERCOT.The company’s shares have lost 1% due to Harvey’s impact. It currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Entergy Corporation (ETR  -  Free Report): Entergy Texas, a subsidiary of Entergy Corp., engages in the electric transmission and distribution business in the Texas.The company’s shares have declined 1% owing to Harvey. It currently carries a Zacks Rank #3.Bottom LineHarvey not only destroyed properties in Texas but also left an indelible mark on the lives of many. However, no one can deny the fact that the enormous investments which Utilities have been making in infrastructural developments to upgrade their transmission lines and grid system have paid well during this period of crisis. Thus it can be said that though Harvey had been one of the worst storms to affect America in the recent past, the damages that occurred to the grids and transmission lines were not equally extensive.However, owing to safety issues distributors snapped electricity in flooded areas resulting in prolonged outages. Though the operating profits of the utility providers are likely to be impacted by the move, the extent of the same would have been much higher had the grid system been affected. Nevertheless, with Hurricane Irma knocking on the doors, utility providers may need to brace themselves from yet another tropical storm and its aftermath.Zacks' 10-Minute Stock-Picking SecretSince 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year.

212,CNP,"CenterPoint Energy, Inc. (CNP  -  Free Report) will release second-quarter 2017 financial results before the market opens on Aug 3.In the prior quarter, the company reported a positive earnings surprise of 2.78%. However, CenterPoint underperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing four quarters, with an average negative earnings surprise of 2.94%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for the company prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayCenterPoint witnessed increased customer count and throughput during first-quarter 2017, primarily due to acquisitions of Atmos Energy Marketing (AEM) and the Energy Services business. Going ahead, similar solid performance from Energy Services is expected in second quarter and beyond, buoyed by increased operating income. Also, the AEM acquisition is likely to be modestly accretive this year, even after accounting for integration expenses. We expect to receive further updates on these once the company releases its second-quarter results.The company's service territories witnessed more or less warmer-than-normal temperatures during the second quarter. This will result in higher household expenditure on cooling, which might boost its revenues in the to-be-reported quarter.However, in the second quarter, a handful of tornados and thunderstorms hit Texas. With the state being the primary service region for CenterPoint, it exposed the company’s utility plants to damage and consequent expenditures. Any damage to these plants by these storms might weigh down on the company’s profitability in the second quarter.For the second quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings projects an improvement of 15.6%, while the consensus for revenues hints at an improvement of almost 13.75% on a year-over-year basis.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that CenterPoint is likely to beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: CenterPoint has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 20 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: CenterPoint carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the Earnings ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult.Meanwhile, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.CenterPoint Energy, Inc.

216,CNP,"Dynegy Inc.  recently concluded the offering of senior notes worth $850 million, with an interest rate of 8.125%, due 2026.Per the offering, Dynegy will use the proceeds from the senior notes offering as well as yields from the sale of Troy and Armstrong facilities in July, and cash in hand worth $480 and $200 million, respectively. This will be utilized to repay a principal amount of approximately $1.25 billion of its outstanding senior notes, carrying interest rate of 6.75%, due 2019.The company will also pay in advance part of its outstanding senior secured term loan worth $200 million, and use the remainder of the proceeds for the fulfillment of payment obligations in relation with fees and corporate purpose expenditure.Ongoing Debt ReductionDynegy has been working on its strategy to strengthen balance sheet and monetize non-core assets, while using the proceeds to fund growth projects and utilize the excess toward debt lowering purposes. In February 2017, the company completed The Illinois Power Holdings (Genco) financial restructuring program and repaid debts worth $640 million.Going forward, the company also has plans to sell a certain portion of assets in Southeastern New England subject to federal approvals.

The company’s shares lost 21.5% against the industry’s gain of 8.2%.The price underperformance can be attributed to the earnings volatility that Dynegy has been facing for quite some time now, due to volatility in supply, fuel price volatility, interest rates, and other seasonal factors.Stocks to ConsiderDynegy currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Investors can consider better-ranked stocks like NextEra Energy, Inc.
