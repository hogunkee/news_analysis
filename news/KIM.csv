0,KIM,"Critics of Donald Trump claim there is no rhyme or reason to his foreign policy. But if there is a consistency, it might be called reciprocity.Trump tries to force other countries to treat the U.S. as it treats them. In ""don't tread on me"" style, he also warns enemies that any aggressive act will be replied to in kind.The underlying principle of Trump commercial reciprocity it that the United States is no longer powerful or wealthy enough to alone underwrite the security of the West. It can no longer assume sole enforcement of the rules and protocols of the postwar global order.This year there have been none of the usual Iranian provocations — frequent during the Obama administration — of harassing American ships in the Persian Gulf. Apparently, the Iranians now realize that anything they do to an American ship will be replied to with overwhelming force.Ditto North Korea. After lots of threats from Kim Jong Un about using his new ballistic missiles against the United States, Trump warned that he would use America's far greater arsenal to eliminate North Korea's arsenal for good.Trump is said to be undermining NATO by questioning its usefulness some 69 years after its founding. Yet unlike 1948, Germany is no longer down. The United States is always in. And Russia is hardly out, but instead cutting energy deals with the Europeans.More importantly, most NATO countries have failed to keep their promises to spend 2% of their GDP on defense.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseYet the vast majority of the 29 alliance members are far closer than the U.S. to the dangers of Middle East terrorism and supposed Russian bullying.Why does Germany by design run up a $65 billion annual trade surplus with the United States? Why does such a wealthy country spend only 1.2% of its GDP on defense? And if Germany has entered into energy agreements with a supposedly dangerous Vladimir Putin, why does it still need to have its security subsidized by the American military?Trump approaches NAFTA in the same reductionist way. The 24-year-old treaty was supposed to stabilize, if not equalize, all trade, immigration and commerce between the three supposed North American allies.It never quite happened that way. Unequal tariffs remained. Both Canada and Mexico have substantial trade surpluses with the U.S. In Mexico's case, it enjoys a $71 billion surplus, the largest of U.S. trading partners with the exception of China.Canada never honored its NATO security commitment. It spends only 1% of its GDP on defense, rightly assuming that the U.S. will continue to underwrite its security.During the lifetime of NAFTA, Mexico has encouraged millions of its citizens to enter the U.S. illegally. Mexico's selfish immigration policy is designed to avoid internal reform, to earn some $30 billion in annual expatriate remittances, and to influence U.S. politics.Yet after more than two decades of NAFTA, Mexico is more unstable than ever. Cartels run entire states. Murders are at a record high. Entire towns in southern Mexico have been denuded of their young males, who crossed the U.S. border illegally.The U.S. runs a huge trade deficit with China. The red ink is predicated on Chinese dumping, patent and copyright infringement, and outright cheating. Beijing illegally occupies neutral islands in the South China Sea, militarizes them and bullies it neighbors.All of the above has become the ""normal"" globalized world.But in 2016, red-state America rebelled at the asymmetry. The other half of the country demonized the red-staters as protectionists, nativists, isolationists, populists and nationalists.However, if China, Europe and other U.S. trading partners had simply followed global trading rules, there would have been no Trump pushback — and probably no Trump presidency at all.Had NATO members and NAFTA partners just kept their commitments, and had Mexico not encouraged millions of its citizens to crash the U.S. border, there would now be little tension between allies.Instead, what had become abnormal was branded the new normal of the postwar world.Again, a rich and powerful U.S. was supposed to subsidize world trade, take in more immigrants than all the nations of the world combined, protect the West, and ensure safe global communications, travel and commerce.After 70 years, the effort had hollowed out the interior of America, creating two separate nations of coastal winners and heartland losers.Trump's entire foreign policy can be summed up as a demand for symmetry from all partners and allies, and tit-for-tat replies to would-be enemies.Did Trump have to be so loud and often crude in his effort to bully America back to reciprocity?Who knows?But it seems impossible to imagine that globalist John McCain, internationalist Barack Obama or gentlemanly Mitt Romney would ever have called Europe, NATO, Mexico, and Canada to account, or warned Iran or North Korea that tit would be met by tat.More Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

1,KIM,"RH (RH), the upscale furniture chain formerly known as Restoration Hardware, is soaring after beating Q1 earnings views and lifting 2018 guidance late Monday, continuing a string of wild post-earnings stock swings.Estimates: Analysts polled by Zacks Investment Research expect RH earnings to soar to $1.01 a share from 5 cents a share. Revenue should tick up 0.4% to $564 million. Same-store sales are expected to dip 0.9%, according to Consensus Metrix.Results: Adjusted diluted EPS rose nearly 27-fold from the prior-year quarter to $1.33, on revenue of $557 million. Comparable brand revenue grew 1%.The major profit figure reflects ""the power of our new membership model, our unique and proprietary product offering, our efforts to revolutionize physical retailing, and our work designing a massively more efficient operating platform,"" said RH CEO Gary Friedman in a press release late Monday.Outlook: RH management raised full-year guidance to adjusted EPS of $6.34-$6.83 vs. prior outlook for $5.45 to $6.20. It reaffirmed revenue of $2.53 billion-$2.57 billion. Analysts expect $5.85 EPS and $2.555 billion.For the current quarter, RH sees $1.70-$1.77 EPS and $655 million-$662 million in revenue. Consensus is for $1.48 EPS and $658 million in sales.The company said it expects revenue to accelerate through the current quarter and the back half of the fiscal year. Four new galleries are planned for 2018 in Portland, Nashville, Yountville and New York; the latter three locations will feature wine bars, cafes and, in Yountville's case, an outpost of the Doughnut Vault. Hospitality is a growing business within RH.Friedman maintained his view that RH can be a $4 billion-$5 billion business in North America.Stock: Shares shot up 30% to 154.74 on the stock market today, setting their eighth straight gain and a record 164.49 intraday.Post-result big swings aren't unusual for this stock: RH has a history of major post-earnings moves, including a 22.5% surge the day after March's Q4 results, a 25.8% pop after November's Q3 pre-announcement, and a 44.8% jump after Q2 results. Last year's Q1 results prompted a 25.7% plunge.Shares of Williams-Sonoma (WSM) advanced 1.6%. Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY) climbed 0.2% and Pier 1 Imports (PIR) rose 2.1%, both erasing intraday losses.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseRH's retail strategy runs counter to the industry trend of going smaller and going online. RH offers an annual membership program that provides discounts. Its massive ""design galleries,"" which span multiple floors and tens of thousands of square feet, sometimes feature high-end restaurants.No fewer than 32 marriage proposals took place at RH's 3 Arts Club Cafe in Chicago in one year, said Friedman on the December earnings call.""Thirty-two marriage proposals in the middle of a furniture store,"" he told analysts then. ""You can't make that up, right?""RH's newer showrooms will occupy less square footage, but the company is going ahead with plans to open more locations. Food and beverage should account for ""a third, maybe more"" of the new prototypes' business, said Friedman in March. He said on the most recent earnings call that the restaurants are ""clearly driving incremental traffic"" to RH's showrooms.YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED IN: After Hours: Trump-Kim Summit On Tap; These 4 Stocks Are Big MoversDave & Buster's Q1 Beats But This VR Game May Rewrite FutureThese 5 Financial Stocks Are In Or Near Buy ZonesTrump-Kim Summit, E3, Key Antitrust Ruling Lead Action Plan Retail & E-Commerce Stocks And Industry News

3,KIM,"Stocks opened to very tight gains on Monday, ahead of a heavy week of political and policy events. The world's attention is trained on Tuesday's summit between President Trump and North Korea's Kim Jong Un, but a Wednesday press conference with Fed Chair Jerome Powell will be a focal point for investors.The Dow Jones industrial average managed a 0.2% gain. The S&P 500 added 0.1%, with utilities Sempra Energy (SRE) and PG&E (PCG) posting the index's largest rise and fall, respectively.The Nasdaq Composite struggled with a gain of less than 0.1%,The Dow posted a 2.8% gain last week, its best since early March. The S&P 500 climbed 1.6% and the Nasdaq notched a 1.2% gain. The result left the Nasdaq at a new high, the Dow holding comfortably above the 25,000 mark and the S&P 500 less than 1% below 2,800.On the political front, markets showed little reaction to an early U.S. exit from a fractious G7 meeting over the weekend. The result set a disappointing tone on progress toward international trade agreements, but markets settled into the quiet trade that is customary head of Federal Reserve meetings.A diplomatic summit set for Tuesday between President Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is historic, although it has no specific targets. The tone of the two leaders, and the tweets that follow the meeting, could have some bearing on market behavior.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

Powell's press conference will be of particular interest, as investors look for clues as to whether the Fed is leaning toward one or two more rate hikes for the rest of the year.Bond markets also will be under the microscope as the ECB meets on Thursday. Few expect the bank will increase its interest rates. But expectations are high the bank will lay out an exit strategy from its massive bond-buying stimulus program begun in 2009.Sempra surged nearly 15% after a letter from activist hedge fund Elliott Management to the San Diego-based company's board outlined a strategy to unlock value in the $26.6 billion market capitalization stock. Moves included replacing six board members, and creating a Strategic Review Committee of the Board. Sempra shares are down 18% from a November 2017 high.PG&E skidded 6% lower. A report released late last week by the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection determined that 12 fires in Northern California, which killed 18 people and burned 174,000 acres in October 2017, were the result of power lines or equipment owned by PG&E. PG&E shares ended Friday 42% below their September high.

The stock ended Friday less than 6% below a buy point at 274.76. Shares are up 26% over the past 12 months, but the stock's Relative Strength line is lagging.Oil prices pulled back sharply, continuing recent volatility ahead of a June 22 meeting of the Organization of Petroleum Producing Countries. News reports said Saudi Arabia was increasing production ahead of the meeting. Many expect Saudi and non-OPEC member Russia to alter or remove production caps put in place in 2016. In addition, Reuters reported that the Trump administration, a day before exiting the Iran anti-nuclear deal, made a direct request for Saudi Arabia to increase production in order to offset the oil price impact of renewed sanctions against Iran.Oil traded down about 1% early Monday.

7,KIM,"The U.S. and North Korea agreed to seek complete denuclearization of the Korean peninsula following a historic summit between President Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un, yet the accord set no deadline and left the path to disarmament undefined.Trump defended the two-page document he signed with Kim at the end of their meeting in Singapore earlier Tuesday, saying that he thinks his North Korean counterpart will live up to to it. ""It's very comprehensive,"" the president said. ""It's going to happen.""Even with Kim's promise to eliminate his nuclear arsenal, Trump said the U.S. will maintain economic sanctions on Pyongyang until North Korea's nuclear program is ""no longer a problem."" He praised Kim for entering into negotiations with the U.S., a longtime foe.""People thought this could never take place,"" Trump told reporters. ""It's a very great day, it's a very great moment in the history of the world.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe signing ceremony and Trump's news conference capped a four-hour summit in Singapore aimed at easing decades of tensions between adversaries that only last year seemed on the brink of nuclear war.For both leaders, the summit represented a major gamble, and its outcome was being dissected around the globe for a sense of whether one of the world's greatest security threats — Kim's nuclear stockpile — can be eliminated. The talks were seen as a key first step to formally ending the Korean War, which remains unfinished after a 1953 armistice.During the signing ceremony, Kim said the agreement ""heralds a new start, leaving the past behind."" He added: ""the world will witness a major change now."" He left the summit site before Trump's news conference and didn't address reporters on his own.Under their agreement, Trump committed to provide unspecified ""security guarantees"" to Kim, as the two sides promised to continue talks. It said nothing about how the two countries would reach the goals, and ""complete denuclearization"" — the key point of contention between U.S. and North Korean negotiators — wasn't spelled out.The document doesn't include the words ""complete, verifiable and irreversible"" — the baseline U.S. demand for denuclearization before lifting sanctions — and omits Kim's previous pledges to halt missile and nuclear testing. Trump insisted that their agreement will include verification.""It will be achieved by having a lot of people there,"" he said.Even as their accord left major questions unresolved, the two sides did succeed in striking a friendlier tone. Trump told reporters after the summit that Kim had accepted an invitation to visit the White House, and that he would be willing to make a trip to Pyongyang at the ""appropriate time.""""Our whole relationship with North Korea and the Korean Peninsula is going to a very much different situation than it has in the past,"" he said.Trump added that the U.S. military would suspend some military exercises that North Korea has regarded as a threat to its security, but offered no specifics about which war games would be affected.Mintaro Oba, a former U.S. State Department official who worked on North Korean issues, said the declaration ""was the minimum necessary to consider the summit a success — no premature concessions, and no escalation of tensions.""China hailed the outcome of the summit, saying the talks should spur the United Nations Security Council to revisit sanctions aimed against Pyongyang.""Sanctions are a means not an end,"" said Geng Shuang, a spokesman for the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs. ""We believe the Security Council should make efforts to support the current diplomatic efforts and contribute to the political settlement of the Korean Peninsula issue.""Trump and Kim kicked off their summit with a handshake shortly after 9 a.m. local time Tuesday — 9 p.m. Monday in New York — marking the first face-to-face encounter between a sitting U.S. president and a North Korean leader.As the meeting opened at the Capella Hotel on Singapore's Sentosa Island, the two men entered with somber expressions that quickly gave way to smiles. Moments earlier, Trump had announced his chief economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, had been sent to the hospital after suffering a heart attack.""It's my honor, and we will have a terrific relationship, I have no doubt,"" Trump said in brief remarks to reporters moments after their history-making handshake.""It was not an easy journey,"" Kim said earlier. ""We've had a past that stopped us from advancing, and wrong behaviors and practices sometimes closed our eyes and ears.""Trump was joined in the talks by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who played a crucial role setting up the summit, National Security Adviser John Bolton and Chief of Staff John Kelly. Kim was accompanied by North Korean Vice Chairman Kim Yong Chol, Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho and former Foreign Minister Ri Su Yong.Just meeting with Trump marks a diplomatic accomplishment for Kim, who has emerged from isolation in recent months and rapidly increased his outreach to other world leaders.By sitting down with an American president — a longtime goal of North Korea's government — Kim's regime is advancing its effort to establish its ""reputation, respect, and credibility as a nuclear weapon state,"" said Michael J. Green, senior vice president for Asia and Japan Chair at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.Trump wants the complete, verifiable and irreversible dismantling of North Korea's nuclear weapons program. Kim is seeking a security guarantee — and possibly a peace treaty — and the removal of the U.S.'s nuclear umbrella protecting allies South Korea and Japan.Kim has rejected calls to unilaterally give up his weapons in return for economic aid, and instead has proposed a step-by-step denuclearization process. His public statements and state-run media indicate he wants a deal to ease sanctions, but that he won't give up his nuclear weapons until he feels safe enough to retain power without them.Shortly after agreeing to the meeting in March, Trump used grandiose language to describe its prospects — at one point saying that North Koreans had already agreed to give up their nuclear weapons.In recent weeks, however, Trump significantly scaled back his public expectations for what meeting Kim would accomplish — at one point he referred to it as a ""get-to-know-you situation."" He also began saying that it would likely take several meetings to accomplish his goal, downplaying the importance of the first summit.Yet Pompeo on Monday drew a firm line, saying the U.S. plans to keep sanctions in place until North Korea eliminates its nuclear weapons capability. Complete, verifiable, irreversible denuclearization, he told reporters, ""is the only outcome that the United States will accept.""Yet the top U.S. diplomat added Trump is ready to offer ""unique"" guarantees to ease the regime's concerns about giving up a nuclear arsenal that provides a deterrent against foreign adversaries while also serving as a key point of national pride.YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:Futures Dip After Trump-Kim Summit; These 4 Stocks Are Big Movers

8,KIM,"President Donald Trump's bromance with Chinese President Xi Jinping has yielded few practical results. To the contrary, U.S.-China relations increasingly seem headed for rough waters.Top of the list is North Korea. After the North's recent angry eruption, or ""different attitude,"" as President Trump put it, he blamed China: ""I think I understand why that happened,"" but ""I can't say that I'm happy about it.""Apparently the president believed that Kim was ready to toss away his nuclear weapons, and who knows what else, until President Xi summoned Kim to Beijing and issued contrary instructions. (The administration's multiple threats of military action are far more likely culprits for Pyongyang's shift.)President Trump is not the only one to assume that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea was China's puppet. Joseph Bosco, who served in the Bush Defense Department, charged China with ""blatant sabotaging of the promising dialogue"" between the U.S. and North Korea.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseIn fact, Pyongyang is resisting administration demands because Kim believes they are not his nation's, or at least his regime's, interest. From its founding the DPRK has resolutely resisted foreign pressure. Long ago even the PRC discovered the limits of its influence in the North.Beijing wants a stable, docile, non-nuclear Korean buffer state. That would enhance China's regional influence, prevent the peninsula from being used as a tool of containment, spark allied requests for Chinese help to ""manage"" the North, and preserve a relationship with both historical and ideological significance. In contrast, a nuclear DPRK ensures Pyongyang's independence, including from the PRC, and generates American complications.Unfortunately for Beijing, its buffer state was always unruly and recently went nuclear. For years the Chinese leadership decided that buffer took precedence over nuclear.Especially since the PRC's influence in the North was substantially more limited some observers assumed. The Beijing-Pyongyang relationship was not unlike America's support for brutally repressive regimes — think Egypt or Saudi Arabia today — which nevertheless were believed to advance other U.S. interests.Chinese intervention in the Korean War preserved founder Kim Il-sung's rule, for which it received few thanks. For years he played Moscow against Beijing.The relationship between the two supposed allies has oscillated, but generally grown increasingly strained. Kim Jong-un accelerated nuclear and missile testing. Moreover, five years ago he executed his uncle, Jang Song-thaek, who was his nation's principle interlocutor with Beijing.Nevertheless, complained Bosco, the PRC enabled the North's ambitions ""by protecting successive Kim regimes from United Nations-imposed and other economic sanctions."" True, because China fears instability and collapse rather like Washington would view a possible Mexican implosion.In control of the entire peninsula, the ROK also would become a more significant international actor, potentially part of a U.S.-orchestrated containment system. In fact, in 1950 Beijing went to war to prevent a united Korea allied with America and hosting U.S. troops on its border. One can imagine Washington's reaction to Canada joining the Warsaw Pact.Thus, preserving the Kim dynasty made sense for the PRC. However, in recent years Chinese attitudes have hardened. After every North Korean test Beijing agreed to tighter restrictions and increasingly enforced them.Six years after Kim ascended to the North Korean throne he had yet to receive an invitation to the PRC. The DPRK was in the equivalent of Xi's doghouse.The Chinese deep freeze probably encouraged Pyongyang to play the America card. Xi watched as Kim met with South Korea's President Moon Jae-in and planned a summit with President Trump. This created a fearsome prospect for Beijing: an autonomous DPRK friendly to America.That possibility likely motivated the two Xi-Kim summits between March and May. It was imperative for Beijing to cater to Kim.China almost certainly was the supplicant, offering the DPRK what the latter long desired. Beijing still wanted North Korea to negotiate, but not from a position of weakness ready to toss the PRC under the proverbial bus.Instead of fulminating about Sino perfidy, Washington should engage the PRC over its perceived interests. For instance, a U.S. promise to withdraw troops and a South Korean pledge of military neutrality could moderate Chinese concerns over a westward North Korean move and even South Korea-dominated reunification.Washington should keep its eye on the prize at the upcoming summit: eliminating North Korean nuclear weapons. Doing so is still a long-shot. But President Trump should be prepared to pay the necessary price for the PRC's aid.Click here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

We'll now see what Kim's made of.In pulling out of the meeting, Trump sent a formal letter that deployed surprisingly deft diplomatic reasoning.""Based on the tremendous anger and open hostility displayed in your recent statement, I feel it is inappropriate, at this time, to have this long-planned meeting,"" Trump said in his letter. ""Therefore, please let this letter serve to represent that the Singapore summit, for the good of both parties, but the detriment of the world, will not take place.""The letter came a day after North Korea's Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Choe Son Hui sharply criticized Vice President Mike Pence, calling him ""ignorant"" and ""stupid"" after Pence commented that North Korea risked ending up like Libya if it didn't make a nuclear deal with the U.S.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseSo it's off. A disaster? Hardly.Now we will see whether Kim Jong-un, just as his grandfather Kim Il-sung and his father Kim Jong-il did, is playing the U.S. to win pre-summit concessions — or really is serious about seeking a nuclear rapprochement.Trump was right to be wary.In recent days, Kim shifted from a months-long charm-offensive to just plain offensive, abruptly cancelling a meeting with South Korea, complaining about routine U.S. military exercises in the region and seeking to remove North Korea's nuclear program from the summit agenda — despite that being the main reason for the summit in the first place.Given the abrupt shift and increasing demands, Trump really had no choice.As for Kim's claim to have destroyed a remote nuclear research site Wednesday in North Korea as a goodwill gesture to the U.S. and South Korea, he allowed only journalists and a handful of other foreigners in as observers — but no one with nuclear technical expertise to determine what really was being demolished, and whether it was of any consequence to Pyongyang's nuclear program at all.Trump's letter was, as we noted, carefully worded, and thanked Kim for releasing three Americans, which Trump called a ""beautiful gesture."" He left open the possibility of still meeting, but put the ball in Kim's court.Smart move.As American Enterprise Institute Fellow and North Korea expert Nicholas Eberstadt wrote on Wednesday, ""these are standard North Korean shakedown techniques, honed to perfection by three generations of regime negotiators. Mr. Kim is probing for pre-emptive concessions before his big get-together with Mr. Trump. Such techniques have proved successful in the past, which is why today North Korea is for all intents and purposes a nuclear state.""That's why Trump called his bluff. Going back to the early 1990s, when President Clinton signed a ""nuclear deal"" with North Korea that the Hermit State later reneged on, the U.S. has been taken to the cleaners repeatedly by North Korea's totalitarian ruling Kim family.They sign deals, get trade, aid and other assistance upfront, then cheat on the deals as soon as it's no longer in their immediate material interest.And, no, this is not a partisan issue: They've done it with Democratic presidents and Republican ones alike.This, by the way, helps explain why Trump was so eager to pull out of the Iran nuclear deal two weeks ago. That deal, negotiated by the Obama administration, was so weak and riddled with giveaways to the Iranian regime, that Trump, John Bolton and others in the administration no doubt felt it had to go.""Why would Mr. Kim accept a worse deal for North Korea than what Iran had obtained?"" Tod Lindberg, a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute wrote. ""Leaving one bad deal still active would have established the precedent for another bad deal.""As a long-time executive in the rough-and-tumble world of mega-project real estate development, Trump knows that sometimes the best move of all is to walk away from a bad deal. Make your opponent counter your offer. If not, it's not for you.In the case of Kim, Trump's instincts were right. Maybe Kim will seek a summit. Maybe he won't. But Trump almost certainly will continue to make clear that a nuclear North Korea is not acceptable under any circumstance. And that failure to make a deal will have consequences.Your move, Mr. Kim.YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:North Korea Diplomacy By Trump Wins Kudos, But Americans Still Wary Of Talks: IBD/TIPP PollNorth Korea's Nuclear Threat Is Here And It's Real — Kim Jong Un's Regime Must GoOur Long History Of Misjudging North KoreaClick here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

10,KIM,"""There is no longer a Nuclear Threat from North Korea.""
"
11,KIM,"— Donald Trump, June 13, 2018""North Korea is upgrading its nuclear research center at a rapid pace, new satellite imagery analysis suggests.""
"
12,KIM,"— The Wall Street Journal, June 27, 2018As the president prepares, if this time he does prepare, for his second summit, note all that went wrong at the first. If he does as badly in his July 16 meeting with Vladimir Putin in Finland as he did with Kim Jong Un in Singapore, the consequences could be catastrophic.An exceptionally knowledgeable student of North Korea, the American Enterprise Institute's Nicholas Eberstadt, writing in National Review (""Kim Wins in Singapore""), says the one-day meeting was for the United States ""a World Series of unforced errors."" The result was that North Korea ""walked away with a joint communiqué that read almost as if it had been drafted by the DPRK (Democratic People's Republic of Korea) ministry of foreign affairs.""Kim, says Eberstadt, is ""the boss of a state-run crime cartel that a U.N. Commission of Inquiry wants to charge with crimes against humanity."" Au contraire, said America's president, who slathered Kim with praise: Kim, with whom Trump has ""a very special bond"" is a ""talented man"" who ""loves his country,"" which reciprocates with ""a great fervor."" Trump called Kim a ""very worthy negotiator,"" which might actually have made sense if Kim had been forced to negotiate for the concessions that Trump dispensed gratis.North Korea, Eberstadt says, is committed to what he calls its ""racial socialism,"" which motivates Kim's ""central and sacred mission,"" which is ""nonnegotiable"" — the unconditional reunification of the Korean Peninsula. This presupposes extermination of the South Korean state, which requires the policy Kim announced last New Year's Day — to ""mass-produce nuclear warheads and missiles and speed up their deployment."" Eberstadt:Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of Use""Such a program would not be necessary for regime legitimation, or for international military extortion, or even to ensure the regime's survival: All of those objectives could surely be satisfied with a limited nuclear force. Why then threaten the U.S. homeland?"" America is the guarantor of South Korea's security, and if Washington can be made to blink at a time and place of Pyongyang's choosing, the U.S.-South Korea alliance will end, as will the U.S. security presence there. Hence the delusional nature of Trump's belief: One one-day meeting sufficed to cause the North Korean regime to abandon its raison d'être.In addition to the legitimation supplied to Pyongyang by the pageantry of the summit for which Trump obviously hungered, the official record of the Singapore deliberations reveals no U.S. interest in Pyongyang's atrocious human rights practices (""unparalleled in the modern world,"" Eberstadt says) that raise doubts about the fervor with which North Koreans appreciate Dear Leader's love for them. In return for Trump's promise to halt military-readiness operations, Kim gave nothing — no inventory of his nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles, nothing beyond North Korea's decades-old commitment to ""denuclearization"" of the Korean Peninsula, an opaque goal that means only that Pyongyang is not clearly committed to anything — beyond a pre-summit promise to decommission a no-longer-useable nuclear test site. The New Year's Day vow has not been disavowed.Singapore was, Eberstadt believes, probably the greatest diplomatic coup for North Korea since 1950, and a milestone on ""the DPRK's road to establishing itself as a permanent nuclear power."" And the sanctions that were the Trump administration's strategy of ""maximum pressure"" will be difficult to maintain now that a ""defanged"" — Eberstadt's description — Trump has declared the nuclear threat banished.The most dangerous moment of the Trump presidency will arrive when he who is constantly gnawed by insecurities and the fear of not seeming what he is not (""strong""), realizes how weak and childish he seems to all who cast a cool eye on Singapore's aftermath. The danger is of him lashing out in wounded vanity. Meanwhile, this innocent abroad is strutting toward a meeting with the cold-eyed Russian who is continuing to dismantle Europe's geographically largest nation, Ukraine. He is likely looking ahead to ratcheting up pressure on one of three small nations, Lithuania, Latvia or Estonia, each a member of the NATO alliance that, for the first time in its 69 years, is dealing with a U.S. president who evinces no admiration for what it has accomplished, or any understanding of its revived importance as the hard man in Moscow, who can sniff softness, relishes what Singapore revealed.More Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

18,KIM,"North Korea Talks: No question, President Trump's gambit to bring North Korea's murderous dictator face-to-face at a summit negotiating table was a risky move. But after living through more than six decades of a state of war and with Pyongyang developing a nuclear weapon was worth the risk.The agreement signed on Tuesday at the Singapore summit is of course merely paper. Whether any deal survives its actual signing depends on the goodwill and trustworthiness of the participants. North Korea's Kim Jong-un, who is himself the third generation of a line of brutal dictators who routinely cheated on deals with both Democratic and Republican presidents, bears close watching.We're sure that Trump's saber-rattling rhetoric, which Democrats roundly criticized and coastal intellectual elites thought was crude, made Kim realize his real vulnerability to the U.S. military. Thus his eagerness to do a deal.The four main planks of the agreement they signed sound promising:Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseYes, skepticism is always in order. But as we said this was a bold risk, one well worth taking. Kim lacks confidence these days, after Trump publicly ridiculed him, calling him ""rocket man"" and ""short and fat"" on twitter.If Trump had been a North Korean citizen saying those words, Kim would have executed him in a particularly painful and gruesome way. That Kim couldn't intimidate or frighten Trump surely disappointed him. Nothing so disturbs a pathological bully as someone who doesn't fear him.Past presidents who signed deals with North Korea — including Clinton, Bush II and Obama — gave aid and other concessions, and got burned. Trump signed his deal from a position of strength.The two greatest threats the U.S. faces are a nuclear-armed North Korea and a soon-to-be-nuclear armed (thanks, President Obama) Iran. Trump, by walking away from Obama's foolish Iran deal and by intimidating Kim into negotiating on nuclear weapons, shows he understands what's at stake.Democrats and their allied media have had a field day, yammering on about Trump ""appeasing"" Kim. He did no such thing. It's funny that the same people criticizing Trump for appeasement, remained silent as Obama all but gave Iran a path to a nuclear weapon and domination of the Mideast.Moreover, it's clear Trump wasn't winging it, but that he had a strategy all along.As national security and military analyst Austin Bay notes, before this summit, Trump was talking about a strategy for dealing with North Korea way back in October, 1999, speaking to the late Tim Russert on ""Meet The Press.""""First I'd negotiate, and be sure I could get the best deal possible ... The biggest problem this world has is nuclear proliferation. And we have a country out there in North Korea which is sort of wacko, which is not a bunch of dummies, and they are developing nuclear weapons ... If that negotiation doesn't work, then better solve the problem now than solve it later.""Think Kim doesn't know Trump said this?In March 2017, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson announced a new North Korea strategy. ""The policy of strategic patience has ended,"" he said. ""We are exploring a new range of diplomatic, security, economic measures. All options are on the table.""That last sentence no doubt rattled Kim's cage and caused him sleepless nights. All options are on the table.This is a criminal regime, one that is still dangerous. Trump's tough rhetoric was warranted. Even so, this deal, while promising, must be tested at every level, with denuclearization of North Korea the main goal. And Trump has been clever to link this issue with concessions in trade talks with China, North Korea's patron. Xi Jinping may have just discovered Americans play chess, too.If Trump rids the Koreas of nuclear weapons, he'll win a tremendous victory — perhaps the Korean War's final victory.

21,KIM,"Less than a month after the Trump administration declared that the China trade war was ""on hold,"" it appears to be back on. And this time, there may be no turning back.President Trump on Friday imposed tariffs on $50 billion worth of mostly high-tech imports that will be subject to 25% tariffs. Some $34 billion will go into effect on July 6. China on Friday announced tariffs on $34 billion worth of U.S. goods, including agricultural goods. It's vowed to match U.S. tariffs swiftly and dollar for dollar.Trump had threatened more tariffs if China retaliates.What happens next will determine how big of a deal Trump's China trade war is for the economy and stock market. Yet there's clear risk that the conflict will escalate into a technological cold war.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe Dow Jones, down more than 1% at one point, pared its loss to 0.3% on the stock market today. The S&P 500 index slid 0.1% and the Nasdaq composite 0.2%.Tariffs on $34 billion in goods will take effect July 6. The other $16 billion are still subject to review.Once shots are fired, trade talks will get more difficult. The Trump administration says it has almost finished drawing up a list of another $100 billion of Chinese goods that could also face tariffs.Commodities prices for soybeans, corn and wheat have taken a hit ahead of the expected imposition of tariffs, while shares of Deere (DE), which thrives when American farmers are doing well, slid close to 5% in the past two days. That's quite a reversal after Trump's May 21 tweet touting an emerging trade deal that would see China ""buy massive amounts of ADDITIONAL Farm/Agricultural products"" from the U.S.So what happened? Trump may have concluded that the deal would have done relatively little to meet his goal of shrinking the U.S. trade deficit. After his meeting with North Korea's Kim Jong-un, Trump might feel his denuclearization push isn't so dependent upon China.Here's another possibility: Trump may have been bullied into the trade war. While the Trump administration has insisted that the enforcement action against Chinese communications equipment supplier ZTE was separate from the trade negotiation, it's not clear that Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed.The brief but favorable turn in China trade relations came after Trump tweeted that he and Xi were working to get ZTE ""back into business, fast."" That's after U.S. sanctions forced the Chinese telecom gear maker to cease operations. As punishment for continuing to doing business with Iran and North Korea in defiance of U.S. sanctions against those regimes, the Commerce Department ordered ZTE's key U.S. component suppliers to cease doing business with the firm.But Trump's leniency prompted a backlash. The Senate appears certain to attach a provision denying relief to ZTE to a defense funding bill. While the White House opposes that provision, it's unclear that Trump would veto must-pass defense legislation over the matter.With the fate of ZTE hanging in the balance, Chinese trade negotiators have frustrated their American counterparts. That, in turn, has strengthened the hand of Trump administration officials who have advocated taking a hard line against China and had the tariffs all ready to go.One ray of hope that a damaging trade war can be averted: China has reportedly granted approval to Qualcomm (QCOM) to buy NXP Semiconductors (NXPI). Chinese regulators appeared to delay approval amid the ZTE furor. But some reports said that China hasn't yet OK'd Qualcomm-NXP Semi.Qualcomm rose 0.7% Friday while NXP advanced 0.1%.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Dow Jones Futures Fall As Trump Steps Up China Trade War; Watch These Key StocksIBD Stock Of The Day: Dropbox Breaks Out As Software IPOs SurgeWhy This Biotech Is Bounding Closer To A BreakoutChart Reading For Beginners: What's In A Stock Chart?

24,KIM,"The commentariat is bursting with speeches, diatribes, essays, analyses, stories and tweets about the impending collapse of the post-World War II international order. This threatens global peace and prosperity, even if we're not entirely sure how the threat might actually materialize.When we say ""the post-World War II international order,"" we mean a series of political, military and economic alliances whose members pursue common goals and embrace common values. Led by the United States, the system arose during and after the war mainly as a counterpoint to the Soviet Union. Countries believed that their narrow national interests were served by advancing a collective agenda.It is this system — a state of mind as much as a set of formal obligations — that is now coming apart, reeling from President Trump's frontal assault on its premises. But, although Trump is the immediate cause of the present turmoil, he is not the only cause. Let's examine the larger context.Start with Trump, because his role is the easiest to understand. By any conventional standard, he is acting irrationally and erratically; worse, he's supported policies that harm the United States. He is deliberately starting a trade war that could derail the global economy. He not only disagrees with our traditional allies (Europe, Japan, Mexico, Canada), but he has gone out of his way to insult them. Even if the leaders of these countries were willing to let bygones be bygones, their citizens may not be so tolerant. Public opinion will make cooperation with the United States harder.But ordinary rules of logic do not apply to Trump. Almost everything he has done can be explained by personal ambition. He is not interested in policy, nor in making America great again. (America was greatest in and after World War II, precisely when it was doing the most for other countries.) The president's all-consuming passion is to make Donald Trump great.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseHe needs to be the center of attention — not just sometimes but all the time. The more outrageous, offensive, unexpected and egotistical something is, the more he likes it because it thrusts him onto center stage, where he wants to be. That's his policy. There is great consistency in his behavior, even if some of his actions repudiate what he has said or done earlier. (Not surprisingly, Trump's meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is a reprise of America's role as global leader.)Granted, not everything that is wrong with America's relations with its ""allies"" — or, for that matter, their relations with us — can be blamed on Trump. If matters were so simple, we could outwait or outwit him. The reality is more complicated. The passage of time has weakened or destroyed the lesson that the World War II generation took from the war: Two decades of isolationism after World War I had not shielded us from the greatest calamity in human history. Because isolationism didn't work, Americans were in no mood to try it again (especially with a nuclear-armed Soviet Union). This shift in public opinion served as a crucial backstop to an outward-looking foreign policy.But the World War II generation — the people who experienced this political and emotional conversion — is mostly dead, and younger generations are of a different mind. Baby boomers lived in the shadow of World War II and absorbed some of its lessons; but many also concluded that, in Vietnam, the country had taken the lessons too far. Later generations have been even less imbued with the value of America's global role.The point is that America's leaders have not been able (some would say they didn't try very hard) to create public support for a new internationalism, based on today's realities. The 2008-09 global financial crisis further undermined public confidence.Still, most of what we seek to achieve — including a stable global economy, relief from terrorism, protections against cyberattacks and consistent environmental goals — depends heavily on international cooperation. We were vulnerable to a Trump, whose simplistic nationalism sounds more appealing than it is.Finally, our allies have not always been the best of allies — and we have not always been the best of leaders. Long before China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001, Japan and some other countries practiced mercantile policies of favoring select industries. Most members of NATO have underspent on their military, even though the official spending target (2% of gross domestic product) is modest. Similarly, the United States has periodically resorted to protectionist measures to defuse political opposition to imports.It's a bleak backdrop. Trumpism is leading to a global power vacuum. Who, if anyone, will fill it? China? Russia? No one?Other columns by Robert SamuelsonMore Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

26,KIM,"G-7: President Trump created a quite a stir among the other Western leaders by refusing to sign the ""communique"" that capped the G-7 summit. But he was right to do so.This is once again being styled as the crude, unnuanced American president refusing to accommodate himself to the much wiser leaders of Europe.In  fact, he wisely refrained from signing what was an empty, far-left political document, which is typical of the G-7 ""consensus"" that American presidents have gone along with for decades.We're indebted to Susan Jones of CNSNews.com who pored over the entire tedious document from the Charlevoix G-7 Summit in Canada to extract the nuggets.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseIt held a panoply of meaningless leftist buzzwords that the U.S. was supposed to embrace, including ""such phrases as 'sustainable development,' 'gender equality and women's empowerment,' 'fair' and 'progressive' tax systems, a 'level playing field,' 'affordable healthcare,' a 'healthy planet,' and 'quality work environments.' ""None of those thing, by the way, have anything whatsoever to do with government. As a matter of fact, intervention of incompetent governments makes most of those things measurably worse.All told, the communique contains 27 points made in five major sections. All of them enlighten citizens around the world about how to think about everything, from gender and jobs to peace and climate change.The leadership of the nations allied with the U.S. come up short. They've ridden the anti-Trump wave of the so-called Progressives, rolling their eyes at his comments and acting as if he, not they, are the problem.That's particularly true of trade.The summit communique, for instance, exhorts G-7 members to ""reduce tariff bers, non-tariff barriers and subsidies.""A reasonable  goal, most economists would agree. The G-7 leaders get angry at Trump because he believes that current trade deals, while good on some levels, actually are unfair to the U.S. Whether you agree or not, it's certainly a debatable point, particularly with regard to trade with China.But what did Trump say at his press conference as he left the fruitless G-7 confab to meet with North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un?""You want a tariff-free (trade system), you want no barriers, and you want no subsidies because you have some cases where countries are subsidizing industries, and that's not fair,""  Trump said, elaborating his own ideas about trade, developed, he said, from his time at the Wharton School of Finance. ""So you go tariff-free, you go barrier-free, you go subsidy-free.""Sounds pretty free trade to us. The fact that he questions current trade deals doesn't signal a hatred of free trade. It does show a disdain for deals that pretend to be free trade but are really government managed trade. Often to the U.S.' detriment.As we've said here before literally dozens of times, we at IBD have always maintained that free trade is a great benefit to humankind.It lets all people satisfy their wants and needs from those who most able to satisfy them at the lowest price. That's how human material well-being advances.G-7 And Tariffs: Hypocrisy On DisplayTrump's idea of making tariffs identical from one nation to the next may be politically naive (and may not, for that matter), but it's not insincere. Nor is his anger over still-large tariffs on U.S. goods invalid.The supposed leaders of the free world, as embodied in the G-7, should recognize that not all the global trade system is equitable — and that, as Trump says, the old protectionist ways that harm the U.S. economy, must come to an end.Based on its recent performances, the G-7 summit has outlived its usefulness. It has become an opportunity for troubled European leaders to preen and pose for cameras, speak progressive platitudes, engage in a little anti-Americanism, but do little if anything of substance.This G-7 meeting, in which all the U.S. allies agreed that Trump was awful, was no different. It was the essence of multi-lateralism: Lots of noise and pageantry, entirely stage-managed, but ultimately empty.YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:Trump: Russia Should Be In G-7 MeetingItaly, EU Instability Roils U.S. Markets — A Sign Of Crisis To Come?EU's Antitrust Attack On Google Is Really An Attack On U.S. High-Tech Innovation

27,KIM,"The summit almost certainly is going to happen. Neither party can afford to cancel this late. How best to make it a success?We know the result will not be denuclearization as defined by the U.S. We will not implement the so-called Libya model, collecting North Korea nukes, despite what National Security Adviser John Bolton said.So what is the objective? Said President Donald Trump after announcing that the summit was on: ""It's a process. We're not go in and sign something on June 12 and we never were. We are going to start a process. And I told them today: take your time. We can go fast, we can go slowly.""It makes one wonder: who is this person, and where is the president who threatened to unleash ""fire and fury"" on the Korean peninsula?Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseProcess can be helpful. Still, process is only a means to bring about a substantive result. So what should the latter be?First, contra the president, the two leaders should sign something, even if just a short, but specific promise by the U.S. to end what might be considered ""hostile policy"" toward North Korea in return for Pyongyang's commitment to denuclearize, specifically eliminate the North's nuclear weapons and entire atomic infrastructure.Second, Washington should seek to make permanent the North's freeze on nuclear and missile tests. That commitment would be easy to police and would limit the reach of missiles and inhibit improvement of nuclear weapons.Third, President Trump and Supreme Leader Kim Jong-un should declare that they view the Korean War to be over and agree to negotiations that include the other major combatants, South Korea and China, to forge a peace treaty formally ending hostilities.Fourth, the president should propose a move toward diplomatic relations. That would not be a reward; the objective would be to create a routine communications channel, while creating an outpost for learning more about what long was accurately termed the Hermit Kingdom.Fifth, Washington would explain that expanding an American mission into a full-scale embassy would depend on North Korean officials being willing to engage on a range of political topics, including human rights.Sixth, on landing in Singapore the president should announce an end to the ban on Americans traveling to the North. At the meeting he should offer to initiate a liberal visa policy for North Korean visitors, who would be invited to come to America for sports, cultural, educational, and other purposes. An internal, organic transformation led by North Koreans would be far better than an outside attempt to impose regime change.Seventh, the president should override his ""alliance forever"" advisers and indicate his willingness to withdraw U.S. troops from and close America's ""nuclear umbrella"" over South Korea in return for denuclearization. It is an important objective worth making significant concessions. Moreover, denuclearization would eliminate any need for a U.S. garrison in the South.Eighth, the two leaders should establish the ""process"" that the president mentioned. A set of negotiations should be initiated with denuclearization as the formal objective. But they should be capable of reaching more limited agreements along the way. For instance, an inventory of the DPRK's nuclear assets, backed by inspections, would be an important step toward denuclearization.Washington should simultaneously encourage the Kim government to engage both the ROK and Japan, since their support would add to the success of a shift toward a more peaceful environment. At the same time, the U.S. should discuss the future of the Korean peninsula with China.Nevertheless, the Trump administration should encourage a more cooperative Beijing by indicating that the latter need not fear an American attempt to turn the peninsula into another military outpost in a regional containment system.President Trump deserves credit for taking the risk of meeting Kim Jong-un. The president even was right to step back from demanding immediate denuclearization, since expecting too much could have resulted in a catastrophic summit break-down, returning the two countries to sort of dangerous confrontation which dominated last year.Making the summit a success will involve process, as the president suggested, but also will need to address the right substance as well. The president still might fall short of a Nobel, but he could help defuse one of the world's hot spots. And that would be an accomplishment worth celebrating.Click here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

28,KIM,"President Donald Trump canceled his planned summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un that had been scheduled for June 12 in Singapore, citing ""tremendous anger and open hostility"" in recent statements from Pyongyang.Trump's decision was communicated Thursday in a letter to Kim released by the White House.North Korea hardened its rhetoric toward the U.S. earlier Thursday, warning it was ready for a ""nuclear-to-nuclear"" showdown if the U.S. didn't follow through on the summit.""You talk about your nuclear capabilities, but ours are so massive and powerful that I pray to God they will never have to be used,"" Trump wrote.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseWith the summit abandoned -- at least temporarily -- the next steps are unclear. Trump has said that if the June 12 meeting were to fall through, the U.S. would continue exerting maximum economic pressure on Kim and his regime.The highly anticipated summit had been cast by the White House as an opportunity to stave off a military conflict with North Korea and showcase Trump's ability to make progress where his predecessors had struggled.But Trump ultimately ran into the same diplomatic quandary that has flummoxed U.S. presidents for the past 25 years: the inability to persuade a stubborn regime to give up a nuclear program that it regards as key to its survival.Trump agreed to meet Kim after the two leaders spent most of 2017 exchanging increasingly hostile and bellicose barbs. Seoul led the effort at detente with Pyongyang that led to the two countries competing together at the Winter Olympics.

29,KIM,"Tesla kept charging higher and continued to work on its new base, while software companies also helped sustain the Nasdaq composite's leadership in stocks today. Meanwhile, the market presents at least four new reasons why investors should stay bullish on growth stocks.The tech-rich Nasdaq composite gained more than 0.5%.At that level, the premier index for growth stocks has now climbed 509% from its March 2009 low of 1265.The S&P 500, hampered by sell-offs in the ship transport, meat, oil drilling, mortgage services, and aerospace and defense industries, was mostly flat after rising nearly 0.3% intraday. The Dow Jones industrial average edged about 0.2% lower. Volume was running mildly higher vs. the same time on Monday on both main exchanges.Kirby (KEX), part of IBD's fourth-ranked Transport-Ship industry group, sailed sharply lower. Shares dropped as much as 4.7% to an intraday low of 86.05 and undercut the key 50-day moving average for the first time since it broke out of a seven-week flat base at 81 in April.The stock is a member of the IBD Leaderboard stock-picking service and one of two Leaders list stocks that are linked to the oil and gas industry.

The U.S. central bank has been raising rates since December 2015, when the fed funds rate rose to a target range of 0.25%-0.5%.Tesla (TSLA), as noted in this recent Stock Market Today column, is still fashioning the right side of a brand-new base. However, the stock is still feeling the overhead supply of sellers near 350, a critical level of upside price resistance. At 341, the stock is now less than 13% below its all-time peak of 389.61.Sentiment appears to be warming to the high possibility that the electric-vehicle pioneer is getting past serious difficulty in ramping up Model 3 production. On Tuesday, CEO Elon Musk announced a 9% cut in total staff, centered on salaried employees. A company memo to employees said that no production associates got laid off.The company seeks to get profitable while also meeting the tremendous demand for its entry-level all-electric car. The planned staff cuts should reduce total headcount to 37,000.Tesla shares show a terrible Relative Price Strength Rating of 25 on a scale of 1 to 99. But as seen in IBD Stock Checkup, the Accumulation/Distribution Rating has improved to a B on a scale of A to E. A rating above the neutral C grade means that over the past 13 weeks, institutions have likely been accumulating the stock on net.In IBD's automakers group, only Ferrari (RACE) and General Motors (GM) show better Accumulation/Distribution ratings than Tesla at A- each. Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters see Tesla swinging from a net loss of $6.82 a share in 2018 to a net profit of $2.46 a share in 2019. Both estimates have recently moved up.Meanwhile, the market is showing at least four new reasons why the stock market's six-year bull run (after a 20%-plus correction in 2011) may have more room to run.One, market breadth continues to improve. The Nasdaq's advance-decline line has been climbing for five straight weeks. This means that more stocks are advancing than declining. This also means that more high-rated stocks stand a chance of breaking out.Two, the new highs list remains robust. As seen in Monday's IBD-screened list, a total 325 stocks on the Nasdaq and NYSE hit 52-week or all-time highs, swamping the 42 names making new lows. More stocks hitting new highs boost the probability of breakouts.Three, leading stocks are outperforming the major indexes.Among the top 10-ranked names in the IBD 50, the average gain approached 3%.Four, investor sentiment is not wildly optimistic. On Tuesday, the put-call volume ratio stood at 0.68. During the March 2000 tech market top, this ratio of bearish put options to bullish call options sank beneath 0.4. Such a low ratio pointed to a severe evaporation of bearish sentiment among options traders.The Investors Intelligence report on newsletter editors also shows the bullish ratio at 52.9%, well below its mid-January peak of 66%.

31,KIM,"Back when the Soviet Union had a first-rate nuclear arsenal but a ramshackle third-world economy that produced no consumer goods other than vodka and caviar that anyone elsewhere would buy, the nation was disparaged as ""Upper Volta with rockets."" Today the question is: Would North Korea like to become Upper Volta without rockets and without exportable vodka or caviar?This question is central as the president undertakes to bring about the ""complete, verifiable and irreversible"" dismantling of the nuclear weapons program that has been the North Korean regime's obsession for more than 60 years. This regime has been run exclusively by and for the Kim family since 1948, during which time it has demonstrated an unswerving willingness to immiserate its people to ensure the regime's survival.The regime has wagered that nuclear weapons would guarantee the loyalty of the only possible internal threat to the family, the armed forces, and would immunize the nation from external threats. It also has wagered that the weapons, when wedded as they soon might be to intercontinental ballistic missiles, extort from other nations, especially the United States, attention, and economic benefits intended to wean North Korea from the nuclear weapons that are the only reason anyone pays attention to it.North Korea has repeatedly won this wager. To wager is to put something at risk, but it is strange to say that North Korea's regime takes risks recklessly. Although vicious, it has been methodical and more or less predictable.Much has been made of the relevance, as North Korea might see it, of the fact that after America toppled Iraq's Saddam Hussein (which would not have happened if he had had nuclear weapons), Libya's Moammar Gadhafi, responding to U.S. pressure, dismantled his pursuit of nuclear weapons — and later was toppled by U.S.-backed insurgents. Not enough is made of this: In 1994, after the disintegration of the Soviet Union left Ukraine in possession of the world's third-largest nuclear arsenal, it gave this up in exchange for U.S. and British — and Russian — security guarantees. Crimea was then part of Ukraine.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseSpeaking in Prague in 2009 at the dawn of his presidency — six months before he harvested the first purely anticipatory Nobel Peace Prize — Barack Obama embraced the goal of ridding the world of nuclear weapons. Six years later he was seeking $348 billion for a 10-year modernization of the U.S. nuclear arsenal. Today there are fewer nuclear weapons in the world than there were during the Cold War. This, however, adds less to global security than is subtracted from it by the fact that there are two more nuclear powers (Pakistan, North Korea) and there will be a third if, as seems certain, Iran is determined to be one.Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has listed 12 ""basic requirements"" Iran must fulfill in order to avoid ""the strongest sanctions in history"" — assuming, perhaps fancifully, that Russia, China and other nations will tug their forelocks and comply with Trump administration ukases. Pompeo's demands include halting all uranium enrichment and development of ballistic missiles, openness to unfettered inspectors, ending aid to terrorists and the Houthi rebels in Yemen, withdrawing Iran's troops from Syria, and behaving neighborly toward its neighbors. It would have been fun — a maraschino cherry atop Pompeo's sundae of a dozen demands — if he had included a 13th: Iranians must become Methodists.Pompeo presented his demands as ""shifts in Tehran's policies."" Actually, they are more akin to asking a leopard not merely to change its spots, but to become a vegetarian. Perhaps Pompeo is mimicking his master.The ""art of the deal,"" according to the supposed Rembrandt of this art (a six-time bankrupt), seems to be this: Ask for the universe, settle for one of Jupiter's minor moons, claim that the moon is actually the center of the universe and was the real goal all along, and that only he — not Metternich, not Kissinger — could have plucked this flower, safety, from the nettle, danger.However, the common denominator in most mishaps of governing — in both domestic (Prohibition, 1930s protectionism, the Great Society, 1970s wage and price controls, etc.) and foreign policies (Woodrow Wilson's Fourteen Points, the Bay of Pigs, Vietnam, Iraq, Libya, etc.) — is the belief that the world is more malleable than it is, that inertia is less powerful than it is, that social variables can be made to vary as we wish them to. But, then, such mishaps were in the era B.R. — Before Rembrandt.Other columns by George Will

32,KIM,"Nuclear Talks: President Trump's summit with North Korea is now set for Singapore on June 12, following North Korea's release of three Americans it held. Has Trump finally brought the Kim regime to heel? Or is this another of North Korea's tricks to extort aid from the West in exchange for empty promises?The good news came, as it often does with President Trump, in a tweet: ""I am pleased to inform you that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is in the air and on his way back from North Korea with the 3 wonderful gentlemen that everyone is looking so forward to meeting. They seem to be in good health. Also, good meeting with Kim Jong Un. Date & Place set.""And early Thursday, at 2 a.m., Trump greeted the three newly freed American detainees at Andrews Air Force Base. He and First Lady Melania Trump greeted the three — Kim Dong Chul, Kim Hak Song and Tony Kim — calling them ""incredible people.""With talks now set with North Korea about ending its nuclear weapons program and reintegrating the Hermit Kingdom with the rest of the world, can Trump count on public support? A new IBD/TIPP Poll suggests that, even before the latest good news, Americans mostly approved of his handling of the North Korea talks.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe poll, conducted from April 26 to May 4 from a sample of 900 U.S. adults, showed that 52% either approve ""somewhat"" or ""strongly"" of ""the way President Trump has handled the situation with North Korea."" Of the remainder, 44% disapproved of Trump's efforts, with 24% disapproving ""strongly.""Not surprisingly, the split was mostly along partisan lines. Some 76% of Democrats disapproved of Trump's North Korean efforts, and 92% of Republicans approved. Independents were split, with 48% approving and 47% disapproving.But can Trump pull off a diplomatic triumph in talks with North Korea's Kim Jong-Un?There, Americans are a bit more ambivalent in the IBD/TIPP Poll, with 48% expressing they're ""somewhat"" or ""very"" confident, and 50% saying they're ""not very"" or ""not at all"" confident. Once again, Democrats and Republicans split sharply. Among Dems, 77% say they're not confident, versus 87% of GOP members who say they are. Among Independents, 43% said they were confident, while 54% said they weren't.So while Trump will largely have the wind of favorable public opinion at his back, he will also face skeptical public opinion at home as well. Given the media's overwhelming and well-documented hostility toward Trump, he can expect any triumph he has to be diminished, and any failure to be magnified and blown out of proportion.Even so, there seems to have been a remarkable turnaround in North Korea once Trump started playing global geostrategic chess like a 3-D chess master. His tariffs on Chinese goods, while perhaps economically dubious, made Xi Jinping see that Trump was serious and not afraid of raising China's ire. Trump knew China is North Korea's patron and main supplier of food and energy. So it has leverage. Kim Jong Un's surprise visit to Beijing last month to ""consult"" with Chinese leaders shows that China got the message.China no doubt ""encouraged"" Kim to engage the U.S. and South Korea in nuclear talks. But Trump's decision to walk away from the Iran nuclear deal and an earlier decision to put North Korea on the U.S.' list of terrorist nations also gave Kim a big nudge. Kim has learned something about Trump: He won't sign a bad deal, he doesn't shrink from conflict, and he's not afraid to act in U.S. interests.Pyongyang has already said it will stop its nuclear tests, launch no more intercontinental ballistic missiles and shut down a nuclear test site — presumably, the one on a remote mountain that collapsed following a recent nuclear test. Even so, if North Korea agrees to end its state of war with South Korea and eliminates its nuclear weapons program, it might have a chance to rejoin the community of nations.Of course, the U.S. should always be wary. North Korea has repeatedly played the U.S. and the rest of the democratic world for patsies. It promises big changes in behavior in exchange for trade and aid, then abandons its promises later. Despite years of talks and multiple agreements, Kim Jong-un's regime (and those of his father and grandfather before him) has continued to develop nuclear weapons.Are these talks just another ruse? Probably not. Kim seems genuinely intimidated by Trump, whose blunt-speaking ways and out-loud military threats have rattled Kim's confidence. He may be desperate for a deal that will leave him in power. As we've said before, we think Kim needs to go.We've heard a lot of talk about a Nobel Peace Prize for Trump. If he can bring peace and denuclearization to the Korean Peninsula, he will certainly deserve it — unlike the previous White House occupant, who won a Nobel for doing nothing and left the world largely a mess because of his diplomatic ineptitude.YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:Media Bias: Hatred Of Trump Brings Disgraceful Fawning Over Kim Jong-un's Sister At Winter OlympicsNorth Korea's Nuclear Threat Is Here And It's Real — Kim Jong Un's Regime Must GoPutting North Korea On U.S.' Terrorist List Was Long OverdueClick here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

Privacy Policy & Terms of UseLost in this tit-for-tat between skeptics and supporters is the perspective of Saudi Arabia's most important and consequential constituency:  the 50% of the population under the age of twenty-five. These are the people for whom reform is being made, and they are the ones that will determine its success or failure.I am a 30-year-old Saudi artist whose paintings hang on the walls of Saudi royal palaces, museums and the homes of stars like Kanye West, Cuba Gooding and Kim Kardashian. For me and a large portion of my generation, the change in Saudi Arabia is real and the future looks bright.We have spent our entire lives waiting for this moment that has finally arrived. We are citizens of the world; connected to others; proud of who we are; bridling to break out and make our mark, both at home and beyond our borders.Until now, we have had to devise creative workarounds to overcome the restrictions placed upon us. For example, if I and my male friends wanted to pick up girls, we would go to men-only section of a restaurant and communicate with young ladies in the women-only section via the Bluetooth feature on our mobile phones to set up future rendezvous.The lifting of constraints in Saudi Arabia is producing a slingshot effect. The prohibitions of the past produced incredible inventiveness and creative energy. That energy has now been released, and it will prove a powerful force. Women driving, cinemas opening, travel restrictions easing are but the outward indicators of a more profound transformation.We are witnessing the emergence of a new generation for whom investigation replaces revelation. We are free to act on our pent-up yearnings and ambitions. Dreams are becoming possibilities. Cynicism and resignation are giving give way to hope and determination.  Saudi Arabia will never be the same.It has become a truism to declare that a country's human capital is its greatest resource. There is no shortage of creativity in Saudi Arabia, but the government is putting its money where its mouth is.Led by Badr al Asaker, The Prince Mohammed bin Salman bin Abdulaziz Foundation — ""MiSK"" — has undertaken a far-reaching national initiative to foster the artistic and scientific talent, creative potential, and innovation of the country's youth.To harness the creative power of Saudi Arabia's millennial generation and to convert it into productive economic and social change, my colleagues and I established the Saudi National Creative Initiative — a collaborative knowledge transfer platform for mapping Saudi Arabia's creativity sector and fostering partnerships that unleash its full potential.  And we need your help.Progress is never linear, and there will be setbacks. Expectations are high and disappointment is all but inevitable.  But we can help manage these expectations by opening up and sustaining channels of communication and collaboration.The youth of Saudi Arabia is indeed aware, empowered and motivated as never before. However, foreign know-how, expertise, training and investment are required to translate today's opportunity into tomorrow's achievement. We must connect the tens of thousands of innovators among us to outside mentors, capital and the global infrastructure of partnership.My art and activism reflect the hope and unyielding optimism of a generation striving to make its voice heard.  For our entire lives, we have been fighting a war between the dreams of what we want and the reality in which we live.Today, it is undeniable that Saudi Arabia's reality has changed, and for the better.  We will make the desert bloom.Click here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

A new Chinese IPO broke out.The Trump news didn't stop ZTO Express (ZTO), a play on Chinese e-commerce, from breaking out. However, keep in mind that the stock has a penchant for pulling back rapidly after hitting new highs.At 2 p.m. ET, the Nasdaq shaved a 1% early-morning loss to nearly nil. Key Nasdaq component Apple (AAPL) erased minor morning losses and is trading near 188, up 5% past its latest 179.04 buy point in a seven-week double-bottom base.The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average also cut beefy early losses to around 0.2% to 0.3%. The small-cap S&P 600 rose fractionally.Meanwhile, the Dow transports rallied more than 1.1% as airline, railroad, logistics and truck firms gained ground amid a 1.6% drop in WTI crude oil futures. West Texas Intermediate crude is now at $70.70 a barrel, still up 17% year to date.Please read Wednesday's Big Picture column on how stocks today are mirroring the bullish activity seen in the prior session.

The Street sees Q2 profit rising 67% to 25 cents a share.On IBD Stock Checkup, ZTO gets an outstanding 98 Composite Rating on a scale of 1 to 99. The Relative Price Strength Rating of 83 means that ZTO has outperformed 83% of all public companies in IBD's database over the past 12 months.If the stock can maintain its fierce new uptrend, that RS Rating should rise. The up/down volume ratio is very strong at 2.7. See it in the ""Technical Performance"" section of Stock Checkup.The Shanghai-based company has a float of 426 million ADS (American depositary shares) and 721 million shares outstanding. The market cap of $13.3 billion makes it a midcap company.Netflix (NFLX), meanwhile, added gains after the streaming giant cleared a 338.92 proper entry in a narrow flat base. See today's Stock Spotlight column for a discussion on how Netflix formed two bases, and why the first one was flawed.Netflix joined IBD Leaderboard on April 5 as a half-position stock, then got upgraded to full-position status on April 17.

52,KIM,"This week, President Trump went to Singapore to meet with the most repressive dictator on the planet, North Korean Supreme Leader Kim Jung Un.Kim presides over a slave state of 25 million people, with gulags stacked with hundreds of thousands of political dissidents. He has diligently pursued nuclear weapons and long-range missile tests. He was greeted as a celebrity in Singapore, with President Trump shaking his hand, calling him ""very smart"" and ""a funny guy"" and generally praising him to the skies.Fans of President Trump were ecstatic. To them, this was a breakthrough movement: an American leader sitting down with a North Korean leader, finally breaking through the clutter of the past to get down to brass tacks. To Trump critics, this was a debacle: The president handed Kim an unprecedented propaganda coup, complete with grinning photos and thumbs up before a backdrop of interpolated North Korean and American flags.Here's the truth: We don't know what this will be yet.If it turns out that Trump has a trick up his sleeve — if it turns out that Trump has indeed convinced Kim to denuclearize and liberalize his country — then this will go down in history as a move of extraordinary genius. If, however, it's a photo op designed to allow Trump to claim status as a diplomatic wizard, and if Kim gives up nothing while the United States legitimizes an evil tyrant and ratchets down military exercises with South Korea, it will be a debacle.This was a high-risk, high-reward strategy.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseBut it doesn't appear that the White House thinks of it that way. Instead, it seems to view the summit as an unalloyed win for President Trump no matter what happens next. Trump, they say, can always reverse himself.Trump himself made the same point: ""Honestly, I think he's going to do these things. I may be wrong. ... I don't know that I'll ever admit that, but I'll find some kind of an excuse.""And herein lies the problem. Trump has a stake in not being wrong. That's why presidents typically don't hold face-to-face get-togethers with evil dictators until some sort of serious negotiation has already taken place. Trump is now invested in the success of his diplomacy, rather than in the strongest possible outcome alone. That's a win for Kim, at the very least.Trump has given Kim an advance against the possibility of future concessions. If those concessions never materialize, Trump will be forced to choose between admitting he was bamboozled and brazening through the humiliation, pretending that Kim is in fact a moderate force willing to work with him.Right now, barring additional evidence of North Korean surrender, Kim has the upper hand. That could always change tomorrow; we should hope and pray that it will. If it doesn't, then President Trump not only won't get a win out of the North Korean summit; he'll have been played by a tin-pot dictator with a penchant for murdering his family members.Other columns by Ben Shapiro

Forty-five percent of CEO candidates had at least one major career setback, yet 78% percent of those still won the position.In a ""Moneyball""-style research study, author Elena Botelho analyzed the data tied to successful leaders, much like the baseball executive in the famous movie used statistical analysis to prove that the conventional wisdom of baseball's way to measure player productivity was wrong.""We spent a decade applying state-of the-art analytics to a database of over 2,600 leaders to uncover who gets to the top and what sets apart the best CEOs,"" said Botelho, co-author with Kim Powell of ""The CEO Next Door: The 4 Behaviors That Transform Ordinary People into World-Class Leaders."" Botelho is also a partner in leadership advisory firm ghSMART.Tips on sharpening the right career skills:Master something. The most effective CEOs are 10 times more likely to be skilled in one or more of the four key behaviors highlighted in ""The CEO Next Door"": decisiveness, relentless reliability, engaging people for impact, and adapting boldly.Hire a mentor. ""The fastest and most effective way to develop any skill is to seek the guidance of a coach,"" said Stacey Hanke, author of ""Influence Redefined: Be the Leader You Were Meant to Be, Monday to Monday.""Be decisive. Aim for speed over precision, Botelho says.Her research advises making fewer but faster decisions, rather than spending too much time deliberating over the perfect one.Decisive CEOs are 12 times more likely to be high performers, she says.Show relentless reliability. Deliver what you promise, on time, every time, Botelho says.This sounds simple, but it turns out to be ""the most powerful behavior,"" she emphasizes. ""CEOs who are known for being reliable are 15 times more likely to be high-performing, and their odds of getting hired are double that of everyone else.""Reliable leaders do seemingly little things like being on time for meetings, planes and phone calls, and they follow up on agreed-upon actions.Adapt boldly. This is not so much about having a perfect lens into the future as it is about embracing a willingness to let go of the past, Botelho says.Conduct annual spring cleanings, she writes. ""Ask yourself and your team what habits, practices and assumptions hold you back today,"" and let those go.Remember that Kodak, Blockbuster and Borders were once household names, but failed to adapt.Engage for impact. Maintaining deliberate routines and being steady keep CEOs close to the business and its people so they can communicate what is important, Botelho says.While ""wildly charismatic 'masters of the universe' may prowl unchallenged in the boardrooms shown in Hollywood films,"" she continued, ""in real boardrooms, results speak louder than charisma.""Seek accountability help. If you don't measure something, it doesn't get done, Hanke says. And expanding your influence alone is nearly impossible.Hanke advises identifying areas where you'd like constructive criticism and then asking individuals in your circle to hold you accountable daily or weekly.Develop consistency. It's the difference between a good communicator and one with true influence, Hanke says. Make sure your verbal and nonverbal communication is in alignment.""When your listener is not guessing who is going to show up every day for every conversation,"" she said, ""they begin to trust you, which encourages them to follow your lead.""If you speak publicly or to a group regularly, record video of yourself.

57,KIM,"The headline writers adore the word ""historic."" It was ubiquitous in reporting on the April meeting between Kim Jong Un and Moon Jae-in. Kim shook Moon's hand and then guided him over the military demarcation line to step onto North Korean territory. This prompted swoons. What rot. If that was a bona fide gesture of peaceful intent, time will tell. In the meantime, let's assume it was a stunt.So, too, with the summit between Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump, though in this case the media hype couldn't compete with Trump's own. He has basked in talk of a Nobel Peace Prize and predicted that he and the butcher of Pyongyang were ""going to have a great discussion and a terrific relationship."" Obviously panting for a meeting, Trump was reportedly livid with national security adviser John Bolton, whose May comments about a ""Libya solution"" to the nuclear weapons problem apparently spooked Kim into withdrawing from the summit. Trump insisted that it was he who cancelled, just as he did with the Philadelphia Eagles' White House visit.But he showed quite a lot of ankle in his note. ""I felt a wonderful dialogue was building up between you and me,"" he cooed, closing with words conceding that it was Kim, not Trump, who had actually cancelled. ""If you change your mind having to do with this most important summit, please do not hesitate to call me or write."" Kim reeled in his catch. He sent an oversized letter Trump could pose with, grinning like a winner of the Publishers Clearing House sweepstakes.Why is our president smiling? You can always argue that democratic leaders must treat with dictators and even villains of various stripes for the sake of winning a war or securing the peace. You can even argue that sometimes presidents flatter unsavory leaders to build trust and ease tensions. But no historical comparisons can illuminate Trump's ricochets between hysterical threats (""fire and fury"") and pusillanimous praise (""very talented"") without any substantive change on the part of the dictator. What has changed since the State of the Union address in which Trump honored the memory of Otto Warmbier and detailed the atrocities of the North Korean regime? In gratitude for the exchange of pleasantries, the release of a few hostages and vague offers of ""denuclearization,"" Trump has made himself Kim's doormat.As a matter of substance, the Singapore summit achieved less than nothing. It was a profound defeat for U.S. world influence and for democratic decency, arguably the worst summit outcome since Yalta. Kim promised to consider ""denuclearization,"" exactly as his father and grandfather had done repeatedly over the past several decades — breaking their promises each and every time. For this puff of cotton candy, Trump agreed to halt ""U.S. war games"" (using the North Korean term for joint military exercises with South Korea), which Trump himself called provocative! He invited Kim to the White House. He also issued the risible tweet announcing, ahem, peace in our time: ""There is no longer a nuclear threat from North Korea.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseIt's difficult to determine just how stupid Trump thinks the American people are. But there is no question that Trump's affection for strongmen and thugs, evident before in his praise of the Chinese murderers of Tiananmen and his warm words for Vladimir Putin, Rodrigo Duterte and Xi Jinping, has now extended to the worst tyrant/killer on the planet. Trump did far more than overlook Kim's atrocious human rights abuses; he became Kim's PR man: ""He's a very talented man, and I also learned he loves his country very much."" He has a ""great personality"" and is ""very smart.""Trump granted Kim's legitimacy: ""His country does love him. His people, you see the fervor. They have a great fervor.""In 2014, a United Nations report concluded that North Korea's crimes against humanity ""entail extermination, murder, enslavement, torture, imprisonment, rape, forced abortions and other sexual violence, persecution on political, religious, racial and gender grounds, the forcible transfer of populations, the enforced disappearance of persons and the inhumane act of knowingly causing prolonged starvation.""What of all that? Trump is understanding, even impressed. ""Hey, he's a tough guy. When you take over a country — a tough country, tough people — and you take it over from your father, I don't care who you are, what you are, how much of an advantage you have. If you can do that at 27 years old, I mean, that's one in 10,000 that could do that. So he's a very smart guy. He's a great negotiator.""What was Trump's chief argument in 2016? The U.S. had been the victim of ""bad deals"" with other countries and he was the great deal-maker. He fingered the Iran deal as the worst deal in history. His defenders will excuse the truckling to Kim as a clever gambit to extract concessions. But Kim has offered absolutely nothing. All of the concessions have come from the United States, including the most crucial one: We've put ourselves on the same moral plane as North Korea.

59,KIM,"It has been a week full of wins for President Donald Trump — at least for those who share Trump's view of the way the world works, and perhaps even for some who don't.Exhibit A is Trump's summit meeting with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un in Singapore. In their self-congratulatory joint statement, they said that North Korea committed to ""work toward complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula"" and the United States agreed to ""provide security guarantees"" to North Korea.Critics said that that's not airtight language and argued that Kim came out better than the author of ""The Art of the Deal."" He got Trump to call for the cancelation of U.S.-South Korea military exercises in August in return for promises that his regime has repeatedly broken.Trump was having none of this. In place of the ""fire and fury"" he threatened not so long ago, he rhapsodized about new condominium developments. And unlike previous U.S. negotiators, his diplomacy was very personal: The president who began his Manhattan real estate career at 25 noted that Kim took power at 27.Similarly personal was the appeal in the four-minute video created by the National Security Council. Of 7 billion people on Earth, only a few can make a difference, the narrator said, adding that history need not be repeated but can evolve. That's hokey, critics said, but ""Dilbert"" creator Scott Adams, who famously predicted Trump's election based on his persuasive powers, said his ""first reaction"" to the video was that ""it might be the best thing that anybody ever did in a negotiation. Period.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe personal touch, by the way, distinguishes Trump's outreach to North Korea from former President Barack Obama's to Iran. The Iranian regime is a group project with many leaders who have ideological and economic interests in continuing hostility toward the United States. Obama's hope that he could change its outlook clearly went unrealized.Kim's regime, in contrast, appears highly personal, one in which the leader can order the sudden deposition and death of an uncle who is a key official. That regime's behavior, Trump is betting, will change if he can change the mind of one man.Of course this may not work out. The argument is that nothing else has, and with North Korean nukes now poised to hit the West Coast, it's worth trying. ""The world is safer than it was a week ago,"" writes veteran Washington Post foreign affairs columnist David Ignatius, ""and Trump is getting some deserved global applause.""""In expected value terms, this is the biggest triumph of the Trump presidency,"" blogs contrarian economist Tyler Cowen. ""The negative commentary I am seeing is mostly sour grapes, misplaced frustration, and it is weak in the quality of its argumentation.""Trump's almost-affectionate treatment of Kim is something like the relationship — making friends with supposed enemies — that he's cultivated with rapper Kanye West. In this case, the obvious goal is that he and his party will improve on the 8% he won from blacks in 2016.And make no mistake; it's his party — something that seemed highly unlikely when he rode down that escalator three years ago this month. Trump has near-unanimous job approval among self-described Republicans, and his clout in Republican primaries was demonstrated in one of his smaller victories this week.Just three hours before polls closed in South Carolina on Tuesday, Trump tweeted his endorsement of Katie Arrington against 1st District incumbent and frequent Trump critic Rep. Mark Sanford. The challenger got 50.6% and avoided a runoff by just 366 votes. Did the tweet make the difference?Another apparent Trump victory came without much notice, as House Speaker Paul Ryan and House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy blocked the efforts of some moderate Republicans and all House Democrats to get the 218 signatures required to trigger a roll call on a bill that would legalize the so-called ""Dreamers,"" young immigrants in the country illegally who were brought here as children, without strengthening immigration law enforcement.That was not the deal Trump had in mind when he promised to sign a bill legalizing recipients of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program and strengthening enforcement. Ryan and McCarthy promised roll-call votes next week on such a bill sponsored by House Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte and another as yet to be drafted by Republican moderates.These developments may not turn out to be Trump wins. The immigration bills probably won't pass and will fall short of Trump goals; Trump endorsement tweets may produce unelectable nominees; negotiations with North Korea may go nowhere.But maybe, as Trump has predicted, we're going to get tired of so much winning.Trump's High-Risk Game Of Nuclear 'Deal Or No Deal' With North Korea's KimTrump Gets High Marks For Handling North Korea: IBD/TIPP Poll

The number was below March's 1.354 million rate, but better than the decline to 1.350 million forecast by economists. Global markets recovered from an initial dip, but remained cautious following news late Tuesday that North Korea had reportedly canceled talks recently launched with South Korea. The country apparently has threatened to also abandon the planned June 12 summit between North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and President Trump.Across Asian stock markets, the Shanghai Composite fell 0.7% and Hong Kong's Hang Seng index took a 0.1% loss.

62,KIM,"Preoccupation with form over substance combined with denial and avoidance behavior are the chief causes of human failure — from the individual and family right up to the national level.World War II became inevitable because of denial by the British, French and Americans that Hitler meant what he said in ""Mein Kampf"" and was rearming to carry it out.  Subsequent denial in the form of appeasement policies enabled Hitler's early swift success in conquering and subjugating almost all of continental Europe, until Churchill rallied the British people with his famous declaration that ""we shall never surrender.""An Islamified Western Europe is arguably one of the biggest stories of our time.  Yet elites on both sides of the Atlantic are in denial about the coming Islamic takeover of much of Europe.  There are already large Muslim minorities throughout many European countries and waves of Muslim refugees have joined them in the last five years. Given Muslims' average birthrates of 3.5 children per couple compared to post-Christian European birthrates of only 1.35 per couple, the demographic die is cast for minarets and sharia law to supplant church bell-towers and constitutional democracy across Europe within two or three generations.Donald Trump has had no illusions about the challenges that the West faces.  His first action after inauguration in January 2017 was his executive order to ban travel to the U.S. by people from countries well-known for harboring Islamist terrorists.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseHe did so on the basis of zero-tolerance for terrorist entry to the U.S. and the fact that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement could not vet people adequately due to gaps and irregularities in birth and identification records characteristic of these designated highly unstable countries.In spite of the disrespect shown President Trump from many of the elites in the U.S., he has commanded surprising respect overseas, from friends and enemies alike. In his July 6, 2017 speech in Warsaw, Poland, Trump was welcomed as hero after he proclaimed the need to defend Christianity and Western Civilization, with all of its culture and traditions. He boldly stated the need to put ""faith and family, not government and bureaucracy, at the center of our lives.""No other U.S. President has made such unapologetic and direct statements that challenge the status quo of ""post-modern"" decline in Europe.Five months after taking office, President Trump removed the U.S. from the Paris Climate Accord, and has continued to remove restrictions on coal mining and open up more sea and land acreage for petroleum exploration and drilling.  The result?The U.S. is exporting natural gas and oil production is up — setting new records, now exceeding 10 million barrels a day, while oil imports are down.  The U.S. is just now on the cusp of achieving the long-sought goal of becoming energy and OPEC independent.In the Middle East, Trump ordered military strikes twice in Syria after President Bashar al-Assad used chemical weapons against people in Syria.  He recently pulled the U.S. out of the nuclear accord deal with Iran, and strengthened our relationship with Israel, moving the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem — both moves opposed by much of the elite establishment.On the Korean peninsula, in response to Kim Jung-un's ongoing ICBM missile testing and nuclear saber rattling, President Trump shunned avoidance and denial — taking an entirely different approach than the preceding four presidents over 28 years.And in spite of condemnation by the foreign policy establishment — that his direct approach would lead to confrontation and war — Trump never wavered in imposing harsh sanctions, repeatedly overflying B1 bombers near the DMZ, and making forceful statements warning ""rocket man"" about U.S. military capability to destroy the North Korean regime and its nuclear capability.The result? Kim Jong-un agreed to the U.S. demand to cease missile and nuclear testing.  Then he responded to overtures from South Korea, becoming the first North Korean leader to ever cross the DMZ to discuss peace terms since the Korean War ended in 1953. And days ago, the North Korean regime released three Americans imprisoned and held hostage.On the U.S. economy, many of the elites were in denial or passive about the harm from high corporate tax rates, excessive regulation and unbalanced trade policies that drove jobs and entire companies out of the U.S. and that also expanded the wealth gap between the rich and the poor.  Trump, the realist, said from the beginning that reducing regulations, lowering tax rates, simplifying the tax code, improving trade agreements and making American companies more competitive would fuel new economic growth.The result? The last three quarters of Trump's first year averaged a 3%-plus GDP increase, a growth rate not seen in the prior twelve-plus years. And 2018 came on like a lion after the passage of his Tax Cuts and Jobs Act at the end of 2017. More than three million American workers at more than 100 companies received pay raises and/or bonuses — as a result of the reduction of corporate tax rates from 35% to 21% and the reduction of repatriation tax rates from 35% to 8%-15%.Apple Inc.'s announcement to bring home $350 billion to invest in America is a likely harbinger of other corporations' repatriation of $1.75 to $2 trillion to the U.S. private economy.  For the first time in 18 years, the U.S. unemployment rate has fallen below 4%.Leadership requires getting out of denial and making tough decisions. It also requires delivering results and substance over form and appearance.  People may disagree with President Trump's persona and manner of communicating, but he's had one of the most successful starts of any new President in history — all the more remarkable given the non-stop assaults against him from day one by the media, Hollywood and political elite.Click here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

63,KIM,"Lockheed Martin (LMT), Raytheon (RTN) and Northrop Grumman (NOC) have received multibillion-dollar radar contracts as the Pentagon continues to bulk up its missile defense despite President Trump's claim the North Korea threat is over.XThe defense giants were each awarded deals worth up to $4.1 billion to ""provide autonomous acquisition and persistent precision tracking and discrimination to optimize the defensive capability of the Ballistic Missile Defense system,"" the Defense Department said late Tuesday.The companies will compete against each other until the Pentagon narrows the award down to a single contractor's radar.While it's not explicitly stated, the contract is for a replacement to Raytheon's massive Sea-Based X-Band Radar, which floats on a nine-story oil rig platform designed by Boeing (BA).The X-Band Radar ""is getting old and costly to operate. So they are moving to a ground-based solution there,"" said Tom Karako, a senior fellow and missile defense analyst at CSIS.The new radar will be deployed in Hawaii and have a 180-degree field of view toward North Korea, he said. He added that there might be a second radar planned for somewhere in the Pacific.Raytheon shares closed down 1% on the stock market today.

Trump later tweeted there ""is no longer a Nuclear Threat from North Korea.""However, satellite images have since shown North Korea upgrading the plutonium production reactor and support buildings at its Yongbyon Nuclear Scientific Research Center.While all the defense contractors picked have extensive missile defense experience, Lockheed has scored some key radar contracts recently.Lockheed is currently building the Long Range Discrimination Radar in Alaska. But Karako said the radar is too far north to see missiles headed to Hawaii from North Korea.Lockheed is also reportedly building its long-range radar for two of Japan's planned Aegis Ashore missile defense systems.Despite the large price tag, the X-Band Radar replacement can't be used against other emerging threats, such as hypersonic boost glide vehicles or a cruise missile attack, Karako said.""The Pentagon's missile defense review isn't out yet, but it was specifically tasked by Congress to look at the full range of missiles,"" he said.To counter sophisticated emerging threats from near-peer adversaries like China and Russia, space-based sensors will be needed as ground-based radars are limited by the curvature of the earth.Still, ground-based radars like the one slated for Hawaii will still be necessary as they augment space-based radars' coverage.Space-based sensors have been discussed by every administration since President Reagan's but haven't made it off the drawing board.""I predict this year a decision will be made,"" Karako saidYOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN: Defense And Aerospace Stocks To WatchThis U.S. Ally Buys Boeing Spy Planes As China Tension Heats UpAir Force Urges This New Hypersonic Weapons Mindset, Faster RolloutAs North Korea Threat Looms, Here's How U.S. Missile Defense Works

64,KIM,"Increasingly bitter and aggressive attacks on President Trump managed to bolster his approval rating, which climbed 5 points to reach the second highest level of his presidency, the latest IBD/TIPP Poll finds.The July poll found that 41% approve of the job Trump is doing. That's the first time he's been above 40% since March 2017, and just 1 point below his highest approval rating of 42% during his first month in office. Fifty-four disapprove of his job performance.Attacks on Trump intensified late last month in the wake of the administration's ""zero tolerance"" policy toward those caught illegally crossing the U.S.-Mexico border — including families.That policy resulted in the temporary separation of children from their parents seeking asylum. Trump later signed an executive order to keep families together while asylum claims played out.In the span of a few days, a mob chased Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen out of a D.C. restaurant, the owner of the Red Hen in Virginia kicked Trump spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders out. Actor Peter Fonda encouraged the abduction and molestation of the president's youngest son. Rep. Maxine Waters made remarks that appeared to encourage mob violence.Some Democrats worried that such antics would only help Trump, which the IBD/TIPP poll appears to confirm.At the same time, Trump scored a big win internationally with his summit meeting with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un. He also won a string of victories at the Supreme Court. Among other things, the court upheld Trump's travel ban on certain Muslim countries.Trump not only made gains among Republicans — 83% of whom now approve of the job he's doing — but among independents, whose approval climbed 5 points to 34%. His approval jumped 7 points among men and 2 points among women.Regionally, Trump's biggest gain came from the south (up 8 points) and rural areas (up 7 points). He also made strong gains among the young, high school educated, and lower income groups, as well as among blacks.The July IBD/TIPP Poll shows a four-point gain in Trump's favorability, which is currently -13 (40% favorable to 53% unfavorable).The broader IBD/TIPP Presidential Leadership Index for Trump is now 44.3, an almost 8% gain over last month and the highest it's been since his second month in office.However, more say they'd prefer a Congress controlled by Democrats rather than Republicans after the midterm elections, 48% to 40%. The Democrats' +8 score on this generic ballot question is up a point from last month.The Real Clear Politics average of national polls on the generic ballot has Democrats up by 5.9 points. At the start of the year, Democrats were up by 13 points in the RCP average.And Trump's recent immigration actions are not winning a lot of support.The poll found that just 33% give him high marks for his handling of the situation involving families who've illegally crossed into the U.S. from Mexico. On a partisan basis, 67% of Republicans approved, 27% of independents, and 4% Democrats.The poll also found that a plurality (43%) say Trump's immigration policies have had no impact on security along the southern border. Forty say they've improved security; 13% say they've weakened it.Still, last month's poll found the public backing Trump on sanctuary cities. And the February IBD/TIPP Poll found that 50% approve of ""the construction of physical and electronic barriers along the southern U.S. border."" It also found that 55% back limits on chain migration.While Trump's approval rating improved, the FBI's has taken a beating in the wake of the inspector general's report detailing how FBI agents and officials bungled its investigation into Hillary Clinton's mishandling of classified information while secretary of State.The poll found that just 39% have a favorable view of the FBI, with 30% feeling unfavorable and 31% not sure.More than half of the public (53%) say political bias influenced the FBI's decision not to recommend charges against Clinton. Just 37% say politics didn't play a role.Not surprisingly, more than three-quarters of Republicans point to political bias for the FBI's exoneration of Clinton. But so do 55% of independents. Even among Democrats, more 1 in 5 (27%) say bias influenced the FBI's decision to drop the case against Clinton.The public splits on whether there was outright collusion between the FBI and Clinton, given revelations in an inspector general's report that FBI employees got gifts from reporters. While 44% say this is evidence of collusion, 47% say it isn't and 8% aren't sure.However, the public is also split on the question of Trump's colluding with Russia during the 2016 presidential campaign.Forty-seven say that special counsel Robert Mueller would have produced evidence of collusion by now if there were any. But 49% say the lack of evidence after more than a year of investigation doesn't mean Trump is off the hook.Methodology: IBD/TIPP conducted the July poll from June 21 to June 29. It includes responses from 900 people nationwide, who were asked questions by live interviewers on phones. The poll's margin of error is +/-3.3 percentage points. (Toplines from the July IBD/TIPP Poll can be found here.)The IBD/TIPP Poll has been credited as being the most accurate poll in the past four presidential elections, and was one of only two that correctly predicted the outcome of the November 2016 presidential election.YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:IBD/TIPP: America's Most Accurate PollsterPresidential Approval, Direction Of CountryEconomic Optimism Index

65,KIM,"Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., wonders: ""Is there any doubt that America would view a foreign nation firing missiles at targets on American soil as an act of war?"" His question might be pertinent to why the Singapore summit happened, and what, if anything, was changed by it. The question certainly is relevant to constitutional government as it pertains — if it still does pertain — to war.Kaine was responding to a 22-page opinion the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel issued 12 days before the summit. The opinion concerns the president's order for the April 13 air strikes against facilities associated with Syria's chemical weapons, after the use of such weapons in a Damascus suburb. The OLC argues that the presidential order, issued without authorization by or consultation with Congress, was nevertheless lawful because the president ""had reasonably determined that the use of force would be in the national interest and that the anticipated hostilities would not rise to the level of a war in the constitutional sense.""Kaine describes as ""ludicrous"" the principle that presidents ""can magically assert 'national interest' and redefine war to exclude missile attacks and thereby bypass Congress."" The OLC's capacious definition of actions in the ""national interest"" encompasses ""protection of U.S. persons and property,"" ""assistance to allies,"" ""support for the United Nations,"" ""promoting regional stability,"" prevention of a ""humanitarian catastrophe,"" and ""deterrence of the use and proliferation of"" particularly heinous weapons.This is perhaps germane to Singapore. There Kim Jong Un committed himself only to a process — ""to work toward"" the goal of ""complete denuclearization of the Korean peninsula"" — and processes can be interminable (e.g., the Middle East ""peace process""). Furthermore, North Korea has espoused this goal for over three decades. Still, let us prematurely assume that something momentous has been achieved. And that the achievement was related to the U.S. policy of ""maximum pressure,"" including the threat, made vivid by deployments of impressive U.S. military assets, of the use of force by the president who, like many predecessors, feels free to act without involving Congress.The threat of military force by an unconstrained president was underscored for Kim shortly before Singapore, when Sen. Lindsey Graham, R.-S.C., a confidant of this president, said of North Korea, ""If they play Trump, we're going to have a war."" He said ""denuclearization"" of North Korea is ""non-negotiable,"" and that a North Korean nuclear capability to strike America ""ensures their demise"": ""If (the president) has to pick between millions of people dying in America, and millions of people dying over there, he's going to pick millions of people dying over there if he has to.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseNote the senator's clear premise: It is for the president to ""pick"" between war involving millions of deaths, and peace. Congress, its arthritic knees creaky from decades of genuflections at the altar of presidential power, will be a gimpy spectator.The OLC says it has ""well over 100"" episodes that support its contention that for 230 years presidents have unilaterally employed force in episodes short of ""sustained, full-scale conflict with another nation."" Note well: ""Sustained."" ""Full-scale."" ""With another nation.""The OLC notes that even the 1973 War Powers Resolution, by which Congress attempted to circumscribe presidential war-making discretion, allows presidents to introduce U.S. forces into hostilities for at least 60 days without congressional authorization. Still, the OLC acknowledges that presidents must ""resort to Congress"" for approval of hostilities ""which reach a certain scale,"" involving U.S. troops in ""significant risk over a substantial period."" ""Certain"" scale. ""Significant"" risk. ""Substantial"" period. There can be ""substantial"" deployments (e.g., two years enforcing a no-fly zone, and 20,000 ground troops, in Bosnia) and engagements more violent than April's Syria episode (e.g., the U.S.-led 2011 air campaign in Libya lasting more than a week and involving more than 600 missiles and precision-guided munitions) without ""war in the constitutional sense.""The Supreme Court has said that ""long settled and established practice is a consideration of great weight in a proper interpretation of constitutional provisions regulating the relationship between Congress and the president."" Regarding unilateral presidential use of military force, the OLC notes a ""long continued practice on the part of the executive, acquiesced in by the Congress.""Perhaps this got Kim nervous, and to Singapore. Nevertheless, the OLC's meticulous argument on behalf of its client, the president, does not validate the principle that invocations of the ""national interest"" would legitimate a president's decision to ""pick"" a major preventive war on the Korean peninsula.Other columns by George WillMore Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

66,KIM,"Nike's (NKE) corporate culture was reportedly such that male executives could pursue sexual relationships — sometime extramarital — with subordinates without fear of repercussion, while women did not escape unscathed, according to a report Wednesday.XFormer employees at the world's biggest athletic apparel brand told Bloomberg that women in such relationships experienced negative consequences, like being reassigned, while the men largely avoided punishment.Nearly a dozen Nike execs, including one woman, have stepped down over the last two months amid surfacing allegations of workplace misbehavior and a ""boy's club"" atmosphere. The names of another five managers came to light Tuesday: Steve Lesnard, Tommy Kain, Helen Kim, Simon Pestridge and Ibrahem Hasan.Women were subject to derogatory nicknames by one supervisor, said a Bloomberg source. Female employees sometimes participated in bullying behavior too. The outlet also noted that top exec Trevor Edwards, longtime Nike Brand president until he stepped down in March, ""had a reputation for humiliating subordinates in meetings,"" and his behavior was mimicked by others.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of Use""There are a lot of very talented people deeper in the organization who have been marginalized both by senior and middle management trying to protect their domain,"" former Nike exec Shaz Kahng told Bloomberg.According to the Wall Street Journal, the recent departures conclude the first part of Nike's internal investigation into workplace complaints. The review was initially spurred by disquiet from within the company that resulted in an informal survey tracking concerns from Nike's female employees.Shares of Nike were down 0.7% at 67.95 in the stock market today, but found support at their 50-day line again. Under Armour (UAA) stock lost 0.2%. Adidas (ADDYY) lost 1.4%.It's not clear yet to what extent the scandal will impact Nike's revenue or its relationship to its women customers, but some analysts have already been pointing to the longer-term consequences.""The executive departures could be more disruptive than most appreciate,"" wrote Susquehanna's Sam Poser on April 19, noting that the changes in leadership are for the best, but will leave talent gaps in the company.""While we believe there is talent that can step into the vacated roles, the contributions of the departing executives will not easily, nor quickly, be replaced,"" he said.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN: This Smart Clothing Could Transform Wearables — And Your WardrobeNike CEO Apologizes To Employees For Corporate CultureUnder Armour Is Threatened By This 'Ticking Time Bomb': AnalystDow Stumbles In Morning Trade As This IBD 50 Stock Takes An Earnings HitNike Upgrade Echoes This 'SNL' Athleisure Spoof; Under Armour JumpsThe '90s Are Back And Bringing These Brands With Them

67,KIM,"If President Donald Trump's incendiary threats have actually frightened the ""dear respected comrade"" Kim Jong Un into laying down his nuclear arsenal, he will deserve the Nobel Peace Prize his fans are demanding. But the suits in Oslo might want to hold off before awarding another premature Peace Prize to an American leader.One expects the press to swoon whenever a blood-drenched tyrant smiles and shakes hands with a democratic leader, and they played their part this time.After Kim's announcement that he was suspending the nation's nuclear testing, CNN's Will Ripley gushed to Wolf Blitzer: ""This is an extraordinarily significant development, and frankly a huge win for President Trump going into these discussions, this potential summit, with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.""Trevor Noah softened his anti-Trump tone, saying, ""I know our first instinct is to hate, but if it wasn't for his craziness, North Korea would never have come to the table.""And Sen. Lindsay Graham enthused that if President Trump ""can lead us to ending the Korean War"" while ""getting North Korea to give up their nuclear program"" in a verifiable way, then ""he deserves the Nobel Peace Prize and then some."" South Korea's president said the same.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseWith characteristic modesty, Trump tweeted: ""With all of the failed 'experts' weighing in, does anybody really believe that talks and dialogue would be going on between North and South Korea right now if I wasn't firm, strong and willing to commit our total 'might' against the North. Fools, but talks are a good thing!""Perhaps it's relief after the unsettling exchange of schoolyard insults and nuclear threats between Kim and Trump, but it seems that people are rushing to declare that something momentous has been achieved when we have no reason to believe that, yet.Even the most hawkish must always remain open to the possibility of real change in an adversary. Mikhail Gorbachev was a different kind of Soviet leader, and it was wise of Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan to recognize that. Anwar Sadat was sincere in his desire to make peace with Israel (though, sadly, he paid for it with his life). South Africa's President F. W. de Klerk dismantled apartheid and agreed to majority rule.It's possible that Kim Jong Un is such a figure, but it is more likely that he is following in the well-worn path of his father and grandfather: Fire off some missiles or attack South Korea's military installations, and then make solemn promises to reform. Cash check in the form of concessions from the West. Oh, and then cheat.In 1991, North Korea signed a joint declaration endorsing the ""denuclearization"" of the Korean peninsula. Both sides promised not to ""test, manufacture, produce, receive, possess, store, deploy, or use nuclear weapons"" or to ""possess nuclear reprocessing and uranium enrichment facilities.""There were immediate problems with compliance. The Clinton administration responded with a flurry of diplomatic efforts (Jimmy Carter was a special envoy to Kim Jong Il), which led to the Agreed Framework of 1994, in which North Korea once again promised not to pursue nuclear weapons.In exchange, the allies gave the North heavy fuel oil and two ""light water nuclear reactors"" for peaceful energy. President Clinton called it ""a good deal for the United States."" North Korea's negotiator, Kang Sok-ju, described it as ""a very important milestone document of historic significance"" that would resolve his country's nuclear dispute with the United States ""once and for all."" The pact, he swore, would resolve ""all questions of the so-called nuclear weapons development by North Korea"" that have raised ""such unfounded concerns and suspicions.""The North cheated, and formalized it in 2003 by dropping out of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.In 2005, negotiators agreed that North Korea would be removed from the list of state sponsors of terrorism, and would no longer be under the strictures of the Trading with the Enemy Act. In return — all together now — North Korea committed to shutting down the Yongbyon nuclear facility. In addition, ""all nuclear weapons"" would be ""comprehensively declared and completely, verifiably and irreversibly eliminated.""North Korea has been selling the same promise to denuclearize for 27 years, getting a good price every time.""Coming to the table"" is not such a milestone for the North Koreans. It's worked brilliantly for them.

68,KIM,"Despite the daily pounding he receives from the media, President Trump enjoys two advantages — low expectations and lots of time.When the opposition party and their media cohorts call Trump an idiot, a fool, a liar, racist, sexist, homophobic, anti-immigrant, anti-Mexican, incompetent, lazy, unfocused, greedy, hateful, fascist, tyrannical and/or Hitler-esque, there's really nowhere to go but up.Recall how immediately after Trump took office, ""experts"" predicted a short administration, perhaps of months-long duration. Critics said Trump did not really think he would win. The recent anti-Trump book by Michael Wolff even claims that Trump did not want to win. Some even predicted that Trump, having captured the presidency, would grow bored and quickly return to his construction business.This brings us to Trump's second advantage: time. There is a long time between now and November, let alone between now and the end of Trump's second term. The piling-on in the first year and a half of the Trump presidency contradicts a reality, quite annoying to Trump bashers: The man is fulfilling one campaign promise after another.The Obama administration, for example, complained about our NATO partners' failure to spend the expected amount on national security. After Trump loudly complained that only five of the 29 member nations spend the minimum NATO requirement of 2% of their gross domestic product on defense; that America was being used and financially ripped off by an ""obsolete"" NATO, which doesn't fight terrorism; and that member nations need to ""promptly pay their bills,"" what happened? Several members pledged to increased their military spending.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseHow many Republican presidential candidates over the years complained about the ban on drilling for oil in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, known as ANWR? Trump signed legislation to begin the process of repealing the ban. Trump successfully appointed more federal appellate judges than any first-year president in history. Trump lowered the corporate tax rate, once the highest statutory rate in the industrialized world. Trump, as promised, eliminated or delayed numerous job-killing regulations. He approved the construction of the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines.The stock market has repeatedly reached all-time highs, and for the first time in years, polls show that Americans believe young peoples' lives will be better than their parents'. An April 2018 Gallup poll found 61% believe today's youth ""will have a better life than their parents did,"" the highest mark since 2010.When Trump derisively called North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un ""rocket man,"" critics practically counted down our remaining days on earth before we would see mushroom clouds. As the only President ever with neither political nor military experience, Trump was called everything from a warmonger to naive. In January, former Vice President Joe Biden said, ""(North Korea) is not a game. This is not about 'can I puff my chest out bigger than yours.' (Trump's threat) is just not — it's not presidential.""President Trump, shortly after taking office, placed American aircraft carriers in the Sea of Japan. Three aircraft carriers and their multi-ship strike groups conducted war exercises in mid-November. Well, well. It was not long after this that Kim Jong Un became the first North Korean dictator to set foot on South Korean soil. Kim announced plans to end the 68-year-old Korean War and even promised to ""denuclearize,"" as Trump demanded as a condition of removing economic sanctions.Ronald Reagan would caution the new President to ""trust, but verify,"" and there's a long way to go before Trump can declare victory on the North Korean issue. But even Trump haters, whether or not they give Trump credit, must admit that the world is better off with a North Korea without nuclear weapons.Trump's achievements are all the more impressive given that from the beginning of his presidency he has been under investigation for allegedly ""colluding"" with the Russians to win the election. The collusion investigation has apparently evolved into an investigation of lying to investigators, obstruction of justice, money laundering and possible campaign finance violation over the $130K payoff to porn star Stormy Daniels.There is an irony here. Many of the Trump bashers cheering special counsel Robert Mueller's probe also called the impeachment of President Bill Clinton a ""witch hunt."" To this day, many believe Congress impeached Clinton because of his extramarital affair in the White House with an intern. In fact, the House impeached him because he lied under oath and committed obstruction of justice. He was later found in contempt of court for lying and temporarily lost his license to practice law.Former California Republican Congressman James Rogan was a House manager, one of the House members who agreed to prosecute Clinton in the Senate. Rogan, now a judge, said that had Congress done nothing to Clinton it would have set a precedent that a president can, without consequences, lie under oath. And if a president can lie under oath, argued Rogan, why can't any person justify or rationalize lying under oath?Had Clinton not been impeached, and had the precedent been established that presidents could lie under oath, Trump would have little to fear from a ""perjury trap.""Other columns by Larry Elder

71,KIM,"The Trump administration is trying to make health insurance affordable again. That's the aim of a regulation issued earlier this month by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.The new rule would give states greater leeway over how they comply with ObamaCare's essential health benefits, or EHB, mandate, which requires all insurance policies to cover a group of ten categories of healthcare services.Relaxing ObamaCare's rules is a far cry from the full-scale repeal Republicans promised over the last eight years and especially during the 2016 campaign.But with Congress seemingly unwilling to take up healthcare reform before this November's mid-term elections, incremental regulatory tweaks from the administration are the best that Americans desperate for affordable coverage can hope for.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe EHB mandate effectively prohibits insurers from selling low-cost, bare-bones plans. All 22 million people in the individual market — whether they shop on the exchanges or not — must choose a comprehensive policy that covers everything from maternity care to prescription drugs to substance-abuse treatment.The mandate also requires insurers to cover preventive services, such as vaccines and counseling,  at zero cost to patients.Those extra benefits aren't free; providing them costs insurers money. So they have raised premiums. A Heritage Foundation review of several state-level studies found that, on average, the EHB mandate increases premiums by 9%.  An analysis by Today eHealth Inc. posits a much larger impact — a 47% increase.As premiums have soared, thanks in part to the cost-inflating EHB mandate, more and more Americans have turned their backs on Obamacare's exchanges. Enrollment in exchange plans fell from a peak of 12.7 million in 2016  to 12.2 million in 2017 to just 11.8 million in 2018.In other words, nearly a million people could no longer afford the plans — or concluded the policies simply didn't deliver enough value to justify the expense.Several states have contemplated weakening the EHB mandate in order to reduce the cost of insurance within their borders. Idaho officials, for example, recently proposed a measure that would allow insurers to sell policies that openly ignore Obamacare's benefits requirements.The Trump administration rightly blocked Idaho from implementing its plan. Obamacare remains the law of the land. Allowing state officials to openly disregard federal statutes would set a terrible precedent.Iowa found a more nuanced work-around. Gov. Kim Reynolds just signed a law which empowers the Iowa Farm Bureau and Wellmark Blue Cross Blue Shield to offer ""health benefit plans"" to any person who joins the Farm Bureau, a non-profit community organization open to all Hawkeye State residents. The Hawkeye State is adapting a model that originated — and worked well — in Tennessee.Iowa law does not consider these plans health insurance: ""a health benefit plan sponsored by a nonprofit agricultural organization domiciled in the state for its members shall not be deemed to be insurance and shall not be subject to the jurisdiction of the commissioner of insurance.""Hence, the plans aren't subject to Obamacare's cost-inflating regulations — including the EHB mandate.  Consequently, Iowans may soon have access to more affordable healthcare options through the Farm Bureau.The Trump administration's new EHB rule could give states yet another way to ratchet down premiums. At present, federal regulations define the essential health benefits in a given state relative to a benchmark plan selected by that state. That plan serves as the standard that all other plans have to follow.Under the new CMS rule, which takes effect in 2020, states have three new options for tailoring their EHB rules. They can set their EHB requirements according to the benchmark plan that another state is using.  They can replace one or more of their EHB categories with those from another state. Or they can design their own essential health benefit categories.If one state's benchmark plan has slightly less generous — and consequently less expensive — coverage of essential health benefits, another state can ""import"" those standards as its own. Or a state can take the flexibility the federal rule provides and build custom EHB requirements that draw on the best that other states have to offer.The CMS rule falls short of scrapping the EHB mandate completely. But it's a small dose of regulatory relief that should help decrease premiums at the margins. And that's exactly what the Trump administration should be doing given Congress's reluctance to act.Click here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

72,KIM,"Raytheon (RTN) expects missile defense demand to remain strong, in the Asia region specifically, regardless of what happens in expected U.S.-North Korea talks, as the maker of the Patriot defense system reported strong Q1 earnings.The Trump administration dispatched CIA Director Mike Pompeo to Pyongyang earlier for preliminary discussions, and negotiations between President Trump and Kim Jong-Un may start in the next month or so. Meanwhile, North Korea has already announced it would stop nuclear missile tests.But Raytheon CFO Toby O'Brien told IBD that he sees demand across all regions of the world and doesn't see that slowing down any time soon.Regional customers also continue to modernize their arsenals with increased demand for new capabilities, such as the latest version of the Standard Missile-3 and the Standard Missile-6.The Patriot missile-defense system remained a strong driver of Q1 results. Raytheon's Integrated Defense Systems unit saw sales rise 7% to $1.49 billion, led by an international Patriot contract award. During Q1, the unit booked over $2 billion for Patriot capabilities to the U.S. and its allies.Earnings per share from continuing operations jumped 27% to $2.20, beating Zacks Investment Research estimates by 10 cents.

Total backlog at the end of Q1 was $38.14 billion, down from $38.21 billion at the end of 2017 but up from $36.05 billion a year ago. Operating cash flow from continuing operations was $283 million compared to an outflow of $41 million a year ago.Raytheon now sees full-year EPS at $9.70-$9.90, above consensus for $9.69 and up from its prior views of $9.55-$9.75, on net sales of $26.5 billion-$27 billion, vs. consensus for $26.81 billion, up from a prior view of $26.4 billion-$26.9 billion.

75,KIM,"North Korea has befuddled the United States and its Asian allies ever since North Korean leader Kim Il Sung launched the invasion of South Korea in June 1950.Prior to the attack, the United States had sent inadvertent signals that it likely would not protect South Korea in the event of an unexpected invasion from the north. Not surprisingly, a war soon followed.Gen. Douglas MacArthur, after leading a brilliant landing at Inchon in September 1950, chased the communists back north of the 38 parallel. In hot pursuit, MacArthur gambled that the Chinese would not invade, as he sought to conquer all of North Korea and unite the peninsula.As MacArthur barreled northward to the Chinese border during the fall of 1950, the landscaped widened. American supply lines lengthened. MacArthur's forces thinned. The weather worsened. The days shortened.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseConventional wisdom had been that the Chinese would not invade, given America's near nuclear monopoly and likely air superiority. But in November 1950, what eventually would become nearly a million-man Chinese army did just that, pouring southward into the Korean peninsula.The Chinese and North Koreans pushed the American and United Nations forces past the Demilitarized Zone at the 38th parallel. In January 1951, the communists retook Seoul after forcing the longest American military retreat in U.S. history.With the arrival of military genius Gen. Matthew Ridgway, the U.S. regrouped. In early 1951, Western troops retook Seoul and drove communist forces back across the 38th Parallel. But despite continued success, Western forces chose not to reinvade the north and reunite the country.What followed the 1953 armistice that ended the Korean War was a tense Cold War standoff between two antithetical Korean countries for the next 65 years. North Korean assassinations, kidnappings and continual provocations continued throughout the ""peace.""In 1994, the Bill Clinton administration gave massive aid to North Korea under the ""Agreed Framework"" deal, including heavy fuel oil. In exchange, North Korea promised to cease its ongoing nuclear proliferation.Predictably, North Korean leadership lied. It eagerly took the aid only to further fast-track its nuclear weapons program.The George W. Bush administration in 2003 arranged for ""six-party talks"" — China, Japan, North Korea, Russia, South Korea and the U.S. — to discourage North Korean nuclear proliferation. America and its allies once more provided aid and promised not to attack the Kim Jong Il regime. In exchange, Pyongyang agreed in writing to dismantle ""all nuclear weapons and existing nuclear programs.""Once more, North Korea outsmarted Western naifs. It interpreted American concessions as weakness to be exploited rather than magnanimity to be reciprocated.In 2006, North Korea detonated a nuclear device.The Barack Obama administration learned nothing from the failures of the Clinton and Bush administrations. It followed the same old tired script of lecturing North Korea about its violations of international law. Then, predictably, Obama gave more aid to North Korea while pleading that it change its behavior and denuclearize. Obama's policy was called ""strategic patience"" — a hope that if North Korea would not compromise, it at least would eventually collapse due to its corruption and malfeasance.Obama misjudged North Korea as every other president had since the end of the Korean War. North Korea only further expanded its nuclear arsenal. Pyongyang always figured it could feign one of its ""crazy"" moods and then play on Western empathy for more money, all while China smiled and claimed ignorance.Soon after Donald Trump was elected, North Korea announced that it was now capable of using its nuclear weaponry to take out cities on America's West Coast. But this time around, the U.S. did not offer bribes. Instead, it issued its own threats to North Korea. Trump himself assumed the unhinged role the Kims usually played, denigrating Kim Jong Un as ""Little Rocket Man"" and ""short and fat.""But the Trump administration also lined up an international boycott of North Korea that is slowly squeezing the regime. Now, Kim Jong Un suddenly wants to talk. A collapsing North Korea once again claims it will denuclearize, but first it wants a historic photo-op with a U.S. president.What have we learned about North Korea in the past 65 years? North Korea's cunning usually trumps America's ideals of fair play and self-confidence. Empty threats do not work. Appeasement with infusions of food, cash and fuel makes things worse.China finds its North Korea client useful. Russia is usually against anything we are for. South Korea appeases North Korea when it senses U.S. weakness. It stands firm only when America does.What should Trump do after seven decades of North Korean aggression?Ratchet up the embargo of North Korea. Do not give it any aid — no matter the pleas and threats. Put more pressure on China.

76,KIM,"Media Bias: Of all the many recent examples of glaring media bias, none stands out so much as the rank politicization by the U.S. media of the South Korean Winter Olympics. What should be a happy, come-together moment for all of America rooting for its athletes, instead became a hate-Trump, #Resistance moment for the far-left media.XThe trump-hatred has metastasized so far that today many journalists have completely abandoned any pretense of fairness and objectivity in their coverage of the world, so long as what they do makes Donald Trump and his administration look bad, stupid or ridiculous.Sorry, but fawning over the evil representatives of a country we are still technically at war with is really too much.No Hidden Agenda: Get News From A Pro-Free Market, Pro-Growth PerspectiveLet's start with a basic premise: Kim Jong-un, North Korea's leader, is one of the most evil people on Earth. He and his family, as the murderous tyrants that rule the Hermit Kingdom, have been implicated in the deaths of millions by starvation, overwork, torture, execution and outright murder.As mass murderers, the Kim family is as morally culpable as Adolf Hitler, Mao Zedong or Joseph Stalin — though, admittedly, North Korea's killing fields are much smaller than those in Nazi Germany, Soviet Russia or Mao's China.The Kim family regime — there has been no other since the nation was created in 1948 — deny their citizens all of the rights that we in the West take for granted: freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom of choice, freedom of association, freedom of political affiliation, and freedom to own property and live your life as you see fit.As part of its effort to restart talks with North Korea, South Korea invited North Korea to send its athletes to compete as one team. North Korea sent athletes, but also ""cheerleaders"", and Kim Jong-un's sister, along with a bevy of high-level North Korean officials, as official representatives.Never mind that terrrorist-supporting North Korea has been using the Games to ""normalize"" itself as a nation among nations. But what was so irksome was the respectful, fawning coverage the U.S. media gave to the North Koreans, in particular Kim Jong-un's sister, while ridiculing the U.S.' official delegation, headed by Vice President Pence and his wife, Karen.It was unclear whose idea it was, but Kim, South Korean President tk and Pence all shared a viewing box. The media tsk-tsked when Pence refused to stand as the North Korean slaves, er, athletes entered the Olympic stadium. Meanwhile, their mass media crush on Kim Yo-ong was tough to hide.Below a flattering picture of Kim, CNN ran the disgraceful headline, ""Kim Jong Un's sister is stealing the show at the Winter Olympics.""The New York Times tweetsmiths issued this dictator-friendly tweet: ""Without a word, only flashing smiles, Kim Jong-un's sister outflanked Vice President Mike Pence in diplomacy.""Think that's it? Ben Domenech at The Federalist  runs down some of the greatest hits, with headlines that look like they were written by the satirical web site The Onion rather than a reputable news agency:Yahoo: ""All swagger and smiles, Kim Jung Un's mysterious sister gets her star turn at Winter Olympics.""Associated Press: ""At Olympic Games, Kim Jong Un's sister takes VIP seat.""Washington Post: ""The 'Ivanka Trump of North Korea' captivates people in the South.""Then there was this Reuters gem: ""North Korea has emerged as the early favorite to grab one of the Winter Olympics' most important medals, the diplomatic gold.""Virtually none of the accounts said who Kim Yo-jong really is. She's not just another pretty face. Since at least 2011, when her father died, Kim Yo-jong has been a key confidante and aide to her brother Kim Jong-un.Since 2015, she has been head of the Communist Party's Propagannda and Agitation Department, and also holds a post as vice minister in the government of her brother.As such, she is every bit as complicit in the North Korean government's crimes — including vicious murders of anyone who dissents and the torture death of Otto Warmbier, whose father was a guest of Vice President Pence in Korea — as her brother.Just last year, she was one of seven North Korean officials to be added to the U.S. sanctions list for her part in the regime's ""severe human rights abuses"" and ""rigid censorship policies.""So calling Kim Yo-jong the ""Ivanka Trump of North Korea"" is like calling Ilsa Koch, the She-Wolf of the SS, the ""Shirley Temple of Nazi Germany."" The media that laud her and insult Pence are despicable. There is no other word that fits.This is a serious business. Most of the reporters don't understand that the world almost went to a World War III over Korea in the early 1950s. If not for North Korea's Communist Chinese patrons, it would have collapsed years if not decades ago.Instead, it's menacing the world and its closest neighbors with its burgeoning nuclear arsenal, courtesy of former President Clinton's foolish ""deal"" that let North Korea back into the nuclear game in the early 1990s.As Fox News noted, ""Top U.S. intelligence officials warned lawmakers Tuesday not to be fooled by North Korea's diplomatic outreach at the Olympic Games, reminding Congress at a high-profile hearing that the dictatorship still represents an 'existential threat' to the U.S.""So thanks, biased media. You even made the Winter Olympics, which should be a celebration of the joy of sport, into an opportunity to bash Donald Trump and the nation he leads. Your nation.There's a reason why thousands and thousands of people are cancelling your papers, turning off your TV news feeds, unfriending you on social media and holding you in such low esteem that you're at the rock-bottom of most opinion polls. And it's not because you're doing your job.You Might Also Like:North Korea's Nuclear Threat Is Here And It's Real — Kim Jong Un's Regime Must Go Putting North Korea On U.S.' Terrorist List Was Long Overdue Yes, Media Bias Is Real, As Survey ShowsClick here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

77,KIM,"Futures for the S&P 500 index, Dow Jones industrial average and Nasdaq 100 rose slightly Friday morning after President Donald Trump agreed to meet North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. The S&P 500 faces a key technical test as the February employment report will show if wage gains remain hot.X Trump will meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un by May, South Korea's national security adviser Chung Eui-Yong told reporters late Thursday. South Korean officials met with Trump on Thursday with Kim's invitation and offer to suspend nuclear and missile tests. Chung said that North Korea's leader said he's ""committed to denuclearization.""The White House said President Trump ""will accept the invitation to meet with Kim Jong Un at a place and time to be determined. We look forward to the denuclearization of North Korea. In the meantime, all sanctions and maximum pressure must remain.""Trump took to Twitter to hail ""great progress"" on this huge geopolitical issue.Kim Jong Un talked about denuclearization with the South Korean Representatives, not just a freeze. Also, no missile testing by North Korea during this period of time. Great progress being made but sanctions will remain until an agreement is reached. Meeting being planned!— Donald J.

79,KIM,"Trade: President Trump's decision to slap tariffs of $50 billion of imports from China for that nation's routine theft of American intellectual property may well be a political masterstroke that results in U.S. companies getting fairer treatment from China. But, as a long-term answer to our economic differences, it comes up far short.China didn't wait long. It immediately imposed trade restrictions on 128 U.S. goods, including ""wine, fresh frutit dried fruit and nuts, steel pipes, modified ethanol and ginseng,"" according to CNBC.While just $3 billion in U.S. sales are affected, a Chinese government statement said it would hit other U.S. goods if China and the U.S. couldn't hash their differences out in negotiations.So it's official: We're in a trade war. Now what?Trump has shown repeatedly that he's a nimble strategic thinker, and uses bluff, bravado and decisiveness to put his political and economic foes on their heels.By putting tariffs on Chinese goods, mostly high tech, Trump has a number of things in mind, and it's not all about trade.For one, Trump is right that China routinely cheats by stealing U.S. technology and creative patents and does so with impunity — and that China needs U.S. markets more than the U.S. needs Chinese markets. China's $375 billion surplus with the U.S. is Trump's leverage.But where it gets interesting is that there are other areas that tariffs and trade restrictions are intended to have an impact — namely, the growing geopolitical conflict between the U.S. and China.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseChina has grown increasingly belligerent and militarily aggressive in recent years, particularly in the South China Sea, but also toward Taiwan. Nor has China been as helpful as it should be in solving the North Korea nuclear standoff, apparently seeing mentally unstable North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un as useful political leverage against the U.S., South Korea and Japan.Put into this larger context, the imposition of tariffs on China by Trump can be seen as using the one great bit of leverage on China that the U.S. has — trade — to enhance the U.S.' strategic role in East Asia. Trump clearly wants to show that the U.S.' might isn't just its powerful military, but its powerful economy too.If his political move leads to a fairly quick resolution of our biggest trade and political differences with China, and the tariffs are subsequently reversed, we might all breathe a sigh of relief.But those are big ""ifs."" And the immediate reaction of the S&P 500 and other major stock market averages — they fell sharply — show that investors are very concerned. That makes us concerned, too.Trump had already levied tariffs on steel and aluminum, a move largely targeting China. Now he's going after Chinese high-tech goods (which are often goods made by American or other nations' companies, not China's).U.S. companies that depend on cheap Chinese inputs may soon find themselves forced to raise prices because of tariffs — or to swallow the higher cost of inputs, accept lower profits and maybe lay off workers and reduce investment. That is never a recipe for financial success.It's true that these moves will have some benefits for manufacturers and patent-holding companies, who have suffered most from China's trade policies.But overall, they're a bad deal.In a poll of 40 economists at some of the U.S.' top universities conducted by the Initiative on Global Markets, all 40 disagreed with the statement: ""Imposing new U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum will improve Americans' welfare."" We're pretty sure you could have inserted the names of virtually any goods for ""steel and aluminum"" and the results would have been the same.""As I've mentioned several times recently...the math of protectionism is pretty simple, and pretty ugly, in terms of its predictable negative effects on the economy,"" wrote Mark J. Perry, a University of Michigan economist and fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, in a blog post.Any time you can get 40 economists to reach such unanimity on something, it's at least worth considering why they feel so strongly.The point is, as we've noted repeatedly, tariffs are taxes, and more trade rules are regulations. Those slow the economy, they don't speed it up.For that reason, many pundits and economists, even those who are sympathetic to Trump, fear that the new tariffs by both sides will undo the clearly positive impact that Trump's tax cuts have had on the economy.""The freedom to trade is a key component of economic freedom, and evidence shows it is a powerful force for growth and prosperity,"" wrote David Kreutzer, on the Heritage Foundation's The Daily Signal news site.He's right. In the long run, no one really wins a trade war.At least, not economically. World markets shrink, revenues fall, profits decline, and opportunities shrivel. Businesses and consumers will both suffer from higher prices. That's what the stock market was telling us on Thursday, when the Dow Jones industrial average fell more than 700 points.It may be, as many argue, that Trump's move is the right one. A president is finally sticking up for American workers. Maybe so.But the fact that it was ""just"" $50 billion in tariffs misses the point. When the dynamic is tit-for-tat, it can quickly turn into a politically-fueled downward trade and economic spiral, reminiscent of the one that led to the 1930s Great Depression.We would hate to see Trump's boom undone by a trade war.

80,KIM,"Conservative watchdog organization Media Research Center examined the nightly news coverage of President Donald Trump on ABC, NBC and CBS in January and February and concluded that the stories were 91% negative. One consistent narrative, particularly given the recent firing of Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, is that ""chaos"" reigns in the Trump White House.Never mind that President Barack Obama went through four secretaries of defense and five chiefs of staff. Obama, goes the narrative, calmly navigated the country during his eight-year tenure. Trump, on the other hand, is reckless, dangerous, undisciplined and out of control.Never mind that the U.S. consumers' confidence is at a level not seen since the early 2000s. Forget the increased value in the stock market, and the appreciation in average home value since the beginning of the Trump presidency. ISIS fighters have been killed or surrendered in the thousands. North Korea's Kim Jong Un has agreed to resume talks about ""denuclearization."" The Middle East did not set itself on fire when Trump agreed to move the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. After nearly 14 months, even many Democrats admit they still, after a year of investigations, see no evidence of ""collusion"" between Russia and the Trump campaign.But things just look ... chaotic.President ""No-Drama Obama"" did indeed successfully push ObamaCare through Congress and signed it into law.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseWhen the House Democrats first revealed what eventually became ObamaCare, the Wall Street Journal called it ""the worst bill ever."" The Journal wrote: ""With spending and debt already at record peacetime levels, the bill creates a new and probably unrepealable middle-class entitlement that is designed to expand over time. Taxes will need to rise precipitously, even as ObamaCare so dramatically expands government control of health care that eventually all medicine will be rationed via politics.""The law did not, as Obama routinely promised, save every family $2,500 a year. ObamaCare did not, as the president insisted, ""bend the cost curve"" down. PolitiFact gave Obama their 2013 ""Lie of the Year"" award for telling the American people, ""If you like your health care plan, you can keep it,"" a guarantee that Obama made even when he knew it was not true.As commander in chief, the no-drama president signed the Iran deal that critics argue puts the world's No. 1 sponsor of terror on a path toward getting a nuclear bomb. Obama's first secretary of defense, Robert Gates, said Obama based the deal on a ""hope that over a 10-year period with the sanctions being lifted that ... they will abandon their ideology, their theology, their revolutionary principles, their meddling in various parts of the region."" Gates called this hope ""unrealistic.""Obama, over the objection of his entire national security team, pulled out all the troops from Iraq. Retired Army Gen. Ray Odierno, a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, later said he believed ISIS could have been dealt with had we left a stay-behind force.On the economy, Obama signed a $787 billion so-called stimulus package, averaged $100 billion in new regulations every single year of his presidency, and promoted the silly, wasteful ""cash for clunkers"" and the equally silly and wasteful ""cash for caulkers.""Obama defenders argue that the recession Obama dealt with was particularly severe. Yet historically, the deeper the recession, the higher the bounce back. Not so under Obama. The recession President Ronald Reagan dealt with was worse, at least by the metrics the Democrats and the media once used until those very metrics made Democrats look bad.Unemployment, for example, under Obama reached 10%. Under Reagan, it reached 10.8%. Inflation was 3.8% the year before Obama took office, but dropped to 1.3% his last year. Under Reagan, it was 13.5% the year before he took office, but dropped to 4.1% his last year. Prime interest rates under Obama, again, were 3.25% when he entered office, and remained low at 3.75% when he left. Under Reagan, prime interest rates climbed as high as 20.5% and dipped as low as 7.5%.It was a Democrat, Jimmy Carter, who, in running against President Gerald Ford in 1976, use the ""misery index."" It was simple. Just add up unemployment, plus inflation. The bigger the number, the worse the economy. Carter pointed out that under Ford, the misery index had gone up. Unfortunately for Carter, when he ran for re-election in 1980, Reagan pointed out that the misery index under Carter had grown even larger. Under Obama, at its worst point, the misery index reached 12.97 in 2011. During Reagan's administration, the misery index was at its worst point when he entered office, at 19.33.Obama, who supposedly governed without drama, delivered the worst recovery since 1949. On the economy and on foreign policy, he signed costly legislation and pushed counterproductive policies.

81,KIM,"South Korean officials declared that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea is prepared to negotiate with the U.S. over denuclearizing the peninsula and normalizing relations. President Trump declared his policy has worked and he has accepted an invitation to meet North Korea's Kim Jong Un.The first is good news, if true. But even if true, it is merely the first step to achieving a stable peace in Northeast Asia.The second is less clear. Any talks are likely to be conducted on North Korea's rather than America's terms. The North's professed willingness to denuclearize may not result in denuclearization.The South Koreans who met with Kim suggest that peace is in the air. The DPRK wants dialogue and is prepared to denuclearize.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseHowever, so far Kim Jong Un has not spoken. In fact, after Seoul's announcement the Communist Party newspaper justified Pyongyang's possession of nuclear weapons. That may just indicate that Pyongyang intends to strike a hard bargain. But we won't really know the North's position until North Korea's Supreme Leader responds.Moreover, there's nothing particularly new in Pyongyang's presumed offer to talk. In the past North Korea has engaged the U.S. in a dialogue over denuclearization. But that did not mean the North was willing to abandon its weapons.The reason there have been no recent official talks is because the Trump administration insisted that the North agree to the main issue beforehand: denuclearization. But indicating a theoretical willingness to disarm is not the same.For instance, the DPRK apparently says it wants sufficient security guarantees. In the past the North demanded that America end the alliance with the Republic of Korea and withdraw U.S. troops from the region.Asking for more than Washington would give would not be simple duplicity, though North Korea obviously is capable of such. However, even if a Trump-Kim summit occurs, what rational dictator on Washington's naughty list would trust the Trump administration and its successors?Every president from Ronald Reagan to Barack Obama ousted at least one regime not to America's liking. President Obama even targeted Libya's Muammar Khadafy after the latter negotiated away his nuclear weapons and missiles.President Trump repudiated the agreement reached between his predecessor and Iran and threatened to unleash ""fire and fury"" on the North. Kim is unlikely to accept expressions of goodwill and paper guarantees as sufficient.Finally, Pyongyang long desired talks with America and there even was talk of a summit between Bill Clinton and Kim Jong Il, shortly before the former left office. It appears that Pyongyang has simply repackaged a long-standing objective.An anonymous Trump administration official insisted that Washington's policy ""will not change until we see credible moves toward denuclearization."" He also dismissed entering into talks encumbered by ""nonstarter conditions"" by the DPRK as in the past.However, the North won't abandon its leverage without receiving something in return. And it can simply move its conditions one step back, from tied to agreeing to negotiate to agreeing to disarm.Despite such caveats, negotiations offer a way out of today's crisis, with the Trump administration threatening to start the Second Korean War. After having helped keep the peace for 65 years, it would be foolish beyond measure for the administration to risk triggering another massive conflict on the peninsula, especially one that could lead to a nuclear exchange.The DPRK long has been the land of second-best options. But in advance of a presumed Kim-Trump summit Washington should work with South Korea and Japan to develop a common denuclearization offer for the DPRK and then seek Chinese backing.Denuclearization should remain Washington's long-term objective, but if the North proves less receptive than South Korea suggests, the U.S. also should pursue other advantageous, if short-term, goals in the meantime, such as freezing North Korean missile and nuclear development. And policymakers should consider creative options if these efforts reach a dead end, as in the past.Kim's apparent offer to talk and meet with Trump is a gambit in a larger strategy for dealing with America. As such, it may prove to be more opportunity than breakthrough. Still, Trump should pursue the chance to sit down with Kim and search for a peaceful exit from the dangerous policy cul-de-sac into which the administration has driven.Click here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

82,KIM,"Shake-Up: The long-rumored departure of Secretary of State Rex Tillerson should come as no surprise. He and President Trump didn't see eye-to-eye on many issues. What's surprising is that Tillerson didn't quit, but was fired. The reason: Trump is moving fast on foreign policy, and didn't think Tillerson could keep up.X Tillerson was rumored to be headed out the door last summer, and then again in November. As the rumors had it, he was fed up with the White House chaos, and in particular had strong differences with Trump on how to proceed with both Iran and North Korea.Former Exxon CEO Tillerson was used to being in charge and working in a structured environment, and he apparently despised the chaos and turnover that came with the Trump administration. Things weren't helped when it was leaked that he called Trump a ""moron"" in a nonpublic conversation.But Tillerson never quit.Trump was said to be angered by Tillerson's refusal to do a complete housecleaning of the State Department, leaving many non-Trump-friendly State bureaucrats in powerful posts where they could thwart Trump's unconventional foreign diplomacy agenda.Tillerson may regret not doing that housecleaning. Within hours of his departure, unnamed State Department ""insiders"" were criticizing Tillerson in a piece posted on the Politico website: "" 'People see this as a chance for a clean sweep,' said one staffer, who like most others spoke on condition of anonymity to avoid losing his job. 'This team has proven itself incapable of managing the State Department.' ""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe handwriting was on the wall last week as Tillerson embarked on a diplomatic tour of Africa. Trump took that opportunity to announce, without telling Tillerson, that he would be open to face-to-face talks with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.Meanwhile, also without Tillerson, Trump on Tuesday hosted Israeli, Saudi, Qatari and UAE officials at the White House in a bid to move Mideast talks along. It's unclear if Tillerson even knew it was happening.Indeed, Tillerson reportedly found out that he was being let go after seeing Trump's tweet to that effect.All a very messy business, but pretty much in keeping with Trump's idiosyncratic and impulsive managerial style.But the truth is, a president can hire and fire his Cabinet. Those who work for Trump know his style, and shouldn't be too shocked when after a period of prolonged conflict they get their walking papers. It might not be Management 101, but it is Trump's prerogative to hire and fire.Even so, give Tillerson his due.As our nation's No. 1 diplomat, Tillerson improved relations with our main allies in the Mideast and in Asia significantly. If he didn't move quickly enough to revamp the State Department, it was because he had too much respect for those who had worked there for a long time — even those who were known to harbor anti-Trump feelings.Whether you agreed with his firing or not, he was a talented secretary of state and a stabilizing presence for the U.S. in international relations. Coming after the twin disasters of Obama's two top envoys, Hillary Clinton and John Kerry, Tillerson was a breath of fresh air.Tillerson will be replaced by CIA Director Mike Pompeo, a button-down graduate of West Point, engineer, Obama foe and former congressman who led the investigation into Hillary Clinton's Benghazi debacle and, as CIA chief under Trump, provided the president with intelligence on North Korea, Iran and other burgeoning threats.Pompeo will be more willing to follow Trump's line, unlike Tillerson. Those insiders who wanted to get rid of Tillerson may soon regret it. Meanwhile, Trump also named Gina Haspel, whom CBS News described as a ""seasoned spymaster,"" as the new CIA chief. Haspel is the first woman to hold the post.No doubt the media will once again have a field day with this personnel shake-up, as it has with others. It fits their narrative of the Trump White House being in disarray, with lots of comings and goings.Jacob Heilbrunn, editor of the National Interest, summed it up perfectly, calling the sure-footed Tillerson the ""worst secretary of state in history"" (a ludicrous statement, given the previous two occupants of that office under President Obama), while correctly noting that Pompeo will likely take a tougher line against Iran and North Korea. Let's hope so.Others will wring their hands in angst over the ""turnover"" in the White House. In fact, once again, these moves only underscore Trump's most valuable asset: his willingness to act to get what he wants. Trump as a CEO and entrepreneur was highly impatient. That's how he runs the White House, too. He's not a typical politician, something the media simply can't understand.Like it or not, that's why people support Trump. He doesn't stand on ceremony. He knows what he wants, and knows his time is limited. He's not going to be a career politician. That's why he's so impatient, and why he fires even able men like Rex Tillerson.With several domestic victories under his belt, it looks like Trump is turning his attention to foreign affairs. Illegal immigration, tariffs, Nafta, China, Iran, North Korea — all of these will be priorities this year. Trump has his team in place. We'll see what happens.YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:Trump Is The Anti-Obama When It Comes To Standing Up To Terrorist-Supporting IranPutting North Korea On U.S.' Terrorist List Was Long OverdueTrump's New 'Principled Realism': Economics = SecurityClick here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

84,KIM,"President Trump will indefinitely delay imposing steel and aluminum tariffs on Mexico and Canada, but other countries could face tariffs within 15 days.X Trump explained his policy Thursday afternoon before a signing ceremony, saying that other countries will be invited to negotiate exemptions from import tariffs of 25% on steel and 10% on aluminum.Trump said he was acting to stop ""an assault on our country"" in the form of cheap, imported industrial metal, calling it ""not merely an economic disaster, but a national security disaster.""He claimed that his policy is already paying dividends, with U.S. Steel (X) and Century Aluminum (CENX) both announcing increased capacity and hiring.Trump said that in the next 15 days his administration will decide which countries will face tariffs and to what extent, based on ""who's treating us fairly,"" not just in regard to trade but also military relationships.Wall Street seemed relieved about the clarification with regard to Mexico and Canada. America's Nafta partners account for 25% of U.S. steel imports but are also major export markets for U.S.-made steel.The Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite all strengthened to close modestly higher on the stock market today.

85,KIM,"See stocks near a buy point, get chart pattern recognition and run custom screens. Start NowWhile tariffs could raise U.S. manufacturing costs for companies like Ford (F), General Motors (GM) and Boeing (BA), the bigger concern is that they would spark a tit-for-tat retaliation. Boeing and GM shares turned higher on Thursday afternoon, while Ford was off 0.2%.Still, the sense of relief on Wall Street is far from complete. The European Union has threatened to retaliate if Trump moves forward with the tariffs, targeting companies like Harley-Davidson (HOG).Steel and aluminum tariffs aren't the only trade concern likely to occupy Wall Street in the months to come. The White House is also reportedly mulling wide-ranging tariffs on Chinese imports to punish Beijing for permitting rampant theft of U.S. intellectual property.The Trump administration is asking China to propose actions that would shrink the bilateral trade deficit by $100 billion.Trump has tried to provide reassurance that the impact of the steel and aluminum tariffs would be largely benign, saying it would be done in a ""loving"" way and inviting key trading partners to negotiate an alternative to his proposed trade prescription.On Thursday he went further, talking about the flexible approach he would take in setting or adjusting the 25% and 10% rates on a country-by-country basis. ""I'll have a right to go up or go down depending on the country, and I'll have a right to drop out countries or add countries.""Yet there's more than a little danger that Trump is miscalculating. The environment for negotiating may turn poisonous if he enacts tariffs that trading partners see as unjustified and a danger to a global trading system which has depended on respect for World Trade Organization rules.Trump's steel tariffs are seen as an affront by most U.S. trading partners because the bulk of steel industry overcapacity comes from China, yet China itself would barely be touched, at least directly, by the 25% tax since it accounts for just 2% of U.S. steel imports.Trump seems to be using the threat of steel tariffs as leverage to undo other perceived inequities with trading partners that contribute to the high U.S. trade deficit. Yet the whole effort undermines the justification for his tariffs — that the U.S. will impose them because a glut of steel and aluminum imports poses a danger to national security.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Trump Agrees To Meet Kim Jong Un; Stock Futures RiseThese Three Dow Jones Stocks Are Near Buy Points As 2 FANGs Make Bullish MoveThe Big Picture: This Is The Real News For InvestorsHere Are 10 Chip Stocks Breaking Out, Hitting New Highs Or Setting UpWhat Do Facebook, Grubhub, Salesforce And Epam Have In Common?

88,KIM,"Think your stock portfolio has had a bad 2018 so far? Your losses are minuscule compared to owners of digital currency, most famously known as Bitcoin.XThe past several weeks saw Bitcoin prices tumble almost 75% (from almost $20,000 to nearly $6,000) before starting a slow but steady recovery in the past few days.  The cryptocurrency enthusiasts I know need PTSD treatment. Why did this happen?Just a few months ago, Bitcoin and the other alternative digital currencies, saw their total market cap soaring toward $1 trillion.  This was up from $18 billion just a year before.  The Bitcoin world saw no end to the surge.  Even the sky was no longer the limit.Instead, prices sank fast, and continue to stay flat. What flipped the switch on the Bitcoin money-making machine?  There are a host of theories, but one that dominates lays the blame on government.  Not any particular government.  All governments.Get IBD's Market Prep And Tech Report Newsletters — For Free!Most politicians and bureaucrats didn't see the Bitcoin train coming.  From time immemorial, the state has controlled currency and its movement across international borders.  In recent times, governments everywhere have implemented strict financial security controls to prevent terrorists and criminals from using the banking system to advance their nefarious aims.Bitcoin changed all that.  The highlight of this new digital currency system was its anonymity.  Governments and financial institutions would no longer be able to control the movement of funds, nor know who was moving those funds.  As Bitcoin prices surged, the state struck back.Across the globe — from India to China to South Korea to the UK to Australia to the U.S. and many, many other nations — governments moved to ban digital currencies, or at least force them to comply with anti-money laundering and know-your-customer statutes that have been refined since well before 9/11.The unrelenting governmental assaults likely caused frightened coin holders to head for the hills, and sell their digital currency.  The market cap plummeted almost 70%.  All because the structure of Bitcoin and other digital currencies is now seen as a security threat on every continent.The security flaw in Bitcoin also leaves digital currencies susceptible to theft.  Hackers who break into digital currency exchanges or the 'wallets' of coin holders can quickly transport crypto to another anonymous wallet, and never be seen again.Is this the end of Bitcoin?  Will the security flaws and the ability for terrorists, child sex traffickers and drug cartels to use it with equanimity doom what could be the most important tech innovation since the creation of the internet?  Not if Marcus Andrade has his way.We hear a lot about Bitcoin profit, but very little about the real Bitcoin prophet, who resides in the State of Texas.  Andrade was an early software entrepreneur in the first phase of the Bitcoin movement.But, several years ago, before anyone was focused on the potential security flaws that could be the undoing of the digital coin movement, Andrade and his team of technicians were busy developing a different kind of digital currency: one that was compliant with anti-money laundering and know-your-customer laws that lay at the heart of the financial security matrix protecting the world financial systems.His innovation is Bitcoin 2.0. With sophisticated biometric digital identity systems built into its core, Andrade's AML Bitcoin (www.amlbitcoin.com) has arrived in time to commence the next phase of Bitcoin — where digital currency is not the enemy of government, but rather a useful tool employed in government payment systems.But it is not government alone that has been awaiting the arrival of this new form of digital currency.  Industry has been itching to enter the digital currency arena, but was held back by the lack of compliance with financial security laws.  No longer.Andrade's teams have been meeting quietly with governments on every continent to share AML Bitcoin's solutions to their concerns with digital currency.  The enthusiasm is great.Among those entirely unenthusiastic about AML Bitcoin are the very terrorists and rogue regimes that have been busy stealing bitcoin for the past several years — chief among them North Korea.  In fact, in an act some feel is immensely brave — or incredibly crazy — AML Bitcoin has gone right at Kim Jong-Un with a hilarious Super Bowl ad lampooning his frustration at the inability to steal this one form of digital currency.As the world cautiously watches how the digital currency market will shake out, there is at least one option to transition to the future, AML Bitcoin.You Might Also Like...Still Bullish On Bitcoin?

92,KIM,"Every two years, Americans unite around the television to root for U.S. athletes, to see their dreams of gold medals come true — unless you're a journalist, in which case the Olympics are a time to root against your country on the world stage.XAt the opening ceremonies in Pyeongchang, South Korea, organizers strangely seated Vice President Mike Pence just a few feet from Kim Yo Jong, the sister of North Korea's communist dictator, Kim Jong Un. To American reporters who hate President Trump, a star was born. The summaries of Jong on Twitter alone were enough to make you throw your phone across the room.Start with the wire services. The Associated Press gushed, ""The trip by Kim Yo Jong is the latest move in an extraordinary show of Olympic diplomacy with Seoul that could prove to be a major challenge to the Trump administration's hard-line Korea policies."" Reuters echoed, ""North Korea has emerged as the early favorite to grab one of the Winter Olympics' most important medals: the diplomatic gold.""The newspapers also claimed that Pence lost to the woman who serves as the North Korean deputy director of propaganda. A New York Times headline read, ""Kim Jong Un's Sister Turns on the Charm, Taking Pence's Spotlight."" It turned to history professor Alexis Dudden, who specializes in Asian countries, for the slam dunk. She said, ""The fact that he and Mrs. Pence didn't stand when the unified (Korean) team came in was a new low in a bullying type of American diplomacy.""No Hidden Agenda: Get News From A Pro-Free Market, Pro-Growth PerspectiveThe Washington Post front page on Sunday declared that it had found the ""Ivanka Trump of North Korea."" Jung ""has enraptured people in looks-obsessed South Korea with her sphinxlike smile and low-key beauty,"" the story read. And her attendance at the Olympics was ""a signal that North Korea is not this crazy, weird former Cold War state — but it too has young women that are capable and are the future leadership.""This kind of truth-shredding article makes a mockery of all the Post's indignant ""Democracy Dies in Darkness"" bravado. One might totally forget that last May, when Trump called the North Korean dictator a ""pretty smart cookie,"" the Post ran a story headlined ""Praise for Strongmen Alarms Rights Advocates"" with the subheading ""Trump's vocal affection for totalitarians marks major U.S. policy shift.""The biggest target for outrage on Twitter was CNN, which announced, ""Kim Jong Un's sister is stealing the show at the Winter Olympics,"" and included a link to an article. It began, ""If 'diplomatic dance' were an event at the Winter Olympics, Kim Jong Un's younger sister would be favored to win gold.""That was in addition to a piece CNN ran with the headline ""North Korea Is Winning the Olympics — and It's Not Because of Sports."" It insisted, without the slightest hint of irony or introspection, that ""the North has gotten the kind of publicity money can't buy.""CNN also brought its academic expert. ""The North is masterful at getting something for nothing,"" David Maxwell of Georgetown University proclaimed. ""They're going to get recognition, legitimacy, resources, without giving anything up.""This is a complete flip-flop from last May. When Trump called the North Korean tyrant a ""pretty smart cookie,"" CNN anchor Jake Tapper brought the brutal facts, saying: ""Kim Jong Un had his uncle murdered. That does not make Kim Jong Un a smart cookie. That makes him a murderer.""If our media elite truly revered democracy and loathed totalitarianism, none of this sugar-coated nonsense on North Korean ""mastery"" would have been uttered or published.

93,KIM,"You've heard the phrase over and over again: ""This isn't normal."" We've heard it about President Trump's rhetoric, and his Twitter usage. We've heard it about his attacks on the media, and we've heard it about his legislative ignorance. We've heard it about his running commentary on the Mueller investigation, and we've heard it about his bizarre stream-of-consciousness interviews.XThere's some truth to all of this. Trump has said some incredibly awful things (e.g. his comments on Charlottesville, Virginia, and Haitians). He's not a predictable, stable genius.All of this ""non-normality,"" however, has resulted in ... a relatively normal situation. The economy's booming. We're on more solid foreign-policy ground than we were when President Obama was in office -- by a long shot. The constitution hasn't been torn asunder. The structures of government are still in place. Trump may be toxic rhetorically, but his presidency hasn't annihilated the norms that govern our society.The same can't be said, however, of the media institutions that seem so consumed with saving the republic from the specter of Trump. Like self-appointed superheroes so intent on stopping an alien monster that they end up destroying the entire city, our media are so focused on stopping Trump that they end up undermining both their credibility and faith in American institutions.Take, for example, the media's coverage of North Korea at the Winter Olympics. Suddenly, the worst regime on the planet has been transformed into a cute exhibit from ""It's a Small World."" Those women in red forced to smile and cheer on cue? Just an example of the brilliance of revolutionary North Korean ""juche"" ideology. Kim Jong Un's sister, a member of the inner cabinet of a regime that imprisons thousands of dissenters and shoots those who don't properly worship the Dear Respected? She's an example of Marxist humility and stellar diplomacy.No Hidden Agenda: Get News From A Pro-Free Market, Pro-Growth PerspectiveIt's not just the media. This week, we learned that former FBI Director James Comey, former Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates, former national security adviser Susan Rice, former Vice President Joe Biden and former President Obama held a last-minute meeting at the White House to discuss the possibility of Trump-Russia collusion. At that meeting, Rice wrote in an email, Obama reportedly asked whether there was any reason ""we cannot share information fully as it relates to Russia."" That means that Obama asked his top staff, including the FBI, whether he could hide intelligence information from the incoming Trump team.That amounts to a massive breach in the constitutional structure. The FBI is not an independent agency. It is part of the executive branch. The incoming Trump administration was duly elected by the American people and had every right to see all intelligence information coming from the FBI and the CIA. Yet it was the supposedly normal Obama White House exploring means of preventing that transparency.Trump isn't a normal president. But the threat to our institutions doesn't reside only at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. -- or even primarily there. It resides with those who are willing to side with any enemy and violate every rule in order to stop the supposed threat of Trump.RELATED:Reforming The Bureaucracy: How Trump Is Taming The LeviathanClick here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

155,KIM,"Bitcoin prices are plummeting. Governments everywhere are banning digital currencies and their exchanges. Hackers and rogue nations such as North Korea are plundering cryptocurrency accounts, stealing billions of dollars for their nefarious aims. Banks, credit card companies and even Facebook are terminating Bitcoin transactions.X The cryptocurrency world is in turmoil and it is hard to comprehend just how much this world has changed in less than two months. Just before Christmas last year, the price of Bitcoin was soaring toward $20,000. Today, its value has been more than halved. Since New Year's Day, the total market capitalization of digital currencies has fallen almost $500 billion. Compared to the fall of Bitcoin, the Dow Industrials are having a pretty good week.To be clear, I own Bitcoin, Ethereum and Litecoin, because I believe that these currencies are the future of transactions that cut out banks and credit card companies from everyday transactions. They are great technologies and no government should use the pretext that they are securities or commodities for the purposes of regulating these instruments of commerce out of existence.No Hidden Agenda: Get News From A Pro-Free Market, Pro-Growth PerspectiveThat being said, there need to be other competing instruments and business models that prevent the truly bad guys, and bad governments, from using them for nefarious purposes.Against this tumultuous backdrop, the U.S. Senate Banking Committee held a hearing titled ""Virtual Currencies: The Oversight Role of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission"" on February 6 to explore how our government can regulate digital currency.Congress is grappling with the same conundrum every nation faces in reacting to the arrival of digital currencies.On the one hand, digital currencies are widely believed to be the next wave of innovation that will power the world to greater technological heights.The flip side of this coin is the potential of digital currencies to facilitate the invasion of criminal and terrorist cash into the world's financial systems. It is likely that governments will overreact and attempt to regulate all digital currencies in a way that will slow growth and stifle innovation.Many countries, including India, South Korea and China, have openly contemplated banning digital currencies. Elsewhere, key financial leaders — such as Secretary of the Treasury Steven Mnuchin — have called for regulation to impede the arrival of a digital currency world. These governmental assaults are driving down the price of digital currencies.But banning cryptocurrency would not only harm millions of coin holders — it would be a tragic and foolish response to the challenges presented by the emergence of digital currency, especially since a real solution to the problem of non-compliance with financial safeguards has recently arrived on the scene.The problem vexing leaders stems from bad actors using the anonymous nature of cryptocurrency to conduct human trafficking and other terrible transactions. Bitcoin and virtually all alt-coins cannot identify their buyers and sellers, nor monitor criminal activity, and this panics regulators.The solution is a vital upgrade to the cryptocurrency world, bridging the exciting Bitcoin of the past and the digital currencies of the future and facilitating voluntary digital currency compliance with international financial laws. One case study in the next generation of digital currency is being rolled out by a new company, AML BitCoin.A look at the company's business model is a view into the future of digital currencies. The core structure of the AML BitCoin features compliance with anti-money laundering (AML), know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-terrorist financing laws, as well as conformity with international financial and banking security laws.This is a self-policing, self-regulatory business model that reduces government worries about digital currencies being used for illegal purposes. The business model also preserves anonymity, yet uses technology to remove the need for government intervention.Moreover, because of its biometric, digital identity blockchain-based wallet structure, AML BitCoin cannot be stolen by ransomware thieves, terrorists or rogue regimes. In a world where Bitcoin is stolen almost as often as it is sold, this feature is vital, and is even the subject of AML BitCoin's hilarious recent viral ad spoof of North Korea's Kim.As we find increasingly in every industry, entrenched interests with a policy agenda and turf to protect are trying to prevent the upgrade. These ""Bitcoin Elite"" have empowered a small Washington lobbying organization to fight against competition.They don't want the Bitcoin business model to evolve and experience competition, even at the risk that digital currencies will never become useful in commerce.It is more important for these elites to protect the Bitcoin business model that has been used to transact drugs and human trafficking, and by rogue regimes to avoid sanctions. No soccer mom will use digital currency to pay for the snacks or pizza after a game with a digital currency notorious for use by really bad actors.The Bitcoin elite, represented by Washington lobbyists such as Coin Center, should embrace the compliance upgrade offered by AML BitCoin, and work to avoid regulations by nations' leaders and ensure that digital currencies can soon fulfill their potential of becoming ubiquitous in our economy and governmental interactions.RELATED:Bitcoin And Cryptocurrency News And TrendsThe End Of Money As We Know It?Just How Many More 'Blockchain Pretenders' Could 2018 Bring?Click here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

167,KIM,"Boeing (BA) has received a $6.56 billion contract to continue managing the U.S. missile defense system intended to stop North Korean or Iranian intercontinental ballistic missiles, the Defense Department said.X The sole-source contract announced Wednesday extends Boeing's management role for six more years, through 2023, and brings its total contract to $12.6 billion. It includes overseeing the addition of 20 ground-based interceptors to the 44 already stationed in California and Alaska.North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has vowed to perfect a nuclear warhead and a missile that could hit the U.S. mainland, adding to the urgency of U.S. missile defense efforts. In his State of the Union address on Tuesday, President Donald Trump said, ""North Korea's reckless pursuit of nuclear missiles could very soon threaten our homeland. We are waging a campaign of maximum pressure to prevent that from ever happening.""Boeing oversees development and support of the network of interceptors, sensors and communications links, sharing funding with subcontractors: Orbital ATK (OA) builds the rocket booster, Raytheon (RTN) makes the hit-to-kill warhead, Northrop Grumman (NOC) provides the battle management system and Aerojet Rocketdyne (AJRD) makes the warhead's in-flight guidance system.The Pentagon released an initial $213.8 million Wednesday as a modification to Boeing's current $6.14 billion management, development and sustainment contract, which expires this year.As the Missile Defense Agency's prime contractor, Boeing will manage the accelerated construction of a new 20-missile field at Fort Greely, Alaska, plus the additional interceptors. Boeing also will oversee development and integration of an upgraded warhead known as the ""Redesigned Kill Vehicle.""Confidence in the $36 billion missile defense system was bolstered last week by a new assessment from the Pentagon's operational testing director based on the successful interception in May of a dummy warhead. The system ""demonstrated the capability to defend the U.S. homeland from a small number"" of ICBMs launched ""with simple countermeasures when the"" U.S. employs ""its full sensors/command and control architecture,"" Robert Behler said in a report to top Pentagon officials.Laura Grego, senior scientist for the Global Security Program of the Union of Concerned Scientists, questioned even that carefully hedged formulation. The system has destroyed ""its target fewer than half the 17 times it has been tested, and its record is not improving over time. Since the 2004 deployment decision, the system has a three-for-nine record,"" including the test in May, she said in an email.On Tuesday, General Paul Selva, vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told reporters that North Korea's capabilities aren't yet as advanced as Kim purports.North Korea has yet to demonstrate essential capabilities for an ICBM that could hit the U.S. mainland, including maneuvering in space, an adequate guidance system and housing that could protect a nuclear warhead from burning up on re-entry.The capability gap provides ""an opening to have"" a conversation with North Korea about a possible missile test freeze, Selva said.While North Korea's nuclear weapons program is the most advanced threat, Trump has vowed to seek new sanctions on Iran for its continued development of ballistic missiles. Iran maintains it has no intention to develop nuclear weapons, and its nuclear program is constrained by its 2015 deal with the U.S. and other world powers.

Apple will pay $38 billion in taxes, pay employee bonuses and step up its manufacturing investment fund as it repatriates massive overseas cash holdings. General Motors (GM) was upbeat about the future while Ford Motor (F) was not. UnitedHealth Group (UNH) kicked off health insurance earnings, and led many insurers' stocks to record highs. Cancer drug trial data and M&A buzz moved drug stocks. But General Electric (GE) crashed to a fresh six-year lows amid a huge new charge and speculation that the conglomerate may break up.X The Dow and Nasdaq rose 1% for the week while the S&P 500 climbed 0.9%, with the Nasdaq and S&P 500 hitting record highs on Friday. Chip-gear makers led the way, fueled by ASML (ASML) and others. Health insurers also were big winners as UnitedHealth (UNH) triggered a group rally. Energy stocks pulled back while lithium plays also sold off.Apple (AAPL) is expected to bring home $245 billion in foreign profits banked overseas to help pay for domestic projects, thanks to recently enacted U.S. corporate tax reforms. Apple pledged to contribute more than $350 billion to the U.S. economy over the next five years. That includes creating 20,000 new jobs, funding a new campus and more data centers, and forging deals with U.S. component manufacturers. Analysts say Apple likely will use some of the foreign cash for tuck-in acquisitions and to increase stock buybacks and dividends.The semiconductor equipment group led all industries for the week. ASML Holding (ASML), Ichor Holdings (ICHR) and Electro Scientific Industries (ESIO) rallied on upbeat financial reports. ASML reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter results and Ichor and Electro Scientific each announced preliminary December-quarter sales that topped views. Chip foundry Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) added to the party by delivering better-than-expected fourth-quarter results and guiding to strong sales growth in 2018.General Electric (GE) CEO John Flannery said he's mulling a breakup into separate businesses, after the industrial giant announced it will take a $6.2 billion charge in the fourth quarter on its legacy insurance business — double earlier guidance. The charge relates to an old long-term-care portfolio. GE's finance arm will pay $15 billion through 2024 to shore up reserves, raising worries that GE's industrial businesses may have to prop up GE Capital with cash at some point. Flannery will update investors on the portfolio review in the spring. Activist hedge fund Trian Fund Management reportedly is pushing for a GE breakup.

The largest U.S. carmaker expects profits to rise in 2019 and beyond, as it shifts its lineup toward more profitable, next-gen SUVs and trucks. Analysts had expected about $6.24 for 2017 and EPS declines in 2018 and 2019. Ford (F) went the other way, forecasting 2017 earnings of $1.78 per share, below estimates. It expects EPS to dip in 2018, to $1.45-$1.70. Ford said Monday it will invest $11 billion in electric vehicles over the next four years, more than doubling an earlier target.

Shares of Schwab rose a fraction for the week while Interactive fell 1%.UnitedHealth Group (UNH) helped spark the Dow's run to 26,000, breaking out 6.4% to a record high after easily clearing Q4 earnings estimates and detailing the impact of tax reform. UnitedHealth earnings jumped 23% to $2.59 a share on 9.5% revenue growth. While the nation's largest insurer said it plans to use its tax windfall to boost investment, UnitedHealth expects 75% of the benefits of tax cuts to go to the bottom line. It's projecting 2018 EPS of $12.30 to $12.60, a range of 22% to 25% profit growth. Other health insurers rallied to new highs on UnitedHealth's strong report.Airbus (EADSY) had 1,109 orders last year, up 52% from 2016, beating Boeing (BA) for the sixth straight year. The European aerospace giant also will keep making the superjumbo A380 after Emirates airline made a $16 billion order at list prices. CEO Tom Enders was critical of Brexit and President Trump's ""America First"" policies but said Brexit would be more devastating to the Airbus' business. Boeing announced a joint venture with auto car seat maker Adient (ADNT) to build seats for its jets to ease congestion from Zodiac Aerospace that has delayed plane deliveries.Bitcoin fell well below $10,000 on Wednesday before rebounding to about $11,700 as of Friday morning. South Korean Finance Minister Kim Dong-yeon spooked cryptocurrency markets saying that banning trading in digital currencies was ""a live option.""

Bank of America had mixed results, while Morgan Stanley (MS) and Citigroup (C) results beat. As Bitcoin's value continued to shrink this week, Goldman CFO Martin Chavez said it was responding to clients' interest in the cryptocurrency, but exercising ""extreme prudence and caution."" He did not say anything about whether the bank, which has already said it would clear Bitcoin futures, would develop a crypto-trading platform of its own. BofA CEO Brian Moynihan said ""customers should be careful"" with cryptocurrencies.Juno Therapeutics (JUNO) stock rocketed 52% on Wednesday on a report that longtime partner Celgene (CELG) is in talks to acquire it. Celgene and Juno are partnered to develop CAR-T drugs, rivaling the likes of Gilead Sciences (GILD), which recently bought Kite Pharma, and Novartis (NVS). Celgene blockbuster faces its multiple myeloma drug Revlimid going off patent. Bluebird Bio (BLUE), another CAR-T developer that partners with Celgene, rose 7.3% on Wednesday.Dow stock Merck surged Tuesday after it released the results of a trial for immuno-oncology drug Keytruda and chemotherapy in advanced lung cancer well ahead of expectations. In October, Merck had delayed the release until 2019. In the Phase 3 trial, Merck's regimen significantly improved overall survival and progression-free survival as a first treatment vs. chemotherapy alone. Roche (RHHBY), Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) and AstraZeneca (AZN), which have rival drugs, retreated Tuesday.Atlassian (TEAM) topped fiscal Q2 earnings and revenue estimates. But the collaboration software maker forecast current-quarter profit of 8 cents a share on revenue of $218 million vs. consensus estimates of 11 cents and $215 million. Analysts said the light guidance was due to annual salary increases and higher payroll taxes. Jefferies hiked its price target to 64 from 53 on expectations for better future cash flow growth. Shares, which had jumped into the buy zone earlier in the week, tumbled 4.55%, just below the entry point.Initial jobless claims fell to a 45-year low as labor markets continue to tighten.

But analysts had expected $1.23 a share on revenue of  $3.29 billion. Alcoa (AA) said it sees 4.25%-5.25% in global aluminum demand growth for 2018. Shares dove 6.45%.Wynn Resorts (WYNN), Las Vegas Sands (LVS), MGM Resorts (MGM) and Melco Resorts & Entertainment (MLCO), have been climbing after Bernstein analysts predicted 22%-24% year-over-year gross gambling revenue gains in Macau for January. That would be the best growth since July. Macau's gaming revenue took an unexpected hit in December, thanks to VIPs on a win streak, but revenue still rose 19.1% in 2017, breaking a three-year period of annual declines amid a government crackdown on corruption.Rail operator CSX topped on earnings but missed on sales. The report was the first since the December death of its CEO Hunter Harrison, a veteran railroad executive known for reining in costs and turning around some of CSX's rivals. CSX said performance continued to strengthen in Q4, ""building upon the scheduled railroading model"" launched under Harrison. Kansas City Southern (KSU) missed EPS views. Canadian Pacific Railway (CP) topped on profit and revenue. CSX and Kansas City Southern shares fell, Canadian Pacific rose.Sociedad Química y Minera de Chile (SQM) reached a deal with Chile that will let it expand lithium production.

(FMC) 8.2% and Global X Lithium and Battery Tech ETF (LIT) 6.2%.American Express (AXP) will suspend its buyback program in the first half of this year, after a one-off write-down on some assets and a repatriation tax from the GOP's new tax bill dented fourth-quarter profits and capital. AmEx topped Q4 profit and revenue estimates. AmEx fell 1.8% Friday but closed above its 50-day line.IBM (IBM) revenue rose 4% vs. year earlier to $22.5 billion, snapping a 24-quarter streak of flat or declining revenue, as IBM undergoes a major overhaul.

171,KIM,"South Korea backed off Thursday's news reports that the country is looking to ban cryptocurrency trading, helping Bitcoin prices to bounce back around $14,000 early Friday.X The finance minister in South Korea, the world's largest market for virtual currencies, said officials from ""all government ministries"" need to coordinate for a solution to cryptocurrency overheating, CNBC said.Kim Dong-yeon's remarks to reporters came a day after his justice counterpart spoke of a proposed bill to ban cryptocurrency exchanges, and a few days after South Korean regulators said they will probe six banks to crack down on speculation and money laundering. Bitcoin price dived as much as 21% in South Korea Thursday in the aftermath of the justice  minister's comments, and lost 10% in U.S. trade, while Bitcoin futures lost more than 7%.In Friday afternoon trade, Bitcoin was up 3.9% at $13,788, according to CoinDesk.

172,KIM,"Oil closed above $63 a barrel for the first time in over three years as crude stockpiles stowed in American tanks and terminals dwindled for an eighth straight week.Futures rose 1% in New York after the U.S. government said refiners and exporters withdrew almost 5 million barrels from storage last week. While the draw was smaller than the 11.2 million barrels reported in an industry tally on Tuesday, it still was the largest for this time of year since 2014. The last time winter stockpiles shrank at this pace was a decade ago.Even though investors were expecting a massive draw, ""it was still a very sizable one,"" said Rob Thummel, managing director at Tortoise Capital Advisors LLC, which handles $16 billion in energy-related assets. We're seeing ""falling inventories and rising geopolitical risk and that signals higher oil prices.""Prices have surged amid renewed optimism that cutbacks by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its partners are helping to drain a global glut. Tempering the rally is the concern that shale producers will boost U.S. output, which the EIA expects to top 11 million barrels a day in November 2019.OPEC would try to talk down a Brent rally above $70 to cushion the impact on the global economy and rival supplies, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said. Citigroup Inc., on the other hand, predicted that war, Middle East tensions, Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un could drive crude toward $80.West Texas Intermediate for February delivery advanced 61 cents to settle at $63.57 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Total volume traded was about 23% above the 100-day average.Brent for March settlement climbed 38 cents to end the session at $69.20 on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange, the highest level since December 2014. The global benchmark crude was at a premium of $5.78 to March WTI.U.S. crude inventories fell to 419.5 million barrels last week, the Energy Information Administration said on Wednesday. Stockpiles in Cushing, Oklahoma, the nation's biggest oil-storage hub, fell for a third week to the lowest in almost three years, while crude production ticked lower. As for fuels, the report showed a rise in gasoline and diesel supplies.""The inventory report still shows that crude stocks are plummeting like a stone,"" Adam Wise, who oversees an $8 billion energy portfolio at John Hancock Financial Services Inc. in Boston, said by telephone. Other factors driving crude's rally to three-year highs include a stronger global economy and OPEC's adherence to output cuts, he said.

173,KIM,"For good or evil, we may see radical changes in North Korea in 2018.The beefed-up United Nations sanctions by midyear could lead to widespread North Korean hunger, as well as the virtual end of the country's industry and transportation.XIn the past, the West had called off such existential sanctions and rushed in cash and humanitarian aid on news of growing starvation. Would it now if the bleak alternative was a lunatic's nuclear missile possibly striking San Diego or Seattle?To survive an unending trade embargo — and perhaps to avoid a coup — Kim Jong Un would likely either have to recalibrate his nuclear program or consider using it.China has always been unwilling to give up pit bull North Korea as its client. The Kim dynasty has proved especially useful over the past 30 years for aggravating and distracting the Chinese communist government's archenemy, Japan, and its chief rival, the United States.Yet China is now worried that the Donald Trump administration is as unfathomable as the prior Obama administration's strategic patience doctrine was predictable.No Hidden Agenda: Get News From A Pro-Free Market, Pro-Growth PerspectiveBeijing's sponsorship of the rogue nuclear regime in North Korea could increasingly become bad business, given global anxieties over the many possible trajectories of North Korea nuclear missiles.What are some likely scenarios for 2018?1) The status quo. China may loudly proclaim that it is following U.N. commercial sanctions while it secretly offers just enough sanction-busting aid to keep Kim Jong Un afloat. It might use its leverage to force Kim to cool his nuclear rhetoric — even as it stealthily supplies embargoed fuel and food.China would then hope that an amnesiac world would move on and accept a gentler-sounding (but still nuclear and thus useful) North Korea.The status quo — North Korean missiles pointed at America's West Coast — is clearly untenable. Yet never underestimate China's faith in the therapeutic forces of Western appeasement to accept the unacceptable.2) A Chinese solution. China would cut some sort of deal to remove North Korean missiles — or even the Kim regime itself through a coup or uprising — in exchange for controlling the future of North Korea. That would likely mean not allowing a democratic, free, Westernized and unified Korean peninsula on its borders.Other than disassociating itself from the future status of North Korea, the U.S. should ensure that it does not give any concessions to China to remove the nukes. Such an indulgence would only reward North Korea nuclear roguery and ensure that the cycle of the last three decades would be endlessly repeated.3) Forced removal. Barring acceptance of the status quo or a Chinese solution, the U.S. would be forced to accept widespread malnutrition of the North Korean populace and a constant ratcheting up of pressures to eliminate Pyongyang's nuclear weapons.Such leverage might include radical bilateral trade sanctions against China. The Japanese, Taiwanese and South Korean militaries could threaten to go nuclear.The U.S. should sponsor a Manhattan Project-style regional comprehensive missile defense system. It could also ban Chinese Communist Party officials and their families from U.S. soil.Such pressures might force something quite unpredictable to happen.A doomed North Korea could launch a missile, invade South Korea, be forced to disarm, or disintegrate amid coups or popular uprisings. A humiliated China would likely either be pressed to quietly abandon North Korea or find financial, economic and military ways to harm the U.S.4) Preemption. Barring the ""peaceful"" options of defanging nuclear North Korea, the U.S. and its Japanese and South Korean allies would have to disable the missiles through military force.Such a nightmarish action would not be limited to ""surgical strikes."" Instead, it would have to include massive attacks on North Korean missile sites, command and control centers, artillery and missile platforms, military bases and WMD repositories.Such preemption would quickly escalate to a general-theater war — or worse.Last-gasp North Korean nukes might escape preemptive bombing and be launched at Japan, South Korea, America's Pacific bases and the U.S. West Coast.A tottering North Korea could order a full-fledged artillery pounding of Seoul, chemical and cyber attacks, and a conventional ground invasion of South Korea.The U.S. and its allies would win such a war. But the cost could be catastrophic and prompt global recession.No one knows what China would do in such an exigency. Would it merely cry crocodile tears while its troublesome patron disappeared? Or to save its last communist client, would China send troops into the peninsula as it did in the fall of 1950?One thing is always certain. The naive architects of appeasement who watch as monsters grow always win short-term praise for avoiding immediate war. Their realist successors, who are forced to cage or destroy such full-grown beasts, are usually labeled as war mongers.Click here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

174,KIM,"Novo Nordisk (NVO) is shedding its restraint and embracing acquisitions after all.The Danish drugmaker, which has traditionally eschewed deals and looked inward to develop new treatments, signaled a desire to seek growth from outside its own labs as it disclosed a $3.1 billion takeover offer for Ablynx (ABLX).Novo CEO Lars Fruergaard Jorgensen, who walked in his predecessor's footsteps in his first year at the helm, is now attempting to clinch Novo's biggest deal ever — despite Ablynx spurning two offers in less than a month. The strategy extends beyond Ablynx: Novo said it's reviewing other potential takeovers and, after years of relying mostly on in-house research, is keen to look elsewhere for new medicines.""It marks a higher risk willingness and a willingness to obtain innovation from outside Novo Nordisk compared to what we historically have done,"" Chief Financial Officer Jesper Brandgaard said in an interview with Bloomberg.Novo has sat out a recent wave of industry deals in which a handful of giants snapped up promising biotechnology companies. The company has spent less than $500 million on mergers and acquisitions over the past decade, according to data disclosed by Novo.Swiss rival Roche Holding (RHHBY), by contrast, committed three times as much just last month when it agreed to buy U.S. biotech firm Ignyta (RXDX). Other pharmaceutical transactions last year include Johnson & Johnson's (JNJ) $30 billion purchase of Swiss biotech Actelion Ltd. and Gilead Sciences' (GILD) $11.9 billion takeover of Kite Pharma.The 51-year-old Jorgensen may find he's not the only one interested in Ablynx. Novo isn't aware of other suitors, Brandgaard told reporters on a conference call, but some may emerge now that Novo's interest is out in the open. Ablynx shares surged more than 49% to close at 38.62. Novo shares ticked down 5 cents to 54.69.Belgium-based Ablynx said late Monday that Chairman Peter Fellner has resigned from the board. Fellner, 74, had served as chairman since 2013 and had been slated to step down later this year. Ablynx gave no reason for the departure.Fellner has had numerous corporate board appointments, and was a member of the advisory group to Novo A/S, an investing arm of the Novo Nordisk Foundation, until January 2016. He'll be replaced as chairman by Bo Jesper Hansen, a non-executive director, the company said in a statement.Jorgensen is working to beef up a unit that has traditionally had a low profile. The business of selling treatments for rare blood disorders makes up only a fifth of its sales and is overshadowed by the company's diabetes operations.Unless the unit gets split off it needs to grow, said Kim Nielsen, a fund manager at C Worldwide Asset Management in Copenhagen.""Otherwise you risk it being too small or too uninteresting,"" said Nielsen, who holds Novo shares. ""Overall I feel confident they should do something like that.""Novo went public after Ablynx rejected a proposal that includes an upfront cash offer of 28 euros a share and additional cash payments known as contingent value rights of up to 2.50 euros per share tied to the success of two experimental medicines. The maximum payment is 44% more than the stock's closing price on Friday in Brussels.The choice of target isn't a shot in the dark: The two companies have been involved in a research collaboration since 2015.Ablynx's most advanced drug, caplacizumab, addresses a rare disorder called acquired thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, in which blood clots form in small blood vessels throughout the body. The illness can block the flow of blood to the body's organs, according to the U.S. National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute.Jorgensen, who grew up on a family farm in Denmark and joined Novo in 1991 as an economist, replaced its retiring leader at the start of last year. He joined just as Novo's traditional diabetes business came under pressure from insurers and payers, who demanded lower prices in the U.S., Novo's largest market.Ablynx ""holds great potential and has highly competent employees,"" Brandgaard said. ""This is a natural first asset for us to pursue.""

175,KIM,"WMD: Until quite recently, the nuclear threat posed by North Korea was mostly hypothetical. But in recent days, after yet another successful missile test, it's become clear that the threat is all too real and immediate. The time for more talk is running short.Anyone who wasn't concerned about North Korea's growing missile prowess before should be now. North Korea told the world Wednesday that it fired a new Hwasong-15 intercontinental ballistic missile over Hokkaido, the northernmost island of Japan. Ominously, it came just two weeks after North Korea reportedly exploded a hydrogen bomb underground.No Hidden Agenda: Get News From A Pro-Free Market, Pro-Growth PerspectiveJust six months ago, the world was worried about North Korea's missiles being able to eventually hit Guam or Alaska. This latest test went just 620 miles, but did so after reaching a height of nearly 2,800 miles and staying in the air for 54 minutes.David Wright, a physicist and co-director at the Union of Concerned Scientists web site, put this into perspective in a blog post: ""If these numbers are correct, then if flown on a standard trajectory rather than this lofted trajectory, this missile would have a range of more than 13,000 kilometers (km) (8,100 miles). This is significantly longer than North Korea's previous long range tests, which flew on lofted trajectories for 37 minutes (July 4) and 47 minutes (July 28). Such a missile would have more than enough range to reach Washington, D.C., and in fact any part of the continental United States."" (Emphasis ours).Let's sum up quickly: This missile can fly 8,100 miles. Washington, D.C. is 6,850 miles from Pyongyang.  See the threat now?And no, those aren't just scare-words from an anti-nuclear scientist-activist.XDefense Secretary Jim Mattis had this to say: ""It went higher frankly than any previous shot they've taken, a research and development effort on their part to continue building ballistic missiles that can threaten everywhere in the world, basically.""Or, as North Korea's communist ruler Kim Jong Un put it, ""We have finally realized the great historic cause of completing the state nuclear force.""Where does that leave us? Not in a good position. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said that U.S. ""diplomatic options remain viable and open, for now.""Since the start of this year, North Korea has tried out 23 missiles in 16 tests, and it continues to pursue advanced technology to deliver a workable nuclear bomb that can be carried by its new ICBMs.""The U.S. and South Korea believe Pyongyang may be able to put a miniaturized warhead on a missile sometime in 2018 — giving it the theoretical capability to launch a missile with a warhead atop it that could reach the U.S.,"" CNN reported.Surprisingly, that might not be the most immediate concern. Others note that an electromagnetic-pulse attack on the U.S., carried by one of the North Korean ICBMs, could have a catastrophic impact.Based on a recent report to Congress, ""A large nuclear blast outside the atmosphere and above the U.S. could short out electric systems across the continent and cause airliners in flight to crash."" Not to mention taking down local power plants, transportation systems, cell phone service, TV service, refrigeration, everything the modern world economy depends on.Oh, and millions of Americans, Canadians and Mexicans would die. And Kim Jong Un, who murders and starves his own people by the thousands, wouldn't lose any sleep about it.It's not a comforting thought. We would do well to refocus some of our energies away from petty political squabbles, and start pondering what to do about this.President Trump has promised new sanctions on North Korea following the test, while China is sending a team of diplomats to its client state for emergency talks. But we have been talking and even doing deals with North Korea for decades now, to no effect.President Clinton in 1994 gave North Korea food and energy aid, in exchange for its promise that it would end its nuclear program. It didn't. Instead, it got together with Iran and worked to create nuclear weapons with which they could menace the world.Thanks to President Obama's 2009 policy of ""strategic patience,"" both Iran and North Korea have had another eight years to become nuclear powers — which will soon give them the ability to use nuclear blackmail on their immediate neighbors and us.Unless North Korea relents, we'll face a hard choice: Continue talking and hope that North Korea sees the light, or take down Kim Jong Un and his hateful totalitarian regime.We think the latter is the only real choice. As our November IBD/TIPP Poll showed, 73% of Americans say they are ""very concerned"" or ""somewhat concerned"" about the ""possibility of a nuclear attack by North Korea against the U.S. or its allies."" This will only grow with recent revelations.We have a choice: Take down Kim's murderous regime and end this growing threat once and for all, or forever regret missing the chance.RELATED:Putting North Korea On The U.S.' Terrorist List Was Long Overdue Americans Fear North Korean Nuclear Attack: IBD/TIPP Poll No, North Korea's Nuclear Threat Isn't Fake News Click here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

176,KIM,"Spirits have chipped away at beer's popularity for several years, but executives at Brown-Forman (BFB) see an even faster-growing kind of booze than spirits: straight-up hard liquor.X The owner of Jack Daniel's, Herradura tequila, Chambord and other kinds of liquor also ratcheted up its full-year profit and underlying net sales guidance and easily topped fiscal second-quarter forecasts on Wednesday. The results, as one analyst suggested during the company's earnings call, stood out as other companies in the consumer-staples industry struggle.CEO Paul Varga attributed that success, in part, to what the company has been doing for decades.""Our categories, where we're focused – American whiskeys, bourbons, increasingly tequilas, Irish – these are categories today that are growing ahead of even the distilled spirits category in the United States,"" he said during the company's earnings call. ""We think we're particularly well positioned.""The premium ends of those kinds of liquor, he said, tend to be the categories that are growing ahead of the market.Management also said that it was positioning its new Tennessee Rye for ""long-term success,"" and expected it to help sales for the rest of the year.That strategy could echo the way it has treated its Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey and its cinnamon-flavored Tennessee Fire — both of which have been rolled out in recent years in attempt to draw millennial drinkers. Varga said ""it was a conscious choice to treat those more like brands,"" rather than novelty flavors.The company, in a statement, attributed the gains in the second quarter to ""improving economies in the emerging markets,"" and the appeal of Jack Daniel's, Woodford Reserve, Old Forester and Herradura tequila. Growth in Poland and Mexico was strong. Varga, during the call, singled out what he described as the rapidly-increasing popularity of Herradura Ultra in Mexico, where tequila isn't exactly in short supply.While the company suggested it was satisfied with its strategy to drive tequila sales, management said it might need to refine how it sells its single-malt scotch, which tends to be sold more uniquely, and at a higher price, than other kinds of liquor.The company said its Scotch brands aren't performing up to plans right now due to hiccups related to timing on bringing them to market.Shares were up 6.5% at 65.82 on the stock market today, a record close after surging as much as 9.6% intraday.IBD'S TAKE: On the search for even more stocks with actionable trading opportunities? Check out our Stock Lists page, where you can find stocks near buy zones, stocks hitting new highs, sector leaders, tech leaders, IPO leaders and more. Brown-Forman's fiscal Q2 earnings per share jumped 23% to 62 cents, while reported net sales rose 10% to $914 million. Wall Street expected EPS of 53 cents and revenue of $868 million, according to Zacks Investment Research.The company boosted its full-year EPS outlook to $1.90-$1.98, up from a prior view of $1.85-$1.95, with the midpoint above the consensus for $1.92. Brown-Forman now sees underlying net sales growth of 6%-7%, up from an earlier view for 4%-5%. The EPS forecast was helped by better sales, a slightly lower tax rate, and expectations for lower inventories.The company said it expects more modest growth in emerging markets for the rest of the fiscal year.Brown-Forman faces stiff competition from other big booze companies like Constellation Brands (STZ) — whose portfolio includes Corona, Kim Crawford wines and other spirits — and Diageo (DEO), whose brands include Smirnoff, Tanqueray and Captain Morgan. News surfaced earlier this year that Brown-Forman rejected a takeover offer from Constellation.But shares of Brown-Forman have climbed since late August, when the company raised its full-year EPS forecast and delivered estimate-topping first-quarter earnings, marking what Zacks analysts called a rebound from a ""dismal"" prior quarter.A lower tax rate and an easier foreign exchange environment influenced the full-year forecast at that time, but the company also held to its sales outlook despite troubled economies outside the U.S.Brown-Forman's results also arrive as the alcoholic beverage industry tries to figure out what to do with marijuana, around which a rapidly growing industry has formed as more U.S. states legalize the plant.Constellation in October said it agreed to take a 9.9% stake in the Canadian marijuana company Canopy Growth, while Molson Coors (TAP) said last month that the company had a team to gauge ""potential impacts and/or the opportunities"" of the cannabis industry.Brown-Forman last month said it was ""continuing to monitor"" the cannabis industry's development, without offering further detail. The subject did not come up during Wednesday's conference call.RELATED:Monster Beverage Tumbles Below Buy Point On Low-Energy EarningsAs Investors Eye Marijuana Industry, These Products May Go Mainstream

177,KIM,"Semiconductor stocks fell Monday after Morgan Stanley issued downgrades on several chipmakers, including Western Digital (WDC), on concerns that prices for memory chips will fall.XMorgan Stanley analyst Katy Huberty cut her rating on Western Digital to equal weight from overweight, based on an expectation that prices of Nand flash-memory chips are peaking and could fall as much as 15%, starting in the first quarter. Huberty cut her price target on Western Digital to 117 from 90, which was also based on uncertainty around the outcome of Western Digital's joint venture with Toshiba.Western Digital shares dropped 6.7% to close at 86.55 on the stock market today.Among other chipmakers, Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) was lowered by Morgan Stanley analyst Charlie Chan to equal weight from overweight, while Morgan Stanley analyst Shawn Kim lowered his rating on Samsung Electronics to equal weight from overweight.""We think now is the time to reduce exposure to Nand (flash memory) and Asian semiconductor names as the industry has benefited from sizable demand tailwinds and unprecedented pricing power, which we see reversing soon,"" Kim wrote in a research note to clients Sunday. ""Given our view of the cycle, we cannot recommend the sector until the market recognizes mounting pressure on Nand prices and slowing logic-chip growth momentum in the near term.""IBD'S TAKE: The semiconductor sector is highly competitive, with more than 750 companies vying globally to build the insides of the next hot device or power future computers. Bookmark this page to stay on top of the latest news in chips.Micron Technology (MU), another big supplier of memory chips, was down 3.4%, near 50. However, Chan said Micron technology was less threatened by the expected fall in Nand memory prices due to Micron's strength in DRAM memory chips.Micron received multiple price-target hikes two months ago after posting better-than-expected fiscal fourth-quarter sales and earnings.Taiwan Semiconductor was down 4.4%, near 41.09. Last month, Taiwan Semiconductor reported third-quarter sales and earnings that beat estimates and guided higher for current-quarter sales.Manufacturers of chipmaking equipment were also getting hit. Applied Materials (AMAT) fell 1.7% to finish at 56.94.  Lam Research (LRCX) dropped 2.7% to close at 210.93.RELATED:Western Digital Reports Quarterly Revenue, Earnings Above ViewsWhy Artificial Intelligence Could Boost Demand For Chipmaking Gear

178,KIM,"This year, North Korea celebrated the Fourth of July by testing long-range missiles capable of reaching the U.S. mainland. Four months later, the Defense Intelligence Agency reported that Pyongyang is now able to miniaturize a nuclear warhead.XNorth Korea's ""Dear Leader,"" Kim Jong Un, has made no secret of his desire to nuke the U.S. In 2013, he threatened to nuke Austin, Texas. He also has cited Los Angeles and Washington, D.C., as preferred targets.Small wonder, then, that the Trump administration last week requested an additional $4 billion to beef up U.S. missile defenses. Currently, our very limited missile defense systems are concentrated in the West. Cities on the East Coast are far less protected. And the missile threat for both coasts is growing.That's because North Korea is not the only rising and obsessively anti-American state out there. Iran is another one, and it's flush with cash from the deal it cut with the Obama administration — a deal that also gave the terrorist-supporting state access to international markets with advanced technologies.Iran is almost certainly using these funds to improve its ballistic missiles, as well as to underwrite terrorist activities aimed at weakening the U.S. and its allies.Earlier this month, the regime celebrated the 38th anniversary of the seizure of the U.S. embassy in Tehran and taking U.S. diplomats hostage.  The mullahs still denounce America as ""the Great Satan,"" and ritual chants of ""Death to America"" still punctuate Friday prayers.The 2015 nuclear deal has temporarily delayed the regime's nuclear weapons program but has not dampened its ambitions. Unless the international conditions change dramatically, we will be facing a nuclear-armed Iran in just a few years.The $4 billion boost in spending requested by President Trump is a drop in the federal budget, but it is approximately half of the annual budget of the agency with primary responsibility for the nation's missile defense.Over half of the proposed hike would go to augment the Ground-Based Midcourse Defense system — and rightly so. This system shoots down enemy missiles in their midcourse phase, hundreds of miles before they reach U.S. territory.Currently we have four of these interceptors in California and up to 40 in Alaska. That's comforting when one ponders the rhetoric and actions of North Korea's ""Rocket Man,"" but we need to stay ahead of that threat. And missile defenses aren't built in a day.Some people oppose spending more money on missile defense, arguing that these systems will never achieve 100% reliability. But nothing in life is 100% guaranteed.If missile defenses save just one major U.S. city, the entire investment will have been justified many times over.Our systems have compiled an impressive test record. Yes, sometimes they have failed a test, but that's not automatically a bad thing.In testing, we learn more from failures than successes. We stress the system and push it to its limits. Failures allow us to identify weaknesses in the system and fix them. It's a process that has produced ever more reliable defenses.Is it perfect? No. But certainly the alternative — letting the enemy missile have a free ride into an American city — is unacceptable.Technologies improve every day. What seemed like science fiction even five years ago is a common occurrence now. That is why the government must sustain its investment in missile defense. It must also increase funding for future missile defense technologies so we are not caught by surprise and vulnerable.We do everything possible to keep ahead of this growing threat. After all, no one wants to celebrate the Fourth under a mushroom cloud.Click here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

179,KIM,"North Korea: President Trump says he'll put Kim Jong Un's hermit kingdom on the U.S.' list of state sponsors of terrorism on Tuesday. The move, Trump said, ""should have happened years ago."" He couldn't be more right.XThe move sends North Korea's ""murderous regime,"" as Trump calls it, an unambiguous signal: The U.S.' tolerance of its escalating acts of aggression against its neighbors and the U.S. is at an end. The diplomatic game of patty-cake is over.The listing of North Korea as a state sponsor of terrorism isn't a toothless act: It automatically triggers a host of sanctions, including ""restrictions on U.S. foreign assistance, a ban on defense exports and sales, certain controls over exports of dual-use items, and miscellaneous financial and other restrictions,"" the State Department said. And North Korea joins some bad company on the list: Iran, Sudan and Syria, all states that succor, sponsor and support terrorism in one form or another.Yet, as of now, North Korea has surged to the fore as one of the biggest terrorist threats out there. Just Monday, South Korea's top spy agency, the National Intelligence Service (NIS), said its communist next-door neighbor appeared to be preparing to ramp up its long-range missile tests this year as part of a growing threat to the U.S.The NIS said ""there is a possibility that North Korea could fire an array of ballistic missiles this year under the name of a satellite launch and peaceful development of space, but in fact to ratchet up its threats against the U.S.""Kim's totalitarian regime has redoubled its efforts in recent months to create a nuclear weapon that can be delivered via intercontinental ballistic missile as far as the U.S., even though these efforts violate U.N. Security Council sanctions already in place. It has tested two missiles by firing them over Japan, and appears to be gaining in its acquisition of the relevant technology needed to someday menace the U.S.North Korea and Iran, by the way, have colluded in their nuclear efforts, with technicians and engineering teams from both countries sharing data and visiting facilities in both countries. The Trump administration sees this as a joint threat.As U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley said in October, ""Leaving the Iran (nuclear) deal unchanged sends Kim Jong Un an unmistakable message that the United States can be bought with a bad deal that does not end the threat of its nuclear missile program, a deal just like the Iran deal.""The fact is, the U.S. has a long history of appeasement of North Korea's bad behavior, from the first President Bush and President Clinton, to the second President Bush and President Obama. Each time, the U.S. has made concessions and increased aid. And each time, North Korea's behavior grew worse.This has had predictable results. Last week, foreign policy analyst Michael Rubin of the American Enterprise Institute noted that influential leaders in Iran have started to question the value of the Iran nuclear agreement, given the U.S.' inability to stop North Korea from doing what it wants.Said Rubin, ""Some Iranian hard-liners close to Khamanei ask themselves why Iran should be constrained by a nuclear agreement when North Korea, a country with a small population and weaker economy, managed to defy the West.""In response, Trump has now started drawing a line in the sand, indicating North Korea's years of acting out are coming to an end. Maybe by cracking down on North Korea and ratcheting up the pain through sanctions, a message will be sent to Iran as well: The days of appeasement are over. And so are the days of U.S. weakness.RELATED:Americans Fear North Korean Nuclear Attack: IBD/TIPP Poll No, North Korea's Nuclear Threat Isn't Fake News Trump Just Got China, Russia And The U.N.

180,KIM,"Antitrust regulators from around the world are frequent news items in the United States — almost never for a good reason.Attention has come as the Korea Fair Trade Commission (KFTC), the Japan Fair Trade Commission, China's National Development and Reform Commission, and the European Union's Competition Directorate have imposed fines approaching or exceeding $1 billion in individual cases against industry-leading U.S. high-technology firms, including Intel, Microsoft, Qualcomm, and Google, often also insisting on changes to operations or pricing that will reduce the firms' competitive advantages.XNew KFTC chairman Kim Sang-Jo, for one, recently promised even more aggressive activity against use of intellectual property to advance leading firms' positions. U.S. authorities should take note — and action.The targeted firms are all successful innovators with extensive intellectual property (IP), and use of their IP has been a focus of antitrust regulators' complaints. Antitrust regulators have interpreted competition law to prevent innovation-based competition by limiting foreign firms' ability to profit from innovative success, viewing a single firm's use of its own IP at the expense of competitors as anti-competitive.Paradoxically, the higher the value of the innovation, the larger the punishment imposed on a firm succeeding by its virtue.Targeting leading foreign firms helps competing firms at home (along with some foreign competitors and downstream purchasers) while increasing officials' power over global commerce. But the expanding scope of KFTC and other regulatory bodies — particularly with their focus on restraining use of legally-granted IP rights by individual firms, not cartels — harms both the U.S. economy and economic progress around the world.Innovation, strong and stable property rights, trade, and respect for the rule of law are key pillars of economic progress and national success. Commitment to these four principles by the U.S. and other nations, largely those described as ""the West,"" in the seven decades following World War II powered an unprecedented increase in global prosperity (an almost fourfold increase in per capita GDP, accounting for more than three-fourths of the improvement in living standards in the last 10,000 years).Protection of intellectual property rights that promote innovation, of trade that distributes innovative products, and of legal rules that secure unbiased treatment of rights-holders, is critical to continued advancement. Because of this, multilateral agreements under the aegis of the World Trade Organization (WTO) now incorporate protections against many actions impairing trade-related intellectual property rights.While using WTO procedures to enforce international trade rules is an obvious first-best route to fight violations, WTO dispute resolution is a notoriously lengthy process — one that also can be distorted by the same forces that impel antitrust authorities to put protection of domestic firms over rules that promote competition, especially competition in innovation. For the same reason, discussions among antitrust authorities, including U.S. officials, can fall prey to similar incentives to expand regulators' reach.A provision of U.S. trade law, Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, allows independent U.S. action to combat violations of trade agreements, and an amendment to the law commonly labeled ""Special 301,"" directs the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) annually to list nations that violate U.S. intellectual property rights and prioritize negotiations with nations that are the worst offenders.Despite legitimate fears that departures from multilateral dispute resolution processes can undermine global rule-based trade regimes — that Section 301 could devolve into a trade-distorting protectionist tool — this ""naming and shaming"" approach, combined with priority for discussions with the other nations, is consistent with our international commitments.Properly implemented, it can complement and reinforce those commitments, prodding compliance with international undertakings that benefit people around the world. Given the bold actions of entities like the KFTC, USTR would be justified in putting nations whose antitrust authorities undermine competition and devalue intellectual property on the Special 301 lists and even initiating an investigation under its broader Section 301 authority, which also can produce negotiated solutions rather than departure from WTO accords.Those who champion open trade should know that enforcing trade rules is critical to maintaining an open-trade regime — and that preventing other nations from systematically targeting cutting-edge U.S. firms helps not just the U.S. economy but a broader global economy based on innovation, competition, and law.The best means to protect IP rights, promote competition, and enforce trade rules may be debated, but the need to support those goals, and the risk evolving antitrust regimes pose to them, should be common ground.

181,KIM,"If you're a donor to charity, you must already be exhausted: Not only have you been bombarded with wrenching news of disasters and relief appeals — from everybody from former U.S. presidents to J.Lo — but political appeals may have kept your phone ringing.  Luckily, the hot stock market may be aiding your ability to give.XBut now, as the year ebbs, a doozy of a giving issue is emerging: tax reform and its possible effects on giving. It's what Michigan-based consultant, Michael Montgomery, calls ""the elephant in the room."" And many believe its implications for your giving could stretch well beyond 2017.While tax benefits aren't the only incentives for giving, they are a consideration for many donors, experts say. And thus, with the current rollout of tax reform proposals, uncertainty is rising about what may pass in Congress, if anything, and its implications for giving. But from what's seen so far, if the current plan passes, giving's tax benefits seem destined to apply to fewer people in the future. And, for donors overall, since current tax rules might provide more generous benefits for giving than future rules, donors should consider making bigger charitable gifts this year, some experts say.To be sure, tax reform's provisions are still evolving in Congress. But key elements of the House of Representatives' now-proposed tax reform plan that could affect people's philanthropy include:""Of highest concern is the near-doubling of the current standard deduction limit for taxpayers,"" holds Tom Bognanno, CEO of Community Health Charities. ""The move could reduce the number of people who itemize tax deductions from almost one-third of tax filers to about 5%."" In turn, that ""would remove the tax incentive for some $95 billion of annual charitable giving and could result in a loss of up to $14 billion in donations.""Eliminating many noncharitable tax deductions, such as the deduction of state and local income and sales taxes from federal taxes, could also deter itemizing.The upshot: If people don't itemize, they won't be able to get a tax deduction for their charitable giving, points out Eugene Steuerle, of the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center.As for lower tax rates: In general, the more that tax rates are cut for itemizers, the less they save on taxes by making a charitable gift. But because of its provisions, the current tax proposal will affect specific donors in various ways. Key factors determining specific donors' tax bill will include where they live and whether they'd be affected by an elimination of deductions, such as those for state and local income taxes and real estate taxes, says Elda Di Re, partner, private clients services, at the accounting firm of EY.As for 2017 giving so far?  Reports are mixed through this year's third quarter.Some plus signs: During the January-September 2017 period, Schwab Charitable donor-advised fund accounts logged a 46% gain in contributions, and a 16% rise in grants to charities, vs. the same period a year earlier, said Kim Laughton, president of Schwab Charitable. During the same nine months of 2017, Vanguard Charitable donor-advised fund (DAF) accounts posted a 15% rise in contributions and a 25% increase in grants vs. the year-earlier period, reports Jane Greenfield, president of Vanguard Charitable.However, one measurement — that of the Growth in Giving Initiative — shows a 4% slide in charitable giving in this year's first nine months vs. the year-earlier period. A drop in donations of $1,000 or more caused the overall decline, said Jon Biedermann, vice president of software producer, DonorPerfect. That firm, along with Bloomerang and NeonCRM, among others, collects data from charities for the GiG database.Taken together, this year's raft of giving factors — from multidisasters, to a possible tax overhaul — may seem daunting to donors. But evidently, there are some useful guides through this thicket. Among the giving tips that experts suggest:RELATED:Psst, Millennials! 5 Tips For Taming Your Student Loans

182,KIM,"If you wanted to predict the results of Tuesday's gubernatorial elections in Virginia and New Jersey, you would have been wise to ignore the flurry of polls and campaign events. You would have paid no heed to the conventional wisdom that Republican Ed Gillespie had a solid chance to beat Ralph Northam in Virginia.In fact, Northam's 9-point victory margin in Virginia was not much different from Phil Murphy's 13-point margin over Republican Kim Guadagno in New Jersey. And both almost precisely mirrored the 2016 presidential results.Hillary Clinton carried New Jersey by a 55-41% margin last year; Murphy won it by a 56-43% margin this week. Clinton carried Virginia by a 50-44% margin; Northam won it 54-45%. The two Democrats, lacking Clinton's reputation for dishonesty, gained a few points she lost to third-party candidates; the two Republicans got almost exactly the same percentages as Donald Trump did in 2016.That makes the 2016 numbers look like the new normal. The past quarter-century, except for 2006-08, has been an era of polarized partisan parity, with one election result resembling another and more straight party ticket voting than any time since the 1950s. That's produced divided government, as Democrats have won 4 of 7 presidential elections since 1992 while Republicans have won a House majority in 10 of 12 congressional elections since 1994.The parties are evenly matched but differently distributed. Democratic voters are clustered in central cities, sympathetic suburbs and university towns. Republican voters are spread more evenly elsewhere.XTrump changed that in 2016, but just a bit. Rough extrapolations from exit polls suggest he lost 2 million to 3 million college-educated whites who had previously voted Republican but gained some 3 million to 4 million non-college-educated whites who had previously voted Democratic or didn't vote. His college graduate losses cost him zero electoral votes; the non-college gains netted him 100 new electoral votes and the White House. The art of the deal.New Jersey and Virginia have relatively few non-college-educated whites — 33% and 37%, respectively, according to FiveThirtyEight. They have many college graduates outraged by Trump. That's especially the case in northern Virginia. The Washington suburbs cast 35% of Virginia's votes.Ed Gillespie, a former chairman of the Republican National Committee and backer of earlier comprehensive immigration reforms, ran for the Senate and won 43% of the vote in northern Virginia in 2014, losing statewide by just 1%. Trump got only 33% there in 2016, and this year, Gillespie could manage only 35%. Losing one-third of a state by 30 points instead of 11 is the difference between a squeaker and a near-landslide loss. Carrying the nonmetropolitan 30% of the state by a margin slightly better than Trump's doesn't compensate.The danger for Republicans — and the opportunity for Democrats — is that Republicans next year will run, as Gillespie did, at Trumpish levels with high-education constituencies but fall, as he didn't, to pre-2016 levels in low-education areas. And despite Gillespie's improvement on 2014 in nonmetropolitan Virginia, Democrats made big gains in state House races by running well-organized and well-financed campaigns, mostly in high-education suburbs. Republicans went into Election Day with a 66-34 majority in the chamber; as this is written, Democrats might just gain the 17 seats needed to overturn that.This has led David Wasserman, The Cook Political Report's ace U.S. House race analyst, to say Democrats are ""slight favorites"" to overturn the Republicans' 240-194 majority in the House. My impression is that anti-Trump enthusiasm has been inspiring many serious Democrats to run in high-education districts but not many are running in low-education districts.Democrats could suffer from internecine primary strife and plurality nominations of fringe candidates, but clearly, Republicans are worried. Many Republican incumbents are retiring, some because of six-year term limits on chairmanships, others for fear of serving in the minority, where your job is to show up and lose.Similar fears may be prompting House Republicans to rally around their leadership's tax legislation, to avoid the type of fiasco we saw when the House floundered and the Senate failed to repeal ObamaCare. But any serious legislation is tricky, and the president's party needs informed guidance from the White House. So far, that's most lacking.Off in South Korea, Trump ungallantly tweeted, ""Ed Gillespie ... did not embrace me or what I stand for.""

183,KIM,"Marxism: One hundred years is a long time, certainly long enough to know whether something works. In the case of communism, now passing its 100th year as a political system, it's safe to say it has had its chance and now ranks as one of the greatest disasters of all humankind.Tuesday marked the day the Bolsheviks overthrew Russia's czar and the elected government, leading to the first communist ""nation,"" the Soviet Union. Eventually, billions of people in Eastern Europe, Asia, Africa and Latin America would be enslaved by this oppressive system.XYes, the Soviet Union disappeared in 1991, a victim, as Marxists might say, of its own contradictions. But it left an indelible stain of evil on humanity that will never be erased. Indeed, even today, lesser countries have succumbed to the communist temptation, leaving millions of their slave-citizens destitute and bereft of hope.Communist nations have become a kind of ideological charnel house, murdering over 100 million of their own people, according to ""The Black Book of Communism,"" whose author, Stephane Courtois, is himself a former communist. Since 1948, China alone has killed an estimated 60 million of its people, while the USSR murdered at least 25 million and likely more than 40 million. Cambodia butchered two million of its own people, which sounds small until you consider it only had eight million people total.Our current nemesis, the totalitarian communist regime of Kim Jong Un in North Korea, has the blood of two million of its own citizens on its hands, too. Today, Cuba and Venezuela, both failed communist states, continue to murder their own people so that a tiny elite of communist rulers can hold their powers and privileges over the vast, exploited and enslaved ""proletariat"" in whose name they rule.""The death of one man is a tragedy; the death of millions is a statistic,"" the USSR's brutal leader Josef Stalin reportedly told U.S. diplomat Averell Harriman. Apocryphal or not, it's a fitting summation of how Marxists, socialists and communists view human life. It's cheap and expendable — everything for the state, nothing outside of it.These extreme-left regimes have found often ingenious ways to murder people. Starvation, brutal medieval-style torture, on-the-spot executions in prison cells, clandestine murders of dissidents, mass killings of enemy populations by special military detachments, the secret police, failure to provide health care to those held in prison, overwork in camps, poison ... the list goes on and on.Say what you will about the many failings of communists, they are bloody good at murder.They're also great at creating equality — equality of misery, for everyone, that is, except for the Politburo fat cats and apparatchiks who govern in the people's name. They always have better health care, cars, dachas or island retreats, special lanes on the highways, access to foreign currency stores, all the things that make being a communist in a communist nation worthwhile — but that also make the rest of the people miserable.That communism has stood for 100 years — indeed, continues to stand — is an enormous tragedy. But perhaps what's worse is that there are still those among us who excuse the murderous excesses and outright theft of communist regimes, and argue that ""true communism has never been tried."" Sorry, it has. It just failed, everywhere it was tried. There are no communist success stories. None.Bizarrely, more than 40% of millennials in a recent poll had a favorable view of socialism, which is communism's fraternal twin. So is ""Marxism,"" the darling of the intellectual set. There's really very little difference between the three, except for how they would gain and maintain power.The last U.S. election even featured a shambling, avuncular, self-avowed socialist whose economic ideas came right out of Karl Marx.  He should have been laughed off every dais he stood on. Instead, he was often warmly applauded. It's a stunning and depressing indictment of the collapse of our education system and the media's responsibility to tell the truth.These ""socialist"" ideas espoused by people like Sen. Bernie Sanders and his allies in the progressive wing of the Democratic Party are the same ideas that have brought misery, poverty and loss of freedom in other countries. But somehow millions of American voters believe it would be different here.A hundred years on, and communism isn't dead, as many believed after the USSR's collapse. It's still alive, and so are the ideas that animate it. And while today's political ""socialism"" and cultural ""Marxism"" pretend to be different, they really aren't. To paraphrase George Santayana, we should remember communism's many deep sins and tragic failures or suffer the ignominious fate of repeating them.RELATED:Venezuela's Collapse Shows Why We Need A Museum Of Communism The Fidel Castro Myth Debunked: The Death Of A Tyrant, Not A Hero Thanks To Free Markets, Global Poverty And Hunger Are On The Ropes Click here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

184,KIM,"North Korean Nukes: Why did President Trump suddenly go wheels-up on a grueling, 12-day Asian tour? As new polling data suggests, it might be because North Korea has suddenly emerged as a major nuclear threat in the eyes of most Americans.In the November IBD/TIPP Poll, taken from Oct. 26 to Nov. 3,  73% said they were ""very concerned"" or ""somewhat concerned"" about the ""possibility of a nuclear attack by North Korea against the U.S. or its allies."" The national poll of 917 adult Americans has a margin of error of +/-3.7 percentage points.Recent news developments no doubt feed this growing fear.On Sunday, Rear Adm. Michael J. Dumont of the Joint Chiefs of Staff said that it would take a ground invasion of North Korea to destroy its nuclear weapons capability. Dumont noted that Seoul, the South Korean capital that lies just 35 miles from the Demilitarized Zone, would be vulnerable to attack by artillery, rockets and ballistic missiles in the event of a war. Seoul is home to 25 million people.Meanwhile, just days ago, an unnamed U.S. official told CNN that North Korea is ""working on an advanced version of its existing KN-20 intercontinental ballistic missile that could potentially reach the United States."" The totalitarian regime of Kim Jong Un launched its first ICBM just last July, so the progress is rapid. An ICBM could potentially reach the U.S. in a little over half an hour.Based on this escalation, blunt-talking U.S. Defense Secretary James Mattis last month made clear what the U.S. policy was: ""I cannot imagine a condition under which the United States would accept North Korea as a nuclear power,"" he said.So a very clear and bright line has been drawn for all to see.Americans seem to understand this. While on many issues these days there are often sharp, even divisive, splits in general opinion based on party affiliation, that's not the case with North Korea's nuclear threat, the IBD/TIPP Poll's results show.Among Democrats, for instance, 86% said they were concerned, vs. just 14% saying they weren't. But Republicans weren't too far behind, with 69% expressing concern about a North Korean nuke, compared with 31% not being concerned. For independents, it was 65% concerned vs. 35% not concerned.A surprising share of those queried also believe that a military conflict between the U.S. is ""inevitable."" Some 27% said the U.S. and North Korea will go to war — 37% of Republicans, 22% of Democrats and 25% of independents.That explains Trump's tough talk on Monday, as he began the first leg of his nearly two-week tour. Speaking with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe next to him, Trump referred to the ""North Korean menace"" and vowed that ""the era of strategic patience is over.""""The regime continues development of its unlawful weapons programs, including its illegal nuclear tests and outrageous launches of ballistic missiles directly overly Japanese territory,"" Trump said. ""We will not stand for that.""Americans have good reason to be worried about the totalitarian North Korean regime's nuclear schemes. Given the brutal nature of the murderous Kim regime and its potential instability, a nuclear North Korea is a nonstarter.President Trump is expected to meet with Chinese officials and possibly also Russian leader Vladimir Putin during his trip. No item on the agenda will be more important than North Korea's burgeoning nuclear program.American presidents of both parties have kicked this can down the road for decades, leaving it for someone else to resolve. Trump is the first to really take it seriously. As we've said before, China is North Korea's main patron. We hope, and expect, Trump will mince no words in expressing his disappointment over China failing to leash its mad dog in Pyongyang.Americans might be surprised to know that the U.S. is already technically at war with North Korea, since the hostilities of the Korean War ended with a cease-fire — not a formal end of the state of war. For one side of the conflict — North Korea — that state of war is very real. Seeing Kim's growing nuclear program, Americans are also starting to realize the threat is real.RELATED:No, North Korea's Nuclear Threat Isn't Fake News North Korea's Nuclear Threat To The U.S. Is Real — And China's Largely To Blame Trump's Trade War With China Is War On North Korea By Other Means IBD/TIPP Poll Click here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

185,KIM,"Many young adults shoulder crushing amounts of student-loan debt. The average outstanding balance is a whopping $33,333, according to Millennial Personal Finance (MPF). Many young adults don't know how they can cope — the default rate tops 11%, says MPF.XBut there are practical steps for handling student-loan debt, including refinancing and, increasingly, availing yourself of loan repayment benefits offered by more employers.Help in any form is greatly needed. A majority of Americans — 56.4% — say student-loan debt is the biggest threat to the U.S., bigger even than the risk posed by Kim Jong Un, the North Korean dictator who repeatedly threatens the U.S. with nuclear holocaust. That's from a new poll done by MPF. The threat stems from the size of the burden. Forty-five million Americans are stuck with student loans balances, says MPF.Sagging under heavy debt burdens, many young adults feel they can't afford other key goals like saving for retirement or starting families. Many would sacrifice long-term goals to get out from under their student-loan debt.If they could get student-loan repayment as a job benefit, this percentage of poll respondents who graduated from 2013 through 2017 told MPF they would sacrifice:IBD'S TAKE: Another key to coping with debt is to build your portfolio. If you are a newcomer to stock investing who wants a few pointers, check out IBD's introduction to stock investing or IBD's mutual funds section for tips and strategies.The good news is that you don't have to make those painful sacrifices. Here are five steps you can take instead to cope better with student-loan debt:If you pay an extra $150 each month, you'd pay off your loan in about 6.6 years instead of about 10 years, according to studentloanhero.com's repayment calculator. Your payments, including interest, would total $42,049, saving you nearly $4,000 in interest.Can't afford an extra $150? If you pay an extra $90, you'll pay off your loan in about 7.7 years and save $2,787 in interest.The average balance refinanced is $53,892, according to LendEDU.com. The average term length is 10.4 years. By refinancing to 4.82%, you cut your total payments to $68,629, a savings of $6,762, says Bankrate.com.It's no surprise that student-loan repayment is emerging as a popular workplace benefit. Four percent of companies represented in the Society for Human Resource Management offer it now. That's up from 3% in 2015. Eight percent of companies with at least 40,000 workers offer it, according to WorldatWork, a human resources association.If your company offers this benefit, consider tapping into it. Why not accept help repaying your loan?Your employer may increase the size of its contribution to your loan repayment in some sort of sync with whatever amount you kick in. Other companies pony up money no matter how much you also pay or without asking you to contribute to the account too. The usual amount paid by employers is $100 to $200, Matherson says.To qualify, you typically must work for a government organization or tax-exempt 501(c)(3) charity. But the overall eligibility rules are restrictive. ""Less than 10% of people with student-loan debt qualify for forgiveness,"" Matherson said. ""And it's probably fewer than 5%.""A key aspect of the program is that you usually must repay your loan for 10 years before becoming eligible. In fact, the earliest 10-year period just ended in October.""It's not a practical source of help for most people,"" Matherson said.RELATED:8 Tips For Millennials Tackling Student-Loan DebtYou Need This Much Retirement Savings At Your Age And IncomeHow To Invest In Stocks For Free: New Apps Aim For BeginnersThe Top 10 Jobs Robots Could Steal From Humans By 2025How To Make Your Boss Add $76K To Your 401(k)

186,KIM,"It turns out that North Korea isn't just a nuclear threat. It's also a cyberthreat, and in some ways, this may be more frightening. Launched largely anonymously, cyberattacks can cripple essential infrastructure — power grids, financial networks, transportation systems — and inflict social disorder and political anarchy. Immediate retaliation is difficult.All this now seems plausible.Until recently, cybersecurity experts dismissed North Korea's attack capabilities. It was too backward to pose a serious threat. No more. In a lengthy front-page story on Oct. 16, The New York Times reported that cybersecurity experts admit that they underestimated North Korea, which has now been tied to some major cyberattacks. This includes the heist of an estimated $81 million of funds from the central bank of Bangladesh.The Times' story ought to command everyone's attention. It alters the military balance between the United States and North Korea — and not favorably for the United States. Written by journalists David Sanger, David Kirkpatrick and Nicole Perlroth, the article reported that North Korea has more than 6,000 hackers whose performance is ""undeniably improving,"" according to American and British security experts.North Korea ""can hold large swaths of nation-state infrastructure and private-sector infrastructure at risk,"" said former deputy director of the National Security Agency Chris Inglis. In part, the North Koreans were instructed and encouraged by Iran, the Times said. But mostly, their gains reflected persistence.""How can such an isolated, backward country have this capability?"" asked a former British government official. ""Well, how can such an isolated backward country have this nuclear ability?""In the Times story, the late North Korean leader Kim Jong Il is quoted, based on the testimony of a defector, as saying in 2003: ""If warfare was about bullets and oil until now ... warfare in the 21st century is about information.""Here are some other takeaways from the article:By the Times' telling, North Korea's capabilities go well beyond its angry response to the 2014 movie satire, ""The Interview,"" when it hacked Sony Pictures, the studio that produced the movie. Still, North Korea continues to resort to hacks to deter criticism of Kim.Just how the United States can react to North Korea's cyberprowess is unclear. According to the Times, ""Hundreds, if not thousands, of American cyberwarriors spend each day mapping the North's few networks, looking for vulnerabilities that could be activated in time of crisis."" By some accounts, the United States has planted sleeper cells in North Korea's networks.But the United States is constrained by its huge commitment to the internet. We are more dependent on the web than the North Koreans. In practice, this means that we are more vulnerable to attacks on it. More systems can be shut down and crippled than in North Korea. Americans think that technological superiority works to our benefit. Here, the opposite may be true.Click here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market? Start with IBD University.

189,KIM,"Donating to charity seems like a slam-dunk of positivity. You support a worthwhile cause, feel good about it and perhaps gain a tax deduction and expressions of gratitude from those who sought your gift.XBut for high-net-worth individuals, philanthropy and anxiety often go hand-in-hand. Deciding how much to give and where to give it can prove vexing.""Many of our clients are looking for guidance in their charitable giving,"" said Steven Wittenberg, director of legacy planning at SEI Private Wealth Management in Oaks, Pa. ""They may be anxious about whether their money is being wasted or if it's making an impact.""Developing expertise in charitable giving can separate advisors from their competitors by helping them become holistic financial advisors. By treating philanthropy as a central part of financial planning, advisors can suggest ways to enhance a client's retirement or estate plan.It's often a win-win proposal. Clients who lack a deep grounding in giving away money may appreciate their advisor's input and understanding of the charitable landscape. And advisors wind up attracting and retaining more clients thanks to their specialized knowledge of the nonprofit world and how to make the most of donated funds.""Advisors should recognize that it's an issue that many clients are worried about and position themselves as a go-to source for philanthropic advice,"" Wittenberg said. ""Some clients may not verbalize this need until we educate them.""For advisors who view charitable giving as a core part of their service, they raise the topic early and often with clients. When onboarding newcomers, they routinely ask about their charitable priorities.Even for those individuals inclined to donate generously, they may not make the most tax-efficient moves or conduct proper due diligence in allocating their gifts. Advisors can provide tools and resources to identify worthy causes while maximizing the tax benefits of giving.For clients with more ambitious plans to donate funds, financial advisors may partner with attorneys, accountants and philanthropic consultants to map out a detailed strategy. Through this team approach, the advisor-client relationship grows stronger and more lasting.""Getting specialized third-party providers involved can help identify options beyond checkbook philanthropy,"" Wittenberg said. He cites examples such as donor-advised funds and family foundations.Donor-advised funds offer a simple way for individuals to direct their giving by making a tax-deductible gift to the fund. The investment firm or community foundation that manages the fund aims to generate positive returns on the assets while distributing some of the money to charities per the donor's instructions.Of course, it's up to advisors to embrace charitable giving as part of their practice. Clients may not necessarily realize all the benefits — from tax savings to emotional gratification — unless their financial planner educates them and offers practical guidance.As more financial advisors provide comprehensive financial planning and seek ways to differentiate themselves, advice on charitable contributions has gained popularity as a value-added service.""Philanthropy was a side topic 20 years ago,"" said Kim Laughton, president of Schwab Charitable, a San Francisco-based donor-advised fund provider established with the support of Charles Schwab (SCHW). ""Over the last 10 years, we've found that the more advisors bring it up, the more clients appreciate it and want help with it.""From a business perspective, financial advisors who provide guidance on charitable giving can boost their client retention rates. It's harder for clients to leave when they've opened up about their desire to give back to their community  — or the larger society — and their advisor paves the way for them to follow through.""When an advisor is supportive of a client's philanthropy, you can forge an emotional tie with the client as a passionate helper,"" Laughton said.Providing tools and information to clients can reinforce your role as an expert on giving. For example, Schwab Charitable offers white papers to individuals who want to learn more about charitable-giving strategies.""Our most popular white paper is on donating more complex, appreciated assets to charity, such as privately traded securities, real estate and collectibles,"" Laughton said.The trickiest challenge for many financial advisors is raising the issue of charitable giving in the first place. If clients don't initiate the conversation, what's the best way to broach the subject without sounding preachy or pushy?""There's a real fear among some advisors of how to bring it up if a client isn't very philanthropic,"" Laughton said. ""It may feel like you're prying or the topic may seem out of bounds.""Mentioning charitable-giving options as part of a larger discussion of tax strategy can make sense. If you're searching for possible tax deductions, you can ask clients if they support any charities on a regular basis.RELATED:Good Listening Skills Help Separate Human Advisors From The Robos Looking For Good ETFs To Buy?

190,KIM,"U.S. stock futures initially turned lower overnight on a report that North Korea threatened a nuclear test in the Pacific Ocean, but investors took the latest saber rattling in stride.XNorth Korea's foreign minister said the country could test a hydrogen bomb over the Pacific Ocean, according to a South Korea news agency. Earlier Thursday, President Trump announced new sanctions vs. North Korea on Thursday following tough talk at his speech before the United Nations. That spurred North Korean leader Kim Jong Un to respond, ""I will surely and definitely tame the mentally deranged U.S. dotard with fire.""Trump responded on Twitter (TWTR) Friday morning, said Kim Jong Un is a ""madman"" who will be ""tested like never before!""Kim Jong Un of North Korea, who is obviously a madman who doesn't mind starving or killing his people, will be tested like never before!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 22, 2017However, North Korean weapons tests and heated rhetoric between that country and the U.S. no longer seem to be having as much effect on overnight trading as they did several weeks ago, when the missiles and threats first heated up. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon said that North Korea is a ""terrible threat."" But, speaking in India, he told a CNBC affiliate that investors shouldn't change how they behave.Separately, Iran vowed to strengthen its missile capability, state media reported.

192,KIM,"Amid the ongoing war of words between North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and U.S. President Donald Trump, investors preferred to refrain from sparking big moves within the stock market Friday.

Grubhub (GRUB), a leader in the mobile and online food ordering space, tanked as much as 7% before shaving those losses.Grubhub, still down nearly 3% to 51.88, is trying to hold above its rising 50-day moving average as well as recent buy points at 42.35 and 48.04.Analysts recently cut their consensus EPS estimates on the Chicago-based firm, but expected growth is still robust at 24% this year to $1.10 a share and 25% in 2018.Other leading stocks showing heavy selling included the following:Sociedad Quimica y Minera (SQM): The Chilean producer of fertilizers and expert in lithium metal mining dropped more than 4% to 55.76 in heavy volume.

Apple has survived temporary declines beneath the 10-week moving average in the past. The stock also still holds a decent cushion above its rising 40-week moving average.The last time Apple touched the 40-week line, roughly equivalent to the 200-day moving average on a daily chart, was in October 2016. That was the time when Apple was still molding a bottoming base pattern.Apple eventually broke out of that base, soaring past a 118.12 entry in a good cup with handle.Elsewhere in the market, small caps continued to thrive.The S&P SmallCap 600 rallied 0.7% as more money continued to flow into small banks.

194,KIM,"The new Nissan (NSANY) Leaf debuted to mixed reviews from auto sites and blogs late Tuesday, with most noting that what the 2018 model of the popular mass-market electric vehicle lacks in design and range, vs. rivals from General Motors (GM) and Tesla (TSLA), it makes up in price.XThe Japanese automaker touts the refreshed model as having longer range at a lower price, better performance, improved design and cutting-edge technologies.Notably, the 2018 Nissan Leaf has a range of 150 miles on a single battery charge, up 40% from last year's model, according to Inside EVs. Its base price drops to just under $30,000 before tax incentives vs. nearly $31,000 in the 2017 model. Battery capacity climbs to 40 kWh from 30 kWh, and horsepower to 147 hp from 107.The new Leaf goes on sale in the U.S. early next year. Nissan is looking to revive its EV sales with the redesigned Leaf. The ""aged"" 2017 model has dropped to fourth place behind the Tesla Model S, Tesla Model X and Chevy Bolt among best-sellers in the EV segment this year, according to Edmunds.Here is a roundup of the reviews:Over at Jalopnik, writer Justin Westbrook was less than wowed by the design aesthetic but found it a ""pretty sweet deal"" nonetheless.""The new Leaf is a neat little car that seems perfect for a daily commute that isn't punishingly long,"" he wrote. ""While its performance figures put it at a disadvantage against a Chevy Bolt or a Tesla Model 3, its $29,990 starting price before incentives puts it at a big cost advantage. That is attractively cheap for a reliable and easily-serviceable electric vehicle.""The advanced technology impressed the Jalopnik writer, ""including some semi-autonomous functionalities with its ProPilot system, where the car can manage single-lane highway driving. That's paired with a self-parking feature, as well as a single-pedal operation mode called e-Pedal, where you can control acceleration and deceleration with just a single pedal.""""The all-new model improves on just about everything from the outgoing Leaf,"" in Westbrook's view — but it's no Tesla Model 3.Fred Lambert at Electrek called the 2018 Leaf's new design ""arguably the biggest change"" in the new-gen model, but gave it thin praise.""The Leaf's profile remains roughly the same — though they claimed that it has been refined,"" Lambert wrote. ""What has been completely refreshed is the front fascia, which had been the main point of criticism for the design of the previous version of the car.""He also called out ""a few things that Nissan didn't update and could be disappointing to some,"" such as capacities and times for regular and quick charging.Inside EVs offered perhaps the most detailed dive into design changes at the heart of the new Nissan Leaf, finding its looks ""far angrier than its easygoing predecessor.""""The new 2018 Nissan Leaf seeks to be more competitive with a slew of driver assistant technologies, an increased range, and a sportier and tech-forward design,"" the website staff added.Kim Reynolds of Motor Trends took the new Leaf on the test track and had praise for the new advanced technologies.He wrote: ""ProPilot Assist is sort of a Tesla Autopilot light (at a fraction of the price). Relying on just a single forward-facing radar and a monocular video camera, ProPilot Assist provides single-lane, feet-off-the-pedals driving (what's called adaptive cruise control). Alone, this is nothing unusual. Its dexterity in responding to slinking traffic (including right down to 0 mph) is, though. Yet what elevates it to the same conversation as Autopilot is how accurately it also threads down the center of the road. Like with other Level 2 semiautonomous systems, you need to keep your hands on the wheel, but here, there's no need to give it periodic tugs. The electric power steering's frequent and small corrections automatically sense their presence.""Reynolds later tried the system on a Detroit expressway and added: ""ProPilot Assist is ordinary sensors doing an extraordinary job due to great software. ... Remember this system as the tipping point when semiautonomous driving finally met the masses.""But how would the 2018 Leaf stack up in performance against two of its biggest rivals?Reynolds concluded: ""Test-track recordings are yet to come, but given the Bolt's and Model 3's better power (and power-to-weight ratios) it'll probably lag in a three-EV drag race.""IBD'S TAKE: Flat bases, which require stocks to consolidate for a minimum of five weeks, have been common recently with the market grinding higher. Learn about this super growth stock pattern.Shares of Nissan were down 0.1% at 20.02 on the stock market today, continuing to test the 50-day moving average.Tesla stock dipped 1.5% to around 344, consolidating below a 370.10 buy point in a cup-with-handle base. Tesla expects to ramp up to mass production of the Model 3 by December.GM stock added 0.6% to 37.44 Wednesday. It is in buy range on the heels of a cup-with-handle breakout in heavy volume Friday.RELATED:Nissan Turns Over New Leaf, But Will It Challenge Tesla Model 3 Or Chevy Bolt?Automotive Industry News, Self-Driving Cars And Stocks To WatchAuto Sales Hit 42-Month Low But Harvey Car Losses May Reach 1 Million

Stocks fluctuated as North Korea's ballistic missile test rattled markets. Palladium extended gains and platinum rose above $1,000 an ounce for the first time since March.""Gold prices have rallied to their highest level since U.S. elections"" in November, analysts at Goldman Sachs Group including Abhinandan Agarwal said in a note to clients. ""Expect precious-metal stocks to outperform today.""Bullion for immediate delivery rose 0.3% to $1,314.23 an ounce at 1:57 p.m. ET, according to Bloomberg generic pricing. The metal gained as much as 1.2% to $1,326.08 an ounce, the highest since Nov. 9. Gold futures for December delivery climbed 0.3% to settle at $1,318.90 at 1:42 p.m. ET on the Comex.A Bloomberg Intelligence index of gold-mining companies climbed 3.5%, touching the highest since April, with AngloGold Ashanti (AU) and Harmony Gold Mining (HMY) leading gains.Gold has surged almost 15% this year, rising every month except June, as investors weigh the possibility of conflict in Asia, with Kim Jong Un's regime pushing on with missile tests and U.S. President Donald Trump vowing a stern response. Prices have also climbed as the Federal Reserve is expected to go slow on further interest-rate increases. Low rates are a boon to non-interest-bearing precious metals.Odds of a rate hike by year's end are at about 30%, down from more than 50% at the beginning of last month, based on fed funds futures.Demand for haven assets also rose as Wall Street and Washington braced for the repercussions of Tropical Storm Harvey in Houston, expected to be the costliest U.S. natural disaster since Hurricane Sandy in 2012.Harvey ""is likely to reduce U.S. GDP in the third quarter,""  Jim Wyckoff, senior analyst at Kitco Metals in Montreal, said in a report.

196,KIM,"With flash points flaring daily — Russian MIGs buzzing American warplanes, Chinese ships making ports of call to prefabbed islands constructed in the South China Sea, Iran's parliament passing a ballistic missile budget to chants of ""Death to America,"" and of course Kim Jong-Un's vow to reduce American cities to radioactive rubble — it's not hard to conclude, in the signal phrase of the Cold War, that threats to U.S. security constitute ""clear and present danger.""It's fair to ask, if this is America's new normal — are our defense forces prepared to deter war, defend U.S. interests and defeat adversaries if necessary?  That's the question that gave rise to a new Presidential Executive Order:  ""On Assessing and Strengthening the Manufacturing and Defense Industrial Base and Supply Chain Resiliency of the United States."" By next April, the heads of various cabinet departments must weigh in — DoD, Homeland Security, Commerce, and Labor among others — and report to the President policy recommendations for strengthening the U.S. defense industrial base.  In an op-ed accompanying the Executive Order, White House Economic Advisor Peter Navarro, point man in the defense readiness review, cited the fact that there is only one U.S. company that can repair submarine propellers. But the problem runs far deeper. Our metals and minerals dependency on foreign sources of supply is great and growing. As noted by the U.S. Geological Survey, we are 100% import-dependent for 20 metals and minerals, and 50% or more dependent for another 50. As for where the U.S. obtains these metals and minerals it needs but does not mine, China is a leading supplier of 28 of the 50 — up from 21 just a year ago.  Russia is a leading supplier for six more.  As a ""single point of failure"" — Pentagon-speak for choke-points on our defense industrial preparedness — there's nothing quite like a raw material shortage to bring the lengthiest supply chain to a standstill.  Take fused aluminum oxide, for example.  USGS reports that we depend on foreign supply for ""more than 75%"" of U.S. annual usage.  Who are the world's leading providers?  Again, it's China, and also Venezuela.In defense applications, the U.S. is 100% dependent for defense-grade aluminum fused oxide — with the shortage so severe that it has been approved for purchase into the National Defense Stockpile.  Can we count on China's leadership — and whatever passes for leadership in volatile Venezuela — to sell the U.S. a material we need for our defense industrial base? In announcing the Executive Order, Navarro noted that it ""does not silo defense, the economy and trade and the workforce,"" but embraces ""all the interconnections between a strong manufacturing base, a strong industrial base, a strong workforce … that strengthen our tax base which … allows us to buy the material and weapons.""A fine and expansive statement, to which we should make a one-word amendment: Instead of buying the strategic materials used in U.S. weapons platforms, whenever we can, we should be mining that material here at home.And that requires reversing the slide that has seen the U.S.'s share of global mining exploration investment in steady decline the past two decades, even as the length of the federal permitting process has doubled. Here, we need not wait for the President's Defense Industrial Base report; we should press for passage of critical minerals legislation now before the Congress, with meaningful permitting reform.In other instances, the necessary legislation is already on the books. What remains is to dust off federal authority not used since the end of the Cold War, as specified in the Defense Production Act to ""encourage domestic sources of supply"" of the growing list of critical metals and minerals. This means not only buying more strategic materials for the National Defense Stockpile from U.S. miners and materials refiners, but entering into off-take agreements for future purchases, to accelerate mine development and encourage U.S. mineral exploration. More generally, this is the right time to recognize the strategic importance of mainstay metals like copper — the mining of which provides access to multiple strategic co-products like rhenium, cobalt, selenium, tellurium and potentially even rare earths.  And not just hard rock mining — but the refining, smelting and advanced materials production that serve as the conveyor belt to advanced defense R&D and weapons platform building. Those who see such intervention as anti-free market need to brush up on their Adam Smith.  In his seminal 1776 work, ""The Wealth of Nations,"" the father of market economics was careful to make a defense exception. When the material in question was sailcloth and gunpowder, the means for powering British ships and British cannon, Smith wrote, ""it might not always be prudent to depend upon our neighbors for the supply.""Translate that to the present day, where our gunpowder and sailcloth are Tomahawk cruise missiles and the F-35 — both requiring rare earths and myriad other tech-metals — and we can see Smith's dictum remains true, especially as U.S. dependence is not on a neighbor like Canada, but a rising rival, China. For all these reasons, the Defense Industrial Base Executive Order is a step in the right direction.  Defense readiness has long been a key bulwark of American strength — and worrying about it has an equally lengthy pedigree.  In his oft-quoted farewell address, in a largely overlooked passage, President Dwight Eisenhower warned:  ""We can no longer risk emergency improvisation of national defense.""  That was 1961, at the height of the U.S.-Soviet Cold War.In 2017, with threats emanating from Moscow, Beijing, Pyongyang and Tehran, this is one instance where it would pay for America to Be Like Ike.

197,KIM,"Nuclear Diplomacy: With U.S. anger over North Korea's burgeoning nuclear weapons program at a full boil, President Trump has announced the first step in what could become a trade war with China. It's not a coincidence.To say that the U.S. is disappointed with China is an understatement. China loves access to our markets, but until recently played both sides as North Korea developed both a small nuclear bomb and the long-range missile capabilities with which to deliver it, and the U.S. tried to stop it.As we've noted before, Trump has explicitly linked improved ties between the U.S. and China to its ability to keep its main client state, North Korea, on a leash. It's failed to do so.It's largely been a costless policy for the Chinese government. China doesn't fear a conventional war with the U.S. because, rightly or wrongly, it guesses we don't have the stomach for one.But they may have underestimated Trump: He has the will, and likely the political support, for an even-more damaging war with China over trade. With the U.S. China's largest market — in 2016, U.S. imports from China totaled nearly half a trillion dollars — a trade war is a serious threat to China, which is already showing signs of economic slowing.That's what's behind Trump's sudden decision to investigate China's rampant theft of U.S. intellectual property. And on trade grounds only, Trump is right to investigate this, since it's enshrined in both U.S. law and international trade treaties that egregious trade violations warrant retaliatory actions if the violations aren't fixed.The U.S. has been jawboning China on this for years, to no effect. China for years has seen the U.S. as a paper tiger, too feckless to act on its own behalf. Now, Trump is showing it otherwise.That this move isn't merely about trade is obvious, especially to the Chinese.""The Korea Peninsula issue and the trade issue belong to two different categories,"" Hua Chunying, spokeswoman for China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said on Monday. ""It's obviously inappropriate to use one issue to pressure the other side on a different issue.""Once again, Trump the savvy business negotiator seems to know his foe's weak points.Perhaps hoping to stall Trump's trade action, China announced that it would cease North Korean imports of coal, iron and lead, and seafood, starting Sept. 5, in keeping with U.N. sanctions imposed on Kim Jong Un's regime.In a joint statement Monday, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and National Security Advisor Gen. James Mattis made explicit the link between China, trade and North Korea: ""China is North Korea's neighbor, sole treaty ally and main commercial partner,"" they wrote. ""Chinese entities are, in one way or another, involved with roughly 90% of North Korean trade. This affords China an unparalleled opportunity to assert its influence with the regime.""The clear message: If you support North Korea's regime economically, we'll hurt you economically in return. It's a Trumpian twist on Von Clausewitz's famous dictum about war and politics: ""(A trade) war is the continuation of politics by other means.""As we've said before, we take a back seat to no one in advocating on behalf of free trade. But when one side routinely and systematically steals hundreds of billions of dollars worth of intellectual property, that's no longer free trade. It's piracy.More to the point, in this case the country that is cheating is also supporting a rogue regime that has threatened us and our allies in Japan and South Korea repeatedly with nuclear weapons.""China has long supplied more than 90% of the North's energy needs, and vast quantities of food and other assistance to sustain Pyongyang's gulag,"" wrote former Ambassador to the U.N. John Bolton in The Hill. ""China has also expended enormous political and diplomatic energy, costing it precious international credibility, to protect the North's erratic regime.""North Korea's nuclear blackmail, aided by China's patronage, is not acceptable. If it takes trade sanctions to get China's diplomatic attention, so be it. It's time that China's charade over its support of North Korea comes to an end.RELATED:North Korea's Nuclear Threat To The U.S. Is Real — And China's Largely To Blame  Trump Just Got China, Russia And The U.N. To Take North Korea's Nuke Threat Seriously No, North Korea's Nuclear Threat Isn't Fake News

198,KIM,"Kim's Nukes: The threat of a North Korean nuclear weapon that could reach the U.S. is real, a new report suggests. Those who think this is just Trumpian saber-rattling haven't been paying attention for the last 65 years.Kim Jong-un's military scientists have figured out how to produce a small enough nuclear warhead to fit on long-distance missiles, such as the ones North Korea has recently tested. Kim will soon have the means for nuclear blackmail of the U.S., Japan and, of course, South Korea. Indeed, he is already threatening Guam with missile attacks, prompting the U.S. Air Force to deploy two B-1B bombers from Guam in a joint exercise with South Korea and Japan.So, no, it's no idle threat.As The Washington Post has reported, ""The (intelligence community) assess North Korea has produced nuclear weapons for ballistic missile delivery, to include delivery by ICBM-class missiles.""In addition, the Post noted, U.S. intelligence agencies ""calculated last month that up to 60 nuclear weapons are now controlled by North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.""Maybe the left — who have savagely criticized Trump for saying the U.S. would respond with ""fire and fury like the world has never seen"" to further nuclear provocations from North Korea — could stop their reflexive Trump-hate for a minute to contemplate what a madman having a nuke that can reach the U.S. would mean.Given the growing danger North Korea presents, Trump's remarks were entirely responsible.""What the president is doing is sending a strong message to North Korea in language that Kim Jong-un can understand, because he doesn't seem to understand diplomatic language,"" Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said.That's an understatement. Like his father and grandfather before him, Kim is a hereditary ruler who reigns by terror and brutal repression. Americans may not realize it, but technically we remain in a state of war with North Korea that never officially ended even though the shooting did.And, as American Thinker's Thomas Lifson reminds us, Trump may be playing a broader, more-sophisticated game than the left-leaning foreign policy wonks think.""Keep in mind that Iran's mullahs are the other audience Trump is addressing,"" Lifson wrote. ""They are sending billions of dollars a year to Kim in order to get help with their nuclear arsenal. Every move the president makes, every word he speaks, is also directed at them.""Moreover, it's unseemly to blame Trump for a problem he didn't cause but now seems ready to solve.Bill Clinton, faced with North Korea's burgeoning nuclear program in the 1990s, used former President Jimmy Carter's help to sign a phony deal with Kim Jong-il to end North Korea's nuke development in exchange for plentiful aid. North Korea got the aid, but never stopped developing nukes.President Bush included North Korea, Iran and Iraq in his ""Axis of Evil"" and subsequently revealed that North Korea was developing a nuclear bomb. Yet despite another agreement with North Korea in 2005, which included more economic and energy aid, by 2006 North Korea was again developing a nuclear weapon.As for President Obama, he did next to nothing about North Korea. In 2012, the U.S. once again gave North Korea aid for stopping its nuclear program. And, once again, it got the aid, but continued developing nuclear weapons. Obama's Six-Party talks, which were supposed to bring North Korea to the negotiating table and end the threat, were a complete failure.See the pattern? Since at least the early 1990s, presidents have kicked the nuclear can way down the road, and now we're running out of road. Trump inherited this mess. Now he's dealing with it.In a little over six months in office, he's put China on notice that he holds them largely responsible for letting this problem with their No. 1 client state fester. He's made clear to our allies in the region that he's eager to help protect them from North Korea's nuclear threats. He's twisted the arm of the U.N. Security Council to get more than a billion dollars of sanctions imposed on North Korea. And he's made extremely clear rhetorically to the deranged but crafty Kim that his nuclear threats won't be tolerated.These aren't off-the-cuff moves, but a strategy to deal with a so-far intractable, and dangerous, problem. We'll see if it works. How will we know if it does? Our friends in the left-leaning mainstream media will stop reporting on it.RELATED:North Korea's Nuclear Threat To The U.S. Is Real — And China's Largely To Blame Don't Look Now, But Trump Just Got China, Russia And The U.N.

199,KIM,"Nuclear Threat: At the same time that new polls show Donald Trump slumping in favorability, he manages to notch yet another big win that barely gets noticed by the big media: On Saturday, the U.N. Security Council voted new sanctions on emerging nuclear threat North Korea. And, unlike past efforts, both China and Russia went along.The unanimous vote to impose sanctions against North Korea for its recent intercontinental ballistic missile tests, including one just last week, followed a week of pressure by Trump on both North Korea and its main allies, China and Russia.Last Wednesday, Trump signed a bill that imposes penalties on North Korea's shipping industry, along with new sanctions on Russia's intelligence agencies for their meddling in the U.S. election last year. And Trump recently also got the EU to go along with other sanctions against Russia for its interference in eastern Ukraine.Meanwhile, Trump also ratcheted up his war of words, via Twitter of course, against China.A little over a week ago, Trump double-tweeted: ""I am very disappointed in China. Our foolish past leaders have allowed them to make hundreds of billions of dollars a year in trade, yet...""And, ""...they do NOTHING for us with North Korea, just talk. We will no longer allow this to continue. China could easily solve this problem!""Of course, it was treated as just more crude bombast from an out-of-control president. Except, it seems to have worked.Last Friday, the U.S. delivered a proposal to the U.N. Security Council seeking that organization's approval for a further crackdown on Kim Jong-un's hellish authoritarian state, which may soon have a nuclear weapon that can reach the U.S. mainland.And on Saturday, Trump was handed a 15-0 victory by the Security Council.It's no secret how Trump did it. To show our potential foes he means business, he threatened or actually imposed sanctions on a number of countries. We know, that's a rather blunt diplomatic instrument. But it seems to have worked. China, Russia and the rest of the Security Council are — finally — taking the North Korean threat seriously.Meanwhile, it's important to be clear on one thing: North Korea, long treated as a joke, isn't one. It is a very real, and serious, threat to close U.S. allies such as South Korea and Japan, but more importantly to us. It should have never been allowed to get this far with its nuclear program, but thanks to the failure of presidents from both parties since 1992 to address it, we now face a critical dilemma: Either let North Korea finish developing its weapon of mass destruction, or stop it, here and now.It looks like the Trump administration has opted for the latter choice — a brave stand and a reversal of previous neglect of the problem. Last weekend, National Security Advisor H.R. McMaster said it was ""impossible to overstate"" the danger of North Korea, and emphasized that ""we have to provide all options"" to Trump — including a military option — to end the threat.We don't know if this will work to bring the unpredictable regime of Kim Jong-un to the table for talks on ending North Korea's destabilizing and dangerous nuclear program. But it shows a deftness by Trump that few, if any, in the mainstream media will be ready to acknowledge.With the media focusing nonstop on the phony Russian influence story, last month's IBD/TIPP Poll's ""U.S. Standing In The World"" index dropped 7.5% to 37.2, the low for Trump's presidency. Sadly, amid the din of sensational anti-Trump coverage, news of real triumphs — like the diplomatic win over North Korea — doesn't get heard.""This is a major diplomatic victory for the Trump Administration,"" the American Greatness blog noted.""The president should not squander this moment.""We agree. And, regardless of whether the media recognize it or not, an American president is finally showing he's not content with kicking the nuclear can down the road. It's about time.RELATED:North Korea's Nuclear Threat To The U.S. Is Real — And China's Largely To Blame After Trump's Syrian Attack, China Suddenly Gets Very Concerned About North Korea's Nukes Obama's Iran Nuclear Deal Threatens The U.S. — Trump Should Pull Out

""While the timing of larger deals may be more difficult to forecast, we believe the pipeline remains healthy and opportunities that were missed during the quarter should close during the next few quarters.""Tableau, meanwhile, missed with its Q3 revenue and with its Q4 guidance, which the company lowered.""DATA reported disappointing F3Q license business due to yet another quarter of lackluster sales execution in its large deal activity,"" Brean Capital analyst Yun Kim wrote in a research note.

201,KIM,"North Korea is suffering from another natural disaster, which seems to have been an almost annual event in the country's 68-year history. Floods have devastated parts of the North, displacing some 70,000 residents. The United Nations is seeking nearly $30 million to aid Pyongyang.Alas, such tragedy is nothing new for the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. Last year the DPRK claimed ""the worst drought in 100 years."" The latter might have been true, but Pyongyang oft has exaggerated its needs to win more foreign aid.Still, North Koreans have paid a high price for their government's sins: Between 1995 and 1997, several hundred thousand — and conceivably as many as two million — people died from famine. Alas, their government was more responsible than nature for that horror.Almost every ""natural"" crisis in North Korea is exacerbated by the ruling regime's totalitarian economic and political policies. Collectivism makes overall prosperity nearly impossible and sharply restricts food output. At least the Kim regime's increasing acceptance of limited markets in both agricultural production and distribution makes a disaster like that of two decades ago less likely.Equally harmful is the diversion of scarce resources into Pyongyang's oversize military and active missile and nuclear programs. Additional resources go to enrich the Kims and their loyal retainers and courtiers. The DPRK could afford to purchase more food for its people if they were the regime's first priority.As similar, if not quite so severe, problems recur in the North, South Koreans today are debating aid for the DPRK. For a decade Seoul implemented the ""Sunshine Policy,"" which essentially attempted to purchase Pyongyang's friendship.Between 1995 and 2005 the South gave North Korea nearly $1.2 billion in food and fertilizer alone. Aid peaked at $400 million in 2007. President Lee Myung-bak finally cut off most support after North Korea sank a submarine and bombarded an island in 2010.The U.S. provided a similar amount of aid between 1995 and 2005 in food, medicine and energy. Like the South, Washington also ended the transfers out of frustration in dealing with the DPRK.Unsurprisingly, South Koreans are skeptical of new aid proposals. Polls show that a majority of the ROK population opposes flood assistance. People believe Seoul should tighten sanctions against the North rather than ease the economic burden on the Kim Jong Un regime.Although refusing to help seems harsh, the Kim dynasty's behavior leaves little choice. The Republic of Korea ""is worried that the North may use the aid from the South to develop its nuclear and missile programs further,"" explained Choi young-il of Kyunghee University.In the past Pyongyang diverted aid to favored factions and sold donated food on the domestic black market as well as in China. Even with better accountability, assistance would strengthen the regime. Relieving the DPRK of responsibility for feeding its people would leave more resources available for military purposes.Of course, such assistance is unlikely to make or break the Kim regime, especially given substantial Chinese backing for Pyongyang. Both the PRC and North appear prepared to do whatever is necessary to preserve the DPRK.In that case, why provide another opportunity for North Korea to manipulate gullible but well-intentioned neighbors? And if Beijing seems determined to keep the North afloat, let the Chinese pay the entire bill for the Kim dynasty's survival.However, government-to-government aid is not the only option. The South Korean NGO Council, made up of 59 private groups, announced plans to step in. The Korea Council for Reconciliation and Cooperation intends to send children's clothes, which, the group argued, could not be diverted to other uses by the North.Even private assistance can help sustain the regime in Pyongyang, but such aid does not help legitimize Kim's rule. Moreover, some organizations, such as the Eugene Bell Foundation, which operates in both the U.S. and ROK, have managed to benefit ill North Koreans rather than influential apparatchiks.Refusing official government assistance does not require attempting to isolate the DPRK. The North's system shows no signs of disintegration, despite high-level defections and executions, and may survive for years more. With the regime obviously committed to developing intercontinental missiles and nuclear weapons, the U.S. can ill afford to continue ignoring Pyongyang, aid or no aid.But governments should refuse to treat the North's self-inflicted wounds, including its many ""natural"" disasters. Responsibility should be placed squarely on the Kim regime and its Chinese patron. The West should avoid helping to sustain this most malignant system.

202,KIM,"Countless cable news programs, newspaper op-ed pieces, and blogs have devoted thousands of words and hours to better understand the phenomenon that is the Donald Trump presidential campaign. Mr. Trump has been described along a continuum from a highly successful, aggressive businessman to a narcissistic demagogue with little interest in anyone but himself.The Trump public persona has provided moments that support the description of him as a self-serving narcissist incapable of showing empathy for others, and who viciously attacks those who would oppose him and his candidacy.Arguments against this characterization are hampered by the constant emergence of misogynistic comments, accusations of sexual assault, claims of unethical business practices, and a childlike demeanor during the two most recent presidential debates (e.g., fidgeting, interrupting, shouting, invading personal space).As he strives to obtain the most powerful position in the free world, one must ask the question: How will this saga end?Here are some possibilities:1. Trump wins the general election and assumes the presidency on Jan. 20, 2017 In the event that Donald J. Trump becomes the 45th President of the United States, most experts will tell you that the results are simply unpredictable. Earlier reports suggested that a Trump Cabinet would consist of members of the private sector with whom he has worked, as well as members of Congress who maintain their support for this candidate.The operational effectiveness of a Trump presidency would depend on his successful transition into the office (including the limitations and nuances that it requires) as well as the partisan makeup of the House and Senate following the November election cycle.Additionally, ""fences would need to be mended"" because of the rancorous nature of this election cycle and the sociopolitical impact across the country.Business experts also project uncertainty in the event that Trump is elected. At best, they can make an educated guess as to how U.S. and world financial markets would respond. There is an old saying that ""the market hates uncertainty."" For that reason, a Hillary win would mean ""business as usual.""Yet if Trump wins, that would be a surprise. The market doesn't usually react well to surprises. We can see an analogous situation perhaps in Brexit. All the polls and experts leaned toward Britain staying in the EU. The market digested that expectation. When, instead, the Brexit vote won, it took the market off-guard. It created a new uncertainty.And the stock market sold off hard, especially British banks such as Barclays, which fell 21% in a day. The British pound also fell. The stock market eventually rebounded; the pound is still down. In fact, as of this writing, the trade-weighted BOE index was down 15% since Brexit.With a Trump win, experts would expect to see some volatility at least in the near-term as the market digests what a Trump presidency means.2. Trump loses the general election and reels from his massive ""narcissistic injury,"" disappearing from the public eyeAnother outcome for Trump can be projected based on the hypothesis that his public behavior is the sum result of a form of vulnerable narcissism which has been actively protecting an underlying fragile sense of self through compensating acts such as lashing out at others, claiming superiority in light of conflicting evidence, and seeking the adulation of his followers.In this scenario, there is the possibility that the psychological mechanisms, by which he has girded himself against criticism, collapse under the weight of the massive ""narcissistic injury"" that losing the general election — to a woman — might produce.For example, David Brooks recently suggested in a New York Times piece that Trump's life after an election loss may ""look superficially successful and profoundly miserable"" and that ""none of us would want to live in the howling wilderness of his own solitude, no matter how thick the gilding.""This possibility actually casts Mr. Trump in a sympathetic light and one that offers hope that the proper interventions could change his personal and worldviews.If the ever-present stream of accusations, lawsuits, and potential criminal proceedings continue well beyond an election loss, Mr. Trump may disappear from the public eye in much the same way that Bill Cosby has, due to the revelations made late in his career. 3. Trump loses the general election and disputes the resultsThis is almost certainly a possibility if Trump loses the general election. We have seen this candidate dispute (or dubiously claim victory) following the presentation of poll numbers, debate results (both primary and presidential), news reports, and numerous official documents discounting his claims.One could imagine a situation similar to that which occurred in the 2000 Bush/Gore general election in which the official results were unknown for weeks. Presumably, any dispute by Trump would only hold merit if the results were close enough for there to be a question of the validity of the vote.That being said, Mr. Trump's defenses against ego injury have withstood scrutiny as he has flirted with foreign dictatorial leaders such as Kim Jong-un and Vladimir Putin. As such, there is no predicting what form his protest might assume.4. Trump loses the general election and leverages his time in the national spotlight to rebrand himselfWe live in a society infused by reality TV. Mr. Trump enhanced his international fame with his role on ""The Apprentice"" and much of the public persona we have seen on the campaign trail was forecast during episodes of his reality TV show.Our society has also shown the tendency to forgive and to allow for the resurrection of celebrity identities. If Mr. Trump survives the onslaught of sexual assault and ethical misconduct allegations, one can imagine a re-emergence of ""The Donald"" in some form of public entertainment. The large number of supporters who maintain their loyalty to this day supports the possibility of ""rebranding"" and such a re-emergence would aid Mr. Trump in keeping his vulnerable ego intact.On Nov. 9, we will begin to see how the sociopolitical, economic, and psychological climates respond to the new president — and loser.

203,KIM,"Smart ETF investors are asking a lot of questions as the year winds down.Among them: Is the seven-year bull market about to come to an end? And how healthy, really, is the U.S. economy? And will the search for yield, a common theme in 2016, spill over into the fourth quarter and beyond?To get a bead on the best ETFs to invest in, IBD talked to some ETF providers and investment managers to get their take on the economy, their investment outlook and which exchange traded funds could be ready to kick into gear in the coming months.Brock Moseley, founding partner of Los Angeles-based Miracle Mile Advisors, has about $650 million in assets under management. He has scaled back his exposure to U.S.-centric holdings over the past year, from about 75% to 50%. The other half is focused on Europe and emerging markets.That said, he still sees value in the industrial sector because ""it's one of the few sectors that hasn't fully recovered yet from pre-financial crisis highs.""He mentioned First Trust Industrials/Producer Durables AlphaDEX (FXR). The fund selects its holdings by ranking industrial stocks in the Russell 1000 by growth and value factors. Despite being overweight to airlines, the fund is still outperforming the broader industrial sector, according to Moseley.Moseley likes the ETF's potential for continued outperformance because of the fund's exposure to aerospace and defense firms.Industrial Select Sector SPDR (XLI) also gives exposure to the broader industrial sector, although, according to Moseley, ""it's a bit top-heavy with its stock selection. The top five holdings recently made up 30% of the ETF.""Being in the S&P 500 was a good play over the past seven years, but we're looking globally for value now,"" he said.For investors who embrace a declining euro/stronger U.S. dollar scenario, Moseley mentioned iShares Currency Hedged MSCI Eurozone (HEZU), which invests in eurozone firms and does well when the euro is falling against the dollar.Moseley mentioned iShares Edge MSCI Minimum Volatility EAFE (EFAV) which, as the name suggests, holds names in foreign developed markets with lower-volatility characteristics.Phil Blancato, CEO and president of Ladenburg Thalmann Asset Management, has more than $2 billion in assets under management.He calls the current environment one of the most challenging he's ever seen in 25 years of money management. ""There are money managers that develop strategies based on economic cycles, and I would argue that there isn't one right now. Others manage money based on the yield curve, and how do you do that when it's in a range we haven't seen before? And then you have an earnings recession for five quarters in a row and the market is at or near all-time highs.""A 5% to 10% pullback in the market wouldn't surprise Blancato at all, but he would use it as a buying opportunity.  He also thinks the hunt for yield -- a big theme in 2016 in the utility, REIT and consumer staple space -- could still work going forward.Some of his favorite sectors include health care, energy and financial.""A gradual rise in interest rates shouldn't have a big impact on credit markets because we're still the best game in town … the only game in town,"" Blancato said. He's not in the recession camp because he thinks the consumer is in pretty good shape with wage growth showing some improvement.The Fed recently decided to stand pat on interest rates. The decision was widely expected, but the FOMC's longer-term rate projections showed an even slower pace of increases. The Fed's recent forecast showed policymakers expect three rate hikes through the end of 2017, down from the five seen at their June meeting. The bottom line is that the Fed thinks it can still be patient in hiking rates over the next couple of years as inflation stays in check.The Fed's stance was music to the stock market's ears on Sept. 21. The Nasdaq composite marked a new all-time closing high on the news.Gary Stroik, chief investment officer at WBI Investments, manages about $2.5 billion. The firm operates a family of 11 ETFs. WBI uses quantitative analysis to guide investment strategy.The consumer-staples, industrials and materials sectors have been rating well lately, with health care, financials and REITs at the bottom. Sentiment is generally positive around the financials these days, Stroik noted. But while rising interest rates are generally good for financials, fundamental headwinds still exist, he added. He cited economic uncertainty, as well as housing affordability and its impact on loan activity.WBI Tactical Rotation (WBIR) was introduced in late July and aims to capitalize on trends uncovered in the firm's quant screens.Kim Arthur, founding partner at Main Management, has about $800 million in assets under management. The Fed's stance a couple of weeks ago that rates will likely be going up at a snail's pace fits into Arthur's thesis that investors' insatiable appetite for yield will continue. On the day of the policy statement, SDPR Utilities (XLU) jumped 2% in heavy volume.Arthur also noted that the health care sector is a great punching bag during election years, which is why iShares Nasdaq Biotech (IBB) is interesting to him. The ETF has rallied nicely off lows, but it's still lagging the S&P 500 badly this year.""Biotech is cheaper than pharma and has 3 times the margin with higher growth rates,"" he said.For ETF investors wanting exposure to the financial sector, he offered up SPDR S&P Bank (KBE), which favors regional banks. ""Financials have basically been flat for the past 10 years,"" he said.And what if the economy performs better than expected in coming months? Rather than target the consumer discretionary or retail sectors, Arthur likes iShares U.S. Home Construction (ITB), which is still selling well below its 2007 high.RELATED:See What Industry Groups Are On The MoveSee The Latest ETF News

204,KIM,"As more people get high, they might not need to get so drunk, and that's bad news for the beverage industry.Far fewer people today admit to smoking pot than admit to drinking. But as others have noted recently, Jack Daniel's maker Brown-Forman (BFB) and Samuel Adams brewer Boston Beer Co. (SAM) have warned about the dangers that marijuana legalization poses to their businesses.Brown-Forman, in its past four annual reports, has cited ""the potential legalization of marijuana use on a more widespread basis within the United States"" as a business risk. Boston Beer, in its past two annual reports, has said that states that have relaxed or are considering relaxing laws around pot usage ""could adversely impact the demand for the company's products.""Now, a new report from Cowen & Co. says those two stocks, along with Constellation Brands (STZ) and Molson Coors (TAP), could be among the most vulnerable if more states — or the nation as a whole — legalize the drug.The research comes as traditional beer giants already struggle to retain market share against an array of craft brewers that have broadened drinkers' palates and made things like tulip glasses and beer with hints of coriander more prevalent in places like, say, sports bars.Beer, in general, has also been losing out to the popularity of spirits, Cowen noted. Millennials have been drinking more flavored liquors like cinnamon whiskey.And in this year's election alone, Massachusetts, Nevada, Maine, Arizona and California will vote on whether to legalize recreational use of marijuana in some form.""Broadening cannabis use seems to be having an impact on alcoholic beverage incidence,"" according to the Cowen report, released last week.The shift to pot and away from alcohol appeared to be more common among men. The report said that ""male alcohol incidence shifted from modest growth to decline"" over the past five years, while cannabis incidence crept up, posing ""negative implications for beer and spirits, in particular whiskey.""Legalization could also mean less wine consumption, which is more common among wealthier households and could pose a threat to Constellation, Cowen said. Constellation's wines include Kim Crawford, Robert Mondavi, Mark West and Toasted Head.""On a total social-lubricant basis (cannabis and alcohol), lower-income consumers are lower-incidence consumers. Interestingly, it would seem that cannabis is in fact having the greatest impact on higher-income alcohol consumption. ... This could have a negative impact on wine consumption, which over-indexes to higher-income consumers,"" the report said.IBD'S TAKE: Anheuser Busch InBev's stock jumped on Thursday, making it one of the few beverage stocks poised for a breakout. Breakouts elsewhere have been fragile. Read this story to see why Apple's breakout is holding up.But Constellation -- which makes Mexican beers Corona, Modelo and Pacifico for the U.S. market -- stands to gain from other demographic trends, Cowen said.""While cannabis use has risen with every major ethnic cohort in the U.S. over both the last 5 and 10 years, Hispanics have been the slowest to adopt cannabis, while their incidence also remains the lowest,"" Cowen's report said.""In contrast, over the last 10 years, Hispanic alcohol incidence has climbed markedly faster than we have seen for other multicultural groups (with the exception of blacks). Notably, despite these strong alcohol gains, there is room to grow, as alcohol incidence remains relatively low.""Shares of Brown-Forman closed up 1.5% in the stock market today but have been below the 50- and 200-day lines since late last month. Boston Beer rose 0.2%, Constellation Brands added 0.1%, Molson Coors gained 1.55%, and Anheuser Busch InBev (BUD) climbed 2.2%.The beneficiaries of pot legalization also include tobacco stocks like Reynolds American (RAI), which could draw pot smokers with its vaping devices, Cowen says.Fast-food chain Jack In The Box (JACK), whose past advertising efforts may or may not have appealed to those in the right state of mind, also has a bunch of its restaurants in pot-friendly states, the investment firm notes.RELATED:The Brews At Constellation Brands Offer Frothy Growth ProspectsInsys Stock Jumps As FDA Approves Appetite-Boosting Cannabis DrugGW Pharma Jumps As Cannabis Drug Treats Severe Epilepsy

205,KIM,"One of the great myths about President Trump is that America's enemies would fear him because he is predictably unpredictable. Trump himself stated during the campaign that he didn't want to spell out general military strategy because he didn't want to warn our enemies. ""Douglas MacArthur, George Patton spinning in their graves when they see the stupidity of our country,"" he stated during one of his debates with Hillary Clinton. And in April 2016, he stated: ""We are totally predictable. We tell everything. We're sending troops? We tell them. We're sending something else? We have a news conference. We have to be unpredictable, and we have to be unpredictable starting now.""Trump, the theory went, would certainly be unpredictable.The theory gained credibility after Trump decided to fire a missile at a Syrian air base in the aftermath of American intelligence reporting that Syrian President Bashar Assad decided to use weapons of mass destruction on Syrian civilians. It seemed he had the capacity to frighten our enemies — you never know what might set him off. That was a good thing: It left those who would challenge us in the dark as to where his triggers would be. If North Korean leader Kim Jong Un were to go too far, he might find himself on the wrong end of a cruise missile.Now, it seems, Trump isn't unpredictable. He's absolutely predictable. He's just unstable.There's a difference between unpredictability and instability. Unpredictability can be strategic. It can allow you to shift your moves in order to throw off your opposition. It means shifting your actual strategy and sticking with that new strategy. It's a key component of any chess game: Do something different and throw your opponent off course.Instability is different. Instability typically manifests as shocking initial action followed by utterly predictable regression to the norm. The unstable people you know may flare up occasionally, but they generally settle down in relatively short order. And we can often predict when  they will become unstable: when they feel threatened, when they have an emotional response to something out of the ordinary.That seems more like Trump.His initial bursts of rage generally peter out until convenience dictates action. If there's any massive blowback at all, he backs off. That's why his treatment of Attorney General Jeff Sessions is actually damaging to America on foreign policy: It leads our enemies to believe they can willfully ignore Trump's initial fulminations and then bet on cooler heads to prevail. It's not a coincidence that Russia and North Korea are gradually upping the ante with Trump in the belief that Trump will talk tough and do little.All of this means that Trump may have to do something truly unpredictable: take a hard stand. On the home front, that means restructuring his administration so that it looks more like a major corporation than a family business, with rules and chains of command. We can hope and pray that retired Gen. John Kelly provides some of that structure. On the foreign policy front, Trump will have to stand behind real consequences for bad actors.If Trump continues to respond to situations with knee-jerk activity followed by grudging acceptance, he won't live up to the promise he made: to unleash hell, in unpredictable but effective fashion, on the enemies of the United States should they violate our interests.

206,KIM,"After insisting that China should ""solve"" the North Korea problem, President Donald Trump appears to have given up. ""While I greatly appreciate the efforts of President Xi & China to help with North Korea, it has not worked out. At least I know China tried,"" he tweeted. Now the issue apparently is back in President Trump's not-so-capable hands.X Unfortunately, the administration really didn't try. Beijing never was going to act just because President Trump wanted it to.Expecting the People's Republic of China to destroy its ally while the U.S. was busy elsewhere in the region seeking to contain Chinese military power, and to do so without receiving anything in return, never was realistic. Unspecified trade concessions simply weren't enough to make a deal.Alas, the administration doesn't have any other good options. Airstrikes might not reach all the facilities and probably would ignite a war, with devastating consequences to everyone involved, most dramatically South Korea.Enhanced sanctions are more likely, including secondary sanctions against Chinese companies and banks. This would risk creating a confrontation with Beijing.Moreover, by shifting the issue from North Korea to the PRC the Trump administration might actually increase Chinese support for the North. Witness the popular rage against South Korea over the THAAD deployment.Although tougher sanctions would impose economic hardship, there is no reason to assume that alone would bring Pyongyang to heel. When I visited the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in June, officials insisted they would stand firm against America's ""hostile policy"" no matter what. While they could be expected to say that, the DPRK did not change policy even in the midst of a horrific famine a couple of decades ago.And so far the PRC appears to value stability above all. If the Kim Jong-un regime appeared in danger of breaking, Beijing might buttress the North rather than risk a collapse, and the violent chaos which could follow.None of this is in the PRC's interest. Instead of acting as bystander if both regional stability and U.S. relations unravel, Beijing should push Washington to engage in serious negotiation with all parties.America's priority should be halting the DPRK's advancing missile and nuclear programs. Thus, Washington should revive the North's proposal for a freeze on its activities in return for an end to annual military exercises between the U.S. and South Korea. The latter agitates North Korean officials, who call them a cover for a possible attack.When I raised this possibility in Pyongyang they dismissed it, saying that the U.S. had rejected their offer. Coming from China and America together, and backed by the threat of joint sanctions, it would be more persuasive.With some breathing space, Washington could work with the Republic of Korea and Japan to develop a big offer in return for denuclearization, and with Beijing to win the latter's endorsement. The package would have to emphasize security — the DPRK's rulers watched the war in Libya and aren't impressed with verbal assurances like those offered by Secretary of State Rex Tillerson.China should offer its support, as well as whatever assistance and assurances would encourage Pyongyang's acceptance. The objective is to denuclearize the peninsula peacefully through negotiation.In return, the PRC would agree to back the effort with the threat of enforcing its own and U.S. sanctions, so long as its other interests were respected. That would include allied assistance for China if the result was a violent DPRK collapse.Moreover, the U.S. should offer assurances that reunification would not put Beijing at a geopolitical disadvantage: In particular, all American military forces should go home in the event of unification. Seoul should consider a declaration of military neutrality for a unified peninsula.Even this approach has critics. Some aver the importance of regular maneuvers for combat effectiveness, but the ROK should be taking ever more responsibility for its own defense. Others fear the agreement would not be enforceable, but that would be an issue for any negotiated settlement.Finally, such an agreement would leave human rights at risk. However, a North Korea holding tightly to its nuclear weapons is unlikely to relax political controls.President Trump raised the potential of a China-U.S. deal over North Korea. Beijing shouldn't let him drop the issue without trying to reach an agreement. The situation in the North is likely to worsen, while the opportunities to solve it peacefully are likely to shrink. Action is needed now.
"
207,KIM,"North Korea recently test-launched a long-range missile capable of reaching Alaska.When North Korea eventually builds a missile capable of reaching the U.S. mainland, it will double down on its well-known shakedown of feigning indifference to American deterrence while promising to take out Los Angeles, San Francisco or Seattle unless massive aid is delivered to Pyongyang.Kim Jong-un rightly assumes that wealthy Western nations would prefer to pay bribe money than suffer the loss of a city — and that they have plenty of cash for such concessions. He is right that the medicine of taking out Kim's missiles is considered by Western strategists to be even worse than the disease of living with a lunatic regime that has nukes.No wonder that the Clinton, Bush and Obama administrations had few answers to serial North Korean lying and deceit about its nuclear intentions.Sanctions were eventually dropped or watered down either on reports of the mass starvation of innocent North Korean civilians or on false promises of better North Korean behavior.China publicly promised to help rein in its unhinged client while privately doing nothing. Apparently, Beijing found a rabid North Korean government useful in bothering rivals such as the Japanese and South Koreans while keeping the U.S. off balance in Asia and the Pacific. The dynamic economies and pacifism of Japan, South Korea and Taiwan were taken for granted by China as easy targets for coercion and blackmail.Russia is never any help. Under President Vladimir Putin, Russian foreign policy is reductive: Whatever causes the United States and its allies a major headache is by definition welcomed.There seems to be zero chance of a North Korean coup or a Chinese intervention to remove Kim. The brainwashed North Korean population is cut off from global news and knows nothing other than three generations of Kim family dictators. The military junta that surrounds Kim is likely as aggressive as its leader. These functionaries see his survival as the only guarantee of their own privilege and influence.A preemptory strike might not get all of North Korea's nuclear missiles and could prompt a conventional response that would wreck nearby Seoul — a scenario about which North Korea openly brags.Pyongyang believes that only the Israelis are wild enough to preempt and bomb neighboring nuclear facilities, as they did in 1981 against Iraq and again in 2007 against Syria. And yet Israel attacked only because neither Iraq nor Syria had created deterrence by possession of a single deliverable nuclear weapon.What are the bad choices for the Western alliance in defanging North Korea before it miscalculates and sends a missile that prompts a war?Sanctions have in the past crippled Pyongyang. But this time around they should not be lifted despite the prospect of ensuing chaos in North Korea. It may be tragic that a captive population suffers for the lunacy of its leader, but such misery is still preferable to an all-out war.Nor should China be exempt from accompanying stiff trade restrictions. Almost every weapon component in the hands of North Korea either came directly from China or was purchased by cash earned through Chinese trade and remittances. Certainly, China would not allow South Korea to send missiles its way along with promises of nuking Beijing while the U.S. kept still about the provocation.Australia, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and the U.S. need to coordinate a massive missile defense project aimed at ending North Korean assumptions that even one of its missiles has a chance to reach its intended target. Such a Marshall Plan-like investment would also send a message to China that its own nuclear deterrent could be compromised and nullified by the defensive efforts of its immediate neighbors. China has made life difficult for the U.S. and its Asian allies, and it should learn that the allies could make things even more problematic for China.None of our allies in Asia and the Pacific wish to develop nuclear weapons, both for historic and economic reasons. But the United States should inform Russia and China that allied democracies in the region may choose to develop a nuclear deterrent to stop North Korean antics — a development that would prove disastrous to both Russian and Chinese strategic planning.Asia is already a dangerous place, with both Indian and Pakistani nuclear missiles and a likely nuclear Iran in the not-so-distant future. Do Moscow and Beijing wish to add three or four more nuclear powers near their borders?The current danger is not just limited to North Korea. Iran, a beneficiary of North Korean nuclear assistance, is watching how far Kim can go. It will certainly make the necessary strategic adjustments if he succeeds in shaking down the Western world.We are nearing an existential showdown, as failed efforts at bribery and appeasement have run their course.Only a tough, messy confrontation now can prevent a disastrous war later on.
"
208,KIM,"Missile Defense: North Korea's successful test of an intercontinental ballistic missile has everyone talking about missile defense, and the fact that the U.S. doesn't seem to have one that could stop a madman like Kim Jong-un. You can blame anti-missile-defense Democrats for this.Shortly after the North Korea test, Politico ran an article pointing out that ""the Pentagon and its contractors still haven't figured out how to reliably shoot down an intercontinental ballistic missile."" The Washington Post noted that after spending tens of billions of dollars, the system ""has never faced combat or been fully tested.""The Missile Defense Agency did in late May destroy a mock ICBM launched from the Marshall Islands with an interceptor launched from the Vandenberg Air Force B Base in California. But the system has failed in previous heavily scripted attempts.And MDA director Vice Admiral James Syring told a House committee recently that ""I would not say we are comfortably ahead of the threat. I would say we are addressing the threat.""What no one commenting on this troubling gap mentions is why it is there at all.News accounts are quick to point out that $189.7 billion has been spent on missile defense since President Reagan announced his vision in 1983, which is supposed to seem like a lot of money spent for little return. But that doesn't tell the whole story.The truth is that the country would be well ahead of where we are now on missile defense if Democrats — including, most recently, President Obama — hadn't spent the past 30 years trying to derail the project.As soon as Reagan announced his Strategic Defense Initiative, Democrats blasted it as a waste of money and mocked it as a ""Star Wars"" fantasy.When Bill Clinton took office, one of the first things he did was cancel the missile defense program he inherited from George H.W. Bush to instead focus on theater defenses. And over the course of his two terms in office, Clinton ""continually delayed progress on development and deploying a national missile defense system,"" according to a Heritage Foundation report in September 2000, which called his record ""perhaps the single greatest national security failure of his administration.""In 2001, George W. Bush reversed course and started investing again in missile defense. In fact, the MDA's annual budget under Bush more than doubled, after accounting for inflation, from Clinton.But then Obama took office after campaigning on a promise to cut missile defense. In his first year, the MDA's budget was slashed by 13% and over the next seven years it dropped another 7%, in real terms.Like Clinton before him, Obama decided to largely abandon Bush's missile defense program. He canceled the planned deployment of missile interceptors and an advanced radar station in Poland and the Czech Republic to appease Russia. He cut the number of interceptors to be installed in the U.S. from 44 to 30 (he reversed this decision in 2013, after a series of North Korean missile launches). Obama also killed the Multiple Kill Vehicle and stripped funding for two programs designed to destroy a missile in its boost phase.All of this ""cost the nation valuable time and capability when it came to building a comprehensive, layered, ballistic missile defense system,"" a 2016 Heritage report noted.Yet, incredibly, none of the news stories discussing the country's ongoing vulnerability to missile attack bothers to mention any of this.That's not to say that the country would have a foolproof missile shield had Clinton and Obama not shortchanged the program for 16 years. The engineering, science and technology involved is daunting. But there's no doubt we'd have much stronger and more reliable missile defenses than we do now.So let's put blame for the dangerous situation we're in now where it belongs.RELATED:Did Trump Just Save NATO By Shaming It?Trump Should Change U.S. Policy On Nuclear WeaponsToday's Defense Department Lacks Nuclear Weapons Expertise
"
209,KIM,"The Obama administration is debating a declaration of no first use of nuclear weapons. Some Asia specialists fear the resulting impact on North Korea. But dealing with Pyongyang is a reason for Washington to encourage its ally South Korea to go nuclear.Washington has possessed nuclear weapons for more than 70 years. No one doubts that the U.S. would use nukes in its own defense.However, since then Washington has extended a so-called ""nuclear umbrella"" over many of its non-nuclear allies. For instance, the U.S. long has threatened to use nuclear weapons in its NATO allies' defense, though the precise circumstances under which the U.S. would act were not clear. The U.S. also holds, probably, a nuclear umbrella over at least some of its Mideast allies.Northeast Asia is the region where nuclear threats seem greatest. Japan and South Korea are thought to be snuggled beneath America's nuclear umbrella, which has discouraged both from acquiring their own weapons. Other possible claimants include Taiwan and Australia, though, again, no one quite knows what Washington would do when.The ""umbrella"" obviously is defensive, that is, to protect American allies against the first use of nukes. However, Washington also could -- and, it appears, would, if necessary, whatever that might mean -- use nuclear weapons first to stop a conventional attack. While Russia and China might not be particularly friendly with America these days, they aren't likely to attack the Republic of Korea or Japan. More plausible is a North Korean invasion of the ROK.Extended nuclear deterrence always has been risky for the U.S. It means being willing to fight a nuclear war on behalf of others, that is, Americans would risk Washington, D.C., and Los Angeles to, say, defend Berlin and Tokyo.At least bilateral deterrence among great powers tends to be reasonably stable. Dealing with North Korea is potentially more dangerous. Kim Jong Un's judgment and stability are problematic. He might start a war inadvertently.Yet the DPRK eventually may gain the ability to strike the U.S. by developing long-range missiles as well as nuclear weapons. The North isn't likely to attack first, but it still could lay waste to a major U.S. city.Which would be a bad deal indeed. Yet advocates of extended deterrence are criticizing proposals for an American pledge of no first use of nuclear weapons. Writing for NK News, analyst Robert E. McCoy argued: ""It is imperative that Kim Jong Un is made to understand that he faces the destructive power of our entire weapons arsenal at all times when it comes to threatening the U.S. or its allies.""Yet that is precisely the problem. It is one thing for Washington to use nuclear weapons, including pre-emptively, to protect America. It is quite different to do so for allies.Alliances are a means, not an end  -- that is, a mechanism to help defend the U.S. A North Korean attack on South Korea would be awful, a humanitarian tragedy. But American security would not be directly threatened. Certainly there is no threat warranting the risk of nuclear retaliation on the U.S.Of course, those being defended have configured their security policy and force structure in response. But future policy should not be held captive to the past.Washington's chief responsibility should be America's security. Backers of the status quo act like there is no alternative to leaving South Korea (and Japan, which faces a real, though less direct, threat from the DPRK) vulnerable to attack.However, Seoul is well able to deter and defeat the North. The ROK possesses around 40 times the GDP and twice the population of North Korea, as well as a vast technological lead and an extensive international support network. Japan, which long possessed the world's second-largest economy, also could do far more.The South is capable of developing nuclear weapons. Indeed, polls show public support for such an option today. Opposition to nuclear weapons is stronger in Japan, but an ROK weapon would put enormous pressure on Tokyo to conform.Obviously, there are plenty of good reasons to oppose proliferation, even among friends. However, the current system is entangling Washington in the middle of other nations' potential conflicts. The result is to make America less secure.Dealing with nuclear weapons is never easy. Washington's best alternative may be to withdraw from Northeast Asia's nuclear imbroglio. Then America's allies could engage in containment and deterrence, just as America did for them for so many years.

210,KIM," Let's get down to business. The casting kerfuffle over Disney's live-action remake of the 1998 animated hit ""Mulan"" brings honor to none. It's a politically correct tempest in a Chinese teapot.More than 90,000 angry activists have now signed a petition ""to tell Disney that we demand to see them cast an Asian Mulan."" The lead instigator, Michigan children's librarian Natalie Molnar, vented against the practice of ""whitewashing"" -- that is, employing ""white Caucasian actors and actresses in roles originally meant to be characters of color.""Extreme racial and ethnic bean-counting is necessary, even in the remake of a cartoon, the petitioners argue, because ""children benefit from finding themselves represented in fiction.""Skin color-based casting entitlements and quotas: ""for the children."" Of course.Once again, privileged progressives demonstrate how arbitrary, capricious and ridiculous militant identity politics can be. Last year, Asian-American leftists attacked director Cameron Crowe for casting Emma Stone as a mixed-race character in the romantic comedy ""Aloha."" It didn't matter whether Stone pulled off the role. The protesters were too busy administering racial and ethnic litmus tests for employment in the entertainment industry.This year, grievance-mongers moaned about the casting of mixed-race actress Zoe Saldana as black jazz legend Nina Simone and white actress Scarlett Johansson as a Japanese Manga cartoon figure.In social justice land, movie-making isn't about casting the most talented actors, regardless of race or ethnicity. Movie-making isn't about entertaining customers or making money. Nope.Movie-making is a never-ending exercise in radical multiculturalism and identity apartheid.The diversity cops maintain that only the right kind of mixed-race stars should play mixed-race characters. Only the right kind of black actresses should win black roles. And only Asians should be cast in ""Mulan"" to maintain ethnic realism.But there's no rhyme, reason or logic in their demands for authenticity. Take ""Mulan."" The original movie was riddled with historical inaccuracies. Based on the legend of teenage warrior Hua Mulan popularized in an ancient Chinese ballad, the heroine disguises herself as a man to take the place of her elderly father in battle -- ""to defeat the Huns,"" as the song from the movie goes.But the Huns were thousands of miles away sacking Rome and Western Europe. The ""Huns"" who attacked the legendary Mulan in 6th-century China were mostly likely related to the central Asian Xiongnu tribe in what became Mongolia, which warred with the Han dynasty in the 3rd century. Movie historian Alex von Tunzelmann notes ""that was at least a couple [of] hundred of years before Mulan's time, and in any case the link between the Xiongnu and the Huns is in dispute.""Unfortunately for social justice warriors, ""Let's get down to business/to defeat the nomadic tribe that was possibly the Xiongnu in the region of Mongolia before it was known as Mongolia"" just doesn't have the same ring as the Disney tune that's still stuck in my head after 18 years.Weirdly, the Asian-American liberal entertainment lobby didn't have a problem with Filipina musical theater star/actress Lea Salonga singing Chinese Mulan's parts in the original movie. Which raises my still-unanswered question in these well-worn casting wars:Why is it that the self-appointed Definers of racial and ethnic Authenticity get to pick and choose which historical inaccuracies and inconsistencies to protest or ignore?Strangely, some of the minority actors and actresses in the ""People of Color"" tribe that the Demand-y Demanders want to cast in ""Mulan"" are as authentically Asian as Mulan's Eddie Murphy-voiced annoying dragon sidekick, Mu Shu.Oliver S. Wang, an L.A.-based culture writer, tweeted that ""The Rock"" (Canadian-American actor Dwayne Johnson of Samoan and Black Nova Scotian heritage) should play the ""Mongol villain.""How do you say ""Huh???"" in Chinese?Heidi Yeung, editor for a South China Morning Post-owned website, is pushing for Korean-American Daniel Dae Kim to play the villainous role of Shan Yu -- in part because he has ""almost identical cheekbones to the animated character."" Diversity!Additionally, she wants Japanese-American George Takei to play the Chinese Emperor and another Korean American, Margaret Cho, to play the Chinese matchmaker.So because the diversity-mongers' choices look more vaguely Asian-ish, never mind the vast differences between their nationalities and heritages, they trump other non-Asian actors and actresses who must all step aside and bow down to the gods of ethnic faux-thenticity.If ""whitewash"" is the problem, why is fake yellow wash the solution?

211,KIM,"Anyone contemplating this year's appalling presidential campaign may be tempted to explain what's happening by applying the third rule of bureaucratic organizations, enunciated by the late poet and definitive scholar of Soviet terrorism Robert Conquest.""The behavior of any bureaucratic organization,"" Conquest explained, ""can best be understood by assuming that it is controlled by a secret cabal of its enemies.""The Republican and Democratic parties aren't exactly bureaucratic organizations; they just aspire to be. But their behavior this year certainly looks like it might have been scripted by their fervent foes.Is it known, for example, just who whispered in Donald Trump's ear that this was a good year to run for president? He's been mulling it before, and accumulating national fame as a reality TV star.In the process, to be fair, he's had more genuine accomplishments than, say, Kim Kardashian. Moving the real estate family business from the outer boroughs, in a decade when they were losing a million people, and into Manhattan, just as prices there touched rock bottom, was a stroke of genius. Shrewd!Shrewd also were Trump's bombastic phrasings of his departures from Republican orthodoxy on immigration and trade. Did a secret cabal of Republicans' enemies put into his head the notion that making one outrageous statement after another could give him more airtime than the other 16 Republican candidates put together? If so, it worked.The fact is that there was no more compelling reason for Trump to run than there was in 2000 or 2008. The word around Palm Beach is that he expected his campaign to be a lark and to add value to the Trump brand. But to his surprise, the dog caught the car.The vehicle could end up in the ditch. The Republican Party may face more problems if Trump wins than if he loses. In the latter case it adapts to its gains among the less educated and losses among the highly educated -- a process ongoing for two decades.If he wins he'd be called on to deliver on his promises on trade and immigration. A president can impose tariffs -- and provoke a financial crisis. A president can build a border wall and Congress can require employers to use e-Verify. Experience with similar measures in Arizona suggests the effects will be real, but marginal. Frustrating!One of the mysteries of the campaign, unexplored by the reliably anti-Republican but not reliably pro-Democratic mainstream media, is why Trump, who turned 70 in June, and Clinton, who turns 69 next month, decided to run at their ages. As Trump has noted, he could have had a comfortable life otherwise; so could Clinton.The track record of presidents elected at about that age is mixed. Ronald Reagan showed that a septuagenarian, even after suffering a serious gunshot wound, could be an effective president. The example of William Henry Harrison, who took office at 68 and died a month later, is less encouraging.Clinton's candidacy essentially squelched the chances of a generation of younger Democrats, who might have advanced more serious future-oriented policies than the unachievable promises of free health care and free college that she copied from the 74-year-old socialist Bernie Sanders. No other Democrat would be toting the barrage of a private email system and a pay-for-play operation with her or his family foundation.If it's true, as many political observers think and as primary season polls suggested, that a Marco Rubio or a Ted Cruz would be leading Clinton in polls now by something like 50% to 43%, it's equally plausible that an Amy Klobuchar or a Sherrod Brown (to name two plausible Democrats) would be leading Rubio or Cruz and with significantly more than Clinton's current 42%. Clinton, like Trump, has her enthusiasts (most over 50 in both cases), but young women are clearly not enraptured by the notion of a female president.And while Clinton must be haunted by the thought that she was almost elected president at age 60 and would have been in the White House the last eight years, that doesn't mean she had to run again. Al Gore has led a lucrative and comfortable life after coming closer than she did. So did Samuel J. Tilden after the 1876 election was stolen from him.The real question about this campaign, which may not be resolved until years after the election, may be which secret cabal of a party's enemies has inflicted more damage on its target.

212,KIM,"Across 25 years and five administrations, we have kicked the North Korean can down the road. We are now out of road.On July 4, North Korea tested an intercontinental ballistic missile apparently capable of hitting the United States. As yet, only Alaska. Soon, every American city.Moreover, Pyongyang claims to have already fitted miniaturized nuclear warheads on intermediate range missiles. Soon, on ICBMs.Secretary of State Rex Tillerson's initial reaction to this game changer was not encouraging. ""Global action is required to stop a global threat,"" he declared.This, in diplo-speak, is a cry for (multilateral) help. Alas, there will be none. Because, while this is indeed a global threat, there is no such thing as global interests. There are individual national interests and they diverge. In this case, radically.Take Russia and China. If there's to be external pressure on North Korea, it would come from them. Will it? On Tuesday, they issued a joint statement proposing a deal: North Korea freezes nuclear and missile testing in return for America abandoning large-scale joint exercises with South Korea.This is a total nonstarter. The exercises have been the backbone of the U.S.-South Korea alliance for half a century. Abandonment would signal the end of an enduring relationship that stabilizes the region and guarantees South Korean independence. In exchange for what?A testing freeze? The offer doesn't even pretend to dismantle North Korea's nuclear program, which has to be our minimal objective. Moreover, we've negotiated multiple freezes over the years with Pyongyang. It has violated every one.The fact that Russia and China would, amid a burning crisis, propose such a dead-on-arrival proposal demonstrates that their real interest is not denuclearization. Their real interest is cutting America down to size by breaking our South Korean alliance and weakening our influence in the Pacific Rim.These are going to be our partners in solving the crisis?And yet, relying on China's good graces appeared to be Donald Trump's first resort for solving North Korea. Until he declared two weeks ago (by tweet, of course) that China had failed. ""At least I know China tried!"" he added.They did? Trump himself tweeted out on Wednesday that Chinese trade with North Korea increased by almost 40% in the first quarter, forcing him to acknowledge that the Chinese haven't been helping.Indeed not. The latest North Korean missile is menacing not just because of its 4,000-mile range, but because it is road mobile. And the transporter comes from China.In the calculus of nuclear deterrence, mobility guarantees inviolability. (The enemy cannot find, and therefore cannot pre-empt, a mobile missile.) It's a huge step forward for Pyongyang. Supplied by Beijing.How many times must we be taught that Beijing does not share our view of denuclearizing North Korea? It prefers a divided peninsula, i.e., sustaining its client state as a guarantee against a unified Korea (possibly nuclear) allied with the West and sitting on its border.Nukes assure regime survival. That's why the Kims have so single-mindedly pursued them. The lessons are clear. Saddam Hussein, no nukes: hanged. Moammar Gadhafi, gave up his nuclear program: killed by his own people. The Kim dynasty, possessing an arsenal of 10-16 bombs: untouched, soon untouchable.What are our choices? Trump has threatened that if China doesn't help we'll have to go it alone. If so, the choice is binary: acquiescence or war.War is almost unthinkable, given the proximity of the Demilitarized Zone to the 10 million people of Seoul. A mere conventional war would be devastating. And could rapidly go nuclear.Acquiescence is not unthinkable. After all, we did it when China went nuclear under Mao Zedong, whose regime promptly went insane under the Cultural Revolution.The hope for a third alternative, getting China to do the dirty work, is mostly wishful thinking. There's talk of sanctioning other Chinese banks. Will that really change China's strategic thinking? Bourgeois democracies believe that economics supersedes geostrategy. Maybe for us. But for dictatorships? Rarely.If we want to decisively alter the strategic balance, we could return U.S. tactical nukes (withdrawn in 1991) to South Korea. Or we could encourage Japan to build a nuclear deterrent of its own. Nothing would get more quick attention from the Chinese. They would face a radically new strategic dilemma: Is preserving North Korea worth a nuclear Japan?We do have powerful alternatives. But each is dangerous and highly unpredictable. Which is why the most likely ultimate outcome, by far, is acquiescence.RELATED: Why Can't the U.S. Defend Itself Against North Korea Nukes?

213,KIM,"Nuclear Security: The U.S. and the rest of the world are frantically scrambling following North Korea's surprise display of defense prowess by launching a new intercontinental ballistic missile that could hit the mainland U.S. But as we've written in the past, China is North Korea's great enabler and is key to reining in the rogue nation.Without China's support, chances are good that North Korea would have collapsed by now. China claims to fear that such an event would be disastrous, with millions of starving North Koreans crossing its 870-mile border with North Korea and causing chaos and a human disaster of epic proportions.But China's rationale looks thin, at best.As a recent backgrounder from the Council on Foreign Relations notes, ""China provides North Korea with most of its food and energy supplies and accounts for upwards of 90% of North Korea's total trade volume. Conversely, China's purchases from its neighbor include minerals, seafood and manufactured garments. In the first quarter of 2017, China-North Korea trade was up 37.4% from the same period in 2016.""So when China loudly proclaims its innocence and publicly feigns alarm at Kim Jong Un's military antics, Americans are right to see that for what it is: China's effort to keep the entire Korean peninsula from becoming a healthy, independent capitalist democracy, thereby diminishing China's clout in the region and enhancing ours.The fact is, North Korea under the cunning but pathological Kim Jong Un is becoming increasingly provocative. The North, with a population of just over 25 million people, has 1.2 million under arms. It has enormous artillery batteries aimed directly at the South Korean capital of Seoul. It spends most of its money bolstering its military, not feeding its people or building its country. It's a threat on many levels.Now it also has a fast-growing nuclear weapons program, thanks largely to President Obama's decision in 2011 to ease diplomatic pressure on the totalitarian communist nation, a foolish policy of benign diplomatic neglect that only emboldened Kim.No, Obama's not solely to blame. Before him, President Clinton signed a 1994 agreement that was supposed to lead to North Korea ending its nuclear program in exchange for aid and technology, only to discover in 2001 that North Korea began cheating on its agreement shortly after it was signed.But Obama and Clinton never learned their lessons, and these days appeasement of nuclear terrorism seems to be official Democratic Party policy.Tuesday's test of the Hwasong-14 missile, delivered on the Fourth of July, shows that North Korea already can reach much of Alaska and possibly Hawaii with its latest missiles. With a few tweaks, all of the U.S. West Coast will be in play.This is what appeasement brings you. Now it's up to President Trump and Defense Secretary James Mattis to make sure Pyongyang's fondest dream of nuclear terror doesn't become our worst nightmare.Trump understands China's role in all this. On Tuesday, in consecutive tweets, he said the following: ""North Korea has just launched another missile. Does this guy have anything better to do with his life? Hard to believe that South Korea and Japan will put up with this much longer. Perhaps China will put a heavy move on North Korea and end this nonsense once and for all.""Meanwhile, China and Russia pushed a ""joint agreement"" on Tuesday that would call on North Korea to end its missile tests, but the U.S. would have to give up deployment of a missile defense shield in South Korea and end its large-scale military exercises with South Korea.It's hard not to imagine Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping not laughing loudly — off the record, of course — after coming to that ""agreement."" It would significantly weaken the U.S.And Trump's on to it. As he said in a third tweet on Wednesday, ""Trade between China and North Korea grew almost 40% in the first quarter. So much for China working with us — but we had to give it a try!"" He hinted that China may no longer be able to count on U.S. forbearance when it comes to trade.He's right, and once again China has come up far short of its responsibilities on the world stage.We don't know if trade is the ideal way to address China's enabling of North Korea, but at least it would get China's attention. It would also let China know that we have no intention of relinquishing our influence and historical role in the Far East — or of abandoning our allies there.If that fails, a new IBD/TIPP Poll taken just days before the launch shows that nearly four in 10 Americans back military action against North Korea. In a poll a month earlier, the percentage favoring military action was 61% ""if North Korea were to continue its provocations and become a growing threat to our allies and the United States homeland.""At a U.N. Security Council emergency meeting Wednesday called by the U.S.,  U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley let the world know how gravely we view Kim's nuclear provocations. ""The United States is prepared to use the full range of our capabilities to defend ourselves and our allies,"" Haley said. ""One of our capabilities lies with our considerable military forces. We will use them if we must, but we prefer not to have to go in that direction.""Our patience must have limits. A nuclearized North Korea with ICBMs that can reach the U.S. should be a nonstarter. It's a red line. We need to say it clearly, and loudly, to all parties involved, but especially to China.RELATED:Strong Support For Military Action Against Belligerent North Korea — IBD/TIPP PollAfter Trump's Syria Attack, China Suddenly Gets Very Concerned About North Korea's NukesTrump Should Change U.S. Policy On Nuclear Weapons

214,KIM,"Even before North Korea's successful launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of reaching the U.S. mainland, nearly four in 10 backed military action against the rogue communist state, the July IBD/TIPP poll found.When asked about ""military action against North Korea at this time,"" 38% supported it, while 55% opposed. The poll was taken over the last week of June, just days before North Korea's July 4 missile launch.However, when put in the context of continued provocations and threats from North Korea, support for military action skyrockets.In May, the IBD/TIPP poll asked whether those surveyed supported the U.S. ""taking military action if North Korea were to continue its provocations and become a growing threat to our allies and the United States homeland."" Fully 65% said yes, with just 31% saying they opposed military action.The poll was taken more than a month before North Korea's Tuesday launch of a missile capable of reaching the U.S. mainland, the latest and most provocative step yet in the country's drive to develop an intercontinental nuclear missile. The results were restricted to the 86% of those surveyed who said they have been following the North Korea story closely.North Korea leader Kim Jong Un said the launch was a Fourth of July ""gift"" to the Trump administration, promised to ""frequently send big and small gift packages to the Yankees"" to ""demonstrate its mettle to the U.S."" and vowed never to negotiate away his nuclear weapons program.Trump said during a meeting with South Korean president Moon Jae-in last week that ""the era of strategic patience with the North Korean regime has failed.""After the missile launch, U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson urged ""global action"" and called on the U.N. to ""enact stronger measures"" against North Korea, saying that countries that provide economic or military help to the communist country would be deemed as ""aiding and abetting a dangerous regime.""The May IBD/TIPP poll found widespread support for military action against such continued provocations, with 62% of independents and 88% of Republicans backing the move. Among Democrats, support for a military response was 48%, with 50% opposed.That same poll found that 54% approve of Trump's handling of the North Korea situation. Those results were, not surprisingly, highly partisan. While 95% of Republicans approve of Trump in this regard, only 20% of Democrats do. Among independents, 52% approve of how he's been handling the North Korea threat.RELATED:After Trump's Syrian Attack, China Suddenly Gets Very Concerned About North Korea's NukesCharles Krauthammer: With North Korea, We Do Have Cards To PlayNo Government Foreign Aid For North Korea

219,KIM,"Intuit (INTU) stock fell Wednesday after the TurboTax maker late Tuesday gave current-quarter guidance that lagged analysts' expectations. But then, the financial software maker's stock has also fallen the past two Augusts after earnings, in all three cases pulling back at a time when shares were trading near record highs.Many investors, even experienced ones, make the mistake of buying a stock just ahead of the company's earnings report because it's trading near highs and seems to be acting right. That can work out, but earnings can also spark big declines, even in good stocks.IBD'S TAKE: IBD provides an options strategy, found within the weekly Earnings Preview feature, to help investors limit risk around earnings and to capitalize on upside potential, while also reducing the risk of a negative reaction to the report. Investors can instead try weekly or monthly options, if the price is right.Intuit stock fell 3.5% to 109.85 on the stock market today. Shares hit a record high just below 117 last month.The fall from grace follows a pattern. Intuit stock plunged 13% last August, on the day after its earnings report, and it fell 2.6% in August 2014 after earnings, after dropping by as much as 4.3% during that session. (Shares also fell a small fraction after the August 2013 report.)Intuit's fiscal Q4 ended July 31, after tax season, though the company said total TurboTax unit sales rose 12%, outpacing its overall sales growth of 8%, to $754 million. That beat views, as did its earnings per share minus items of 8 cents, swinging from a 5 cent loss in the year-earlier quarter.The company's small-business segment, mostly its QuickBooks products, saw sales rise 10%.But Intuit's fiscal Q1 guidance of $740 million-$760 million in revenue, up 5% at the midpoint, missed Wall Street expectations, and did its EPS ex items guidance of 1 cent-3 cents, vs. 9 cents in the year-earlier period.The company's fiscal-year guidance, however, met Wall Street expectations, Brean Capital analyst Yun Kim said in a research note.Brean was one of at least two investment banks that hiked their price targets on Intuit stock following the earnings report. Brean raised its target to 135 from 130, while Goldman Sachs upped its target to 124 from 123.""We highlight that the company continues to show year-over-year improvement in its SBG (small-business group) operating margin for the past four quarters, and we expect that trend to continue,"" Kim wrote.But RBC Capital Markets cut its price target to 108 from 113 and lowered its financial estimates for the 2018 and 2019 fiscal years.In a research note, RBC analyst Ross MacMillan said smaller stock buybacks accounted for some of the lowered estimates, as well as ""a slightly more cautious view on SMB Desktop ecosystem and no material upward revisions to our SMB Online ecosystem estimates.""

220,KIM,"Drugmaker Medivation's (MDVN) stock was jumping Monday -- and lifting some other big biotechs with it -- after Pfizer (PFE) announced that it's acquiring the company for $14 billion in cash.The Pfizer-Medivation deal was formally announced after a weekend of leaks and a long campaign by big French pharma Sanofi (SNY) to take over the maker of prostate-cancer drug Xtandi. Sanofi didn't completely rule out making another bid, but its statement on Monday made it sound as though Pfizer's $81.50 a share in cash was too rich for its blood: ""While we recognized the potential strategic benefits of a combination with Medivation, we are first and foremost a disciplined acquirer and remain committed to acting in the best interests of Sanofi shareholders.""Medivation stock rose 20% to 80.42 on the stock market today. Shares of both Pfizer stock fell a fraction Monday.IBD'S TAKE: In the last five weeks, IBD's Medical-Biomed/Biotech Industry Group has risen from No. 126 to No. 36 out of 197 industry groups. This month, IBD looked at what's driving the biotech stock rally.Jefferies analysts noted that this might reignite speculation that Sanofi turn its attention to rare-disease specialist BioMarin Pharmaceutical (BMRN). In June, BioMarin's stock rose on an anonymously sourced report at the blog Betaville that BioMarin was Sanofi's fallback option. On Monday, BioMarin stock popped 6.7% to 98.17.Meanwhile, Incyte (INCY), maker of the blood-cancer drug Jakafi and a perpetual object of buyout speculation with various partners, rose 7.7% to 81.98.In a research note sizing up several biotech buyout targets, BMO Capital Markets analyst Do Kim wrote that Incyte could go for $14.1 billion to $18.8 billion, based on a valuation of three to four times peak sales. While that wouldn't bring much of an upside to its current market cap of $15 billion, Kim added, ""We believe these companies could potentially command a higher multiple, given the limited number of late-stage clinical and commercial biotechs.""Others he named as likely targets include rare-disease players Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) and Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX), which rose 3.3% and 3%, respectively, on Monday.RELATED:

221,KIM,"Hedge funds and other large speculators set the biggest bet on benchmark Treasuries in more than three years just as Federal Reserve officials reinforced the potential for an interest-rate increase this year.In a sign traders are confident a record-setting Treasuries rally has further to run, they boosted positions in 10-year futures to a net 185,521 contracts last week, the most since December 2012, according to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission's Commitments of Traders report.Their conviction is being tested as Treasuries slipped after New York Fed President William Dudley said investors are underestimating how many times the central bank will raise rates and Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan said an increase in September is ""very much on the table.""""When you see these Fed speakers come out, people are growing increasingly cognizant that the market is positioned in a very long way, which might be inappropriate given the underlying data in the U.S.,"" said Jonathan Rick, an interest-rate derivatives strategist in New York at Credit Agricole CIB, which forecasts a Fed rate increase in December.The retreat for Treasuries follows gains last week after a report showed second-quarter U.S. gross domestic product grew at less than half the pace economists predicted. U.S. manufacturing expanded in July, though at a slower pace, an Institute for Supply Management index showed Monday. Policymakers will hold off raising rates for at least a year, according to fed funds futures data compiled by Bloomberg, while the probability of a hike this year is about 34%, down from 48% a week ago.The U.S. 10-year-note yield climbed seven basis points, or 0.07 percentage point, to 1.52% as of 5 p.m. ET, Bloomberg Bond Trader data show.Citigroup's U.S. Economic Surprise Index last week reached the highest in almost two years before dropping by the most since January 2013 on July 29, when the GDP data were released.""The Fed is probably going to delay the interest-rate hike,"" said Kim Youngsung, head of overseas investment in Seoul at South Korea's Government Employees Pension Service, which has $13.5 billion in assets. ""The economic data have been mixed. It's been really good for U.S. Treasuries.""Though Treasuries rallied after the Fed's July 27 policy statement on signals that the central bank would continue down a gradual path of rate increases, policymakers since then have cautioned the bond market on its outlook for lower rates.""The movement in investor expectations toward a flatter path for U.S. short-term interest rates seems broadly appropriate,"" Dudley said in remarks prepared for a speech Monday at a conference in Bali. However, ""it is premature to rule out further monetary-policy tightening this year,"" he said.Traders will focus this week on U.S. data, including the Labor Department's July payrolls report on Aug. 5, after relatively extreme swings in the pace of hiring in the previous two months. The survey will be released as a Merrill Lynch measure of expected price swings in Treasuries has dropped to near the lowest level since 2014.""The underlying demand for bonds remains strong, but I think the rally will run into obstacles this week,"" said Jan von Gerich, chief strategist at Nordea Bank AB in Helsinki. ""The recent move back in yields leaves the Treasury market vulnerable to upside data surprises, especially regarding Friday's employment report.""

225,KIM,"PYONGYANG, North Korea — In the popular mind, there may be no more forbidding destination on earth. I've never had as many people ask if I was serious when I mentioned I was heading to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.In fact, I had no worries. I was going as an official guest, invited by the Institute of American Studies of the Foreign Ministry. Having invited me, the North Koreans wanted the trip to proceed smoothly. I also understood what not to do.Failing at the latter has proved to be the undoing of a number of Americans, most spectacularly collegian Otto Warmbier, who died after being released by North Korea in what Pyongyang claimed was a medically-induced coma. Three other Americans remain in custody.Some attributed Warmbier's release to the Trump administration's efforts, though it has no more leverage than its predecessor. While in the North I asked if the government sent Warmbier home as a conciliatory gesture to Washington. The unequivocal response was that it was strictly a humanitarian matter.Otto Warmbier's family blames the Obama administration for failing to win his release, but the decision always was Pyongyang's. Why the DPRK released him now is impossible to know: Perhaps Kim Jong-un decided that holding a comatose prisoner was a political liability.The cases of Warmbier and other Americans, some going back years, are uniformly tragic: People punished for actions that should not be considered criminal. But the DPRK is not alone in penalizing foreigners for dubious offenses. The main difference may be that Pyongyang, more than most other ""hostile"" states, sees potential political value in jailed Americans.Still, 1,000 Americans visit annually and don't get arrested. Young Pioneer Tours, which organized the trip on which Warmbier traveled, pointed out that it had brought in more than 8,000 other travelers without incident.On my plane entering North Korea I sat next to a British citizen who was making his third tourist visit. The worst trouble he had was being told to delete photos deemed inappropriate.A number of humanitarian groups, some explicitly religious, work in the officially atheist nation. I met several NGO staffers and volunteers in the midst of a lengthy sojourn providing medical care. None had ever ended up in jail.In fact, arrests aren't random but, in North Korea's view, for cause. DPRK officials say they punish intentional, not accidental, rules violations.I chatted with the head of a Western NGO active in the North who said her group had looked into the cases of those jailed: All had committed some illegal act. That doesn't mean their conduct warranted punishment. But they put themselves under the DPRK's authority.Warmbier's case looks extreme even by North Korean standards. Some knowledgeable Westerners suggest that his actual offense was more egregious and more humiliating for the North. The poster incident merely became the cover story. Of course, that still wouldn't justify his awful treatment.Some in Congress want to ban travel to the North. But a free society should protect the liberty to travel and explore. This right shouldn't be limited without compelling justification.Visiting the DPRK has educational value. Those who spend time in North Korea are more likely to understand it. Since the U.S. government lacks a diplomatic presence, American visitors are the best alternative.Going to the North also causes those living in free societies to better appreciate their systems. I left thankful that I lived in a society which, however imperfectly, protected individual liberty.Watching, meeting and especially working with people who don't fit the official stereotype provide North Koreans with an education as well. Knowledge is transmitted, curiosity is aroused. Engagement is no panacea but is more likely than isolation to encourage Pyongyang's positive evolution.Banning Americans from visiting the North would be especially perverse when the rest of the world remains free to go. Congress should think how best to transform the North's people as well as government over the long term.We may never know what happened to Otto Warmbier. His tragic case reminds us that visiting North Korea requires special caution. But that's no reason to block Americans from going.They have much both to learn and teach. Until the DPRK changes, individual travelers may end up being America's most important and perhaps only ambassadors to North Korea.

226,KIM,"If you keep up with the news, you might think that the unpleasant and unedifying 2016 presidential campaign is still going on.President Donald Trump, up early, is sending out tweets coarsely attacking foreign leaders and American politicians — complete with misspelled words, in at least one case to the point of indecipherability.Runner-up Hillary Clinton is supervising a busy staff, which, after she takes an hour for exercise, fills her in on the 60 minutes' latest news developments. A leader of the ""resistance"" — a term she's embraced — should always be prepared.Charitably-minded observers may excuse both of these individuals, neither of whom expected 12 months ago to be in the places and positions they are today. And they might add that they're not the only ones continuing to operate in campaign mode.Rush Limbaugh proclaims that ""American voters saved this country as we know it."" Or, to be more precise, the 46% of American voters responsible for securing 304 electoral votes for Trump did.Limbaugh is, of course, right that Trump's victory has had important policy consequences, from the appointment of Justice Neil Gorsuch to the renunciation of the unenforceable strictures of the Paris climate agreement. More, although probably not so many as most Trump voters would like, are in store.But America has rebounded from policy mistakes — you can make your own list — before. Every election has policy consequences, some of them pretty serious and many unpredictable. The country has evolved, changed, grown enormously, but much of its character remains recognizable in the writings of Alexis de Tocqueville, who interviewed the rival presidents John Quincy Adams and Andrew Jackson 180-some years ago.On the other side, 43% of respondents to a Politico/Morning Consult poll want Congress to begin impeachment proceedings against Trump. Over half of those people — 23% of respondents — think he has proved ""he is unfit to serve and should be removed from office, regardless of whether he committed an impeachable offense or not.""So to heck with the Constitution and its nitpicking requirement that officials be removed from office only for ""Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors."" These folks want a revote, right now. For them, the campaign is still on — as it may still be for the next 17 months, if in 2018 Democratic House candidates make impeachment a main plank of their platforms.Amid the continuing campaign chatter, let's step back and ponder how current events will be regarded in the longer run of history.Trump's capture of 70 previously Democratic electoral votes in the Midwest and Pennsylvania owes much to his distinctive stands on immigration and trade, even though the problems he cited are of declining importance. Illegal immigration across the Mexican border fell off sharply in 2007, and the reduction in American jobs because of Chinese imports probably crested several years before.That positions him as president to claim credit for trends that are ongoing, albeit his policies are arguably accelerating them. Illegal border crossings are apparently way down this year, probably in response to Trump's strengthened enforcement of existing laws. Manufacturing jobs may be rising, too, as rising Chinese wages make Chinese goods less competitive here.On foreign policy, Trump has abandoned Barack Obama's tilt to Iran (Obama had a secret back channel with Iran, dating back to the 2008 campaign) and stitched together an informal anti-Iran coalition in the Middle East. He may have persuaded China to exert some discipline over North Korea and has accelerated the long-standing missile defense program, derided for years by Democrats, to protect America from any Kim Jong Un nukes.As for Europe, he and German Chancellor Angela Merkel both have benefited politically from trading news conference and Twitter insults. Merkel is strengthened for her Sept. 24 election, and Trump can claim to have spurred Europeans to take more responsibility for their own defense.This is starting to look like a more conventional Republican foreign policy than campaign rhetoric suggested. Congressional Democrats seem to have stalled in their efforts to find some Team Trump collusion with Russia that would justify the impeachment proceedings their party's base expects and lusts for — perhaps because an investigation could show that the Obama administration surveilled and criminally unmasked Americans for political reasons.I'm happy to join those urging Trump and Clinton to stop acting like candidates. But maybe the rest of us should take a deep breath and stop acting as if the campaign were still on.
"
227,KIM,"It has been interesting to see how the United States observed the recent South Korean election. Americans mostly viewed the election as a barometer for future policy toward the North: Would South Korea elect a conservative candidate to get tough with Kim Jong-un? With North Korea's saber-rattling across the Pacific, safety in Asia was America's No. 1 concern.But South Korean voters saw it differently.For them, economic matters mattered more. Only 18.5% of South Korea's voters in a pre-election survey said national security was the most important issue, putting it at No. 3, with the economy at No. 2 (24.5%) and government corruption at No. 1 (27.5%) – a natural concern given that their country has not had a president since December because she was impeached on corruption charges. Left-wing reform candidate Moon Jae-in had the clear inside track to electoral success given the circumstances.In December, while Americans were still doing our own political post-mortems, South Korean President Park Geun-hye was impeached because her administration stood accused of taking bribes from large South Korean companies, including Samsung, Hyundai, Lotte Group, SK Group, and others. Ms. Park's trial is underway. Samsung Vice Chairman Lee Jae-yong was arrested in February and his trial is underway as well.Meanwhile Samsung is facing an uncertain future with its leader sitting in a jail cell and the inherent challenges of staying competitive with Apple and other leaders in the tech space. It's safe to say that Mr. Lee's absence could eventually deal a serious blow to Samsung – the largest driver of the South Korean economy.Samsung alone comprises 20% of the South Korean economy, or as the Atlantic magazine put it a few years ago, ""Whoa: Samsung Is Responsible for 20% (!?) of South Korea's Economy."" Samsung is to South Korea what Disney is to Florida — except about 10 times bigger. At that scale, it's safe to say that as Samsung goes, so goes South Korea.Thus, both are in trouble with the aggressive anti-big-business reform agenda that the new administration has promised. President Moon campaigned on rooting out corruption in government and big businesses, or the ""chaebols,"" and with his victory Koreans may learn a hard lesson: Liberal economic reforms and breaking up successful businesses could weaken South Korean companies and make it harder for them to compete globally.To translate this into American politics: The Republican Party took a bath in the 1974 Congressional elections and lost the presidency in 1976 because people were upset with Watergate, not because they thought Jimmy Carter was best suited to handle the USSR. Park is like Nixon except instead of a wiretapping and cover-up, she is accused of corruption and bribery. Moon represents to most people a chance to move forward.President Moon vows to take on the chaebols, similar to how the so-called ""Watergate babies,"" the liberal reformers who came to Congress after Nixon resigned, upended government and business practices alike, ushering in new regulations, transparency rules and oversight. But within a few years, American businesses found themselves hamstrung and average Americans were paying higher taxes for a growing bureaucracy in place to check the power of big corporations.By 1980, the combination of economic stagnation and inflation, or ""stagflation,"" was too much and Americans turned to business-friendly Ronald Reagan. By 1984, it was ""morning in America"" once again.Moon's crusade on corporate corruption will certainly please skeptics of the U.S. free trade agreement with South Korea. The Trump administration has already questioned whether the agreement has been good for the U.S. We can debate the merits of trade between the U.S. and disparate economies like China or Mexico, which can displace working class jobs, but we shouldn't have to with South Korea. We are both advanced, stable economies with similar political and legal systems.Despite this, the U.S. trade deficit in goods with South Korea had doubled since the South Korean FTA went into effect five years ago.  Look for this imbalance to change at South Korea's detriment if President Moon takes on the chaebol system too aggressively and too quickly.Given the size and reach of the chaebols, any setbacks will come with great cost to South Korean businesses and create new openings for foreign competitors. South Korea should be wary of these unintended consequences. Whether Moon succeeds in replacing his country's unique system with something that works better, or simply blows up in their faces, will not be known for years.

228,KIM,"After years of strong revenue growth and hefty losses, Workday (WDAY) has reached a major milestone. The cloud-based enterprise software firm unexpectedly reported its second straight quarter of positive earnings in its fiscal fourth quarter. Wall Street now sees increasing profitability as the company grabs market share from giants Oracle (ORCL) and SAP (SAP).X On June 1, analysts expect Workday to report that fiscal Q1 earnings surged 220% to 16 cents a share excluding various items. Revenue likely rose 35% to $467.33 million. After a 12-cent profit in fiscal 2017, the company's first year in the black, analysts project EPS to accelerate to 51 cents, 81 cents, and $1.32 over the next three years.Workday provides human capital management and payroll software and has recently expanded into financial applications. Its investment in new products and features and its ability to maintain a high customer-satisfaction rate bodes well, according to Credit Suisse analyst Michael Nemeroff.""Our subscription revenue estimates imply continued market-share gains in both the HCM and Financial applications markets due to WDAY's best-of-breed capabilities and competitive advantages in its large and growing total addressable market,"" Nemeroff said in an April report.

To find more fast-growing names with actionable trading opportunities, take a free trial.After hitting a nine-month low of 65.79 on Dec. 30, shares closed Friday at 99.99, near their best levels since their early-2014 all-time high. Workday shares cleared a cup-with-handle base with a 92.56 buy point in heavy volume on May 15. The stock is now extended from the 5% buy range, but if it pulls back in light volume — as some leaders do — it could provide investors with another chance to purchase shares.The Pleasanton, Calif.-based company has a strong IBD Composite Rating of 95 out of 99, yet it's still ranked seventh in the highly rated enterprise software industry group.Workday says that continued into the most recently reported quarter. ""The win rates against SAP and Oracle were as high as they have been in recent memory,"" CEO Bhusri said on the Q4 call.Despite expectations for strong revenue growth and margin expansion over the next few years, Credit Suisse and Benchmark both initiated coverage on Workday's stock in April with a neutral, or hold, rating.""We are wary of intense competition in its core target Human Capital Management (HCM) market, which continues to drive pricing pressure, unfavorable billings terms and lengthening sales cycle,"" Benchmark analyst Yun Kim said in an April 26 report. But Kim did highlight Workday's successful execution, citing ""strong product positioning and superior customer references.""Meanwhile, Nemeroff said there are not yet signs of ""accelerated momentum"" in large clients for Workday's financial management software, due to the risk and complexity of switching core financial applications to the cloud.But he notes that IDC projects the cloud-based financial applications software market will reach $9.5 billion in 2020, representing a compound annual growth rate of 12%.Workday could adjust its outlook on the next quarterly call, but last forecast fiscal 2018 revenue of $2.005 billion to $2.025 billion, or growth of 27% to 29%. That would make it the second pure-play software-as-a-service provider to top $2 billion in annual revenue, only after Salesforce (CRM).

233,KIM,"SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — Unlike America's presidential election, South Korea's contest yielded no surprises. Left-leaning Moon Jae-in topped a multimember field to take over from disgraced Park Geun-hye, who was impeached and removed from office on corruption charges.The contest was a rushed affair, held several months earlier than originally scheduled. Moon was the losing candidate five years ago and had served as chief of staff to the last liberal president.The ruling party split over Park's ouster and had little time to recover. Moon was briefly threatened by a more centrist opponent who backed him in the last election, but then faded in the stretch after a bad debate performance. Moon won with 41% of the vote, not exactly a mandate, but nevertheless with a sizable margin over the next finisher.Although Moon will face opposition in pushing his leftish economic nostrums, his foreign policy views will likely more controversy at home and abroad. Moon formally affirmed his commitment to the alliance in a postelection phone call with Donald Trump, but the former may be less enamored of his nation's long relationship with Washington than he suggested.Moon rose to prominence as a left-wing lawyer and human rights activist. He opposed the long-running military dictatorship, which only gave way in 1987 in response to mass demonstrations by Koreans demanding elections.He helped elect Roh Moo-hyun in 2002, a fellow activist attorney who won a narrow victory in the midst of surging anti-American sentiment. Moon lost to Park five years ago, but as head of the principal opposition party was well-positioned when Park's presidency collapsed.Moon's views are no secret, though like any good politician he downplayed his more controversial views during the brief campaign. He started as an opponent of the THAAD anti-missile system, which has been deployed in the Republic of Korea despite China's angry opposition.He urged revival of the so-called Sunshine policy, which sought to win North Korea's friendship with aid and commerce. (His proposal has been nicknamed Moonshine.) He promoted the idea of an ""economic community"" with the North, urged talks with North Korea's Kim Jong-un, endorsed revival of the Six-Party talks (which include Japan, Russia, and China), and expressed his desire to take his first foreign trip to Pyongyang.As the polls tightened he carefully qualified his positions, adding conditions for any approach to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. Yet many suspect such promises were merely convenient election add-ons. Indeed, his newly appointed chief of staff, 39-year-old Im Jong-Seok, once was jailed for promoting contacts with the North and led a student group which occupied the U.S. ambassador's office.There's nothing wrong with South Koreans criticizing both America and the U.S.-South Korea alliance. In fact, the South is longer overdue in taking over responsibility for its own defense. Today South Korea enjoys a roughly 40-1 economic advantage and 2-1 population edge. The South could devote as much money as necessary to its military.However, Moon's attitude toward the North suggests more than a tinge of naivete. Engagement makes good sense, but any contacts should be without illusion. After all, Pyongyang has continued its missile tests despite Moon's victory.Moreover, the new government in Seoul is likely to run into sharp conflict with President Donald Trump's administration. In broad terms, Washington is committed to applying maximum pressure on the North, through military threats and enhanced economic sanctions.The administration plans to condition talks with North Korea on prior agreement to America's demands: dismantling the North's nuclear and missile programs. The U.S. expects China to cut aid and trade.A new round of ROK investment and aid would undercut the U.S. objective of ""maximum pressure"" on the North. Moreover, Washington could not easily demand that China sever its commercial connections with the North.If President Moon flies to Pyongyang to negotiate a nuclear freeze, Washington's insistence on dismantlement before talks begin would be stillborn. The more America threatens war, the more uncomfortable and even antagonistic South Koreans likely will become.The two presidents spoke by phone shortly after Moon took office and agreed to a summit next month. But even friendly discussions won't hide the fact that the two countries' interests differ in substantial ways.U.S.-South Korean ties have varied over time. However, the Trump-Moon match may present a special challenge. South Koreans are likely to quickly learn whether Donald Trump or Kim Jong-un is the more unpredictable leader.

234,KIM,"A federal appeals court rejected a $5.7 billion settlement of claims that Visa (V) and MasterCard (MA) improperly fixed credit-card swipe fees, potentially renewing years of litigation with millions of U.S. merchants.The ruling is a blow to credit-card firms that sought to put an end to bitter court battles over fees amounting to tens of billions of dollars annually. The lawsuit, brought on behalf of 12 million merchants nationwide, was filed a decade ago after earlier disputes over the fees. The rejection of the deal raises the prospect that it will have to be renegotiated or the case may go to trial.Dozens of big retailers who opposed the accord cheered the decision, in which the appeals court said provisions barring merchants from suing over fees were unfair. The U.S. Court of Appeals in Manhattan also said that lawyers who represented retailers nationwide didn't do enough to protect their interests.""This is not a settlement; it is a confiscation,"" U.S. Circuit Judge Pierre Leval said in one of two opinions in the case. The judge said he was particularly troubled by the broad litigation release that ""binds in perpetuity, without opportunity to reject the settlement, all merchants who in the future will accept Visa and MasterCard, including those not yet in existence.""Visa declined 2.3% to $74.94 at 11:58 a.m. in New York, while MasterCard slipped 2% to $90.29. The world's largest payment networks were the worst performers in the 68-company S&P 500 Information Technology Index.""We are disappointed by today's ruling,"" Seth Eisen, a spokesman for MasterCard, said in an e-mailed statement. ""We believe we presented a clear case to the court that the settlement was fair and appropriate based on more than four years of negotiation and the close involvement of the district court. We are reviewing the decision to determine our next steps.""Connie Kim, a spokeswoman for Visa, declined to comment.Large retailers including Wal-Mart Stores (WMT), Amazon.com (AMZN) and Target (TGT), as well as major airlines, health insurers and other consumer businesses, had criticized the deal. On Thursday, the Retail Industry Leaders Association, a trade group that represents more than 200 merchants, praised the ruling, saying the settlement would have denied retailers the ability to bring lawsuits over interchange rules and rate setting. The group had formally opted out and objected to the deal two years ago.""Today's decision is a victory for all merchants and consumers,"" Deborah White, the group's executive vice president, said in a statement. ""The settlement orchestrated by the card networks and banks would have undermined merchants' legal rights forever and would have allowed Visa and MasterCard to impose higher and higher swipe fees.""U.S. District Judge John Gleeson in Brooklyn, New York, approved the accord on Dec. 13, 2013, saying he was satisfied with the settlement, which was estimated to be the largest-ever U.S. antitrust deal. Gleeson stepped down from the bench earlier this year.Once owned by groups of major banks, Visa and MasterCard had defended themselves for decades against legal claims that they operated price-fixing schemes. Swipe, or interchange, fees are set by card companies and paid by merchants when consumers use credit or debit cards.The settlement was announced in July 2012. Once worth as much as $7.25 billion, it was valued at about $5.7 billion as of August 2013 after reductions for about 8,000 merchants that dropped out of the damages portion of the lawsuit.The case is In re Payment Card Interchange Fee and Merchant Discount Antitrust Litigation, 12-4671, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit (Manhattan).

The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 1.1%.Volume was tracking below Monday's levels -- an indication that institutional investors weren't buying with as much enthusiasm as they sold on Monday and Friday. Winners led losers by nearly 6 to 1 on the NYSE and by nearly 5 to 1 on the Nasdaq.Energy, biotech and banking stocks were among the leaders. Citigroup climbed 3% while Bank of America (BAC) and JPMorgan added 2%, all in heavy trading. But the gains were minor compared to the losses of the previous two days.A number of top-rated stocks found support at the 50-day moving average. While it would be risky to purchase stocks in these new buy areas until the market shows more strength, the support was at least a tentatively good sign.IBD 50 members MarketAxess (MKTX), Copart (CPRT) and Primerica (PRI) were bouncing from the 50-day lines in active trading. Several other IBD 50 stocks also were finding support, but volume was tracking below normal levels.Some real estate investment trusts have climbed past buy points, and those included IBD 50 component Sun Communities (SUI).

237,KIM,"Markets abhor uncertainty. And perhaps nothing breeds more uncertainty than a war that starts with a surprise attack like the Korean War in the early 1950s.To the investor, wars create volatility and opportunity.You do not have to be able to predict such events. But you do need to be flexible and know when to quickly raise cash to avoid huge losses in stocks. Then you must be able to buy with conviction when the market, via the follow-through bottoming signal, has given investors a green light to buy leading new stocks.IBD teaches such techniques via this column and the Big Picture. Market timing is essential to making great trades.On Sunday, June 25, 1950, the North Korean People's Army surprised South Korea and a small contingent of U.S. military personnel, pouring south across the 38th parallel. The next day, North Korean tanks were at the outskirts of the South Korean capital of Seoul.The day after that, President Harry Truman secured a United Nations resolution calling for military assistance to the South. Truman named Gen. Douglas MacArthur to head two U.S. divisions in what he called a ""police action."" For the next three years, the U.S. would fight a difficult and costly war to an eventual standstill that lasts to this day.Kim Jong Un, the grandson of Kim Il Sung, the supreme leader who launched North Korean forces against the South, is in charge today, still raising havoc in the region.The Monday morning after the attack in 1950, the Dow fell 4.7%. The next day, the market lost 0.8%, with volume reaching the heaviest since September 1939, when Nazi Germany invaded Poland. From a June 12 intraday high to a July 13 low, the Dow lost 14.8%. Yet the correction was contained; the Dow had just about recovered its loss by September, when U.S. forces launched the Inchon invasion and the liberation of Seoul.The Korean War had important consequences for the economy. Rather than build deficits, Truman preferred a pay-as-you-go strategy. Supported by Congress, he raised income, corporate and excise taxes to record levels in 1950 and 1951.At the war's outbreak, inflation skyrocketed as consumers hurried to buy, fearing shortages. Prices rose 11% from the war's onset until price controls were imposed Jan. 26, 1951. In its last year, war expenses made up 14.1% of GDP.Dwight D. Eisenhower was elected in November 1952 on a platform of ending the war. An armistice went into effect on July 27, 1953.The market's advance once the war was underway was mild and choppy. Still, some winners emerged. One winner was United Aircraft, later to become current Dow Jones industrial average member United Technologies (UTX), which owned the Pratt & Whitney Aircraft Engine Co. Pratt & Whitney built jet engines used in fighters and bombers. United broke out of a cup-with-handle base in 1949. By 1953, 87% of sales were to the government. It gained 256% in 169 weeks.Better bets surfaced at the end of the war when price controls and materials restrictions were lifted. Enter Outboard Marine, a maker of outboard motors. It expanded its offerings to include snowblowers, lawn mowers and chain saws, and its earnings and stock price exploded.Following a strong breakout in January 1954, Outboard gained 720% in 177 weeks, ascended into a climax run on a 3-for-1 stock split and gave a clear sell signal.

238,KIM,"Situational ethics define the liberal media. There is no pursuit of truth. There is only a double standard.When former President Barack Obama bowed to dictators in Cuba and Iran, it was ""historic"" diplomacy. When President Donald Trump talks up meeting with autocrats, that's another dangerous and disgusting sign of his lack of respect for human rights.The Washington Post front page on May 2 carried the headline ""Praise for strongmen alarms rights advocates: Trump's vocal affection for totalitarians marks major U.S. policy shift."" Pictures included Russian President Vladimir Putin, Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi and the crackpot North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.So, what was different when President Obama launched a Russian ""reset"" with Putin? And when Obama praised Muslim Brotherhood tyrant President Mohammed Morsi in Egypt, that was smart? Did the Post freak out on the front page in 2008 when then-presidential candidate Obama stared down Hillary Clinton and said he would talk to dictatorial regimes, that refusing to talk is ""ridiculous""?You won't find a Washington Post headline on ""Obama's vocal affection for totalitarians.""What about the media's happy talk for murdering brutes? Go back a few months to Cuban dictator Fidel Castro's death. ""Revolutionary remade Cuba,"" read the Post headline. The obit gushed that he was ""a romantic figure in olive-drab fatigues and combat boots"" and a ""spiritual beacon for the world's political far left."" The New York Times preferred to describe him as ""the fiery apostle of revolution.""Do we really need to revisit the media's opportunistic tendency to kiss dictatorial rings to gain access for softball interviews? Should we have to recall Scott Pelley celebrating the ethics of Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, Dan Rather babbling to deposed Iraqi ruler Saddam Hussein or 20 different anchors lauding Castro to his face?Nevertheless, CNN anchorman Jake Tapper opened his show on May 1 with blazing snark, saying: ""The world according to Trump: Journalists are the enemies of the people, but he would be honored to meet Kim Jong Un. ... President Trump today saying he would be honored to meet where North Korea's despotic dictator under the right circumstances. And that is not the first maniacal and murderous strongman he has opened up to in the past day.""Trump called the North Korean tyrant a ""pretty smart cookie"" on Sunday, and Tapper offered a rebuttal, saying: ""Kim Jong Un had his uncle murdered. That doesn't make Kim Jong Un a smart cookie. That makes him a murderer.""This on the network that confessed it squashed tales of torment and murder for years in order to keep its Baghdad bureau open, to distribute only ""news"" that was acceptable to that great humanitarian Saddam Hussein.Here's another CNN blast from the past. In June 1994, former President Jimmy Carter went to Pyongyang and hugged North Korean despot Kim Il-Sung. CNN anchor Frank Sesno summarized it, saying: ""Jimmy Carter, Korean peacemaker! Did his trip to Korea reduce the threat of war?"" Carter even called the Stalinesque dictator the ""Great Leader"" without getting scalded.And let us not forget CNN was founded by Ted Turner, who did embarrassing interviews with ""murderous strongman"" Fidel Castro and broadcast a documentary in 1988 called ""Portrait of the Soviet Union"" that fawned over the Communist revolution with lines like this howler: ""Once, the Kremlin was the home of czars. Today, it belongs to the people.""Tapper concluded his commentary by quoting Ronald Reagan, saying that ""a violation of human rights anywhere is the business of free people everywhere."" That sounds great. But that same press fought Reagan tooth and nail in his day, assaulting him for being a crazy Red-baiting warmonger for statements like that.It's good for journalists in free countries to question leaders about their commitment to advocating human rights instead of pragmatically enabling dictators. Unfortunately, our media display a reflexive habit of questioning only Republican presidents. The Carters, the Clintons and the Obamas skate free.
"
239,KIM,"Give President Trump credit. He put North Korea front and center in talks with China. In doing so, he's created an opportunity for the two nations to cooperate to more effectively press the North to freeze, if not end, its nuclear program.But the Trump administration must do more than dramatically wave its military sticks. It should take the initiative and offer more carrots as well.Over the last quarter-century the U.S. has failed to dissuade North Korea from building nuclear weapons and longer-range missiles. Neither engagement nor isolation has diverted Pyongyang from its confrontational course.Now the small, impoverished nation appears to be closing in on its objective to create an intercontinental missile capable of hitting America. There is no evidence that Kim Jong Un is suicidal. But that's still cold comfort, knowing that a mistake or error by Kim — or President Trump — could lead to the destruction of an American city or two.Despite the president's bluster that the U.S. will ""solve"" the North Korea problem with or without China's help, Washington has few options. Military strikes would risk triggering the Second Korean War.Sanctions could be further strengthened, but targeting North Korea won't have dramatic effect without Beijing's support. Hitting Chinese firms and banks doing business with the North would antagonize the People's Republic of China without necessarily forcing Pyongyang to abandon its efforts.Gaining the PRC's cooperation remains the most obvious and effective means to apply increased pressure on Pyongyang. If China stepped on North Korea's economic windpipe, Kim & Co. would notice.The Trump administration has made an unsubtle attempt to browbeat Beijing, threatening to take military action against the DPRK. President Trump also added a bit of equally crude bribery, offering better trade terms with Beijing if the latter acts as desired.However, these actions aren't likely to convince the PRC to apply the sort of bone-crunching sanctions that almost certainly would be necessary to have much chance of changing North Korean policy.The first problem is that the administration has made an unconvincing threat combined with an ambiguous offer, with a request that Beijing do something not detailed in return. To abandon its traditional ally and strengthen America's geopolitical position in return for a promise of unspecified future benefits would be foolish, if not foolhardy.Equally problematic, the Trump administration has not addressed the PRC's greatest concerns. Applying extraordinary economic pressure on the North could result in a messy national implosion, followed by a unified Korea allied with America and hosting U.S. troops — a historic and geopolitical nightmare for China.In fact, these concerns explain why Beijing has not acted previously, despite rising irritation with the North's confrontational, even reckless, behavior. For the PRC, stability is paramount.Moreover,China views the U.S. as being primarily responsible for the impasse, having implemented a ""hostile"" policy toward the DPRK, which encouraged the latter to pursue nuclear weapons. After all, Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya and Serbia all demonstrated that small states cannot easily resist U.S. military action.For years U.S. officials have seemed bewildered that Beijing didn't rush to fulfill U.S. demands and hand China's sole military ally over to America. The Trump administration appeared to start down the same road when Secretary of State Rex Tillerson testified at his confirmation hearing that the U.S. needed to ""compel"" China to apply UN sanctions against the North.However,President Trump's trade initiative suggests greater administration flexibility. Economic benefits, as proposed by the president, are useful, but China's leadership isn't likely to sacrifice core security interests for better trade terms alone. Indeed, the People's Liberation Army has an outsize interest in the North's survival.Instead of attempting to coerce Beijing, Washington should play ""Let's make a deal."" Propose talks with Pyongyang over general security and political issues. Offer to assist the PRC should the North collapse and create a humanitarian crisis.Respect China's economic investments in North Korea. Withdraw U.S. forces in the event of Korean reunification. Neutralize the peninsula militarily. Include the Republic of Korea and Japan in a broader agreement.Even with Beijing's aid the U.S. might not be able to bring North Korea to heel. But the possibility of success is a good enough reason to give negotiation a try. It is imperative to preserve peace on the peninsula. 
"
240,KIM,"The crisis with North Korea may appear trumped up. It's not.Given that Pyongyang has had nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles for more than a decade, why the panic now? Because North Korea is headed for a nuclear breakout. The regime has openly declared that it is racing to develop an intercontinental ballistic missile that can reach the United States — and thus destroy an American city at a Kim Jong Un push of a button.The North Koreans are not bluffing. They've made significant progress with solid-fuel rockets, which are more quickly deployable and thus more easily hidden and less subject to detection and pre-emption.At the same time, Pyongyang has been steadily adding to its supply of nuclear weapons. Today it has an estimated 10 to 16. By 2020, it could very well have a hundred. (For context: the British are thought to have about 200.)Hence the crisis. We simply cannot concede to Kim Jong Un the capacity to annihilate American cities.Some will argue for deterrence. If it held off the Russians and the Chinese for all these years, why not the North Koreans? First, because deterrence, even with a rational adversary like the old Soviet Union, is never a sure thing. We came pretty close to nuclear war in October 1962.And second, because North Korea's regime is bizarre in the extreme, a hermit kingdom run by a weird, utterly ruthless and highly erratic god-king. You can't count on Caligula. The regime is savage and cult-like; its people, robotic. Karen Elliott House once noted that while Saddam Hussein's Iraq was a prison, North Korea was an ant colony.Ant colonies do not have good checks and balances.If not deterrence, then prevention. But how? The best hope is for China to exercise its influence and induce North Korea to give up its programs.For years, the Chinese made gestures, but never did anything remotely decisive. They have their reasons. It's not just that they fear a massive influx of refugees if the Kim regime disintegrates. It's also that Pyongyang is a perpetual thorn in the side of the Americans, whereas regime collapse brings South Korea (and thus America) right up to the Yalu River.So why would the Chinese do our bidding now?For a variety of reasons.These are major cards America can play. Our objective should be clear. At a minimum, a testing freeze. At the maximum, regime change.Because Beijing has such a strong interest in the current regime, we could sweeten the latter offer by abjuring Korean reunification. This would not be Germany, where the communist state was absorbed into the West. We would accept an independent, but Finlandized, North.During the Cold War, Finland was, by agreement, independent but always pro-Russian in foreign policy. Here we would guarantee that a new North Korea would be independent but always oriented toward China. For example, the new regime would forswear ever joining any hostile alliance.There are deals to be made. They may have to be underpinned by demonstrations of American resolve. A pre-emptive attack on North Korea's nuclear facilities and missile sites would be too dangerous, as it would almost surely precipitate an invasion of South Korea with untold millions of casualties. We might, however, try to shoot down a North Korean missile in mid-flight to demonstrate both our capacity to defend ourselves and the futility of a North Korean missile force that can be neutralized technologically.The Korea crisis is real and growing. But we are not helpless. We have choices. We have assets. It's time to deploy them.
"
241,KIM,"If you prize clarity, then these past weeks were some of the best in memory.1. When America leads, the world is better.For the first time in eight years, the allies of America and the world's decent people celebrated America's return to leadership. Just about all of them understand that if the United States doesn't exercise its power, the worst regimes on Earth will.The left claims to care about the downtrodden of the world, but this concern is a moral fraud. The downtrodden the left most care about are American blacks, women and gays. And Palestinians. But these groups aren't downtrodden; they are merely a vehicle by which the left attacks America and Israel to gain power. The truly downtrodden — that is, the most oppressed people in the world, such as Christians living in the Middle East, and the victims of Syrian President Bashar Assad's tyranny — know who really cares about them: Trump and America's conservatives.2. The terrible presidency of Barack Obama is beginning to be acknowledged.Following President Trump's order to attack Syria about 63 hours after the Syrian regime seemingly used chemical weapons, even many in the mainstream media couldn't help but contrast his prompt response with Obama's nonresponse to Assad's use of chemical weapons in 2013. And almost every report further noted that Obama failed to do anything after having promised that he would regard the use of chemical weapons by Assad as crossing a ""red line.""Likewise, Obama's do-nothing policies vis-à-vis North Korea are being contrasted with Trump's warnings to leader Kim Jung Un about further testing of intercontinental ballistic missiles and pressure on China's leaders to rein in the North Korean regime.These contrasts are important for a number of reasons, not the least of which being there is now hope that Obama's star will dim as time goes on.This will come as somewhat of a surprise to those on the left, but many of us who are not on the left believe that Obama did more damage to America than any previous president — economically, militarily and socially.Regarding the social damage, as the first black president in American history, he could have been an unprecedented force for racial healing but instead left America more racially divided than any modern president. In his repeated citing of Ferguson, for example, he helped spread the lie that a racist white Missouri police officer had killed an innocent black teenager without reason (other than racial bias).He deceived the American people (the ""if you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor"" assertion and more) in order to pass ObamaCare, one of the largest government-expanding programs in American history. He used presidential power in an unprecedentedly authoritarian manner. He showed far more understanding of the Iranian theocracy than of the Israeli democracy. His Internal Revenue Service and Department of Justice were politicized in ways reminiscent of corrupt Third World regimes. And he left America fighting a (thus far nonviolent) second Civil War.3. The interminably repeated left-wing lie that Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin are in cahoots has exploded.With Trump's military attack on Assad and verbal attacks on Russia, that claim has been shown to be what those with a little common sense knew it to be: a baseless, wholly made-up conspiracy theory meant to explain an election loss with which Democrats still haven't come to grips. In fact, President Trump has shown more backbone with Russia in his first 100 days in office than President Obama did in eight years.4. Another charge made over and over by the left — the mainstream media, academia and the Democratic Party — that the Trump election had unleashed an unprecedented amount of anti-Semitism was proved to be yet another left-wing hysteria based on a left-wing lie.It turned out that bomb threats phoned into Jewish community centers and Jewish agencies came not from Trump supporters and ""white supremacists"" but from a black radical and a disturbed young American Jew living in Israel.Given that factual and moral clarity are conservatism's greatest allies, we may be witnessing the beginning of a conservative Renaissance, the likes of which we haven't seen since the advent of progressivism.
"
242,KIM,"Foreign Policy: In international diplomacy, credibility is all important. After taking out a Syrian chemical weapons base, President Trump now has credibility in spades. He'll need it in dealing with North Korea's nuclear threat.Keen observers have noted that the missile attacks on the Syrian air base were launched as President Trump sat down last week to dinner with China's President Xi Jinping. No doubt Xi immediately recognized that this president, unlike the previous one, acts quickly to make sure bad situations don't get worse.What does this have to do with North Korea? Plenty. Despite their at times rocky relationship, China is the totalitarian communist North Korean regime's main patron and protector, accounting for over half the North Korean nation's trade and much of its food and energy supplies. Strive as it does for self-sufficiency, without aid from China, North Korea would soon starve.Even so, North Korean tyrant Kim Jong-un appears to be preparing for a sixth nuclear test, and has threatened the U.S. with a nuclear strike if it tries to interfere. Meanwhile, the U.S. has sent a Navy strike group to the region, with President Trump tweeting recently that North Korea is ""looking for trouble"" and that the U.S. will ""solve the problem,"" whether China helps or not.Knowing now that Trump means business, China seems to have reached the end of its patience with its unpredictable client.We know this because a tough editorial in the Global Times, an international newspaper owned by the Chinese Communist Party, warned that China's government has a ""bottom line"" and that if ""the bottom line is touched, China will employ all means available including the military means to strike back.""The editorial went a step further, telling North Korea that it won't wait for the U.S. to do the dirty work, but ""will launch attacks to (North Korea's) nuclear facilities on its own.""Since February, China has been curbing its trade with North Korea, and in recent days even turned away a fleet of North Korean merchant ships filled with coal, the impoverished nation's No. 1 export. So things are about to get ugly in North Korea's already-strapped economy.Here in the U.S., we've been dealing with North Korea's provocations since the Korean War in the 1950s. Most Americans don't realize it, but that war never officially ended. There's only a truce.The nuclear mess, however, is of recent vintage. Trump is dealing with the failures of previous U.S. administrations to end the threat, either by twisting China's arm or by direct action. In the early 1990s, when North Korea threatened nuclear devastation and war with South Korea, President Clinton sent former President Jimmy Carter to negotiate an end to the threat.The Clinton White House proudly announced the ""deal"": an end to North Korea's military nuclear program in exchange for billions of dollars in aid and ""peaceful"" nuclear technology. Within just two years, however, North Korea was cheating.Hopes of getting China to help out with North Korea hit bottom last year, after China expressed open contempt for President Obama, even humiliating the president during last summer's G-20 economic summit by refusing to roll out a red carpet for him as it had for the other leaders and forcing Obama and National Security Advisor Susan Rice to deplane from the rear of Air Force One. This only emboldened North Korea's Kim.""Kim knows that Xi is not about to further goals, like the denuclearization of North Korea, that (Obama) promotes, and so Pyongyang thinks it has a big green light in its quest to possess the world's most destructive weapons,"" wrote China expert Gordon Chang at the time. That's what Obama's weakness in the face of China's open hostility achieved.As for those who think the threat isn't real, they should think again. North Korea has focused intently on building a viable nuclear threat for nearly three decades, and has made consistent progress both in building warheads and long-range missiles to deliver them. A 2014 study by the U.S. based Institute for Science and International Security estimated that North Korea could have enough nuclear material for as many as 79 nuclear weapons by 2020. That's three years away, folks.As we noted before, China now has gotten the message: Trump isn't going to roll over like Obama did, and he means business. Xi learned this after being informed during a steak and seafood dinner that Trump had launched 59 Tomahawks at that chemical weapons base in Syria — without asking Russia's permission, and after giving it just a short warning to get its troops out of harm's way.That certainly explains China's sudden shift in tone toward North Korea to one of open hostility. China now knows there's a president who not only understands U.S. interests in the region, but has explicitly told China that any trade deals between our two nations will depend on its cooperation in ending North Korea's nuclear threat.Being nice and negotiating phony nuclear deals with North Korea hasn't worked. The ""six-party talks"" on North Korea's nukes that have been going on since 2003 haven't worked either. By restoring U.S. credibility, Trump has made China care about North Korea's nuclear threat in a way it never did before. It may be the best chance we have of avoiding a nuclear catastrophe from a nation ruled by a totalitarian sociopath.RELATED:Holes In Obama's North Korea Nuclear 'Shield'China Won't Help A Weak U.S. With Nuclear-Armed North KoreaTrump Should Change U.S. Policy On Nuclear Weapons

Malls aren't going extinct — they're changing, sometimes by healthy natural selection. While store closures are painful, often they represent a Darwinian moment, allowing a shopping center to refresh its mix by adding a grocery market or an Apple store.Investors aren't buying it. Literally. Mall REIT stocks have dropped 18% in the past year, compared with a 4% gain in the broader REIT group, as stores close at a record pace. At the same time, a view is building among industry analysts that skepticism has gone too far.Down 7% this year, Bloomberg's BBREIT Regional Mall Index trades for 5.1 times book value, down from its 2016 high of 6.7 and roughly in line with its decade average.New York University's REIT Symposium on April 6 featured presentations from chief executive officers at 27 REITs spanning numerous industries. But the conversation kept bouncing back to retail. Here's what the executives had to say:Retail properties come in many varieties, and shouldn't be lumped together. Malls aren't the same as strip centers, and, more importantly, high-quality malls — or ""A"" malls — are different from ""B"" and ""C"" malls. The consensus is that the high-quality malls will outperform.""If you own the best real estate, you will thrive,"" said Sandeep Mathrani, CEO of mall operator GGP (GGP). Retailers no longer care whether they're operating out of a strip center or a mall, he said. Quality is what matters. And of the 7.5 billion square feet of retail real estate in the U.S., only 1.2 billion is currently occupied by stores that are considered high quality, Mathrani said.When it comes to malls, ""high quality"" has been synonymous with luxury apparel brands. But the definition is changing as e-commerce puts a premium on creativity. A trip to the mall is no longer just about buying a designer handbag. Now it often involves going to a grocery store, doctor's office or upscale restaurant — all businesses that face less risk from e-commerce than traditional tenants. Some REITs are tacking on office space or apartments to diversify. One mall in Dubai even boasts an aquarium and an Olympic sized ice rink, and another features a ski slope.Mathrani said today's ideal mall includes one department store, a supermarket, an Apple store, a Tesla store, and businesses that started out online, such as Warby Parker. Clothing stores, which used to take up about 70% of the average shopping center, now represent closer to 50%, he said. Meanwhile, food is roughly 15%, up from around 6%.""Food is the new fashion, and fitness is the new food,"" said Acadia Realty Trust (AKR) CEO Kenneth Bernstein.Shoppers also aren't willing to travel as far as they once were for a day at the mall, so location and convenience are important. ""Old-fashioned retail shopping centers will continue to exist as long as they're in the right location,"" Mathrani said.Store closures such as those at Sears Holdings (SHLD) and J.C. Penney (JCP) have driven a lot of the recent negativity around retail, but some REITs have said good riddance. The exit of one retailer can present an opportunity to boost rents and lease space to a higher-quality store.Mathrani said that GGP had anticipated the fall of some stores, and has been able to fill 80% of the space that was left empty when retailers went bankrupt. Stores like Bonobos, Lululemon (LULU) and Warby Parker have filled the gaps.Technological innovation can also open doors, according to Conor Flynn, CEO of shopping center REIT Kimco Realty (KIM). He said driverless cars and ride-sharing could allow his company to transform parking lots into apartments and hotels.Some REIT executives said the U.S. has too much retail space. Flynn said a lot of shopping centers were built to keep up with household formation, but many of those households were never built. So as e-commerce continues to take more market share, parts of the country may need to do some demolition. In the future, the city you live in may have four malls instead of eight. The key, Flynn said, is having a good business both in stores and online.""Home Depot (HD) is a perfect example of being very efficient at both the physical bricks-and-mortar as well as the e-commerce business,"" he said. ""There is an omnichannel wave now that is widely accepted by most consumers.""MORE ABOUT REAL ESTATE:Investors Who See Plenty Of Life In Dying MallsSeeking E-Commerce Shoots Among Retail's Brick-And-Mortar DeclineWho's Driving The Housing Recovery Now?

244,KIM,"So far this year, no one has tossed any rhetorical stun grenades at the Morningstar Investment Conference.Last year, keynote speaker Jeremy Grantham -- founder and chief investment strategist of Boston-based Grantham, Mayo, Van Otterloo -- warned of an emerging bubble in the stock market.Grantham is well-known for identifying speculative market bubbles as they are still taking shape, then taking clients’ assets to the exits before those investors suffer bruising losses. He did that with Japanese stocks in the late 1980s and with technology stocks in the late 1990s.At 2014’s Morningstar conclave, famed bond investor Bill Gross strode onstage for his address wearing sunglasses and introduced himself as a 70-year-old version of controversial pop star Justin Bieber. It was Gross’ way of poking fun at the press criticism he has often attracted. To emphasize his point, he also compared himself to press-beleaguered celebrities such as World War II Gen. George Patton -- whom the wartime press lambasted for slapping a hospitalized soldier -- and current celebrity Kim Kardashian.The closest that this year’s edition of the conference -- its 28th annual gathering -- has come to controversy may have been with the Tuesday panel that discussed high-yield bonds.Panelists Fred Hoff of Fidelity Investments, Michael Hong of Wellington Management and Mark Vaselkiv of T. Rowe Price (TROW) concurred about the virtues of high-yield debt.But two advisors in the audience, who asked not to be named, afterwards told IBD that they would have liked to hear more about the odds of the default rates rising for either corporate or other high-yield debt. One of the advisors noted that he didn’t recall hearing the word “junk” used during the presentation.Still, the panelists said the large research teams in each of their large mutual-fund shops aim to steer their funds away from potential defaults.And risk was addressed. Moderator Sumit Desai kicked off the discussion in part by noting that famed investor Carl Icahn has declared his growing bearishness about high yield. And the average high-yield spread to comparable maturity Treasuries is greater than the norm -- 597 basis points vs. 583 -- suggesting a reversion to the mean is in the cards.The panelists stressed that investing in high yield demands a long time horizon.Vaselkiv said if the apparent stabilization of the price of oil around $45 per barrel holds, the danger of a ripple effect of defaults from the troubled oil patch should recede or at least not grow.

245,KIM,"According to U.S. mall landlords, the rumors of the death of brick-and-mortar retail are greatly exaggerated.“There is no question there is a lot of change,” Taubman Centers Chief Operating Officer Bill Taubman said in an interview at the International Council of Shopping Centers annual convention, which was held in Las Vegas this past week. “But retail has always been about evolution. Someone is always bemoaning the change in the market and how it’s impacting things.”Bleak earnings forecasts from department-store companies, including Macy’s (M) and Nordstrom (JWN), along with bankruptcy filings by firms such as Sports Authority and teen-clothing chain Aeropostale, have rattled investors in retail landlords. A Bloomberg index of regional mall landlords, which includes the shares of Taubman Centers (TCO) and Simon Property Group (SPG), has dropped almost 8% recently, double the decline in the broader Bloomberg Real Estate Investment Trust Index.Retailers are being hurt by the rise of Internet shopping, changes in consumer tastes and declining visits to big-city shopping districts by tourists deterred by the strong dollar. Retail rents on Madison Avenue in Manhattan have fallen to $1,644 a square foot on average, down 3% from last year, according to a report this month by the Real Estate Board of New York.Sales have suffered this year at malls that rely on shoppers from Europe and Latin America, said Taubman, whose properties include high-end destinations such as the Mall at Short Hills in New Jersey and Beverly Center in Los Angeles. Spending by travelers from China hasn’t dropped off much, he said.Despite the turmoil, demand for space has held up, Kimco Realty (KIM) Chief Executive Officer Conor Flynn said during a panel discussion at the Las Vegas convention. New Hyde Park, N.Y.-based Kimco is adding more grocery stores to anchor its shopping centers, a reliable source of business, he said.The market will get more clarity on retailers’ demand for space when Sports Authority auctions off its stores, Flynn said. Once the largest U.S. sporting-goods retailer, the company filed for bankruptcy in March after saddling itself with $643 million of debt.“We are watching shadow supply,” Flynn said. “We don’t want a shock to the system where there is a ton of square-footage coming online at the same time.”Plenty of retailers are thriving, said Matt Lougee, a senior vice president at DDR (DDR), a company that owns shopping centers across the U.S. Lougee cited TJX (TJX), the owner of discounters T.J. Maxx and Marshalls that last week boosted its earnings forecast, as an example of a company that is benefiting from the shift away from full-price apparel. The perception that lost revenue is all going online isn’t accurate, he said.“Those dollars are going somewhere,” Lougee said in an interview in Las Vegas. “They went to a different channel, not necessarily the Internet.”Property owners in the retail business will always have to contend with filling empty stores as part of the normal course of business, Vereit (VER) Chief Executive Officer Glenn Rufrano said on a panel in Las Vegas.“Retailers will always lose space, not because they are retailers, but because they are bad merchants,” he said.Related: Dollar Tree, Discount Retailers Dominate New-Highs ListWal-Mart Re-Thinks Small Format Strategy As Dollar Stores SwarmSluggish Retail Sales?

246,KIM,"Mobile video game publisher Glu Mobile (GLUU) got a rise Thursday from the release of a new game featuring pop singer Britney Spears. However, it’s the big game publishers like Activision Blizzard (ATVI) and Electronic Arts (EA) that are winning in the mobile games market.Glu saw its low-priced, micro-cap stock rise 7% to 2.50 in afternoon trading on the stock market today, on the release of its latest celebrity game: “Britney Spears: American Dream.”The San Francisco-based company needs another hit along the lines of its genre-defining game, “Kim Kardashian: Hollywood,” to regain its footing.Glu’s sales have fallen on a year-over-year basis for three straight quarters. And the declines are accelerating -- from a 2% decrease in Q3 2015 to a 16% drop in Q4 and a 22% fall in Q1.Glu has a miserable IBD Relative Strength Rating of 3, meaning it is in the bottom 3% for performance among all stocks over the last 12 months.Another publicly traded maker of mobile games, San Francisco-based Zynga (ZNGA), faces similar challenges. Its sales have stalled the last two quarters -- falling 4% year over year in Q4 and increasing just 2% in Q1. Zynga is known for games such as “Words With Friends” and “Zynga Poker.”Like Glu, Zynga stock is low valued, trading near 2.50 and up a fraction Thursday afternoon.Meanwhile, PC and console game giants Activision Blizzard and Electronic Arts reported solid gains in their mobile game initiatives in the March quarter.Activision stock jumped to near its all-time high after the company posted better-than-expected first-quarter results on May 5. The Santa Monica, Calif.-based company credited the upside surprise to newly acquired mobile game publisher King Digital Entertainment and its hot titles like “Candy Crush Jelly Saga.”Activision completed its purchase of King on Feb. 23. In Q1, King’s monthly active users rose 3% to 463 million from the prior quarter. King has had three of the top 15 highest-grossing titles in the U.S. mobile app stores for nine quarters in a row.EA stock climbed to a record high of 77.15 after the Redwood City, Calif.-based company posted better-than-expected results for its fiscal Q4 on May 10. Shares were down 1.5% Thursday afternoon, near 73.50.EA was the No. 1 most-downloaded mobile game publisher in 2015, with such popular games as “Madden NFL Mobile” and “Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes.”

247,KIM,"Real estate investment trusts are preparing for a surge of attention as they get their own grouping in major U.S. stock indexes. Their first task: educating investors who have no idea how to evaluate the industry.The companies -- which own properties such as apartment complexes, hotels, office towers and shopping malls -- are tweaking their disclosures, adding glossaries to their earnings statements and reaching out to investors to break free of the reputation of REITs as a quirky niche. The new industry classifications, which take effect in September, will separate real estate stocks from financials and make them their own category.The separate grouping means REITs will lure more generalists, defined as any money manager that doesn’t specialize in the area. The trouble is, such investors have little background in an industry that favors measures such as funds from operations or net asset value. Generalist funds are underinvested in REITs relative to their benchmarks by roughly $100 billion, in part because some of the concepts underpinning their analysis are unheard of elsewhere on Wall Street, JPMorgan Chase (JPM) analysts wrote in a note this month.“Everyone has shopped in a mall or lived in an apartment or driven past a warehouse,” said Alexander Goldfarb, an analyst at Sandler O’Neill & Partners in New York. “It should be really easy to understand, but it becomes very complicated because of the terminology.”While REITs have been around since the 1960s, the industry ballooned following the real estate bust in the 1990s as cash-strapped companies turned to public markets when private funding dried up. The trusts are being carved out into their own category by S&P Global’s S&P Dow Jones indexes and MSCI (MSCI) after a surge in valuations. Equity REIT market capitalization more than doubled to $886 billion from 2007 to 2015, according to the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts.The property companies now make up about 3% of the S&P 500 Index. With the new classification, money managers who track benchmark gauges will be adjusting their portfolios to include REIT stocks. Cohen & Steers (CNS) estimates $100 billion will flow into the shares.REITs began taking steps in their first-quarter earnings reports to make it easier for fund managers who aren’t versed in the industry’s idiosyncratic lingo to understand their business. Equity Residential (EQR), the apartment owner taken public by billionaire Sam Zell in 1993, introduced a list of key terms and definitions.The Chicago-based landlord reached out to a broader pool of investors to prepare for the new classification about a year ago, and found that investors who hadn’t bought REIT shares didn’t find commonly cited measures such as per-square-foot rent helpful in understanding earnings power, said Chief Financial Officer Mark Parrell.Equity Residential added the glossary so investors who have never looked at a real estate company before can make some sense of its financial statements, he said. The landlord also changed its investor presentation to start with thematic topics such as the preference for urban living rather than diving straight into detailed data on its properties, he said.“This doesn’t mean we won’t communicate to our real estate investors,” Parrell said. “It’s important for us to be bilingual.”It’s easy for a novice in any industry to get tripped up by jargon, but REIT jargon is particularly hard for the uninitiated. For example, analysts eschew the familiar measure of earnings per share when gauging REIT performance. Instead, they look at a company’s funds from operations, or FFO, which excludes items such as the cost of depreciation. That’s because while a telecommunications company can expect its fiber optic cables to lose value over time, an office landlord expects the value of its properties to rise.“Unless you own really bad buildings, real estate tends to hold its value or appreciate over time,” said Sandler O’Neill’s Goldfarb. “Depreciation isn’t really a factor.”In order to get at just how much all those buildings are worth, analysts and investors work out a company’s NAV, or net asset value. It’s one of the most important calculations for understanding the intrinsic value of a REIT, and something generalists who might not know the real estate market could wrestle with, Goldfarb said.At shopping-center owner Kimco Realty (KIM), the glossary was moved to the front of the company’s first-quarter financial disclosures to make them easier for investors to digest, according to David Bujnicki, a senior vice president at the New Hyde Park, N.Y.-based company. Previously, it was buried in the back, he said. In addition to FFO, disoriented investors can look up ABR (annualized base rent), GLA (gross leasable area) and economic occupancy, too.“Real estate has its own vernacular,” said Owen Thomas, chief executive officer of Boston Properties (BXP), which owns stakes in marquee real estate including Manhattan’s General Motors Building and San Francisco’s Embarcadero Center. “Once an investor takes the time to learn the terminology, I think it can be understood relatively quickly.”Boston Properties is extending its investor-relations efforts to include more dialogue with managers who oversee broader portfolios, Thomas said.Yet it may be a precarious moment to jump into real estate. Commercial-property prices are flattening after six years of record-shattering growth, hurt by concerns ranging from slumping oil prices to slowing economic growth in China.REIT shares have taken a hit recently on speculation that the Federal Reserve may raise interest rates again as soon as June. Higher rates increase the companies’ borrowing costs and diminish the attractiveness of their dividend yield.Simon Property Group (SPG) -- the largest REIT, with a market value of about $60 billion -- is “very focused” on soliciting new investors, said Les Morris, a spokesman for the Indianapolis-based mall owner.“We do feel this is an opportunity for us as these investors are focused on cash flow growth, earnings and dividend growth, and strong balance sheet metrics, which plays to our strengths,” Morris said in an emailed statement.Meeting face-to-face is crucial in getting generalist investors comfortable, said Kimco’s Bujnicki. The company, credited with jump-starting the modern REIT era with its initial public offering in 1991, has set a goal to schedule half of its meetings at conferences and on road trips with non-REIT fund managers, he said.“The idea for us is to get in front of these investors and start to get face time,” Bujnicki said.Related:REITs Attract Investor Interest In Volatile MarketHealth-Care REITs: A Dividend Play On An Aging PopulationHotel REITS Offer Hefty Yields, But Not All Are Equal

248,KIM,"Syria: President Trump sent a loud message to Syria's Bashar al-Assad for his use of deadly Sarin gas against his own people: Your days of terrorizing your own people with chemical weapons are about to end. But many others are getting Trump's message, too.""Tonight, I ordered a targeted military strike on the air base in Syria from where the chemical attack was launched,"" Trump said, speaking from Mar-a-Lago in Florida. ""It is in this vital national security interest of the United States to prevent and deter the spread and use of deadly chemical weapons.""Two U.S. ships in the Mediterranean launched 59 Tomahawk missiles, striking Shayrat Airfield in western Syria, which U.S. intelligence believes has been used as a base for deadly chemical attacks against Assad's own people — including the 100 murdered this week in a Sarin gas attack.""Using a deadly nerve agent, Assad choked off the lives of men, women and children,"" Trump said Thursday, visibly moved, adding: ""No child of God should ever suffer such a horror.""So it's official: ""Leading from behind,"" as official U.S. foreign policy, is dead. ""Leading"" is back.Trump has clearly signaled that, after 8 years, the U.S. is ready to re-engage in the Mideast and elsewhere. This has been clear in recent weeks, as he's pointedly met with a handful of moderate and U.S.-friendly leaders in the Mideast to build a new coalition of sorts and to reassert U.S. leadership in the region.Just this week, he met with Egypt's Egypt's President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi and with Jordan's King Abdullah II, and he's recently talked with the Saudis and with Israel's Benjamin Netanyahu. He engaged Germany's Angela Merkel, Britain's Theresa May and Japan's Shinzo Abe. It's clear Trump's intent on re-establishing the damaged ties from President Obama's tenure.But equally clear, the strike by 59 Tomahawk missiles against the Syrian military base from which chemical weapon attacks were likely launched, was a broader message from Trump to other recipients:It's not our job to wargame what comes next, or play armchair general. We're not beating a drum for war, or for U.S. troops to be sent back to the Mideast.But Assad crossed a red line, one that poses a danger to all of civilization. The last time he did that, we did nothing. Now, a new president is showing Assad — and the rest of the world — that such murderous acts will have very serious consequences.And that's a very good thing for America and the world.RELATED: Can Trump Clean Up Obama's Mess In Syria?Cold War 2.0: Obama Doctrine Of Weakness Has Reawakened The Russian Bear Kerry's Syrian 'Cease-Fire' Is Really Just Capitulation

249,KIM,"If there's a moment that should give Americans pause, it is Donald Trump, international ingenue, meeting Chinese President Xi Jinping, son of a Mao Zedong confidante and victim of the Cultural Revolution, who climbed atop the world's biggest political heap. Xi also knows as much about Middle America as does the U.S. president, having once spent time with a typical Midwestern family.President Trump is not a man who devotes much time to preparing. But much depends on him learning about both China and Xi, particularly what motivates them. The most important bilateral relationship in the world is that between the United States of America and the People's Republic of China.The starting point should be to hire a few people to staff the State Department and other agencies. No secretary of state, no matter how talented and knowledgeable, can manage U.S. foreign policy alone.Washington needs a strategy to deal with Asia's rising power. Priorities must be set, trade-offs need to be evaluated, deals should be offered. Appropriate means must be developed to advance serious ends.Secretary of State Rex Tillerson isn't going to draft the relevant memos. President Trump certainly won't do so. Someone who knows something about China and Asia needs to bridge the gap between State's permanent employees and the secretary.If the administration won't be ready, it should postpone the summit. Beijing will have an agenda and a strategy to advance its interests.So must Trump & Co.First, the administration must recognize that it can't ""win"" on every issue. What is most important to the president? Limiting Chinese exports, defenestrating North Korea's Kim Jong Un, deterring Beijing's truculent maritime practices, or something else? Treating everything as essential means nothing is.Second, confrontation and military threats are likely to end badly. The U.S. armed forces are far more powerful than the People's Liberation Army, but the PRC has far more at stake in its neighborhood and therefore is willing to spend and risk far more to protect its interests. Moreover, Xi and the rest of China's leadership direct a rising, nationalistic power not inclined to be bullied. Washington can and should communicate its willingness to back vital interests with force, but do so, yes, ""diplomatically.""Third, the president needs to learn the art of diplomacy, and quickly. China might moderate how it pursues its territorial claims in the Asia-Pacific, but will require something in return. Beijing is irritated with Pyongyang's behavior, but to be convinced to apply greater pressure requires the U.S. to address the PRC's interests and concerns.Fourth, President Trump should separate the interests of the U.S. and its allies, as well as distinguish between essential and peripheral concerns. Allies should be a means to an end: the defense of the U.S. Washington shouldn't protect other nations as an act of charity, especially against a nuclear-armed power. Moreover, America's principal interest in, say, Japan and the Philippines is preserving their independence, not their control of unimportant and contested islets.Fifth, the president should adapt U.S. policy in expectation that friendly states will do far more on behalf of their own interests. If the Philippines wants to go ship-to-ship with the PRC, it needs an effective navy, rather than relying on America's fleet. Japan needs to be willing to employ the navy that it has. Changed circumstances warrant changed policies.Sixth, the president should recognize that cheap imports are as much a benefit as are expensive exports. Average folks, at least those not living on New York City's Fifth Avenue, benefit from a lower cost of living. Exporters also do better when they purchase intermediate goods for less. And unless the Chinese unexpectedly start burning the dollars they collect for their exports, the money will come back to the U.S. as purchases or investments.Seventh, it is vital to develop a generally civil and cooperative U.S.-China relationship. Differences are inevitable, but conflict is not.Beijing does not threaten the U.S. — the latter's territory, population, wealth, or liberty. Rather, the PRC is contesting American dominance along China's border. That may be advantageous for the U.S., but is hardly a vital concern worth war.The first meeting of the presidents from the world's two most important nations is a major diplomatic moment. President Trump needs to become something he's never been: a knowledgeable statesman.RELATED:China Grew 6.7% Three Quarters In A Row?

250,KIM,"At the heart of Donald Trump's foreign policy team lies a glaring contradiction. On the one hand, it is composed of men of experience, judgment and traditionalism. Meaning, they are all very much within the parameters of mainstream American internationalism as practiced since 1945. Practically every member of the team — the heads of State, Homeland Security, the CIA, and most especially Defense Secretary James Mattis and national security adviser H.R. McMaster — could fit in a Cabinet put together by, say, Hillary Clinton.The commander in chief, on the other hand, is quite the opposite — inexperienced, untraditional, unbounded. His pronouncements on everything from the ""one China"" policy to the two-state (Arab-Israeli) solution, from NATO obsolescence to the ravages of free trade, continue to confound and, as we say today, disrupt.The obvious question is: Can this arrangement possibly work? The answer thus far, surprisingly, is: perhaps.The sample size is tiny but take, for example, the German excursion. Trump dispatched his grown-ups — Vice President Pence, Defense Secretary Mattis, Secretary of Homeland Security John Kelly and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson — to various international confabs in Germany to reassure allies with the usual pieties about America's commitment to European security. They did drop a few hints to Trump's loud complaints about allied parasitism, in particular shirking their share of the defense burden.Within days, Germany announced a 20,000-man expansion of its military. Smaller European countries are likely to take note of the new setup. It's classic good-cop, bad-cop: The secretaries represent foreign policy continuity but their boss preaches America First. Message: Shape up.John Hannah of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies suggests that the push-pull effect might work on foes as well as friends. Last Saturday, China announced a cutoff of all coal imports from North Korea for the rest of 2017. Constituting more than one-third of all North Korean exports, this is a major blow to its economy.True, part of the reason could be Chinese ire at the brazen assassination of Kim Jong Un's half-brother, who had been under Chinese protection. Nonetheless, the boycott was declared just days after a provocative North Korean missile launch — and shortly into the term of a new American president who has shown that he can be erratic and quite disdainful of Chinese sensibilities.His wavering on the ""one China"" policy took Beijing by surprise. Trump also strongly denounced Chinese expansion in the South China Sea and conducted an ostentatious love-in with Japan's prime minister, something guaranteed to rankle the Chinese. Beijing's boycott of Pyongyang is many things, among them a nod to Washington.This suggests that the peculiar and discordant makeup of the U.S. national security team — traditionalist lieutenants, disruptive boss — might reproduce the old Nixonian ""Madman Theory."" That's when adversaries tread carefully because they suspect the U.S. president of being unpredictable, occasionally reckless and potentially crazy dangerous. Henry Kissinger, with Nixon's collaboration, tried more than once to exploit this perception to pressure adversaries.Trump's people have already shown a delicate touch in dealing with his bouts of loopiness. Trump has gone on for years about how we should have taken Iraq's oil for ourselves. Sunday in Baghdad, Mattis wryly backed off, telling his hosts that ""All of us in America have generally paid for our gas and oil all along, and I am sure we will continue to do so in the future.""Yet sometimes an off-center comment can have its uses. Take Trump's casual dismissal of a U.S. commitment to a two-state solution in the Middle East. The next day, U.S. policy was brought back in line by his own U.N. ambassador. But this diversion might prove salutary. It's a message to the Palestinians that their decades of rejectionism may not continue to pay off with an inexorable march toward statehood — that there may actually be a price to pay for making no concessions and simply waiting for the U.S. to deliver them a Palestinian state.To be sure, a two-track, two-policy, two-reality foreign policy is risky, unsettling and has the potential to go totally off the rails. This is not how you would draw it up in advance. It's unstable and confusing. But the experience of the first month suggests that, with prudence and luck, it can yield the occasional benefit — that the combination of radical rhetoric and conventional policy may induce better behavior both in friend and foe.Alas, there is also a worst-case scenario. It needs no elaboration. RELATED:Trump News & Tweets

251,KIM,"SANTA MONICA, Calif. — The Cold War was waged and won in many places, including this beach city, home to the RAND Corp. Created in 1948 to think about research and development as it effects military planning and procurement, RAND pioneered strategic thinking about nuclear weapons in the context of the U.S.-Soviet competition. Seven decades later it is thinking about the nuclear threat from a nation created in 1948.When Defense Secretary James Mattis said that any North Korean use of nuclear weapons would draw an ""effective and overwhelming"" U.S. response, he did not, according to RAND's Bruce W. Bennett, ""overcommit"" the president by saying that the response would be nuclear. But an overwhelming response could be.On Jan. 1, North Korea's 33-year-old leader Kim Jong Un said that his regime was at ""the final stage in preparations to test-launch"" an ICBM, perhaps one capable of reaching America's Pacific Coast. On Jan. 2, Donald Trump tweeted: ""It won't happen!"" He thereby drew a red line comparable to his predecessor's concerning Syrian chemical weapons. So, Trump, who excoriated Barack Obama for ignoring that red line, must, Bennett believes, be prepared to threaten actions that would prevent North Korea from learning from its test, actions such as shooting down the missile.The United States has 30-some ground-based interceptor missiles at Fort Greely in Alaska and others at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. This small capability is intended to cope with an accidental firing by an adversary, or an intentional firing by a rogue general, or to deter or defeat a deliberate attack by an adversary with a small nuclear arsenal, such as North Korea. Will the U.S. anti-ballistic missile system work? Bennett says technologies can go wrong, so this would be an opportunity to fix any failures. And unless we then are prepared to shoot down theater-range ballistic missiles, we will signal less-than-convincing commitment to South Korea and Japan. To those who say it is premature to conclude that Kim is capable of delivering a nuclear warhead, Bennett says: In 1966, China, in its fourth nuclear test, just two years after its first, had a missile carry a nuclear weapon to its detonation over its western desert.In 2006, William Perry, who had been defense secretary for Bill Clinton, and Ashton Carter, who would be Obama's final defense secretary, recommended U.S. action to destroy any ICBM set for testing on a North Korean launchpad. But that nation's conventional retaliatory capabilities, including artillery and rockets capable of inflicting considerable damage on at least Seoul's northern suburbs, forestalled this. And North Korea has perhaps 1,000 tactical-range ballistic missiles capable of striking throughout South Korea and Japan. Furthermore, North Korea has cyberwar, commando and sabotage capabilities.Today, U.S. surface ships and submarines alone could deliver dozens of cruise missiles, and each of up to 10 B-2 bombers could carry two Massive Ordnance Penetrators to destroy underground leadership or missile bunkers. But as soon as Kim has one or more ICBMs (probably road-mobile) capable of delivering, on short notice, a nuclear payload to, say, Santa Monica, pre-emptive U.S. action, even just against his nuclear infrastructure, might be too risky.Furthermore, preparations for a more ambitious strike — against North Korean artillery and rockets, ports, airfields, command-and-control centers, leadership bunkers and forward-positioned forces — might be apparent and might provoke Kim to strike first against Seoul and U.S. forces in South Korea. South Korea talks openly of creating, this year, a ""decapitation brigade"" involving perhaps as many as 2,000 troops whose mission would be to eliminate North Korea's leadership in the event of war.Kim recently dismissed the head of his secret police, the latest sign of insecurity. Bennett believes Kim, undeterred by tweets, might test his ICBM for internal purposes — to impress restive North Korean elites. Bennett suggests that the threat to shoot down the test flight would constructively exacerbate Kim's problems. As might U.S. propaganda, for example by reminding North Korean elites that China's president has had eight summits with South Korea's president in the last four years but never has had one with Kim, who China apparently considers not important.North Korea, which has been run opaquely for the Kim family's benefit since 1953, is approaching a red line. Although the line was drawn before Trump took office, perhaps it represents continuity. It prefigured the kind of improvisational governance that has made his early weeks so interesting.RELATED: Holes In Obama's North Korea Nuclear 'Shield'No Government Foreign Aid For North Korea

252,KIM,"Two-year Treasuries are barely eking out a gain in 2016, lagging behind every other U.S. bond and note.Part of the problem is the Federal Reserve.  Fed officials have signaled that they may raise interest rates as soon as their next meeting in June. Fed Bank of Philadelphia President Patrick Harker, who doesn’t vote on monetary policy this year, said Monday he could see two to three moves in 2016. There’s a 78% chance the central bank will boost rates by December, the highest odds in two months, futures contracts indicate.“They’re probably going to increase the rate in June or July if the data are good enough,” said Kim Youngsung, the head of overseas investment in Seoul at South Korea’s Government Employees Pension Service, which oversees $12.7 billion. “I’m not going to buy two-year bonds.”The securities have returned 0.6% this year, based on Bank of America’s debt indexes. The broad Treasury market has gained 3.2%, let by an 8.9% surge in 30-year bonds.Meanwhile, the 10-year yield was at 1.86% at 4:59 p.m. New York time.Purchases of new homes in the U.S. surged in April to the highest level since the start of 2008, Commerce Department data showed Tuesday. The Treasury is scheduled to sell five-year notes Wednesday and seven-year securities Thursday. It also plans to sell two-year floating-rate debt Wednesday. Fed Chair Janet Yellen speaks Friday.U.S. yields that are higher than those in other countries will still lure investors to Treasuries, said Tsutomu Komiya, a bond investor in Tokyo at Daiwa Asset Management, which had $119 billion in assets as of March 2015, the most recent figure on the company’s website. Two-year notes yield about minus 0.51% in Germany and negative 0.23% in Japan.""Global investors are trying to find an attractive investment option,” Komiya said. “Demand is strong” in the Treasury market, he said.

253,KIM,"CyberArk Software (CYBR) stock lifted Thursday on a bullish report from Imperial Capital that sees an 8% upside to the privileged account manager's Q1 earnings, posted early this month, driven by increased cross-selling opportunities and broader greenfield adoption.Imperial Capital analyst Michael Kim kept his in-line rating on CyberArk stock, but boosted his price target to 45 from 41. In early afternoon trading on the stock market today, CyberArk stock rose 2.6%, to 42.54, and touched a six-week high. But shares are 16% off a 2016 high of 49.56, achieved Jan. 22.The lift defied a slight fractional decline in IBD's 26-company Computer Software-Security industry group. Shares of Imperva (IMPV), FireEye (FEYE) and Symantec (SYMC) all fell a fraction Thursday, while Check Point Software Technology (CHKP) stock fell 1%.""At current levels, we think CyberArk shares offer balanced risk/reward,"" Kim wrote in a research report. ""Investors could become more constructive as the company gains greater scale and broader adoption of its new offerings.""Kim expects less volatile near-term license revenue growth and margin expansion. But he cut his 2017 earnings per share minus items view to $1.14 from $1.16 on expected investments in growth. Wall Street models $1.13, up 23% above 2016 views for 92 cents.CyberArk still has runway to add new customers, Kim wrote. During Q1, CyberArk added 100 new customers, bringing the company's installed base to 2,600. Nearly a third of new customers added three or more products, ""highlighting the company's broadening cross-selling and up-selling opportunities.""In Q1, CyberArk also doubled its sales in its government, health care, retail, media and education segments. License revenue grew 38% vs. the year-earlier quarter, trailing 50% growth in the maintenance and professional services business.

254,KIM,"Nuclear Attack: After more than seven years in office, President Obama, who in 2007 promised to ""eliminate North Korea's nuclear weapons program"" with ""a strong international coalition,"" now proposes shooting down their ICBMs. Reality detonates late.The North Korean nuclear threat to the U.S. homeland was going to be a piece of cake for a charismatic genius like Barack Obama.In a much-lauded 2007 article for Foreign Affairs magazine, then-Sen. Obama charged that President George W. Bush ""belittled South Korean efforts to improve relations with the North"" and promised that as president he would ""work to forge a more effective framework in Asia that goes beyond bilateral agreements, occasional summits, and ad hoc arrangements, such as the six-party talks on North Korea.""In retrospect, those six-party talks Obama disparaged, in which the Bush administration got China, South Korea, Japan and Russia to unite in pressuring North Korea, were the most effective diplomatic engagement with Pyongyang in history.We bought the closure of North Korea's nuclear facilities with both oil and the prospect of normalizing diplomatic relations. But three months into Obama's presidency, Pyongyang pulled out, no doubt sensing the weakness of America's dovish new president.Candidate Obama had promised to ""develop a strong international coalition to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons and eliminate North Korea's nuclear weapons program."" The key, Obama argued, was ""sustained, direct, and aggressive diplomacy -- the kind that the Bush administration has been unable and unwilling to use.""But as president, the furthest Obama ever got with North Korea is a food aid agreement in 2012 that collapsed within a month when youthful dictator Kim Jong Un ordered a three-stage ballistic missile test. The president's approach has since shifted from working to build that ""strong international coalition"" that will ""eliminate North Korea's nuclear weapons program"" to ... crossing his fingers.""Over time you will see a regime like this collapse"" because ""the Internet, over time, is going to be penetrating this country,"" Obama assured YouTube creators Bethany Mota, GloZell Green and Hank Green in January.CBS on Tuesday broadcast an interview in which Obama told Charlie Rose that he is ""setting up a shield that can at least block the relatively low-level threats"" North Korea is ""posing now."" That's funny, because shortly after taking office in 2009 Obama scrapped the proposed U.S. anti-nuclear missile shield to protect Poland and the Czech Republic from Russia and Iran. And he's cut billions from missile defense programs.Moreover, liberals tried to strangle the very concept of missile defense at birth. When President Ronald Reagan in 1983 announced his Strategic Defense Initiative, Sen. Ted Kennedy accused the ex-movie star of basing ""national policy on fond memories of radio serials, dreams of the Old West, and the thrilling days of yesteryear."" Reagan's ""Star Wars"" was ""the preposterous notion of a Lone Ranger in the sky, firing silver laser bullets and shooting missiles out of the hands of Soviet outlaws,"" Kennedy declared.President Obama now promises to shoot nuclear missiles out of the hands of North Korean outlaws. President Bush's cowboy diplomacy worked better.
"
255,KIM,"Donald Trump's wise and humanitarian move to reinstate the Reagan-era ""Mexico City policy,"" which prohibits U.S. foreign-aid dollars from going to non-government organizations that perform or provide referrals for abortions, has incited a torrent of liberal outrage.Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire seethed that the edict ""(favors) ideological politics over women and families."" Yet she favors a policy that requires Americans to fund activities they find morally offensive. So much for ""pro-choice.""The restoration of the Mexico City policy is a great start, but Trump should take a much bolder step: Stop all non-emergency foreign aid now. Virtually every poll of the last two decades shows that voters hate foreign aid, for good reason.The programs don't work to bring development to Nigeria or Mexico City anymore than domestic-aid programs have revived inner-city Detroit or Milwaukee.Why are American taxpayers funding birth control or, for that matter, any overseas family-planning programs in foreign countries? We can't even afford our own government health programs, yet we are supposed to fund condom-distribution programs in Asia and Africa?Foreign aid, when including military aid, costs up to $50 billion a year. Liberals say this is a trivial amount given that the entire federal budget exceeds $4 trillion. How is $500 billion over a decade trivial?One of the world's experts on foreign aid is William Easterly, an economist at New York University. He has noted that the developed countries could save as many as 5 million deaths from malaria and other preventable infectious diseases at a cost of less than $5 per life saved. This would simply require bed netting and cheap medicines. But it doesn't happen.Meanwhile, Easterly notes, the Western world spent almost 25 times this amount — over $2 trillion from 1950 to 2000 — on foreign aid. And what did it buy for all this spending?As Easterly puts it: ""The West spent $2.3 trillion and still had not managed to get $4 bed nets to poor families."" This is almost an inhumanely irresponsible misallocation of taxpayer dollars.Or think about this: According to the Cato Institute, ""Since the 1960s, sub-Saharan Africa has received nearly $500 billion in aid, yet the region has become poorer in the past several decades."" The Cato Institute's analysis found that aid spending in Africa is negatively correlated with development.Why do these programs so tragically fail? One reason is that the money flows through organizations and advocacy groups that are often hostile to free enterprise.Government bureaucrats are the problem, not the solution, in poor nations. They are corrupt and intercept money and spend it on themselves.The West put tens of billions of dollars behind Millennium Development Grants to try to bring economic development to the former Soviet Union nations, but the aid had almost no effect in bringing prosperity.Just as the welfare state here at home has created cycles of poverty in families, aid abroad fosters dependency, not self-sufficiency. Local initiatives don't take shape, because the attitude is that the foreigners will take care of the busted pipe or the downed power lines.How did India and China and other Asian Tiger nations develop so quickly? As the Heritage Foundation's Index of Economic Freedom points out, they moved to free-market economics at a rapid pace and shed governmental controls.To paraphrase Heritage Foundation economist Anthony Kim: These nations privatized state-owned enterprises, encouraged entrepreneurship and cut taxes and red tape.America should be exporting sound economic ideas — free-market capitalism — not taxpayer dollars. It's time to stop funding the vast foreign-aid empire that has gotten rich off of other people's misery.If the returns for certain aid programs are as positive for women across the globe as Sen. Shaheen and others think they are, then surely there are millionaire donors who will pick up the tab for groups such as Planned Parenthood.But let's see if any of these programs can pass a market test and persuade charitable donors to fund their activities. The left would rather lobby Congress. Maybe that is because there is no real value — and these programs do more harm than good.The best way to promote prosperity abroad is to fix America's problems first. Then we can serve as a beacon of freedom and opportunity for nations around the globe. If we lead, the rest of the world will follow.

256,KIM,"Some real estate amenities are eternal — a sweeping view across Central Park, for instance, or a doorman who knows your favorite driver. Others, though, might prove unexpectedly faddish: What seems like a must-have today could vanish in the developments of tomorrow. Here are four surprising staples of the luxury real estate market that insider experts predict could soon become obsolete.The home theater market stateside stood at $1.4 billion in 2015, up more than 50% since the same period in 2010, per Cedia, a trade association for home technology companies. Of course, it's no longer enough to install a supersize screen and digital projector: True cinephiles can build their own $1 million personal Imax theater and sign up for Prima Cinema, a Netflix-like service for the 1% that allows rentals of first-run movies at $500 a pop.It could prove to a shortsighted investment, though, at least according to architect Duan Tran of KAA Design. ""Our clients are requesting fully immersive, VR environments because they're super-busy and want the highest forms of escapism,"" Tran confides by phone from his office in Los Angeles.One current project, commissioned by a man the architect calls ""a real techie, who likes to geek out,"" involved simply stripping down the erstwhile maid's room in his home, turning it into a 20-foot-by-20-foot shell as the venue for his own personal Holodeck. ""There, he can throw on a pair of VR goggles and immerse himself completely. Imagine taking a walk on the beach in the Bahamas, or a walk down to the Arc de Triomphe on Saturday afternoon before dinner.""Tech advances have propelled this blue-sky idea into brick-and-mortar reality, such as the relatively affordable VR cubes and screens from such companies as Virtalis. Tran explains that changing building codes in overbuilt areas such as L.A. could also have an effect moving this forward. ""They're starting to restrict the size of houses, so when clients request bells and whistles — a 20-car garage, say — we need to be more efficient with space,"" he says. ""Right now, you might need to have 1,000 square feet dedicated to a home theater,"" but in the future, ""it could be a 6-foot-by-6-foot room for the same programming.""Sprawling master suites were once the ultimate trophy asset in a luxury home, but recent developments have begun replacing the open-plan, loft-like rooms with a complex of private chambers, jigsawed together around a smaller, cozy space that's home solely to a bed. Douglas Elliman's Roy Kim points to Miami's Rem Koolhas-designed Park Grove as an example. ""You'll see an antechamber, like a study, or a library, plus a large dressing area and a spalike bathroom,"" Kim says by phone from California. ""You no longer want to walk unceremoniously into a master bedroom and see the bed — creating privacy is more important than ever.""Jonah Disend, founder of innovation firm Redscout, explains further: ""The concept of a master bedroom is becoming obsolete because we have a different relationship with sleep now — we don't hang out in the bedroom the way we used to."" Disend notes that millennials are driving this shift. Their relationship with privacy is radically different from those of the generations preceding them — though digitally nonchalant, they're prudish in person.""Millennials don't like to get naked — if you go to the gym now, everyone under 30 will put their underwear on under the towel, which is a massive cultural shift,"" he continues. As gym designers are adapting, so are condo developers. ""They want their own changing rooms and bathrooms, even in a couple.""The same instinct is driving the renewed boom in so-called accessory apartments, typically a second, studio home purchased by wealthy couples in the same luxury development where they live, so that boomeranging 20-somethings can enjoy full privacy when moving back in with mom and dad.Even when they live with peers, these new privacy preferences are changing the layout of apartments, according to Teresa Ruiz of SB Architects. ""We're seeing a shift in household formation, with a lot of cohabitation by renters,"" she says by phone from her office in San Francisco. For one local developer, Avalon, Ruiz says the average age of a renter is 30 years old, with an average income of $300,000. ""The private space they want may be smaller, but they want a larger unit as a whole, so we're making two bedrooms with a den and an extra bathroom."" Translation: They'll share a sofa but are squeamish if ever asked to split the sink.According to the number-crunchers at McKinsey, ride-sharing and driverless cars will reduce the space allocated to parking vehicles by 25% come 2050, a reduction that represents more than 61 billion square feet of extra living room. And we're already seeing buildings that anticipate this shift, says Joel Dixon of real estate startup Compass. For example, floor-to-ceiling heights in garages are increasing, to make it easier to convert parking spots to office or residential use at a later time. Likewise, footprints are shrinking so that every corner receives natural light — again, essential for adaptive reuse. Elsewhere, future-proofed buildings with flexible spaces that allow garages to be repurposed are already appearing.""Parking floors aren't angled with ramps as they used to be, either,"" Joel adds, by phone from his office in New York. ""Instead, they use speed bumps to slow traffic, which is also much easier to adapt for future reuse.""L.A. was a pioneer of this shift, thanks to the Adaptive Reuse Ordinance of the 1990s. To encourage development of vacant commercial buildings into housing, these rules exempted buildings from onerous minimum parking requirements — and so prepped the luxury homes within for the shared-ride boom. In Miami, Herzog & de Meuron's 1111 Lincoln Road fuses residential, office, retail, and parking in a single structure, the idea being that as zoning requirements evolve, autonomous vehicle use increases, and behavior patterns shift, the building would be able to react. Likewise, at Government Center in Boston, a 2,130-vehicle parking garage will be replaced by two 500-foot luxury towers — with only 600 spaces open to the public.Of course, as garages shrink, one related amenity is expanding: With more vehicles lining up to wait or drop residents at home, a lavish driveway is more essential than ever.According to Redscout's Disend, elaborate, centerpiece kitchens, like master suites, are another amenity on the endangered list in high-end homes. In part, it's because delivery services such as Blue Apron or Amazon Prime Now will minimize the need to store anything but the bare minimum at home, coupled with such new amenities as centralized cooking and catering within a development. Take Rafael Vinoly's 437 Park Avenue, where Michelin-starred chef Shaun Hergatt will operate a residents-only restaurant, providing the ultimate in luxury takeout.Disend also identifies the rise of 3D printing as fundamental to this change. ""Soon — I'd expect around two or three years' time — you will be able to create specific housewares for a dinner party when you throw it,"" he says, minimizing the need for storage; Disend himself has even invested directly in 3D printing startup Othr for exactly these reasons. If 3D printers for food ever pass the gimmick phase, future homeowners may be able to dispense with the cooking entirely.And where would you put that printer? Well, an ""appliance garage,"" which Elliman's Kim predicts will replace the open-plan showcase kitchen. ""We're recommending appliance garages in our upcoming projects, a place to put your espresso maker, juicer, and anything that might clutter the countertop or cause smells, a bit like a mini version of the chef's kitchen.""MORE ABOUT HOME DESIGN:Trending Home Improvement Projects For 2017Features That Sell A Home Faster, And For MoreThese Outdoor Remodels Add The Most Curb Appeal And ValueDevelopers Set Sights On Bathrooms With A View

257,KIM,"General Motors (GM) on Tuesday announced a $1 billion U.S. investment plan comprised mostly of spending on models and plants long in the works, becoming the latest automaker to answer to pressure from President-elect Donald Trump to create jobs.The nation's top carmaker will add or retain about 7,000 salaried and hourly workers, including almost 2,000 in domestic factories, spokesman Pat Morrissey said. The announcement was accelerated after Trump urged the company last week to follow Ford Motor (F) and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCAU) and detail U.S. spending plans, said a person familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified because the matter was private.Earlier Tuesday, Korea's Hyundai Motor and Kia Motors said they'll increase U.S. investment over the next five years and consider building a new plant in the country. Trump praised Ford and Fiat Chrysler last week for plans to spend on U.S. factories after threatening for months to slap Mexico-built vehicles with a 35% import tax.The president-elect is taking credit mostly for expenditures that the companies had already planned, according to Maryann Keller, an independent auto industry consultant based in Stamford, Conn.""This is the normal course of business,"" Keller said of GM. ""All they're doing is announcing investments that they would have made anyway.""Carmakers are eager to cooperate with the incoming administration as they prepare to ask for favors including weaker fuel economy rules and lower corporate taxes. And the auto industry isn't alone: Wal-Mart Stores (WMT) will create about 10,000 retail jobs, the country's largest private employer said Tuesday.Less than two minutes into his first formal news conference since the election, Trump highlighted Ford's decision to cancel a $1.6 billion factory in Mexico and expand an existing plant in Michigan. Fiat Chrysler committed $1 billion toward making three new Jeeps in the U.S. and enabling a Michigan facility to manufacture a Ram pickup now produced in Mexico. He said he hoped GM would follow.""With all of the jobs I am bringing back into the U.S. (even before taking office), with all of the new auto plants coming back into our country and with the massive cost reductions I have negotiated on military purchases and more, I believe the people are seeing 'big stuff,' "" Trump wrote in a series of tweets Tuesday.GM will begin to bring axle production for its next-generation full-size pickups to operations in Michigan, including work previously done in Mexico, creating 450 U.S. jobs, the company said Tuesday. About 1,500 workers will be added or retained at factories detailed during the course of the year, and the company will add about 5,000 employees to develop advanced technology or join its lending subsidiary GM Financial.The automaker budgets about $9 billion a year toward capital expenditures, including for new models and factory upgrades. The U.S. is no longer the biggest market in the world for the Detroit-based company — that title goes to China, where it plans to introduce 18 new or refreshed vehicles this year.The automaker announced at least $2.9 billion in U.S. investment in 2016, bringing its total since 2009 to $29 billion.Trump targeted GM earlier this month for importing a small number of Chevrolet Cruze hatchback models from Mexico to the U.S. The company has made separate recent announcements that it would permanently cut 3,300 jobs at three passenger-car plants and temporarily slow production at five factories in states including Michigan and Ohio, due to slack demand.GM also continues to invest in Mexico. In late 2014, the company said it would spend $5 billion on new plants in the country by 2018, creating 5,600 jobs. Facilities making the Chevrolet Equinox and GMC Terrain, shown last week at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit, account for about $1 billion of those outlays.The auto industry has been in Trump's cross hairs. He's threatened Japan's Toyota Motor (TM) and Germany's BMW with tariffs on Mexico-made cars. BMW sees "" no reason"" to change plans, said Peter Schwarzenbauer, who heads the automaker's Mini and Rolls-Royce brands and its car-sharing business.Hyundai and its affiliate Kia said Tuesday that they plan to invest $3.1 billion in the U.S. over the next five years, up from $2.1 billion spent in the five years through 2016.South Korea's two largest automakers group may produce Hyundai's upscale Genesis vehicles and a U.S.-specific SUV in the country, said President Chung Jin-haeng, who also oversees strategic planning for Kia.""We expect a boost in the U.S. economy and increased demand for various models as President-elect Trump follows through on his promise to create 1 million jobs in five years,"" Chung said. ""We will actively consider introducing new models that have increasing demand and profits.""Hyundai has been considering expanding its plant in Montgomery, Ala., which produces the Sonata and Elantra sedans and Santa Fe crossover. The factory is running at its top capacity of 370,000 cars a year. Kia's factory in West Point, Ga., is also at full tilt, producing 360,000 units of the Optima sedan and Sorento SUV a year.Hyundai and Kia have no additional plans to invest in Mexico and won't transfer production or jobs from the U.S. to Mexico, according to a Hyundai spokesman.Kia opened a new $3 billion, 200,000 unit-a-year production line in Mexico two months before the U.S. presidential election. The company plans to increase capacity there to 300,000 units this year and to 400,000 vehicles by the end of 2018.""When automakers such as Toyota announced their new strategies in response to the so-called Trump risk, the industry was nervous and asked 'Who's next?',"" said Kim Jin-woo, an analyst at Korea Investment & Securities in Seoul. ""This is positive news that came at the right time as the automakers were facing capacity constraints in the U.S.""

258,KIM,"You can kick the can down the road, but when Kim Jong Un announces, as he did last Sunday, that ""we have reached the final stage in preparations to test-launch an intercontinental ballistic rocket,"" you are reaching the end of that road.Since the early 1990s, we have offered every kind of inducement to get North Korea to give up its nuclear program. All failed miserably. Pyongyang managed to extort money, food, oil and commercial nuclear reactors in exchange. But it was all a swindle. North Korea was never going to give up its nukes because it sees them as the ultimate guarantee of regime survival.The North Koreans believe that nukes confer inviolability. Saddam Hussein was invaded and deposed before he could acquire them. Kim won't let that happen to him. That's why Thae Yong Ho, a recent high-level defector, insisted that ""As long as Kim Jong Un is in power, North Korea will never give up its nuclear weapons, even if it's offered $1 trillion or $10 trillion in rewards.""Meanwhile, they have advanced. They've already exploded a handful of nuclear bombs. And they've twice successfully launched satellites, which means they have the ICBM essentials. If they can miniaturize their weapons to fit on top of the rocket and control re-entry, they'll be able to push a button in Pyongyang and wipe out an American city.What to do? The options are stark:(1) Pre-emptive attack on its missile launching facilities. Doable but reckless. It is the option most likely to trigger an actual war. The North Koreans enjoy both conventional superiority and proximity: a vast army poised at the Demilitarized Zone only 30 miles from Seoul. Americans are not going to fight another land war in Asia.(2) Shoot down the test ICBM, as advocated by The Wall Street Journal. Assuming we can. Democrats have done their best to abort or slow down anti-missile defenses since Ronald Reagan proposed them in the early 1980s. Even so, we should be able to intercept a single, relatively primitive ICBM of the sort North Korea might be capable of.Though such a shoot-down would occur nowhere near North Korean soil, it could still very well provoke a military response. Which is why the new administration should issue a clear warning that if such a test missile is launched, we will bring it down. Barack Obama is gone. Such a red line could be a powerful deterrent.(3) Return tactical U.S. nuclear weapons to South Korea. They were withdrawn in 1991 by George H.W. Bush in the waning days of the Cold War. Gorbachev's Soviet Union responded in kind. A good idea in general, but not on the Korean Peninsula. Pyongyang had railed constantly against their presence, but they did act as a deterrent to any contemplated North Korean aggression. Which might make them a useful bargaining chip.(4) Economic leverage on China, upon which Pyongyang depends for its survival. Donald Trump seems to suggest using trade to pressure China to get North Korea to desist. The problem is that China has shown no evidence of being willing to yield a priceless strategic asset — a wholly dependent client state that acts as a permanent thorn and distraction to U.S. power in the Pacific Rim — because of mere economic pressure.(5) Strategic leverage on China. We've been begging China for decades to halt the North Korean nuclear program. Beijing plays along with sanctions and offers occasional expressions of dismay. Nothing more. There's one way guaranteed to get its attention. Declare that we would no longer oppose Japan acquiring a nuclear deterrent.This is a radical step that goes against our general policy of nonproliferation. But the point is to halt proliferation to the infinitely more dangerous regime in North Korea. China is the key. The Chinese have many nightmares, none worse than a nuclear-armed Japan.The principal strategic challenge facing the United States is the rise of revisionist powers — Russia, China and Iran — striving to expel American influence from their regions. In comparison, the Korean problem is minor, an idiosyncratic relic of the Cold War.  North Korea should be a strategic afterthought, like Cuba. And it would be if not for its nukes.That's a big if. A wholly unpredictable, highly erratic and often irrational regime is acquiring the capacity to destroy an American city by missile. That's an urgent problem.North Korea may be just an unexploded ordnance of a long-concluded Cold War. But we cannot keep assuming it will never go off.

He presented both sides of the case before showing a comical ad his show made for Apple in the company's signature style.On Tuesday, Apple and the Justice Department will face off in a federal court in Riverside, Calif., over whether the government can compel Apple to hack its iPhone security protections for a criminal investigation.Meanwhile, comedian Remy made a music video parodying the Apple-FBI legal battle to the tune of ""Hotline Bling"" by Drake. His version, called ""iPhone Bling,"" was done for Reason magazine.The case also was the subject of online comics by the Joy of Tech and the Onion.America’s late-night comics found other tech industry subjects to mock in addition to the Apple-FBI case. Those targets included Amazon.com (AMZN), Facebook (FB) and Spotify.What follows are recent jokes from Jimmy Fallon, Conan O’Brien, Jimmy Kimmel and Stephen Colbert.Fallon: Selena Gomez just became the most-followed person on Instagram with almost 70 million followers. When reached for comment, Kim Kardashian said, “I can’t get any more naked, guys. I’ve shown you everything I got.”Fallon: Spotify released a birthing playlist with songs to help women in labor. It includes artists such as John Legend. I guess ladies are like, “Hey, his music got into me this mess. Might as well get me out of this mess.”Fallon: And this is just crazy here. I saw that some researchers at Stanford University have made tiny robots that are modeled after bugs, and found that six of them could actually move a car weighing almost two tons. While two REAL New York cockroaches can actually flip the car over and set it on fire. “Come on – let’s go mug a delivery guy!”Fallon: Amazon just filed a patent for technology that allows customers to “pay by selfie,” where customers can verify purchases by taking a selfie. In related news, the Kardashians just went bankrupt. (That’s all it took!)Conan: It’s come out that Kim Kardashian has paid off Kanye West’s $53 million debt with proceeds from her video game. In case you’re unfamiliar, Kim’s video game is named “Call of Booty.”Conan: A private space company founded by Amazon chief Jeff Bezos plans to send humans into space by next year. Or if they sign up for Amazon Prime, by Tuesday.Kimmel: Facebook has reportedly patented software that recognizes new slang words when they’re posted. The software stores the words in what they call a social glossary while they’re current, then removes the words once they’re no longer popular. I wish Facebook would spend less time with stuff like cataloging new slang and more time trying to stop the monsters who keep inviting me to like their homemade jewelry page.Colbert: Amazon’s got this new voice-activated home assistant gadget called the Echo. You just talk to the Echo, and it tells you the weather or sports scores or controls the lighting or climate in your house. Now, the Echo is always listening, but it only activates when you say its name: Alexa. It’s a pretty name, much prettier than the earlier name, the privacy-destroyer Spy-Mike 5000.

261,KIM,"You don't hear it much anymore, but a longtime rallying cry of anti-Communists was ""Get the U.S. out of the U.N. Get the U.N. out of the U.S."" Under President Reagan, our U.N ambassador, Jeane Kirkpatrick, ""removed the kick-me sign"" from America's back, as she liked to put it, and we found ways of using the corrupt, opulent hangout on the East River, workplace of so many tyrants' henchmen masquerading as diplomats, to the advantage of the free world.Kirkpatrick's devastating audio-visual presentation in the Security Council calling the Soviet Union to account as the world watched on TV for the Korean Air Lines shootdown in 1983, killing 269, including a Georgia congressman, was a perfect example of a case in which it was better to have the UN than not have it.In the aftermath, however, Kirkpatrick's deputy, Charles Lichtenstein, famously remarked that if the U.N. ever did choose to take its headquarters away from U.S. soil, ""the members of the U.S. mission to the United Nations will be down at the dockside waving you a fond farewell as you sail off into the sunset.""Then as now, U.N. resolutions are little more than words when not backed up by American power.

We may have recovered from our costly, devastating defeat in Vietnam, but the repercussions of our needless defeats in Iraq and Afghanistan, and the terrorist gains that resulted, have yet to be fully revealed.What good is a U.N. that can't even bring itself to impose sanctions on Iran, the world's foremost terrorist state, after it launches nuclear-capable missiles adorned with a ""destroy Israel"" message -- instead mulling an ineffectual written reprimand? It turns out that last July's resolution covering missile launches, which was passed in sync with President Obama's nuclear deal with Iran, contained ambiguous language making it unclear whether Tehran violated it. At first the Obama administration charged that the fanatical Islamist state had violated the U.N. resolution, but now the official U.S. line has been softened.Declarations from the U.N. don't shame aggressors into backing down -- not unless buttressed by a credible threat from America of force of one kind of another. The Security Council's words only work when they serve as the Pentagon's calling card.So Iran will continue, especially in the wake of the nuclear pact, to launch ballistic missiles, and use the tens of billions of dollars the agreement gives it to expand its sponsorship of terrorism directed against Israel and the U.S. Similarly, North Korea, which may now have the hydrogen bomb, will not be cowed into ceasing its nuclear-capable missile launches by U.N condemnations. The efficacy of sanctions is limited when it comes to regimes that care little about the economic well-being of their own people, and don't have to worry about being elected out of office.One can imagine North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un in fits of laughter hearing U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, a South Korean and thus automatic enemy of Pyongyang, calling on North Korea to ""halt these inflammatory and escalatory actions.""With a strong America available in the wings, the U.N.'s impotent pronouncements have for seven decades been a kind of game; the U.S. military was the real deterrent to aggression. If, however, we really do ""get the U.S. out of the U.N."" in the sense of the U.N. being exposed, absent credible U.S. force, as nothing more than a corrupt hot air factory, the likes of Iran and North Korea may so humiliate the purported ""one great hope for a peaceful and free world,"" it may not just ""get out of the U.S.""; it may go out of existence altogether.

262,KIM,"Wasn't one vapid pretty boy named Justin from Canada enough?At least Justin Bieber is eye candy without the heartburn. Justin Trudeau, on the other hand, is the twinkly-eyed boy toy who makes informed adults wanna hurl.For more than a year, the liberal Canadian prime minister enjoyed drool-stained global press coverage as the ""hot hipster"" and ""dreamy sex symbol"" with great hair and a tribal Haida tattoo. He basked in Ryan Gosling-esque memes about his commitment to feminism and touched off ""Trudeau-mania"" with a series of shirtless selfies and photobombs.But this weekend, the sane world saw the baby-faced Commie apologist for the naked twit he truly is.Mourning the death of repressive dictator Fidel Castro, Trudeau hailed his longtime family friend as a ""larger than life leader"" who ""served his people for almost half a century."" Actually, El Comandante ruled with an iron fist and firing squads — serving himself to all of the island's land, private businesses and media, along with his own private yacht, private island, 20 homes, fleet of Mercedes limos and bevy of mistresses.Trudeau's ridiculous mash note to the ""legendary revolutionary and orator"" caused the social media backlash of the year. The hashtag #TrudeauEulogies erupted to mock Trudeau's soft-soaping of tyranny.""As we mourn Emperor Caligula, let us always remember his steadfast devotion to Senate reform,"" one Twitter user jibed in Trudeau-speak.""Although flawed Hitler was a vegetarian who loved animals, was a contributor to the arts & proud advocate for Germany,"" another joked.""Kim Jong Il will always be remembered fondly for his leadership and contributions on climate change,"" another chimed in.Stung, the Canadian tundra hunk's office announced Monday that he will not attend services for his beloved Uncle Fidel, who had served as a pallbearer at his former Canadian PM father's funeral. But if Trudeau thinks the damage to his celebrity brand is temporary, he has another think coming.Our neighbors to the north are now discovering what disillusioned Barack Obama worshipers realized too late: Beneath the shiny packaging of supermodel progressivism lies the same old decrepit culture of corruption.Political watchdogs have been buzzing about Trudeau's shady fundraising ties to Chinese communist moguls. Like Obama, Trudeau promised unprecedented transparency in government — ""sunny ways"" that would shed open light on how the Liberal Party was conducting the people's business. Dudley Do-Right's party declared there would be ""no preferential access, or appearance of preferential access"" in exchange for campaign cash and purported to ban favor-seekers with direct business before the government from attending political fundraisers.Behind closed doors, however, Trudeau was selling out to wealthy Chinese-Canadians and Chinese nationals seeking government green lights for their business deals. According to his conservative critics, Trudeau and the Liberal Party have held 80 such cash-for-access fundraisers crawling with lobbyists and access traders over the past year.The Globe and Mail newspaper revealed last week that Trudeau and his Liberal Party fundraisers had secretly organized one tony $1,500-per-head private residential gala in May attended by Chinese billionaires and bankers gunning for federal approval of projects. Echoing the operations of the Clinton Foundation pay-for-play money machine, the nonprofit Trudeau Foundation and the University of Montreal raked in $1 million from a wealthy Chinese businessman a few weeks after the fundraiser. The donation includes funding for a statue of Pierre Trudeau, who once wrote a book hailing Chairman Mao.The self-aggrandizing Commie fanboy apple doesn't fall far from his cultural Marxist tree.

263,KIM,"Landlords on Manhattan's Fifth Avenue are sitting on a record amount of open space as retailers balk at committing to expensive new leases in one of the world's most prestigious shopping districts.The availability rate on the famed strip, home to Saks (SKS) Fifth Avenue and Tiffany & Co.'s (TIF)flagship store, jumped to 15.9% in the third quarter, up from about 10% a year earlier, according to Cushman & Wakefield. The rate has climbed steadily this year, surpassing the prior peak of 11.3%, set in the fourth quarter of 2014.The rise of empty storefronts isn't limited to Fifth Avenue. It's part of a Manhattan-wide space glut as retailers -- buffeted by e-commerce, tepid demand for luxury goods and a strong dollar that's eroded tourist spending -- push back against rents that have soared to records. Leasing costs have increased in tandem with property values in the past five years, outpacing gains in merchandise sales and making it impossible for retailers to run profitable stores at many locations, according to Richard Hodos, a vice chairman at brokerage CBRE Group (CBG).""Property trades are being based on achieving ever-higher rents, and nobody ever really looks at what retailers can afford to pay,"" Hodos said. ""In some cases, rents need to come down 30% or more for rents to be at levels where retailers are able to make sense of them again.""Retailers are being squeezed across the U.S. In 2016, malls and other types of shopping venues have been hit by 280 major-brand store closures, totaling 12.8 million square feet (1.2 million square meters), data from Reis (REIS) show. Another real estate research firm, Green Street Advisors, estimates that several hundred malls around the country will cease operations over the next decade.Shoppers continue to shift their spending from stores to computers and smartphones. Online sales in the U.S. are expected to reach $398 billion this year, up 16% from 2015, according to research firm eMarketer.On the stretch of Fifth Avenue from 49th to 60th streets, which commands the world's highest rents, landlords are asking an average of $3,213 a square foot, up from $2,075 a square foot in 2011, Cushman data show. In the tourist-heavy Times Square area, rents stand at $2,104 a square foot after tripling over a four-year period.The brokerage's retail availability rate takes into account vacancies as well as stores occupied by merchants that plan to leave when their leases expire. Retailers that signed leases at high prices in the past several years and are seeking a tenant to sublease their space are also included, according to Steve Soutendijk, an executive director at Cushman.""Tenants that signed at the absolute top of the market are looking to mitigate their exposure,"" he said.At 667 Madison Ave., a 24-story tower two blocks from Central Park, Michael Kors Holdings (KOR) is looking to sublease about 5,000 square feet of retail space at the base of the building, according to a person familiar with the plans. The store, with 22-foot ceilings, was the company's largest when it opened in 2012, the New York Times reported at the time.Four years later, the London-based fashion house is struggling to pay the rent, said the person, who asked not to be identified because negotiations aren't public. Michael Kors is seeking a tenant to take over the space on a lease that runs through 2023, the person said.A spokeswoman for Michael Kors declined to comment. Representatives for the company's landlord, Hartz Group, didn't respond to calls and emails seeking comment.Property owners with space to fill are starting to lower their expectations, according to Cushman's Soutendijk. Asking rents in some of Manhattan's prime shopping districts, including Soho and Times Square, have declined over the course of 2016, Cushman data show.""I think a lot of landlords are ready to make deals,"" Soutendijk said. ""Everybody understands there is too much space in the market. We are not in a state of equilibrium.""Buyers of real estate during the recent boom years may not have much room to maneuver. To justify paying record prices for buildings -- and the debt that financed the acquisitions -- owners are under pressure to get the highest rents possible, according to Patrick Smith, a vice chairman of the retail brokerage at Jones Lang LaSalle (JLL).""Typically, a building that has been capitalized over the past three years is very rent-sensitive,"" he said.Landlords who hold out for the right tenant can be left hanging on to empty space for years. A partnership of developer Thor Equities and General Growth Properties, the second-largest owner of U.S. malls, bought 530 Fifth Ave. in 2014. During a conference call with analysts that year, General Growth Chief Executive Officer Sandeep Mathrani highlighted the property's large, vacant block as an opportunity to attract new retailers.No new retail leases have been signed at the property since the acquisition, though three tenants are close to agreements, according to a person with knowledge of the plans. The prospective occupants are in the health-and-beauty and sporting-goods businesses, and will likely pay less in rent than what the building owners had originally aimed for, said the person, who asked not to be identified because negotiations are ongoing.Representatives for Thor and General Growth declined to comment on plans for the property. The building sits between 44th and 45th Streets, several blocks south of Fifth Avenue's most-sought-after addresses. The availability rate in the area has climbed to 29%, Cushman data show.Manhattan's empty storefronts will eventually be absorbed, according to Smith of Jones Lang. The way space is used may change to focus more on the experience than just the merchandise -- for example, Lululemon Athletica (LULU) offers yoga classes in its stores -- but New York will always be a magnet for retailers and shoppers, he said.""Will Fifth Avenue, which has been a multigenerational place to shop and has evolved over many, many decades, continue to be a successful place? Absolutely,"" Smith said. ""Will it look the same? No.""MORE ABOUT RETAIL PROPERTY:J.C.

264,KIM,"In every home she designs, Clodagh is known for her focus on sustainability and nature; above all, she's uncompromising in her efforts to bring the outdoors inside. And the Irish-born interiors expert (yes, she goes by one name only) believes there's one room in which such connections with nature are more impactful than anywhere else in a home. ""I always suggest designing bathrooms with a view,"" she told us by phone from her office in New York. ""That's a room, remember, that used to be called a water closet, because it was so tucked away. But you spend eight or 10 hours in there a week, and it's one of the places where you can refresh, renew and get natural light. The skin is the largest organ on your body, and taking in natural light is very propitious for health and wellness.""Clodagh's own home offers a view of the outdoors from every amenity, be it tub, sauna, shower or toilet; for clients, she finds ingenious ways to provide a view, such as a skylight so ""you can lie in the tub and look at the sky."" Recently, she even insisted on blasting a large hole in the load-bearing exterior wall of a client's house in Miami, giving the rain shower a view over the inland waterway. ""I'm not nicknamed the Demolition Queen for nothing,"" she laughed.Clodagh isn't alone. Increasingly, whether in luxury developments or private homes, the design and location of a bathroom is no longer an afterthought. What was once a handy way to maximize dead square footage that remained after the rest of the living space was mapped out has become a stand-alone selling point. High-end developments now place bathrooms in prime locations, where they can enjoy maximum light and the best-possible views.The wet rooms in Jean Nouvel's 100 11th Ave. in New York, for example — heavily featured on Bravo TV's ""Million Dollar Listing"" — have huge, picture-frame inspired windows that, quite literally, turn the views of the city into wall art. Converting the 1929 Walker Tower into contemporary condos included expanding the windows and installing a huge tub in front of the south-facing views, while the poured concrete tubs in John Pawson and Ian Schrager's 215 Chrystie St. are also positioned to overlook the best aspects — in this case, the Chrysler Building. The wet rooms in Rafael Vinoly's 432 Park Ave. are enormous, with almost an entire wall of glass where the vanities sit. ""Even today, Vinoly will tell me it's his favorite bathroom in the city,"" explained Roy Kim, who worked on the project and is now chief creative officer at Elliman, by phone from Milan.Likewise, when developer Kevin Maloney began master-planning his new Cary Tamarkin-helmed tower in Soho, 10 Sullivan, one of his first considerations was where to put the master bathroom. ""In all the full-floor units of the building, it looks north, so that when you're soaking in the tub, there's the Empire State Building,"" Maloney said by phone from a construction site in Miami. ""A buyer walks in, and every time they see that, they'll say, 'Wow.' ""It isn't just New York buyers tub-thumping for bathroom vistas, though. In Miami's Oceana Bal Harbour, designed by local starchitect Bernardo Fort-Brescia, each of the 240 units has bathrooms placed specifically to capture views of the Atlantic Ocean or of the Miami skyline.Wet rooms first began morphing to flashy perches around a decade ago, when Gwathmey Siegel's Sculpture for Living building appeared on New York's Astor Place, according to Corcoran superbroker Julie Pham. Bathrooms with huge windows and stunning views, such as those in that development, weren't instant hits, though; Gwathmey Siegel's building famously struggled to attract tenants, in large part due to some of the goldfish bowl-like atmosphere its window-heavy design created. Pham says such concerns are rarely raised now, especially on any apartment with a price tag higher than $10 million.""The bathtub in front of a picturesque window? It's become iconic for the uberwealthy,"" she explained by phone from her office in New York. ""A bathroom with a view catapults you to the superluxury caliber, not just the everyday luxury class.""Elliman's Roy Kim believes an additional factor has contributed: the nesting instinct that's become more prominent since futurist Faith Popcorn first coined the concept of ""cocooning"" in the 1980s. (See also: Netflix-and-chill) ""People want to be comforted, to have a spalike experience in their own home. I call it super-cocooning,"" Kim noted.Consider, too, the influence of hospitality design, which often now provides touchstones for high-end real estate. The Signature Room at the John Hancock Center in Chicago, for example, is renowned as much for the views from the women's restroom as for its menu, while New York's Standard Hotel was an exhibitionist's haven in the Meatpacking District. Bathrooms in its rooftop bar were fitted with floor-to-ceiling windows that looked out over the city, curtain free — until waist-high screens were added three years after it opened. Such screens are recommended for many glass-fronted bathrooms, though some developments opt for a more high tech solution. See the late Zaha Hadid's building in the west of New York's Chelsea, for example: Its glass-encased bathrooms are fitted by Innovative Glass with smart walls that frost to opaque at the flip of a switch.Perhaps such steps are unnecessary, though. It's no coincidence that as privacy becomes less and less important (or even possible), exhibitionist bathrooms that offer views for both residents and neighbors are likely to become even more common. Not every buyer will be quite bold enough to embrace the layout at 737 Park Ave., though. The condos in this 1940s conversion feature bathrooms with an unexpected view: so-called dueling toilets — cisterns placed directly across from each other, so there's no need to leave your significant other's company for even a moment. It's certainly a bathroom with a view, if not one that will appeal to everyone.MORE ABOUT HIGH-END DEVELOPERS:Luxury-Condo Glut Leaves Developers Ready To Cut A DealDevelopers Rehab Rust Belt Relics Into Luxury HotelsAs Luxury Units Go Begging, Apartment Developers Lower Expectations

265,KIM,"Fasten your seatbelts:  The New Year has arrived — and with it, the Great Infrastructure Debate. In a time of when partisan rancor has reached record levels, infrastructure stands alone as a bipartisan refuge — one issue both parties can agree on.The economy seems to feel the same way. Mention infrastructure, and markets respond. Investors give cement and construction machinery stocks a pop, as visions of Eisenhower's Interstate Highway Program dance in their heads. Ribbons of steel and rebar, replacing roads and crumbing bridges built by FDR's Works Progress Administration mark infrastructure as the tonic to our anemic economy.But the sinews of what connects America in the 21st Century have changed. This isn't your grandfather's infrastructure: Bridges, tunnels and roads are just part of the story.Today, our infrastructure extends to the national power grid — currently a patchwork of lines, nodes and often antique switching towers we rely on to move energy to where we need it — to the internet itself, which has a physicality we easily overlook in this Age of the Cloud and Wireless. These systems, marvels that they are, come closer to tin-can-and-string contraptions than the modern version we would build if we began the work today.And both the internet and the energy grid must not only be rebuilt, but hardened, against the threat of EMP — Electro-Magnetic Pulse — whether ""man-caused,"" via a nuclear detonation in the Earth atmosphere by madcap Kim Jung-Un or via solar flares (nothing personal, Planet Earth!) which appear to be spiking now. Readers of Ted Koppel's ""Lights Out: cyberattack, A Nation Unprepared,"" a frightening exploration of our vulnerability to cyberattack on our energy and information grids, suggests that we are all just a matter of hours from a Hobbesian state of nature of ""all against all.""In fact, all of our progress to date has conspired to make us extremely vulnerable to an urban apocalypse. Very few of us will know how to cope with even the temporary loss of our cellphones, and we won't be able to ask Siri to ask for an app on how to purify rain water or set a squirrel trap for dinner. Far better to harden the Grid now than learn how we fare living without it.For projects of this scale, what is our shopping list? It includes some common materials and others decidedly less-so.For instance, we'll need copper, and lots of it. The bad news is that we are too often import-dependent. Our annual ""copper gap"" is 600,000 metric tons. We'll need more aluminum, where the U.S. is down to a single smelter. We will need graphite and manganese for next-gen energy storage systems; the U.S. currently produces zero graphite — the last American graphite mine closed 25 years ago — and zero manganese, relying on China and South Africa to fill our delivery orders. We'll need more cobalt, coming now from strife-riven DRC Congo, more rhenium from Kazakhstan. The list of unstable material suppliers is long.As we did in the long era of oil dependence, the U.S. will learn what it means to be on the wrong end of a materials monopoly. We will pay more for what we need, and — in cases where the metal in demand is needed for advanced military applications — we may well find critical military materials unavailable at any price.But this dystopia need not be our destiny. In the great geological lottery, the U.S. is resource-rich. We've simply spent the last several decades closing mines, and making it harder to open new ones. The USGS annual survey tells the tale: We are 100% import-dependent for 19 metals and minerals, and more than 50% import dependent for 43 metals in all. That's nearly half the Periodic Table of Elements — with many of our imports coming from China, others from Russia, and a grab-bag of autocratic regimes with questionable stability.So we will need new mines, and more than that, novel methods of metal recycling, too. It means getting over the pernicious mindset that 2017 America lives in a postindustrial age, a time when Americans are all ""symbolic analysts,"" tapping away at keyboards, creating wealth from ones-and-zeros, live-blogging streaming video and the like, no longer dependent of transforming real raw materials into things. That messy business has been off-shored to other places, happy to sell us what we need.But the rest of the world may have other thoughts in mind. They may balk at providing us the raw material tech-metals we need to fuel American economic dominance, preferring instead to up-process materials into manufactured products, sustaining local employment and a positive balance of trade.All of which means there's more to the infrastructure story than cement trucks and Jersey Barriers. Word is that the new infrastructure bill will exceed $1 trillion. Shoring up our infrastructure — broadly understood — is essential, and not just for jobs and GDP, but for the stuff modern dreams are made of — everything from the gadgets we use to occupy our time to the high-performance materials that power the weapons platforms that keep us safe.If we approach the Great Infrastructure Debate in this spirit, we could do even more than rebuild our roads, bridges and tunnels. We could build the foundation for a new American Century.

266,KIM,"For yuan bears, it's the worst kind of deja vu.As China's currency posts a record two-day rally offshore and skyrocketing interbank rates make short positions prohibitively expensive, memories of an epic squeeze last January are rushing back to bearish traders. The abrupt market reversal almost exactly a year ago marked the beginning of a nearly 5% rally that lasted two months.""Another extraordinary day in China,"" said Gareth Berry, a foreign-exchange and rates strategist at Macquarie Bank Ltd. in Singapore. ""It looks like a classic case of a consensus trade blowing up at the start of a new year.""The turbulence represents the latest twist in a battle between China bears — who say slowing economic growth makes a devaluation inevitable — and policymakers fearing a sudden drop will destabilize the financial system. Pessimists have mostly been on the right side of the trade since a one-time exchange rate adjustment in August 2015, but sudden bouts of strength have proved painful for short sellers who need to periodically roll over their bets.Derivatives markets show the extent to which some speculators were caught off guard. The extra cost of bearish options over bullish contracts posted its biggest three-day drop since May 2014, according to three-month risk reversal prices compiled by Bloomberg. Option-implied odds of the onshore rate hitting 7 per dollar in the first quarter tumbled to 36%, from 65% just two days ago.The onshore yuan gained 0.7% to 6.8830 per dollar in Shanghai, while the rate in Hong Kong extended its two-day advance to 2.5%. The city's overnight deposit rate touched a record 100%, while the spread between the offshore and onshore exchange rates reached the widest since 2010.""It's painful to sit on short yuan positions now, given the soaring funding costs,"" said Sim Moh Siong, a currency strategist at Bank of Singapore Ltd.While the role of government intervention in the latest squeeze is unclear, Bloomberg News reported this week that policymakers were encouraging state-owned enterprises to sell foreign currency. National Australia Bank Ltd. says bears are unlikely to see a major reprieve any time soon as authorities keep tight control of the yuan before this month's inauguration of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump.""There are no signs of the market loosening,"" said Ngan Kim Man, deputy head of treasury at China Everbright Bank Co.'s Hong Kong branch.The People's Bank of China has plenty of reasons to give the yuan some short-term support. Trump has pledged to label the country a currency manipulator on his first day in office, while the exchange rate came close to breaking through the psychologically important level of 7 per dollar earlier this week. Policymakers also want to avoid a flood of capital outflows as citizens' annual foreign-exchange quotas reset for the new year.""Judging from the speed of the yuan's appreciation, the PBOC may have intervened to prop up the exchange rate,"" said Kenix Lai, a Hong Kong-based foreign-exchange analyst at Bank of East Asia Ltd. ""The PBOC is expressing its strong determination to keep the currency stable and is seeking to restore confidence.""The central bank didn't immediately respond to a faxed request for comment sent outside regular business hours.Short squeezes like the one in Hong Kong's offshore market this week come at a cost. While surging interbank rates help deter bearish speculators, they also undermine China's push to make the yuan an international reserve currency, said Michael Every, head of financial markets research at Rabobank Group in Hong Kong.""What's the point of being a reserve currency and having fought so hard to become a reserve currency, and then not letting anybody get hold of that currency,"" he said. ""China basically wants to have its cake and eat it on all fronts.""Analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg suggest China will eventually let the yuan continue its descent. The exchange rate will fall to 7.15 per dollar by year-end before sliding to 7.3 the following year, according to the median projections.In the short term, though, the currency is unlikely to be a one-way wager, said Angus To, deputy head of research at ICBC International Research Ltd. in Hong Kong.""After this round of liquidity squeeze, speculators will at least scale down short yuan bets for the next two months,"" To said. ""We expect the offshore yuan to stabilize at around 6.8 yuan per dollar after the market run.""

269,KIM,"Enemies United: Fanatical North Korea's rocket launches the day after Iran's is a reminder that George W. Bush's ""axis of evil"" is alive, and more well than ever. They're testing not missiles, but America.North Korea on Thursday fired two ballistic missiles from its northern shore to targets over 3oo miles away. The provocative move came the day after Iran tested two long-range, nuclear-capable missiles adorned with the message that Israel be wiped from the face of the earth.It also came two days after North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un was pictured with what North Korea claimed was a miniaturized nuclear warhead that could be carried by a long-range ballistic missile. And the test comes in the wake of the United Nations Security Council imposing harsh, new punitive sanctions on the regime in response to its Jan. 6 underground detonation of what may have been a hydrogen bomb. Finally, North Korea's saber-rattling comes amidst joint U.S.- South Korean military exercises.The extent of economic globalization is well known, but we also now live in an age in which the military strategies of the enemies of the free world are linked from one side of the globe to the other. Not that there needs to be much grand scheming on the niceties of the aggression of the Ayatollah in Tehran, Kim in Asia, and terrorist entities ranging from the Islamic State caliphate to al-Qaida; fomenting destruction and mayhem don't have to be coordinated to be effective.President Bush in 2002 famously called North Korea, Iran, and Iraq under Saddam Hussein ""an axis of evil, arming to threaten the peace of the world,"" who in seeking weapons of mass destruction ""pose a grave and growing danger. They could provide these arms to terrorists, giving them the means to match their hatred. They could attack our allies or attempt to blackmail the United States. In any of these cases, the price of indifference would be catastrophic,"" Bush told Congress.A lot has changed in the 14 years since Barack Obama's immediate predecessor gave that warning. Saddam, whose original nuclear weapons program was bombed to oblivion by the Israelis in 1981, was ousted from Iraq in 2003. But after Obama withdrew U.S. forces, the barbaric ISIS emerged in Iraq and Syria, perhaps the most challenging terrorist threat the U.S. has ever faced. North Korea, meanwhile, now possesses the WMDs it was seeking; and Islamofascist Iran remains indefinitely on the threshold of developing nukes thanks to Obama's nuclear deal last year.With ISIS replacing Saddam, the Taliban on its way back to power in Afghanistan, and both North Korea and Iran testing nuclear-capable missiles, it's hard to argue that the Axis of Evil is not a greater threat in 2016 than it was in the years immediately after the Sept. 11th, 2001 attacks.The two spokes on that axis of North Korea and Iran, for their parts, have been working together for years to threaten the U.S. and other Western powers directly. Ballistic missile scientists and technicians in both countries have visited the other to share technology that could ultimately result in nuclear attack on targets thousands of miles from North Korea or Iran, including the U.S. homeland. Kim Yong-nam, a high-level North Korean official, has met with those at the very top of the Iranian regime, and both governments have explicitly stated that they are working together against the U.S.Multilateralism, in the form of self-congratulatory international sanctions and excessive faith in talks, will not stop these two enemies of America. Only an engaged, assertive U.S. that in the years ahead rebuilds from Obama's devastation of both our military and our global prestige, and shows itself ready to act, will.

273,KIM,"When Hong Kong-based financier Michael Nock wanted a place to escape in the wake of the 2008 global financial crisis, he looked beyond the traditional havens of the rich to a land at the edge of the world, where cows outnumber people 2-to-1.Nock, the founder of hedge fund firm Doric Capital, bought a retreat 5,800 miles away in New Zealand's picturesque Queenstown. In the seven years since, terror threats in Europe and political uncertainty from Britain to the U.S. have helped make the South Pacific nation — a day by air away from New York or London — a popular bolt-hole for the megawealthy.Isolation has long been considered New Zealand's Achilles' heel. That remoteness is turning into an advantage, however, with hedge-fund pioneer Julian Robertson to Russian steel titan Alexander Abramov and Hollywood director James Cameron establishing multimillion-dollar hideaways in the New Zealand countryside.""The thing that was always working against New Zealand — the tyranny of distance — is the very thing that becomes its strength as the world becomes more uncertain,"" Nock, 60, said by phone from Los Angeles during a recent business trip.Nock's five-acre estate is named ""Giverny"" after artist Claude Monet's iconic home and garden in northern France, and the ""funny old farmhouse"" is surrounded by ponds and mature plants, he said. Nock is converting a barn into an art studio on the property, which overlooks Queenstown's Shotover River — a fast-flowing, turquoise stretch of water that tourists speed down on jet boats and white-water rafts.Twice the size of England, but with less than a tenth of its people, New Zealand ranks high on international surveys of desirable places to live, placing among the top 10 for democracy, lack of corruption, peace and satisfaction. With its NZ$250 billion ($180 billion) economy dominated by farming and tourism, the nation last month overtook Singapore as the best country in the world to do business and was rated second to the Southeast Asian nation as the top place to live for expatriates in a survey by HSBC Holdings (ADR) in September.House prices in New Zealand increased 12.7% in the year through October, and the average price in largest city Auckland has almost doubled since 2007 to more than NZ$1 million.Jack Ma, founder of e-retailing behemoth Alibaba Group Holding (BABA) and China's richest man, told Prime Minister John Key in April that he'd like to buy a home in his country, according to the New Zealand Herald. At least 20 of Ma's 40-something colleagues have retired there, the newspaper said.Key, a former currency trader, once described New Zealand as ""England without the attitude."" It's changed leaders just twice in almost 17 years and the last hint of terrorism came a generation ago, when French spies bombed a Greenpeace campaigning ship docked in Auckland harbor in 1985.It's that kind of stability that's attracting a wave of Brexit-inspired migration to the island nation that gained prominence as the otherworldly backdrop to the ""Lord of the Rings"" and ""The Hobbit"" films.New Zealand received 998 registrations from U.K. nationals interested in moving to the country the day after the referendum on European Union membership, vs. 109 the day before the vote, according to data from the immigration department. That grew to 10,647 registrations in the 49 days after June 23, more than double the same period a year earlier.""If the world is going to go to hell in a hand basket, they're in the best place they could possibly be,"" said David Cooper, director of client services at Malcolm Pacific Immigration in Auckland, the country's biggest migration agency. ""People want to get the hell out of where they are and they feel that New Zealand is safe.""Cooper has seen an uptick in inquiries from U.S. citizens over the past few months, he said, with the raucous presidential contest, as well as the recent spate of mass shootings, cited as reasons to flee.""The world is heading into a major crisis,"" said internet entrepreneur Kim Dotcom in an Oct. 31 Twitter post. ""I saw it coming and that's why we moved to New Zealand. Far away & not on any nuclear target list."" The German-born founder of Megaupload was granted residency in 2010, but is now fighting attempts to extradite him to the U.S.Successful Kiwis who have worked in investment banking and other lucrative professions in New York and London are also returning home to raise their families, said Ollie Wall, an agent with Auckland-based Graham Wall Real Estate. The firm helped broker New Zealand's most expensive house sale in 2013, when a seven-bedroom mansion on the city's Paritai Drive was sold to a China-born businessman for NZ$39 million.""The world has got smaller,"" Wall said in an email. ""You can run multinational corporations from paradise now. So why wouldn't you?""Fidelity National Financial (FNFV) Chairman Bill Foley owns a luxury homestead in the Wairarapa region north of Wellington, and Julian Robertson, chairman of Tiger Management in New York, owns two of the nation's most prestigious golf courses and a luxury lodge overlooking Queenstown's Lake Wakatipu. He says New Zealand is ""the most beautiful place on Earth.""Billionaire Facebook (FB) backer Peter Thiel described New Zealand as a ""utopia"" in 2011 and is reported to have bought residential property in Auckland and Queenstown. Thiel and a spokesman for the PayPal (PYPL) co-founder didn't respond to emailed requests for comment.New Zealand has actively courted the wealthy. For an investment of NZ$10 million in local assets or funds over a three-year-period, migrants can qualify for residency provided they spent 44 days in New Zealand in each of the two latest years. These investors don't have to speak English or live for a set amount of time in the country after the qualification period. They also don't have to become tax residents.Since the program started six years ago, 121 people have gained so-called Investor Plus visas, and more than 800 have secured a residency pass that requires a NZ$1.5 million investment over four years, government data show.""It provides a bolt-hole, a place for 'just in case,' "" said Willy Sussman, a partner at Auckland law firm Bell Gully, which has worked with wealthy migrants from all over the world.The desire for a haven nestled among snow-capped alps close to an international airport helped house prices in Queenstown increase at more than twice the pace of Auckland in the year through October, reaching an average of NZ$974,564.Mark Harris, managing director of the town's Sotheby's Realty office, said he has sold properties for more than NZ$20 million, including ones with private landing strips.""We hedge fund people all love optionality,"" said Nock, the part-time Queenstown resident from Hong Kong. ""Will I live in New Zealand permanently? I'm not sure, but I want the optionality of being able to do that.""MORE ABOUT GETAWAYS: 3 Ways To Turn A Second Home Into A Gold MineEntrepreneurs Fit A Tiny House Into An 'Anti-Vacation' PackageThe Election Is One More Reason For Canadians To Sell U.S. Homes

274,KIM,"Call it the Donald Trump effect. As charitable donors open their wallets during this year-end giving season, signs show some are experiencing more than just the usual motives for giving.Sure, at least some Americans are well-fixed to donate, given the booming stock market and low jobless rate.But in the wake of Donald Trump's election as president, signs show new political urges pumping up the giving action. And experts say those postelection factors have both long and short-term implications.Key politically linked moves this year-end: Amid concern about the future of social programs, data show some donors racing to support favorite organizations. And all the while, experts say the prospect for tax reform has been firing up some accountants and advisors: Sensing fewer tax benefits of giving ahead, some are suggesting higher-income clients boost their charitable giving in 2016.IBD'S TAKE: Want to make your charitable donations stretch further? IBD Leaderboard provides you with top-performing stocks that can expand your charitable portfolio. On the social front, data show support ballooning lately for some causes and groups. Some examples: Between the day after the election and Nov. 28, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) drew more than $15 million of donations. On Nov. 29, which was Giving Tuesday, donations to the ACLU hit $1.72- million, which was 965% higher than the group obtained last year on Giving Tuesday.At the Sierra Club, online donations this November reached $1.8 million. That was 852% higher than online donations the same month last year.But for many high net worth donors, a different issue — the prospect of major tax reform — is also drawing attention this year-end. As experts explain, many wealthier donors value the tax incentives available for charitable giving. Should these enticements be trimmed, as seems likely, giving by the wealthy (whose donations comprise a large chunk of all charitable giving) could drop.As C. Eugene Steuerle, of the Tax Policy Center, sees it, ""There is some probability there will be a tax bill in 2017."" He believes that ""If what was stated in the presidential campaign is put into effect, charitable giving could fall at least 4.5% to as much as 9%, or between $13.5 billion and $26.1 billion in 2017.""Key aspects of the Trump Tax Plan that experts believe affect charitable giving: cuts in federal taxes, with the highest marginal income tax rate trimmed to 33% from 39.6% (which is also included in the House Republicans' tax reform blueprint.); a cap on tax deductions ($200,000 for married tax filers, $100,000 for single filers); and a boost to the standard tax deduction.Of course, it's still unclear what tax changes might occur. Nonetheless, some advisors suggest donors act now to capitalize on today's tax benefits.  For those who itemize tax deductions, some suggest boosting their giving — pushing into 2016 donations planned for future years.As Elda Di Re, partner at accounting firm Ernst & Young, sees it, ""Uncertainty around tax reform is having a huge impact on giving by high net worth individuals. Those in the highest federal tax bracket feel that, this year, the benefit of tax deductions could be better than they'll ever see again.""She provides this illustration: ""Let's say you give $100,000 to charity.  For those in the top 39.6% federal tax bracket, the tax deduction on that gift now saves you $39,600 in taxes. If the tax rate falls to 33%, you save a lesser $33,000.""Thus, Di Re recommends, ""If you are in the top tax bracket, accelerate your charitable contributions, (advancing them) to this year.""To help with some of these, and other, tax issues, some advisors recommend using a donor-advised fund (DAF) as a giving vehicle. This philanthropic tool, sponsored by a public charity, allows donors to be eligible for an immediate tax benefit for contributions into their DAF account. Donors can give ""cash, publicly traded stock or illiquid assets,"" points out Karla Valas, a managing director of Fidelity Charitable, administrator of Fidelity's DAF. But there's no pressure to pick a recipient charity before year-end: DAF users can recommend over time which nonprofits they wish to support.Given the hot stock market, some believe DAFs could prove especially useful this year. The thinking: If investors put appreciated shares held for more than a year in a DAF account, they could get a tax deduction this year on the fair market value of the shares, without needing to pay capital gains tax on the gift. Thus, the double-barreled benefit: ""Using a donor-advised fund (you can) offset the gains now, but can grant out the money over time,"" points out Kim Laughton, president of Schwab Charitable, the administrator of Schwab's DAF.Whatever the reasons, Schwab's DAF has clearly been a draw: Between this year's July 1 (the start of Schwab Charitable's fiscal 2017) and Nov. 30, contributions to Schwab's DAF leapt 43%, vs. the same period last year, reports the firm.RELATED:Special Report: Dividend And Income Investing

275,KIM,"As a caregiver for her ailing father, Quentara Costa spent six years immersed in eldercare issues. Today, she applies those lessons to build her financial advisory practice.Costa, a certified financial planner in North Andover, Mass., has carved out a niche working with seniors and their families. She's developed expertise in helping individuals tackle eldercare challenges, especially as they weigh a move into an assisted living facility.Costa, 31, focuses on an underserved market. She has not come across other advisors who specialize in helping seniors and their families evaluate various types of assisted living communities and analyzing the long-term affordability of making the move.To grow their business, advisors must think like entrepreneurs. They uncover niches that others overlook to differentiate themselves from the pack.The trick is to tap a previously ignored niche that's substantial enough to provide a significant number of clients. If you concentrate on a market that's too narrow, you can set yourself apart but have little to show for it.Pursuing the right niche comes naturally to some advisors. If they have connections to a certain market segment, they may find themselves attracting clients who refer others with similar characteristics or interests.In other cases, advisors' life experience shapes their outlook. Like Costa, they may realize that the wisdom they've gained through their personal travails can prove an asset in winning over clients with specific needs.Ideally, the most overlooked niches consist of a stable or growing cache of potential clients. If you are the first advisor to penetrate that group, you can gain a head start by establishing your credibility within that market.In the course of helping her father, Costa became well versed in assisting living options. She learned what constitutes skilled nursing care and what questions to ask when assessing a facility.""There are many seniors who are considering the move into some type of assisted living facility,"" Costa said. ""And such a move can involve lots of moving pieces such as getting all the family members on board.""Costa, who markets exclusively to seniors and their families, tours facilities in her area and builds relationships with administrators who run these operations. They in turn refer seniors to her who already reside in the facility and seek an advisor to help address their financial concerns.""I don't do investment management, so I have to show my value as a planner,"" she said. ""And this is a booming market. I can help seniors choose a facility — or figure out how long their money will last so they can stay there.""Some advisors don't have to search far to find a good niche. When Jennifer Kim started her financial planning career nearly 25 years ago, she noticed that no advisors were pursuing the bustling Korean-American community in Los Angeles.By advertising in a local magazine that targeted Korean readers, Kim built visibility. Her Korean heritage also helped her forge ties, and she's now a certified financial planner with deep roots serving her niche.Some advisors stumble upon an overlooked niche by accident. Fate can lead them to discover a cluster of professionals who welcome an advisor's specialized knowledge.In 2012, Tim Baker moved to Baltimore to begin his career in the financial advisory field. After his friend married a pharmacist, Baker won a key client.""My friend and his wife were champions of my business,"" Baker recalled. ""She's on the staff at a local pharmacy school, and she recommended me to other pharmacists.""Like other advisors who successfully uncover a hidden niche, Baker benefited by having what he calls ""early adopters to help spread the word."" He also took steps to educate himself about his target market.""I have no medical background, but I identified the challenges that pharmacists face, such as dealing with student loan debt,"" said Baker, a certified financial planner. ""And I've had thousands of cups of coffee with pharmacists to understand their financial needs better. A lot of my free time is spent listening to podcasts geared to pharmacists.""When he set up his own firm in May 2016, he called it Script Financial to further commit to his niche. He incorporates terms that are familiar to pharmacists — such as ""prescription"" and ""legend"" — in his marketing outreach.""I think financial planning is so broad that you cannot be a master of all,"" Baker said. ""That's why having a unique niche is so important. My goal is to build a national brand so that when a pharmacist graduates from college, within five years they're my client.""RELATED:Advisors Tread Lightly When Talking Politics With ClientsHow Much Is A Financial Advisor's Service Really Worth?

276,KIM,"Declines in the venture capital market are hitting startups of all sizes, but the ones left particularly vulnerable are the thousands of young companies that raised seed funding during headier times just a year or two ago.The seed frenzy peaked in the first quarter of 2015 when more than 1,500 startups raised their first rounds of capital, according to research firm PitchBook Data. Many of those companies are now running out of cash, and most won't be able to get more.Dying is a fact of life for most startups, but corporate graveyards are filling more quickly this year. The pain is likely to drag on for another 12 to 18 months as early-stage companies fizzle out earlier than usual or limp along without access to more capital, said Gus Tai, a general partner at Trinity Ventures.""The pressure is even more acute,"" he said.Now the next Amazon.com (AMZN), Facebook (FB) or Google — now under the Alphabet (GOOGL) name — may never get off the ground as many fund sources are getting skittish about taking risks.As many as half of fledgling startups today are looking to sell shares or take on convertible loans at the same price or terms as their previous rounds, said Jim Kim, a partner at Formation 8 who's raising as much as $200 million for a new VC fund called Builders. He said such deals were rare a couple years ago when enthusiasm was higher and VCs were willing to pay a premium.""It is a completely different environment now,"" Kim said.Despite their recent pullback, American VCs aren't strapped for cash. They're on track to raise the most money since the 2000-era bubble. The top firms are raising larger funds, which is pushing many to make larger early-stage investments in the hopes of driving returns. Accel Partners, Andreessen Horowitz and Founders Fund have raised funds of more than $1 billion each this year.While many other VCs, including Builders, continue to make smaller investments, the big firms are driving up the average investment size in young companies. The median valuation of early rounds involving professional investors has reached $15 million, more than any time in the last five years, said Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati, a law firm that advises startups.However, the $55.5 billion of venture money spent in the first three quarters of the year fell short of the $61.2 billion invested in the same period last year, according to PitchBook. The overall startup market has rebounded in the last couple months but is still down 15% from its high last year, according to the Bloomberg U.S. Startups Barometer, an index that tracks VC funding and deals.More than 11,000 angel and seed investments were made in 2014 and 2015, PitchBook said. Since then, the market has become depressed at all levels, but the imbalance in earlier stages, especially the one known as ""Series A,"" has created intense competition for survival among young companies. The number of companies able to raise their second or third rounds of funding fell 25% last quarter compared with the same period in 2014, PitchBook said.Etai Beck raised a seed round in 2014 for his corporate software company Folloze. He later sold more shares under the same terms, bringing the total size of the round to $3.3 million. This year, as he looked for a second round of funding, he found that investors ""are way stricter,"" with higher expectations for revenue and customers. The company eventually found its way to $7.3 million in September.""The new, higher bar is fine for companies that have very recently raised seed capital — they knew what to expect,"" Tim Bliamptis and Judith Elsea, partners at Weathergage Capital, wrote in a blog post in August. ""It's not so fine for previously seeded companies that had been operating under the old milestone expectations.""

277,KIM,"There will always be more work than time in which to do it. The only factor under your control is how you allocate time, minute by minute, hour by hour, and on what.That's from Brian Tracy, noted author of ""Master Your Time, Master Your Life.""  Tracy is the chairman and CEO of Brian Tracy International, which trains individuals and organizations.His book breaks up time into 10 different categories: goal setting, productive, income improvement, spare, work, creative, problem solving/decision making, people/family, relaxation, and quiet.Tips on getting the most out of your minutes to drive up productivity:Target one thing. Tracy says to start each day with your most important task and ""discipline yourself to stay with it 100% until it is complete.""Just how important is doing that? ""This one technique will double your productivity from the first day,"" Tracy states.Determine daily objectives. The time you allocate to setting clear, specific, written goals is ""the most powerful and important"" of all the time categories, Tracy says.Decide what you really want to be, do and have in the months and years ahead. ""What are your schedules and deadlines for accomplishing each step? What is the first step you will take right now?"" he asks.Ruthlessly eliminate distractions. The best rule for high performance, Tracy says, is ""work all the time you work! Don't waste time. Get going and keep going.""He adds that 50% of worktime today is wasted with electronic interruptions. For example, ""don't check your email in the morning. Turn it off and leave it off. Check it three times a day, at 11:00 a.m., 2:00 p.m. and 5:00 p.m. Get on and off fast.""Further, don't allow yourself to fall into the ""attraction of distraction,"" Tracy cautions, as that can prevent you ""from completing those tasks upon which your future depends."" Avoid internet surfing and ""chatting endlessly with co-workers about nonwork-related activities.""Find your best time. Alex Soojung-Kim Pang, author of ""Rest: Why You Get More Done When You Work Less,"" says productive people do their most critical work early in the morning, ""when they're free from distractions and have time to think.""Keep learning. Tracy offers this perspective: ""Whatever got you to where you are today is not enough to keep you there. You might be only one skill away from doubling your income right now.""Get shut-eye. To perform at your best, ""you need eight to nine hours of good sleep each night,"" Tracy says.Pang offers that people in general are chronically sleep-deprived. If you can manage it, ""a 20-minute nap can offer much the same restorative value as a two-hour snooze."" He say that this is why Thomas Edison napped, and Winston Churchill insisted on them even during World War II.Unplug. Having to think about work after-hours destroys the restorative power of rest, Pang says.If you spend time at the beach doing email, ""as far as your mind is concerned, you're still at the office,"" he said. ""Disconnect and give your brain a real break.""Rest. Take one full day of the seven each week to do nothing work-related at all, Tracy said. Also, taking regular vacations can recharge your mental batteries.Tracy's rule: The time people most need to rest and back off, as their work situation allows, is when ""you most feel that you have too much work to do and can't stop. When you feel this way, you have entered into the danger zone of mental and physical health.""Encourage and manage downtime. A wealth of scientific research in recent decades has shown that chronic overwork and burnout reduce productivity and increase mistakes, Pang says.""Having time to recover from work, in contrast, builds resilience, restores job satisfaction, and boosts creativity,"" he said. Further, studies reveal that the people most susceptible to overwork and burnout are always the highest-achieving, most ambitious workers.Leaders should ""protect their investment in people by giving them permission to get away now and then,"" Pang advises.MORE SECRETS TO SUCCESS:What To Know About Preparing For The UnknownWhy Sales Pros Need To Be Ready To Play 'Moneyball'Vanquish Self-Defeating Habits And Negative Thinking

But the real mover is enterprise software developer Workday (WDAY), back to work after an anxious Leap Year workday when it unveiled Q4 earnings and revenue that beat Wall Street -- for the 13th time in 14 quarters -- but then sucked some oxygen out of the room by guiding the current Q1 sales below analyst estimates. The stock edged down in after-hours trade Monday.No matter.

Workday stock is still 29% off a three-month high made last May.The entire IBD Computer Software-Enterprise industry group was up 2.3% by midafternoon, also on a five-day win run, boosted by Salesforce.com's (CRM) big 11% jump after issuing solid earnings and outlook after the close Feb 24. Salesforce was up 2.3% in afternoon trade Tuesday, while legacy software king Oracle (ORCL) was up 2.9% to 37.85.Salesforce is the highest-ranked of the bunch, with an IBD Composite Rating of 88 out of a possible 99, tracking metrics such as earnings growth, stock market performance and other measures. But the Computer Software-Enterprise industry group as a whole ranks just 90th in performance out of 197 tracked by IBD. The Computer Software-Database group, where low-rated Tableau resides, ranks near the bottom, at 184, though both groups have been on an upswing since the second week of February, clambering back from steep losses the prior week. Oracle, Tableau and Workday still hold relatively low IBD Composite Ratings in the 40s.A little momentum at Workday? Analysts differ. They're impressed, but also cautious.Citing Workday's ""strong billings"" -- up 44% -- with financial management software customers ""roughly doubling"" year over year to 207 clients, FBN Securities analyst Shebly Seyrafi lowered his price target to 75 from 80 and retained his sector perform rating on Workday, not so much on any weakness at Workday but ""due to recent market multiple contraction.""And while revenue guidance for Q1 came in below analyst expectations, ""billings guidance was above,"" Seyrafi wrote in a research note issued Tuesday.""We are also impressed by WDAY’s strong degree of visibility,"" he said. Unearned revenue of $900 million grew by 42%, but noncancelable backlog -- not on the balance sheet -- grew by 62% to $1.56 billion, he noted.""This results in the combination of unearned revenue and backlog at $2.5 billion, up 54%. Since this represents 82% of our estimated next-eight-quarter subscription revenue, up from 72% at the end of fiscal 2015, WDAY’s visibility has increased.""Similarly, analyst David Hynes lowered Canaccord Genuity's price target to 75 from 95 but reiterated a buy rating for Workday.""Lots of things happening at Workday,"" he wrote in a research note, citing ""record new customer adds, Fortune 500 go-lives, triple-digit pipeline growth, improving competitive win rates, increasing attach rates, new SKUs set to hit the market in (the current) fiscal 2017, and the list goes on.""Those new SKUs -- stock keeping units, or individual products -- in planning, learning management and student software are expected to add ""more than"" a $5 billion total addressable market for Workday to work over, co-founder and CEO Aneel Bhusri told analysts in a post-earnings conference call late Monday. That's on top of Workday's core financial management and human capital management (HCM) software product markets.Then again, Brean Capital analyst Yun Kim warned that billings growth decelerated to 42% in fiscal 2016 from 69% in 2015. ""Its fiscal 2017 billings guidance calls for modest 31% growth,"" Kim wrote in a research note issued Tuesday.""While overall FY17 revenue and billings guidance was mostly positive, we believe its outlook for flat margins could disappoint some investors,"" Kim said.Brean Capital rates Workday a hold with a 60.45 price target.""Overall, given lack of transparency into its new business bookings, we believe there will likely be a high degree of uncertainty that exists among investors regarding its true sales momentum,"" Kim wrote.Evercore ISI analyst Kirk Materne lowered his price target to 75 from 95 but maintained a buy rating.""Overall, we believe the longer-term trends in the business remain positive, and WDAY remains one of the best multiyear growth stories in software,"" he said in a Tuesday research note. ""But given that the market remains wary of high valuation SaaS  (Software as a Service) names, investors will need to take a long-term view.""For the current Q1 2017, Workday guided revenue below analysts' views to a range of $337 million to $339 million but didn't forecast earnings. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect on average a Q1 per-share loss minus items of 2 cents, flat with a year ago, on $343.3 million in revenue vs. Q1 2016's $251 million.

279,KIM,"Atomic Threats: North Korea escalates production of uranium and plutonium nuclear fuel, while Iran is “preserving nuclear capabilities,” says the U.S. intelligence chief. “Tough-minded diplomacy” fails, absent U.S power.Back in 2007, when candidate Barack Obama was wowing the left’s opinion mavens with his supposedly intellectually rigorous foreign policy plans, he treated North Korea and Iran as identical challenges.In his much-celebrated article in Foreign Affairs magazine that year, then-Sen. Obama wrote: “We must develop a strong international coalition to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons and eliminate North Korea’s nuclear weapons program” because “Iran and North Korea could trigger regional arms races, creating dangerous nuclear flashpoints in the Middle East and East Asia.”How? “Our first measure must be sustained, direct, and aggressive diplomacy -- the kind that the Bush administration has been unable and unwilling to use.”Today, North Korea has apparently advanced to the hydrogen bomb, and the U.S. has formally allowed Tehran to keep a permanent and swift nuclear weapons construction capability.President Obama has had over seven years now for a task he called a “must.” But in 2016, all these years later, Obama’s director of national intelligence, James Clapper, testifies to the Senate Armed Services Committee on Tuesday that North Korea has expanded its Yongbyon plant for uranium enrichment and has restarted a plutonium reactor shut down in 2007 that could produce nuclear weapons fuel “within a matter of weeks to months.”North Korea could have as many as 100 nuclear bombs less than five years from now, plus, as Clapper warned, it’s developing an ICBM missile to carry them to the U.S. homeland.Obama’s plan?  Ignore it, it seems.North Korea apparently detonated an H-bomb on Jan. 6, but in his State of the Union speech to Congress last month, the president pretended it never happened. “We didn’t particularly feel compelled to give” Kim Jong-un “that attention,” Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes explained.Go to the White House website, type in “North Korea,” and up comes a video of the president from May 2009 reacting to the A-bomb test Pyongyang had conducted hours earlier by promising that “we will work with our friends and our allies to stand up to this behavior.”The second item that comes up is a notice from last June that Obama is once again renewing for another year a June 2008 George W. Bush executive order that declared “a national emergency with respect to North Korea.”Rhodes is perfectly accurate: We are aren’t giving the North Korea nuclear threat any attention.On the diplomatic front, a U.S. under Obama that has lost two wars has seemingly zero clout with Communist China, the nation with the most leverage over North Korea because it provides most of its food, fuel and trade.Does Obama believe Kim Jong-un is simply too fanatical? He had his own uncle-by-marriage, four-star Gen. Jang Song-taek, executed after all. But the Iranians are fanatical enough to believe the 12th Imam will soon lead an apocalyptic holy war against America and Israel, and yet Obama spent endless months negotiating a deal with them, which they never had to sign. In it, the U.S. ultimately relented and tolerated Tehran’s ability to build nuclear weapons, and build them fast.The “Worldwide Threat Assessment” accompanying Clapper’s testimony features this astonishing post-Iran deal conclusion: “Iran does not face any insurmountable technical barriers to producing a nuclear weapon, making Iran’s political will the central issue.”The president, who in 2007 promised that his untried diplomatic skills would denuclearize both North Korea and Iran, had by 2016 substantially escalated both of these fanatical terrorist powers’ atomic threats to America.

280,KIM,"The day after one of the greatest political upsets in world history, I dug out my July 2016 exchange with ""David,"" an Ohio left-wing retired law professor whom I once considered my best friend. He wrote:Larry, Donald Trump -- the screaming, the red face, the slashing hand gestures, the repeated appeals to familial blood spilled by outsiders, the vow to deport 3% of the American population.The demonization of our present leaders as stupid, as weak, as corrupt, as criminals, as traitors, as not citizens, as not Christians.The mischaracterization of our country as broken, as suffering, as crushed underfoot by foreign forces.The assertion that only he can save us ...This is unique to American politics, Larry. But the world has seen this before.If you can't see it after last night's speech I am afraid you will never see it.You have spent your entire career denying that racism still exists. You were wrong. Racism is a powerful force, a dark and tempting lure that can be used by a fanatical leader to frighten and manipulate multitudes. Now you have a raving lunatic racist as the Republican nominee. What will you do? Will you continue to support him? Will you stay silent? You are a man of great influence, and I have faith in you to do the right thing and help to save our country.DavidMy response:David,Name one time I 'denied that racism still exists'! One. I've never written such a thing, said such a thing, or believed such a thing. It is beyond insulting.Not only does racism still exist in America, but bigotry does. And you are an example of it. You're bigoted against conservatives, against people who believe the government is too big, against people, like my father, who grew up in the Jim Crow South during the Great Depression, who believed that racism, sexism and whatever 'isms' you want to put forth are no longer major forces in America.By making such an asinine statement you reduce yourself to the subterranean level of credibility you claim Trump possesses.After that I need not -- and won't -- respond to anything else you said in your email.But I will say this. Get used to it. You just heard the next president of the United States. He's going to get elected. And it will be, in no small measure, because of the hysterical, unfair, demonic characterization of him by you and others who, by doing this, malign many soon-to-be Trump-voting Americans, who feel they're working harder and longer and making less money as a result of the policies of the last eight years.When he gets elected, go to the nearest mirror -- you played a large role in it.I've been doing this a long time. I have a much better handle on how much of America feels and thinks than you do. You think you do, but you don't.I've seen the Trump phenomenon divide friends and families. I never really thought it would happen between you and me.But this is the first time I truly feel insulted, demeaned and caricatured by you -- simply because I see things differently. I have many, many left-wing friends. I live in California. Honestly, how many conservative friends do you have? I bet the answer is -- after this letter -- none.LarryDavid's response:These kinds of divisions are inevitable when people are presented with choices that are this momentous. Americans faced a similar choice in the 1850s, Germany in the 1930s. I told you before that Trump is a categorically different candidate. He is not a (John) McCain, or a (Mitt) Romney, or a George or Jeb Bush, men with whom I disagree but who are honorable, decent people, and none of whom support Trump. Trump is a demagogue and a racist. He openly admires dictators like Kim Jong Un and Vladimir Putin, and if the report regarding his keeping the book of Hitler's speeches at his bedside is accurate, then him as well. He openly appeals to violence and has expressly vowed to imprison his principal political opponent if he wins and has implicitly called for her to be assassinated if he loses. He rejects the Western alliance of democratic nations in favor of doing business with the Russian kleptocracy.I am not deceived as to Trump's popularity. You are right that many people adore Trump. I had hoped you were not one of them. His level of support does not change his essential character; it is what makes him dangerous. I deeply mourn our friendship. But this is just the beginning of this conflict, and the choices we make will define all of us.This is, indeed, ""just the beginning of this conflict"" -- the conflict between those who denounced Trump as a racist and a bigot and the American voters who see him and his vision in a very different way. Deal with it.
"
281,KIM,"After Wells Fargo (WFC) executive John Sotoodeh handed off more than 100 branches in Southern California to a colleague in 2009, problems surfaced quickly.His successor, Kim Young, addressing rumors that some employees were opening bogus accounts, called an introductory meeting with staff and warned that she wouldn't tolerate misconduct. Within a few days, managers recall, sales crumbled across her new turf.Sotoodeh, who started as a teller in 1990, has since climbed even higher. He's now one of three regional chiefs running the firm's nationwide consumer-banking empire. Young spent the final years of her four-decade career at Wells Fargo weeding out bad employees, retiring in 2014.In interviews, more than a dozen past and current Wells Fargo employees — many of them senior managers — chronicled how a generation of executives thrived in its ambitious sales culture, winning accolades and promotions, while being held aloft as examples to colleagues. All the while, people under them were opening legions of unwanted accounts for customers.As Wells Fargo grew, some stars fanned out from Southern California, described by colleagues and in congressional testimony as a focal point of the rampant misconduct, spreading a culture that lionized boosting sales.Wells Fargo declined to make managers available for interviews but said in a statement that its leaders are closely examining the abuses and are ""intently focused"" on restoring customers' trust. Many of those mentioned in this story, including Sotoodeh, referred questions to company spokesmen. Others declined to comment or didn't respond to messages.Company executives already have identified some current managers to be fired, according to a person with knowledge of an internal investigation. The terminations are being delayed so employees can aid inquiries, said the person, who asked not to be named discussing the matter. The person declined to specify who may be poised to lose their jobs.No one interviewed said they heard senior executives instruct underlings to open bogus accounts, though more than a half-dozen bankers said low-level managers privately coached them to do so.More often, employees said, managers taught underlings to use misleading sales pitches — such as telling customers a checking account came with a credit card — or they balked when subordinates raised concerns. At the least, former managers say, many executives failed to stamp out misconduct for years despite ample signs it was flourishing below them as their own careers advanced.""No one was ever penalized for doing the wrong thing until there was critical mass,"" said Michael Bruns, a banker at Wells Fargo branches in Silicon Valley from 2009 to 2012. ""Instead, they were promoted. They became our bosses and the people who are running the company today.""Bruns said he was fired two months after complaining to the bank's ethics hotline about his colleagues' sales practices.In the statement, Wells Fargo said it takes allegations such as Bruns' seriously and will examine them thoroughly. The San Francisco-based bank has policies prohibiting retaliation for reporting suspected misconduct, and it's conducting an ""an end-to-end review"" of the hotline process. The company said Thursday in a quarterly regulatory filing that the Securities and Exchange Commission is among the authorities examining its sales practices.More broadly, the lender said it's taking a hard look at what happened.""The company's leadership is intently focused on restoring trust in its community bank, making things right with customers and taking actions intended to ensure sales-practices issues do not happen again,"" Wells Fargo said. ""Actions have included naming a new head of retail banking, eliminating product-sales goals and changing the retail bank's risk-management processes and protocols for customer-account activity. As we have disclosed, there are multiple investigations underway to address sales-practice issues, including by an independent committee of the board of directors. The integrity of these investigations is not served by commenting on speculation and rumor. The company will take accountability actions, as appropriate, once it has the facts necessary to act.""The scandal exploded in September with the announcement of $185 million in fines, prompting John Stumpf to step down weeks later as chairman and chief executive officer. Carrie Tolstedt, who oversaw the consumer unit from 2006 until July this year, also left. Together, they're giving up about $60 million of unvested stock. Neither responded to messages seeking comment.The bank's board has publicly promised to investigate how fake accounts proliferated, potentially punishing more executives as warranted.That's a monumental task: The firm's most recent annual report shows the community bank's three U.S. regional chiefs oversee more than 50 regional presidents. Below them, there are about 120 area presidents, each with their own cluster of branches.The bank terminated only one member of that army — an area president — for improper sales over half a decade while firing more than 5,000 lower-level workers, Stumpf said while testifying to a U.S. Senate panel in September.One question lawmakers want answered is whether any of those who remain ever directed employees to open accounts without customers' permission or ignored such misconduct, which authorities have said was widespread. The board's review is expected to take months, according to a person with knowledge of the process. A board spokesman declined to comment.""We failed to acknowledge the role leadership played and, as a result, many felt we blamed our team members,"" Stumpf's successor as CEO, Tim Sloan, said in a speech to staff on Oct. 25. ""That one still hurts, and I am committed to rectifying it.""At the heart of Wells Fargo's sales culture was a metric developed by top brass more than a decade ago, tracking how many financial products and accounts — now dubbed ""solutions"" -- branch employees sold daily. Back then, the focus appeared to be different.Les Biller, chief operating officer from 1998 to 2002, mainly used the figure to set staffing levels, one former senior manager said. If employees fielded more than a certain number of solutions daily, it might signal more tellers were needed at an overworked branch. Biller didn't respond to messages seeking comment.Under Tolstedt, 56, sales volume was the ultimate measure of performance, former employees said. Managers urged workers to boost daily sales and persuade each customer to sign up for more Wells Fargo products, a practice known as cross-selling.Tolstedt ran the division with a style that former colleagues describe as intense and driven, and unrelentingly focused on numbers showing growth. Branch personnel were assigned sales targets that, for years, kept climbing. Their progress was tracked in what some called a ""Motivator Report,"" which circulated daily to managers. It set the tone for conference calls, in which supervisors pressed people below them to meet quotas.Stumpf brought them up, too, emailing high-performing managers to congratulate them and often citing their figures when stopping by local offices, according to one former manager.The bank has said it took steps to prevent cheating, such as increasing ethics training and lowering targets to win bonuses. One manager credited Tolstedt for introducing more metrics to track customer service and satisfaction, emphasizing a need for quality.But for many, the focus on hitting or beating quotas was a monster that underperformers dreaded and the ambitious tried to lasso. Managers who boosted sales typically rose fastest, and some talked incessantly about strategies for doing that, the employees said.Stories of Southern California bankers opening 42 debit cards in a single day percolated among astonished managers in other areas, one person recalled. Several managers who tried to gauge their progress relative to peers said California and Florida often stood out for their new accounts, though many of them were hardly used.After some managers alerted their bosses that the numbers seemed suspicious, they said they were told to mind their own results. Some said they then watched their supervisors climb higher, or at least continued to hold senior posts within the division.Wells Fargo's three U.S. consumer-banking chiefs report to Tolstedt's successor, Mary Mack.Two of them built their careers in California: Lisa Stevens, 46, was promoted to run the state in 2009, and later expanded her territory to cover the Pacific Midwest region, which arcs eastward toward Ohio. She also heads small-business banking. Sotoodeh, 46, oversaw Los Angeles and Orange County before his promotion to lead other Southwest states from Texas.The third region, the East Coast, was run by another former California chief, Laura Schulte, from 2009 until her retirement in 2014. Tolstedt moved her to Charlotte, N.C., just after Wells Fargo bought Wachovia, giving her a key role in integrating the companies. Schulte said in an email to Bloomberg that executives picked her ""due to my extensive experience as a transition manager over several years and acquisitions, rather than anything related to sales practices.""Still, she's remembered by some staff for an internal sales promotion called ""Schulte's All Stars."" A 2010 copy of the list obtained by Bloomberg ranks managers by a mix of metrics, all gauging volume in different ways. Some were on track to be in the ""Schulte Hall of Fame.""Such lists were ""scrubbed carefully so that any one of my winners did not include anyone who was known to be under scrutiny for sales practices,"" Schulte said in her email. She said she wasn't focused primarily on sales numbers, and that she also ran ""recognition events"" tied to employee satisfaction, turnover, customer service and other measures of quality. Promotions, too, were based on a variety of criteria, she said.Schulte also brought along a pair of California all-stars. Darryl Harmon became head of Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi and Tennessee, and Shelley Freeman ran Florida.Freeman, who previously oversaw metropolitan Los Angeles, soon tried to duplicate its sales-centric culture, former employees said. Every Monday, she wrote an email to thousands of Florida personnel to encourage them to sell, sometimes describing the kind of lifestyle they might hope to achieve. She mentioned her Super Bowl tickets and buying an $800 pair of sunglasses at the beach, one former manager recalled. The messages went to tellers making $12 an hour.Freeman now heads the bank's consumer credit-card business. She said she couldn't immediately comment when reached by phone, and later didn't respond to messages.Forty-five people who worked in Wells Fargo's Florida branches have stepped forward to join a wrongful termination and retaliation lawsuit filed in September by Los Angeles employment lawyer Jonathan Delshad. It was the first such case to be brought after the fines. He provided Bloomberg with a state-by-state breakdown of the roughly 500 potential plaintiffs vetted by his firm so far, showing only California has more, with 144.The complaint, filed in Los Angeles Superior Court, seeks class-action status for employees ousted or demoted for missing sales quotas while refusing to cheat customers.Some of Sotoodeh's team also got involved with new branches in the southeast. In 2010, members of his staff went to train Wachovia bankers working under Harmon. Soon after the coaches left, the Wachovia staff discovered debit cards in their mailboxes for Wells Fargo accounts they hadn't requested, one person said. The bankers learned months later that members of Sotoodeh's team had used local customers' identities to help meet sales goals, the person said.Wells Fargo's internal crackdown intensified in the years after Sotoodeh handed Young the swath of branches stretching from San Bernardino County to San Diego in Southern California.In 2011, the bank created a ""report card"" to help track sales practices in California, and it delegated a team to sift data for patterns suggesting accounts were bogus, Stumpf told the Senate panel. Two years later, that group launched an ""intensive investigation"" in Los Angeles and neighboring Orange County into a practice known as ""simulated funding,"" he said. At the time, Sotoodeh oversaw both areas.Employees were opening bogus accounts, then depositing funds temporarily to make it look like customers were using them, Stumpf testified. He conceded to lawmakers that sales abuses were especially prevalent in Southern California, and not just because the bank's presence there was large. Both the report card and funding review later expanded nationwide.Other managers from California also assumed leadership posts overseeing broader U.S. regions. Pam Conboy supervised the San Gabriel Valley to the east of Los Angeles when Tolstedt was picked to run the state in 2000. Tolstedt promoted Conboy within the state, and later flew her around the country to teach strategies for increasing sales, managers say. She now oversees Arizona, Nevada and Utah. Conboy didn't respond to messages seeking comment.Conboy, Sotoodeh and Stevens have outlasted many of their colleagues. Of the almost 70 regional supervisors listed in the company's 1999 annual report, they're among fewer than 10 whose names still appeared in an updated hierarchy posted this year.A number of other managers who came up under Sotoodeh around Los Angeles and Orange County are now regional presidents overseeing parts of California and Texas. David DiCristofaro runs greater Los Angeles. Ben Alvarado runs the region that Sotoodeh once handed to Young. Reza Razzaghipour manages an area stretching from Ventura and Santa Barbara inland to Tulare County, while his spouse, Marla Clemow, presides over metropolitan Los Angeles. They declined to comment or didn't respond to messages.One of their peers, Darryl Montgomery, leads Houston. He was the most senior manager below Tolstedt named in a lawsuit by ex-Wells Fargo employees claiming that they were unfairly pressed to meet sales quotas, according to a Bloomberg review of more than 40 court cases. While that 2014 complaint against Wells Fargo is continuing in Los Angeles Superior Court, claims against Montgomery were extinguished in July. He didn't respond to phone messages.Wells Fargo has said it scaled back, and ultimately eliminated, sales goals that regulators faulted for encouraging abusive cross-selling. A new performance plan for retail bankers will be introduced next year. It'll be based on customer service, growth and risk management.The company created a human resources team to help rehire employees who left for performance reasons, Sloan told staff in his speech. And it will hire consultants to review sales practices and address ""cultural weaknesses that need to be strengthened or fixed,"" he said.""I think it all begins with understanding where things broke down, and where we failed — as a culture, a company and as leaders,"" he said.Six years ago, former Wachovia banker Joe Coyne helped run some of Schulte's programs on the East Coast to drive up numbers, such as one called ""Jump Into 2010."" To many managers back then, his was a voice of encouragement, singling out those who beat targets and spurring them to do more.""The performance you both planned for and delivered is nothing short of incredible,"" he wrote in a staff update on the 2010 campaign. ""You have raised the bar higher than many thought possible."" He referred questions about that work to the bank's spokesmen.Last year, Wells Fargo promoted him to a key post within its risk office. Coyne now oversees sales practices across the company's divisions, looking for any conduct that might cause problems.

283,KIM,"Islamofascism: A U.S. Marine has sued a Maryland school district for forcing his daughter to recite the Islamic profession of faith in history class. Schools across the nation are forcing such Islamic indoctrination.We applaud John K. Wood for refusing to allow his daughter to be subjected to the promotion of the Muslim religion in her high school World History, class as part of pro-Islamic curriculum implemented by the Charles County Public Schools in Maryland.Wood, who was deployed in Iraq and also responded as a firefighter to the 9/11 Islamic terror attack on the Pentagon, couldn’t stand by as his daughter was compelled by liberal educrats to memorize and recite the five pillars of Islam, and write out faith statements of the religion in worksheets and quizzes.The Maryland district requires that students write out and confess the Shahada, the Islamic profession of faith, which states, “There is no god but Allah, and Muhammad is the messenger of Allah.”However, the school district does not require students to recite the 10 Commandments, the Beatitudes or John 3:16. The district, in fact, mandates teachers spend only one day teaching Christianity, while devoting two weeks to promoting Islam.Charles County Public Schools also teaches the following:Talk about historic revisionism. The unit shamelessly sugarcoats the systematic Muslim beheadings of conquered Jews and pagans in Medina and Mecca under Muhammad’s reign. In fact, the correct answer to test question #18, “How did Muslim conquerors treat those they conquered?” is: “With tolerance, kindness and respect.”The high school, which uses the Islam-endorsing textbook, “World History (Survey): Patterns of Interaction” (McDougal Littel), wouldn’t let Wood's daughter opt out of the assignments, and threatened her with failing grades if she didn’t do them. When she refused, it stuck her in the library and flunked her for the unit. So Wood, who was banned by the school for complaining, sued in federal court, charging the public school district is unconstitutionally promoting the Islamic faith.Parents should know that this unconstitutional promotion of Islam -- along with the marginalization, even denigration, of Christianity -- is happening in public schools across the country as part of President Obama’s Common Core curriculum. Similar cases have been reported recently in Minnesota, as well as even conservative states such as Tennessee, Texas and Virginia.Project Veritas recently caught on camera a former marketing executive for textbook publishing giant Pearson Education revealing the anti-Christian, pro-Islamic agenda of Common Core.Veritas: Christianity is totally out of Common Core?Ex-Pearson official Kim Koerber: Yes, it is. Totally. It’s not a core concept at all . . . They said you have to talk about Islam.“Parents must be ever vigilant to the Islamic indoctrination of their children under the guise of teaching history and multiculturalism. This is happening in public schools across the country. And they must take action to stop it,” warned Richard Thompson, president of the Thomas More Law Center, a national public-interest law firm that filed the lawsuit on behalf of the Wood family.If more parents fail to fight back like the courageous Wood, they risk their children not just being indoctrinated, but possibly even being converted to Islam in our otherwise secular public schools.

286,KIM,"Markets abhor uncertainty. And perhaps nothing breeds more uncertainty than a war that starts with a surprise attack like the Korean War in the early 1950s.To the investor, wars create volatility and opportunity. You do not have to be able to predict such events from happening. But you do need to be flexible and know when to quickly raise cash to avoid huge losses in stocks. Then you must be able to buy with conviction when the market, via the follow-through bottoming signal, has given investors a green light to buy leading new stocks.IBD teaches such techniques via this column and the Big Picture. Market timing is essential to making great trades.On June 25, 1950, the North Korean People's Army surprised South Korea and a small contingent of U.S. military personnel, pouring south across the 38th parallel. The next day, North Korean tanks were at the outskirts of the South Korean capital of Seoul.The day after that, President Harry S. Truman secured a United Nations resolution calling for military assistance to the South. Truman named Gen. Douglas MacArthur to head two U.S. divisions in what he called a ""police action."" For the next three years, the U.S. would fight a difficult and costly war to an eventual standstill that lasts to this day. Kim Jong-un, the grandson of Kim Il-song, the supreme leader who launched North Korean forces against the South, is in charge today, still raising havoc in the region.The Monday morning after the attack, the Dow fell 4.7%. The next day, the market lost 0.8%, with volume reaching the heaviest since September 1939, when Hitler invaded Poland. From a June 12 intraday high to a July 13 low, the Dow lost 14.8%. Yet the correction was contained; the Dow had just about recovered its loss by September, when U.S. forces launched the Inchon invasion and the liberation of Seoul.The Korean War had important consequences for the economy. Rather than build deficits, Truman preferred a pay-as-you-go strategy. Supported by Congress, he raised income, corporate and excise taxes to record levels in 1950 and 1951.At the war's outbreak, inflation skyrocketed as consumers hurried to buy, fearing shortages. Prices rose 11% from the war's onset until price controls were imposed Jan. 26, 1951. In its last year, war expenses made up 14.1% of GDP.Dwight D. Eisenhower  was elected in November 1952 on a platform of ending the war. An armistice went into effect July 27, 1953.The advance once the war was underway was mild and choppy. Still, some winners emerged. One winner was United Aircraft Corp., later United Technologies (UTX), which owned the Pratt & Whitney Aircraft Engine Co., maker of jet engines used in fighters and bombers. It broke out of a cup-with-handle base in 1949. By 1953, 87% of sales were to the government. It gained 256% in 169 weeks.Better bets surfaced at the end of the war when price controls and materials restrictions were lifted. Enter Outboard Marine, a maker of outboard motors. It expanded its offerings to include snow blowers, lawn mowers and chain saws and saw earnings and stock price explode.Following a strong breakout in January 1954, Outboard gained 720% in 177 weeks, ascended into a climax run on a 3-for-1 stock split and gave a clear sell signal.

287,KIM,"Presidency: President Obama chose to skip the funeral of former first lady Nancy Reagan, opting instead to keynote a Texas hipster festival. Given all the other funerals of leading conservatives and U.S. allies he's missed, the optics are not good.Sure, it isn't traditional for a president to attend the funeral of a former first lady, and the president did pay verbal tribute to her, whose eight years in the White House restored the splendor, dignity and even glamour of the presidency, even as the work of her husband, President Reagan, ended the Cold War and ushered in a new era of prosperity. The first lady, who died Sunday in California, was a presence in her own right, and the dearest person to the heart of the greatest president of the 20th century.Obama himself has spoken of the mark the Reagan presidency left on America and even of seeking to achieve the same kind of influence they did. So it would be a seemly gesture for him to go to the funeral anyway, joining first lady Michelle. Not going to happen. An Austin, Texas, tech and music festival called South by Southwest Interactive, or SXSW, is beckoning, and although the event had been already scheduled, there's no such thing as an event where the U.S. president wouldn't be welcomed whenever he arrives, perhaps after the funeral.A lot of good could be done by going to this funeral to pay his last respects to the beloved former first lady. The president could remind the public that the office of presidency is more important than the partisan politics that surrounds it. He could also draw some goodwill from his political opponents among Republicans, given that he's a lame duck and still seeks to accomplish things in his last year. And he could erase the growing sense that he only goes to funerals where he can reap political hay.To date, Obama has skipped some very significant funerals, often choosing to play golf or fundraise with political fat-cats instead. He passed on the funeral of America's top Cold War ally, Lady Margaret Thatcher, in 2013, sending only a low-level delegation ranking below that of the group he sent to the funeral of Venezuela's anti-American dictator, Hugo Chavez, the same year.Singapore's Lee Kuan Yew, the greatest Asian leader of the post-colonial era, and a lion-hearted U.S. ally, got about the same after he died in 2015, as did South Korea's former president Kim Young-sam and Georgia's Eduard Shevardnadze. Even rock-solid ally Israel's Ariel Sharon, who died in 2014, got only Vice President Joe Biden.Domestically, Obama also gave the back of his hand to Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, a giant among his peers, skipping his funeral this year.Even more painful, he's failed to show up for the funerals of important military men who lost their lives under his command. Maj. Gen. Harold Greene, who was killed in Afghanistan in 2014, got nothing more than a representative, while American Sniper Chris Kyle got absolutely nothing, not even a mention in the 2013 State of the Union address the same day.But there were people he was willing to jet halfway around the world to honor at their funerals. One of them was South Africa's Nelson Mandela, an important figure to be sure, but not significant to U.S. interests. Instead of representing the U.S. state with dignity, President Obama chose to giggle for selfies with Denmark's leader and shake hands with Cuba's odious dictator Raul Castro.He's also sent representation to the funerals of criminals in the name of political gain, honoring the likes of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., in 2014, and Freddy Gray in Baltimore in 2015, both moves that were calculated to stoke racial unrest. Even his presence at the funeral of an honorable man, State Senator and Reverend Clementa Pinckney, who was killed in South Carolina church massacre in 2015, was a move to advance a narrative about white racism.The president is the representative of all the American people as the head of state, not just those who share a political stripe or prove politically useful. No, he didn't have to attend the funeral of Nancy Reagan. But he should have.

288,KIM,"In his classic ""How to Make Money in Stocks,"" IBD founder William J. O'Neil writes that as much as ""37% of a stock's price movement is directly tied to the performance of the industry group the stock is in.""IBD's Your Weekly Review, a unique screen of highly rated stocks published each Friday, is built with the fruits of that research in mind.Your Weekly Review lists up to 120 minicharts of stocks, and all of those stocks are graded in descending order by the relative strength of the industry group to which they belong.Thus, studying Your Weekly Review (starting on page A5 of Friday's print edition) enables any serious investor to isolate quickly those stocks that appear in the very top performing groups, out of the total 197 such groups that IBD identifies and ranks based on six-month price action every trading day. Use the accompanying column written by IBD's market writers and editors as a map to navigate through the list and find promising candidates to buy in a healthy market uptrend.No matter how weak or strong a stock’s industry group fares, the screen includes only stocks having EPS and Relative Strength ratings of at least 85 out of a possible 99. That's why the screen is sometimes referred to as the 85-85 Index.In a roaring bull market, you will see 120 stocks appearing week after week in Your Weekly Review, with perhaps dozens more waiting in the wings that didn't qualify only because of space limitations. Alternatively in a bear market, the list will shrink considerably.In fact, to determine the overall health of the market, make a habit of counting how many stocks appear in Your Weekly Review. During rough markets, you might notice a sharp drop in little time. For instance, in the Dec. 4, 2015, edition, the section contained four full pages' worth of minicharts and 177 stocks in the tables. By the end of January this year, the list shriveled to 56 names. Since then, the list has recovered mildly.To make the screen, all stocks must sell for at least $10 a share, trade within 15% of their 52-week highs, and show a minimum average volume of 10,000 shares a day. Investors should be wary of such thin traders. Focus on more liquid stocks with an average daily volume of about half a million. As an adjunct to the charts, the table in Your Weekly Review features the name of one A-rated mutual fund with a large position in these stocks. This supplies evidence of the I in IBD’s CAN SLIM investment acronym, which stands for institutional sponsorship.Your Weekly Review's accompanying table gives readers a sense of the market's defensive mood. Performance Food Group (PFGC), Hormel Foods (HRL) and Chesapeake Utilities (CPK) are the third highest-ranked in the Feb. 19 edition of Your Weekly Review. In other words, the market is prizing businesses in food distribution, pork supply and natural gas utility above more high-growth sectors.Dividend-rich real estate investment trusts such as CoreSite Realty (COR), Agree Realty (ADC) and Kimco Realty (KIM), all of which sport a Composite Rating of 98 or 99.

289,KIM,"Nuclear Threat: President Obama told North Korea he would talk about formally ending the Korean War, thinking nuclear disarmament would result. Their response was another nuclear detonation.The president of change seems to have believed he had an all-purpose method of transforming America's enemies. The negotiations with Tehran were originally touted as a means of getting the world's foremost terrorist state to end its ability to build nuclear weapons; instead, it let them keep it permanently, a year away from constructing a warhead once they choose to do so, and with increasingly longer-range missiles.Cuba was ripe for the picking too. In opening U.S. relations with Castro for the first time ever, Obama now sends out the thinly-disguised message that the 10 previous presidents were too dumb to realize that our relations with Cuba were defective. In fact, the Communist island nation that once let the Soviet Union deploy nuclear missiles within sight of the Florida shore was in a de-facto state of war with America for six decades; thanks to Obama, Castro in the end has won.The president tells the nation talk worked in both cases; but these two regimes with a history of sponsoring anti-U.S. terrorism will undoubtedly both have some surprises for him in the years ahead. It was revealed over the weekend that Obama covertly tried the same approach on North Korea's fanatical, youthful tyrant Kim Jong-un as ""one of several unsuccessful attempts that American officials say they made to discuss denuclearization with North Korea during President Barack Obama’s second term while also negotiating with Iran over its nuclear program.""The U.S. and other major powers had a long-standing requirement that North Korea move toward eliminating its nuclear program before it could be agreed to embark upon negotiations. But as with Iran, Obama's general modus operandi was that he was willing to talk without preconditions. He actually campaigned on doing this within the first year of his first term of office.Asked if he would meet ""the leaders of Iran, Syria, Venezuela, Cuba and North Korea, in order to bridge the gap that divides our countries"" anywhere and without condition, candidate Obama replied, ""I would. And the reason is this: that the notion that somehow not talking to countries is punishment to them -- which has been the guiding diplomatic principle of"" President George W. Bush ""is ridiculous.""Punishment, however, was clearly not the primary motive for Bush, any more than it was for Ronald Reagan when he spent his whole first term refusing to meet with Soviet Premier Brezhnev, then Andropov, then Chernenko, before finally meeting with Gorbachev during his second term, after the U.S. had revitalized its military and committed to an anti-nuclear strategic missile defense. The biggest motive was self-protection -- especially regarding enemies with nuclear weapons capability.North Korea's reaction to our openness to talk was yet another nuclear test on Jan. 6, quite possibly an H-bomb.This administration thinks Obama can be Nixon, and that North Korea can be China. But Henry Kissinger himself, the architect of Nixon's opening to China, warned during Obama's first year as president that he was risking that ""diplomacy will turn into a means of legitimizing proliferation rather than arresting it,"" as North Korea stalled and stalled.It was reported on Monday that China, which fears North Korean destabilization more than any other country, has taken the drastic measure of freezing the assets of North Korean depositors and restricting cash transfers to the Pyongyang regime. Beijing knows, if Obama doesn't, that concrete actions are all Kim and his henchmen understand.Of all the adversaries in the world to choose to appease, the isolated, oppressive, unpredictable North Korean regime may be the worst.

328,KIM,"Sen. Cory Gardner gives the Republican Party's Weekly RemarksHi, I’m Senator Cory Gardner, and I’m proud to represent the great state of Colorado in the United States Senate. For decades, the United States and our allies like Japan and South Korea have faced a complex threat in North Korea.And while the Obama Administration has rightfully focused attention on developments in the Middle East, for too long it has turned a blind eye to the North Korean threat. (Scroll down for video of these remarks.)A rogue regime headed by a leader with no respect for human dignity, North Korea’s Forgotten Maniac—Kim Jong-Un—has been met with indifference instead of resolve.It’s time to reverse this Administration’s failed policy of ‘strategic patience.’ Recent headlines confirm this.North Korea has conducted four nuclear tests, three of which occurred during the Obama Administration. Earlier this month, North Korea launched a long-range rocket.We know that the regime is expanding its nuclear stockpile and its capabilities are growing. North Korea may already possess as many as 20 nuclear warheads, with the potential to gain as many as 100 within the next five years.Furthermore, our military experts have warned that the situation on the Korean Peninsula may be at its most unstable point in over sixty years. They believe that North Korea has the ability to miniaturize an atomic weapon and place it on a rocket that has the ability to reach the homeland.North Korea’s illicit behavior doesn’t stop with its proliferation activities. The regime has intensified its cyberwarfare as evidenced by its attacks on South Korea’s financial systems and the hack of Sony Pictures here in the United States.North Korea also has a long history of horrific human rights abuses and continues to maintain a vast network of political prison camps.We can no longer stand idly by as North Korea builds an arsenal of mass destruction, grows its cyber capabilities and tortures as many as 200,000 of its own men, women, and children. We must apply the pressure required to change the Forgotten Maniac’s pattern of belligerent behavior that endangers the globe.That’s why the Senate in an overwhelming bipartisan vote, recently passed my North Korea Sanctions and Policy Enhancement Act.My bill is a tough rebuke of Kim Jung Un and a dramatic change in U.S. policy toward North Korea. It imposes mandatory sanctions on individuals who contribute to North Korea’s nuclear and ballistic missile program, its malicious cyber-attacks, its censorship activities, and the regime’s continued human rights abuses.It also mandates that the Administration develop a comprehensive strategy to address the regime’s human rights abuses and cyber activities.The goal of this bill is simple: to quell North Korea’s aggression, peacefully disarm the regime and restore human rights.During his final State of the Union address, President Obama acknowledged that ‘our foreign policy must be focused on the threat from ISIL and al Qaeda, but it can’t stop there.’And I couldn’t agree more with that statement. It’s time for the United States to lead.We must set an example and send a message to the rest of the world that America will not tolerate patterns of belligerence – a message that America will lead. ####RELATED:

In the game, players interact with the sisters as friends and mentors as they work to realize their creative and career aspirations.“Kendall and Kylie Jenner’s combined social followers have more than doubled to over 150 million since Glu’s original partnership announcement, showcasing their tremendous impact on pop culture,” Glu CEO Niccolo de Masi said in a statement. “The global awareness of each of their personal brands makes them great partners for mobile gaming.”Other upcoming celebrity video games from Glu will feature pop singers Britney Spears, Nicki Minaj and Taylor Swift.RELATED:Taylor Swift Video Game In Glu Mobile Investors’ ‘Wildest Dreams’Zynga Stock Getting Dogged By Declining User Base.

333,KIM,"Iran Deal: The Tehran agreement has a familiar ring; 21 years ago, President Carter was dispatched to North Korea, and the result was a failed pact that ultimately led to a nuclear-armed Pyongyang.The echoes are eerie. The world's most isolated and oppressive terrorist state in 1994 had long been giving United Nations nuclear arms inspectors the runaround. President Clinton was justly afraid that the mysterious communist regime would follow through on its repeated threats to arm itself with the bomb.This was a job for ... James Earl Carter.Clinton sent Carter to meet with then-North Korean dictator Kim Il Sung, whose cult of personality was the center of life for the nation's starving masses. (The cover story was that Carter was going on his own initiative.) But Carter, typically, was enthralled by his own cult of personality. Without authorization from the Clinton administration, he publicly announced the outlines of a treaty.And so the ball was rolling. It all led to the ""Agreed Framework,"" which like the current effort to make a deal with Iran, was contractually ambiguous, being neither a treaty nor even a binding agreement between the two countries.Under the arrangement, North Korea's plutonium reactors were to be replaced by 2003 with light water reactors, to be built by South Korea and Japan. Exhausted nuclear fuel would be disposed of. The U.N.'s International Atomic Energy Agency would conduct routine inspections. And North Korea would receive half a million tons of fuel oil a year.How did it go? Here is none other than Ashton Carter, President Obama's new defense secretary, writing in Harvard Magazine in 2003:Less than a decade after the Agreed Framework was agreed to, North Korea ""admitted to having launched a uranium-enrichment program in parallel with its frozen plutonium program, withdrew from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and declared itself a nuclear power.""Carter, who served as Clinton's assistant secretary of defense for international security policy, continued:""Most ominously, it (North Korea) abandoned the freeze at Yongbyon,"" its plutonium reactor, ""precisely the disaster we faced in 1994.""Obama's current Pentagon chief sounded like one of today's critics of the Iran deal warning of a nuclear arms race in the region:""A nuclear North Korea could cause a domino effect in East Asia, as South Korea, Japan, and Taiwan ask themselves if their non-nuclear status is safe for them.""Carter also warned, ""Diplomacy with North Korea must have a coercive dimension, so economic strangulation and use of military force must be credibly on the table.""""In any diplomatic discussion, the United States must ultimately obtain the complete and verifiable elimination of North Korea's nuclear program ... at some point Yongbyon must be dismantled, as must the centrifuges for enriching uranium, the ballistic missiles and their factories, and the engineering infrastructure that supports them.""Why is this administration not insisting on ""the complete and verifiable elimination"" of Iran's nuclear program, its missiles and its supporting infrastructure?Why is ""economic strangulation and use of military force"" not ""credibly on the table"" when it comes to Iran?Former U.S. ambassador to the U.N. John Bolton summarized well the failure of the 1994 blunder in his memoir ""Surrender Is Not an Option.""""The North violated the deal almost before the ink was dry,"" said Bolton. ""In short, the Clinton policy and the Agreed Framework were classic illustrations of the delusion that a rogue state could be coaxed out of nuclear weapons, and were embarrassments to the United States.""And Iran, another rogue state — which has been assisted by North Korea in its nuclear testing — is shaping up as a classic illustration of the truism that those who do not learn from history are condemned to repeat it.

334,KIM,"Promises: Not long after FCC chairman Tom Wheeler swore that the FCC takeover of the Internet wouldn't result in new taxes or fees, it appears likely that new taxes will show up on Internet bills in the near future.In a speech a few weeks before the FCC voted to approve its ""net neutrality"" rules, Chairman Tom Wheeler promised there would be ""no tariffs, no new taxes"" as a result.Later that month, FCC spokeswoman Kim Hart promised that the new regulatory scheme ""does not raise taxes or fees. Period.""If that sounds suspiciously like Obama's promise that under ObamaCare you would be able to ""keep your plan. Period,"" there's a good reason.In mid-March, Wheeler told a House panel that he couldn't, in fact, rule out a new Internet fee to help pay for the government's ""Universal Service Fund"" (USF).By shoving the Internet into the agency's Title II regulatory scheme — which was set up 80 years ago to regulate the telephone monopoly — Wheeler made it possible to do so.He said a special board representing federal and state governments was weighing whether to impose that tax. Right now, the USF is paid for by a tax added to long-distance bills.""How they resolve things in the future I do not know,"" he told the House committee.Does anyone in their right mind believe that state and federal governments will say no to a brand new revenue source now that they can tap it?The Los Angeles Times doesn't seem to think so. An article published Thursday leads with: ""Recently adopted net neutrality regulations soon could make your monthly Internet bill more complicated — and potentially more expensive.""It quotes Hal Singer of the centrist Progressive Policy Institute, who figures the USF fee and various other charges that state and local government are likely to add to Internet bills will cost consumers around $11 billion a year.Wheeler has suggested that any new federal Internet fee could be offset by a lower charge on phone bills, so it would be a wash to the consumer.Right. Just last December, Wheeler authorized a $1.5 billion boost in the USF budget so he could spend more on subsidies for school and library broadband services, on top of the 47% boost in the fund's budget since 2004.Welcome to the brave new world of ObamaNet.

339,KIM,"Deploying Lena didn't work. Neither did shout-outs from Beyonce, Kim, Ilana and Abbi, Ariana, Katy, Demi or either of the Amys.Hillary Clinton's squad of celebrity surrogates, stumpers and endorsers (surnamed Dunham, Knowles-Carter, Kardashian West, Glazer, Jacobson, Grande, Perry, Lovato, Schumer and Poehler, respectively, as if you had to ask) may be totes on fleek. And they may be idolized by many American millennials.But they have not succeeded in transferring their youthful popularity to their preferred presidential candidate.Both nationwide, and in the early primary states, Bernie Sanders is thoroughly trouncing Clinton among the under-30 set.In the Iowa caucuses alone, Sanders beat Clinton 84% to 14% in this age group, according to entrance polls. That's a 70-point margin. Just for reference, note that in 2008, in the very same state, among the very same demographic, Barack Obama bested Clinton by ""only""46 points. And Obama was young and cool; Sanders is more of an eccentric-grandpa type.Why are so many young'uns feeling the Bern?I see two main reasons.The first is that, to millennials, Sanders's socialism is a feature, not a bug. Much of the current conversation about Sanders's ""democratic socialism"" is predicated on whether Americans can look past this supposedly toxic label. But millennials love Sanders not despite his socialism, but because of it.""Socialism"" has never been a dirty word for the current cohort of youth, who either didn't live through the Cold War or don't remember it. We are more likely to associate socialism with prosperous, egalitarian, relatively well-functioning Scandinavian states -- the kinds of places that produce awesome things like Ikea and ""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo"" -- than with autocrats who starve their people.Many of us also entered the job market just as unbridled capitalism appeared to blow up the world economy. Perhaps for this reason, millennials actually seem to prefer socialism to capitalism.In a recent YouGov survey, 43% of respondents under age 30 said they had a favorable opinion of socialism, while just 32% said the same about capitalism. Among all ages, races, geographic regions, genders, party affiliations and income levels, millennials were the only demographic that held socialism in higher regard than capitalism.It's not just Sanders's socialist label that sells; it's his socialist ideas, too.To a generation that's broke, in debt, underemployed and stuck in its parents' basements, promises of a political revolution, more equitable distribution of (other people's) wealth, a more robust social safety net and free college can sound pretty appealing.There's a second major reason millennials prefer Sanders to Clinton, and that one is more stylistic than substantive. It has to do with his so-called ""authenticity,"" by which is usually meant his willingness to look and sound like a hot mess.I suspect young Americans have always been skeptical of anyone trying too hard to look and sound a particular way (see: Holden Caulfield vs. the ""phonies""). But that skepticism is heightened among today's youth.In the social media era, meticulous image management is both a necessity and a source of constant resentment and cynicism. We are bombarded with carefully curated Instagram feeds, tweets and other forms of self-conscious digital preening. We must be camera-ready at all times, lest an unflattering image find its way onto Facebook.Yet what's perhaps the bravest, most powerful boast you can make online? ""#Nofilter,"" a humblebrag hashtag applied to unedited photos. Or perhaps its close cousin, ""#IWokeUpLikeThis.""It is precisely Sanders's au-naturel-ness that endears him to his young fans: his unkempt hair, his ill-fitting suits, his unpolished Brooklyn accent, his propensity to yell and wave his hands maniacally. Sanders, it appears, woke up like this.These qualities are what make him seem ""authentic,"" ""sincere"" even -- especially when contrasted with Clinton's hyper-scriptedness. Sanders, unlike Clinton, doesn't give a damn if he's camera-ready.This is, of course, a form of authenticity that is off-limits to any female politician, not just one with Clinton's baggage.Female politicians -- at least if they want to be taken seriously on a national stage -- cannot be unkempt and unfiltered, hair mussed and voice raised. They have to be carefully coifed and scripted at all times, because they have to hew as closely as possible to the bounds of propriety available to both their sex and their occupation. They can't be too quiet or too loud, too emotional or too cold, too meek or too aggressive, and so on.But they also can't appear to be trying too hard, either. At least if they want the kind of enthusiastic millennial support that Sanders enjoys.

340,KIM,"When North Korea's impulsive and eccentric young dictator Kim Jong Un on Thursday claimed, off the cuff, that his regime was ""a powerful nuclear weapons state ready to detonate a self-reliant A-bomb and H-bomb to reliably defend its sovereignty and the dignity of the nation,"" the White House and a number of nuclear weaponry experts were quick to scoff at the notion of a North Korean hydrogen weapon.

372,KIM,"Nuclear Deal: Why would Iran test-launch a 1,000-mile-range missile if our ""peace pact"" prevents Tehran from building nuclear warheads? That's not the only way President Obama's Iran agreement isn't what he says.U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power on Tuesday promised that ""the U.S. is conducting a serious review"" to confirm Iran's Nov. 21 launch near its border with Pakistan of a liquid-fuel missile with a 1,180-mile range that can carry a nuclear warhead. The launch violates a 2010 U.N. Security Council resolution.Whatever the U.S. or the U.N. might do to punish post-nuclear-deal Iran would hurt about as much as a star major leaguer being fined a few thousand dollars out of his $30 million salary or a Lotto winner paying a parking ticket. Because the deal's removal of sanctions rewards the world's foremost terror state with incomprehensible riches — $100 billion in unfrozen assets, plus the massive new business and sale of oil abroad that Tehran will enjoy.One locale that will receive a lot more Iranian oil thanks to the lifting of sanctions is North Korea, and former South Korean intelligence official Ra Jong-yil this week warned that Kim Jong-un's mega-oppressive, nuclear-armed dictatorship will likely ""barter weapons"" to Tehran for its oil.Meanwhile, symbolic of Europe being raring to go on resuming a level of commercial relations with Iran that hasn't existed since the Shah over three decades ago, Air France on Tuesday announced that it will soon resume flights from Paris to Tehran for the first time since 2008, calling the Islamofascist state ""a country with buoyant growth.""Even South Korea will practice capitalism with the terrorist regime, launching a newly announced shipbuilding venture between the Iran Shipbuilding & Offshore Industries Complex Company, which boasts the largest fleet of oil supertankers in the world, and Hyundai.No wonder Iran's ""moderate"" President Hassan Rouhani said while meeting with South Korean Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se on Saturday that the two countries can expand ""relations in all fields such as in economic, cultural and political arenas.""How remarkable it would be if the South Koreans, who understandably fear North Korea, were to strengthen their fanatical neighbor so much that it would become an even greater existential threat to them. How ironic for North Korea, a communist terrorist regime with nukes, to strengthen its alliance with an Islamist terrorist regime seeking nukes, with a huge assist from the people in more danger from that alliance than anyone else.As predicted, the capitalists are selling the rope with which they will be hanged. But who could ever have predicted that it would be radical Muslims acting as hangmen?In the end, however, the largest share of blame goes to Barack Obama, president of the nation that symbolizes capitalism, whose deal made it all possible. And, sad to say, to the tens of millions of Americans who twice gave him their votes.

373,KIM,"Tom Hudner wasn't about to leave Jesse Brown to die in North Korea. Brown's plane had been shot down on Dec. 4, 1950. With the Korean War raging, they were part of a group of fighter and bomber pilots attacking 67,000 Chinese who had come to the aid of their communist allies, surrounding 30,000 U.N. forces at the Battle of Chosin Reservoir.

"
376,KIM,"Fight To The End
"
377,KIM,"As recounted in ""Devotion"" by Adam Makos, Hudner couldn't pry Brown from the cockpit, so he radioed to bring an ax while he packed snow into the smoking engine to prevent fire from consuming the plane.
"
378,KIM,"The helicopter team also was unable to remove Brown, who by then was unconscious. The Americans had to abandon the effort and evacuate before the Chinese arrived. The ensign was later determined by a flyover to have died; he was the Navy's first black officer killed in action in the Korean War.
"
379,KIM,"Instead of being punished for disobeying orders, as Hudner expected, he was given the Medal of Honor by President Truman.

380,KIM,"Hudner was born in 1924 in Fall River, Mass. His family owned a chain of grocery stores, and he was expected to join the company after graduating from Harvard.
"

"
382,KIM,"Initially, Hudner was a communications officer on ships off Taiwan and had no interest in flying.
"
383,KIM,"Soon he saw the sky as a challenging frontier and qualified as a naval aviator at the base in Corpus Christi, Texas, in 1949.
"
384,KIM,"At 25, he was a lieutenant junior grade at Quonset Point Naval Air Station in Rhode Island when he met Jesse Brown.
"
385,KIM,"Brown was born in 1926 in Lux, Miss., the son of sharecroppers, and as a child worked 11 hours a day. His father had been a member of an all-black Army cavalry unit that was set to deploy when World War I ended.
"
386,KIM,"In the 1940s, with Truman desegregating the military, Brown aspired to be a Navy officer. Yet remnants of black-white separation remained at Annapolis, so he spent two years at Ohio State University, where he enlisted in the Naval Reserve in 1946 and graduated the next year with a degree in architectural engineering. He reported to the naval station at Glenview, Ill., and was trained at two other bases before being made an ensign and the Navy's first black aviator in April 1949.

Tom could have led a comfy, silver-spoon sort of life, and Jesse wanted to serve a nation that wouldn't allow him to be served at some restaurants. They were both selfless patriots.""Tom Hudner wasn't about to leave Jesse Brown to die in North Korea. Brown's plane had been shot down on Dec. 4, 1950. With the Korean War raging, they were part of a group of fighter and bomber pilots attacking 67,000 Chinese who had come to the aid of their communist allies, surrounding 30,000 U.N. forces at the Battle of Chosin Reservoir.Lt. Hudner and Ensign Brown had flown their F4U Corsairs from the carrier Leyte, and suddenly ground fire ruptured Brown's fuel line and he crashed behind enemy lines.""We thought Jesse had perished, but he opened his canopy and waved at us,"" Hudner, 91, told IBD from his home in Concord, Mass. ""A helicopter was on the way to rescue him, but I was told it might take 45 minutes to get there and there was smoke coming from his plane, so I knew that could be too late. Our squadron commander had warned us not to try to rescue anybody because we would probably die in the effort, but Jesse was my best friend, so I crash-landed to help him.""Fight To The EndAs recounted in ""Devotion"" by Adam Makos, Hudner couldn't pry Brown from the cockpit, so he radioed to bring an ax while he packed snow into the smoking engine to prevent fire from consuming the plane.The helicopter team also was unable to remove Brown, who by then was unconscious. The Americans had to abandon the effort and evacuate before the Chinese arrived. The ensign was later determined by a flyover to have died; he was the Navy's first black officer killed in action in the Korean War.Instead of being punished for disobeying orders, as Hudner expected, he was given the Medal of Honor by President Truman.Hudner was born in 1924 in Fall River, Mass. His family owned a chain of grocery stores, and he was expected to join the company after graduating from Harvard.But in 1943, he was inspired by America's struggle against fascism to enter the Naval Academy in Annapolis, Md. He graduated in 1946, a year late for World War II.Initially, Hudner was a communications officer on ships off Taiwan and had no interest in flying.Soon he saw the sky as a challenging frontier and qualified as a naval aviator at the base in Corpus Christi, Texas, in 1949.At 25, he was a lieutenant junior grade at Quonset Point Naval Air Station in Rhode Island when he met Jesse Brown.Brown was born in 1926 in Lux, Miss., the son of sharecroppers, and as a child worked 11 hours a day. His father had been a member of an all-black Army cavalry unit that was set to deploy when World War I ended.In the 1940s, with Truman desegregating the military, Brown aspired to be a Navy officer. Yet remnants of black-white separation remained at Annapolis, so he spent two years at Ohio State University, where he enlisted in the Naval Reserve in 1946 and graduated the next year with a degree in architectural engineering. He reported to the naval station at Glenview, Ill., and was trained at two other bases before being made an ensign and the Navy's first black aviator in April 1949.Soviet boss Josef Stalin had been stoking North Korean fears that America would rearm Japan and encouraged a seizure of the South. The communist attack in June 1950 pushed South Korean forces to the bottom of the Asian peninsula.Here Came MacArthurThanks to a vigorous U.S. and U.N. response, led by Gen. Douglas MacArthur's Inchon landing, the communists retreated to the far north by the time Hudner and Brown arrived on the Leyte with Fighter Squadron FV-32 in October.The two young officers bonded.

419,KIM,"Powered by robust demand and lean supply, high-end mall owners and quality shopping center operators are primed to perform in 2015.They are riding the crest of a stronger economy and healthy consumer spending climate, and are now luring shoppers with enhanced services and experiences.The bright prospects come at a time when the stars are also aligned for the retail industry.""Retailers are heading into 2015 with the most momentum they've had since the Great Recession,"" Ken Perkins, president of Retail Metrics, told IBD.A healthy consumer spending climate at retail would bode well for big mall owners such as Simon Property Group (SPG), Macerich (MAC), General Growth Properties (GGP), and Taubman Centers (TCO) as well as community and neighborhood shopping center operator and owner Kimco Realty (KIM), all of which benefit when their tenants get more financially fit.Malls And The MarketRetail mall real estate investment trusts are part of IBD's Finance-Property REIT industry group, and several get high Composite Ratings. Out of a possible 99, Kimco Realty has a 98, Simon Property Group a 91 and General Growth Properties an 87, factoring in metrics such as earnings growth and stock-price gains.All three have run up in the stock market. Kimco Realty shares rose 27% in 2014 and are up 11% this year. General Growth Properties jumped 40% in 2014 and is up 9% in 2015. Simon Property Group lifted 27% in 2014 and is up 11% this year.Macro tailwinds should help malls this year.""There should be a lot of momentum with the (stronger) economy and (lower) energy prices,"" Ryan Severino, senior economist for commercial real estate tracker Reis (REIS), told IBD via email. ""The decline in energy should add billions in spending. Some of that will accrue to malls. The real question is how much and will that be enough to offset the impact of store closings?""The top firms should still be regional mall REITs that focus on ""A"" malls — those that sell the most per square foot and tend toward more upscale retailers and trade areas — real estate experts say.""Class A malls should continue to have low vacancy and strong rent growth (in 2015),"" said Severino. ""But for the remainder of the subsector, vacancy could actually rise, and rent growth will probably accelerate only slightly.""At year end, the national mall vacancy rate was 8%, up 10 basis points for in 2014. Rents grew by 1.8% during that year, says Severino. He forecasts that in 2015, rents should grow by roughly 2% to 2.5%.But the national vacancy rate is not likely to change much in 2015 as store closures will offset rising demand and the outlook for lower-caliber malls ""is murkier,"" he said. ""Although a strengthening recovery in the economy and labor market, coupled with a decline in energy prices, should bolster the subsector, this will compete against the store closings (in lower-caliber malls) of some important retailers such asJ.C. Penney (JCP) and Sears (SHLD).""Class A OverachieversStifel Nicolaus analyst Nathan Isbee is also upbeat about prospects for ""A"" malls. ""Retailer demand for high-quality mall space will remain robust in 2015 from international and domestic retailers,"" he wrote in a report, calling high-quality mall space is ""extremely limited.""General Growth Properties is his top regional mall pick for 2015. The REIT focuses exclusively on owning, managing, leasing and redeveloping Class A regional malls and urban flagship locations in the U.S., spokesman Kevin Berry told IBD.He says the firm believes that owning these retail properties positions it well for the long term.Generally, he adds, the properties' leases have ten-year terms with annual contractual increases in rent. ""On average, 10% of the leases expire,"" he said. ""The majority of the annual revenue (is) in place when the year begins.""General Growth Properties' strategy since Sandeep Mathrani became CEO in 2011 has been the creation of a redevelopment/expansion pipeline of projects, Berry says. As of Dec. 31, the firm had development and redevelopment activities totaling about $2.4 billion ""at share,"" of which projects totaling about $418 million have opened, $1.2 billion are under construction and $825 million are in the pipeline.Redevelopment is all tenant driven, says Berry. General's largest redevelopment project is at Ala Moana Center in Honolulu, which it is expanding with a new luxury wing anchored by Bloomingdale's and Nordstrom (JWN). General also focuses on improving the shopping experience by adding options such as movie theaters and restaurants, which give shoppers more reasons to come to the malls and spend time.""Mall vacancies in the U.S. are currently at a five-year low of 5.7% and at 5.5% for just the major markets,"" said Greg Maloney, CEO of the Americas Retail Group at commercial real estate firm Jones Lang LaSalle (JLL), citing real estate data company CoStar as the source.He says that malls are going into 2015 with probably the best fundamentals seen in the past five years.""Liquidity and appetite for product has been here for a few years, but now consumers are feeling much better about the economy, and that is the driving force,"" he adds. ""We now have positive momentum. Retailers are looking to expand with new stores, and there's a renewed interest in terms of retailers looking for new space.""He says that there's some new mall development for the first time in a long time, including three or four projects that JLL is doing.Isbee notes that shopping center REIT fundamentals are ""healthy as occupancies are approaching or exceeding pre-recession levels.""Kimco Realty is among REITs he rates a buy. It operates North America's largest publicly traded portfolio of neighborhood and community shopping centers. CEO David Henry calls fundamentals for such shopping centers strong. ""We've been very fortunate that there's been no new building of shopping centers for six years,"" he told IBD.While the supply of centers hasn't grown, the U.S. population has grown at between 2.5 million and 3 million people a year. And the need for restaurants, grocers, dry cleaners and other businesses has grown with the population.""That's why occupancies are moving up and all the vital signs are looking good for shopping centers,"" he said, adding that shopping centers are still in ""recovery mode"" and rents not back to all-time highs. But he says Kimco is benefiting from more demand and limited supply.Henry says that occupancy at ""quality"" centers is at 95%, close to Kimco's all-time high of 96% before the recession.Redevelopment Vs. New MallsKimco has been doing a lot of redevelopment, he says, and the best place to invest capital is in its own properties — the value of projects in the pipeline is nearing $1 billion.Most of the new development among the mall REITs has been concentrated on outlet centers, with six opened in 2014, says Isbee.David Ober, president of Global Outlet Management, says that among the reasons behind building more outlet centers is retailers' desire to include outlet stores as a part of their ""omnichannel"" distribution mix along with full-price stores.Still, Garrick Brown, vice president of research at property services firm DTZ, says, ""We are nearing a saturation point"" in outlet center building and adds that there's room for only ""a little more product.""""Everyone wants to jump on this bandwagon to build these because they have performed so well in recent years,"" he said by email. ""But they will probably build too many.""

420,KIM,"In its ""Global Application & Network Security Report"" for 2014-15, Radware called 2014 ""a watershed year"" for the cybersecurity industry, one in which cyberattacks ""reached a tipping point"" in terms of their quantity, length, complexity and targets.Radware (RDWR) should know. It provides integrated application delivery and network security hardware for enterprises ranging from banks and insurers to manufacturers, retailers, telecoms, government agencies, media firms and service providers.The company's core product provides load balancing, traffic management, application performance monitoring and network security. Its website boasts that it offers ""complete security of business critical applications"" for around 10,000 enterprises and carriers worldwide. Its partners include Check Point Software Technologies (CHKP) and Juniper Networks (JNPR).In addition to helping businesses improve productivity and profitability, and lower IT operating and infrastructure costs, Radware's cybersecurity and application delivery solutions are designed to help customers secure and manage network traffic.Safety Is SellingThe security end of the business has become ""a very hot market"" for Radware, says Chief Financial Officer Meir Moshe.""President Obama even talked about how this is a nationwide challenge following the attack on Sony, which he said came in from North Korea,"" Moshe told IBD in a phone interview from his Tel Aviv office. ""Companies need to be protected against cybersecurity attacks, and so we've seen an acceleration of growth in this market.""Radware's technology is designed to recognize potential threats in a network's traffic and block them before they have a chance to do any damage, Moshe says. That requires sophisticated gear that can analyze anomalies in traffic so that ""only legitimate traffic"" flows into the network.One such product, a new version of Radware's DefensePro platform, was launched this month. It is designed to help high-end cloud service providers mitigate sophisticated attacks by providing more security capacity.""Security in the cloud is our main focus for 2015,"" Moshe said. ""We have put a lot of resources into this because it is a very high-demand and growing market.""Analysts likewise have a bullish outlook on the cybersecurity market, as well as Radware's growth opportunities in it.New ServicesIn a research note, Imperial Capital analyst Michael Kim said he anticipates ""continued strong growth driven by increasing demand"" for Radware's security solutions.""We see particular opportunities for broadening deployments of application security and data center protection solutions, with potential upside from new cloud security services — e.g., managed attack mitigation and web application firewall,"" Kim noted.Buckingham Research analyst Rohit Chopra calls Radware ""one of the most compelling hybrid ways to play strong secular trends in security.""He expects Radware to increase R&D; and other spending as a way to capture new cybersecurity opportunities as well as prepare for a new partnership with a still-unnamed original equipment manufacturer (OEM) that Chopra says will likely be a ""large networking provider.""Partnership PlanningMoshe would not divulge the name of the OEM, though he did confirm that the OEM will be identified during the second quarter and that revenue from the relationship will start coming in during the second half of the year.Financially, Radware continues to bounce back from a sluggish 2013, when it reported lower earnings and only a slight increase in sales. Part of the problem then was fierce competition that drove down prices, Moshe says.Thanks to a bigger emphasis on higher-margin security products, Radware has now posted four straight quarters of double-digit sales and earnings growth, the first time that's happened since 2012.On Jan. 28, Radware reported fourth-quarter earnings of 28 cents a share, up from 22 cents a year earlier and a penny above the consensus view of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. Revenue climbed 15% to $61 million, also slightly above estimates.The company's operating margins expanded to 22% at the end of 2014 from 14% at the end of the year.Radware's stock price sank 12% to 19.72 after it guided Q1 sales and earnings at the low end of analyst expectations. Shares have since regained some ground and currently trade near 22.For the full year, Radware's EPS grew 25% to 86 cents while revenue climbed 15% to $222 million — the biggest annual top-line gain since 2011.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect Radware to increase 2015 earnings by 20% to $1.03 a share and revenue by 12% to $247.9 million.""By focusing on high-performance capabilities, tight integration of multiple services and multiple deployment options, Radware is carving out a defensible portion of the application delivery assurance market,"" D.A. Davidson analyst Mark Kelleher noted in a research report.He reckons Radware's ""continued innovation"" will let the company ""expand its addressable market and maintain mid-teens top-line growth for at least the next three years.""Radware has an IBD Composite Rating of 95, factoring in metrics such as earnings growth and stock-price gains. It belongs to IBD's Computer-Networking industry group, which ranks No. 45 in performance among 197 tracked.Radware is the top-rated stock in the group. Other high-rated stocks in the group include QLogic (QLGC), Arista Networks (ANET) and Ruckus Wireless (RKUS).

It just shows a provocative weakness.It's as if the U.S. has become a helpless giant. It's not only that an American ambassador was murdered by terrorists in Benghazi, Libya, in 2012 as he pleaded for help on the anniversary of 9/11.There have also been bombs, one at the U.S. embassy in Ankara, Turkey, in 2013 that killed two bystanders. There also have been quite a few acts of barbarism against U.S. envoys in Havana, Cuba, and Caracas, Venezuela, in recent years.Meanwhile, there are several innocent Americans, including a Washington Post reporter, still held in Iranian dungeons by the mullahs. Most recently, there were the brazen killings of two U.S. journalists and two aid workers in Islamic State-held Syria and Iraq.All of these events came and went without apparent consequences for the attackers, beyond the usual statements to condemn the acts.Now the bloodshed has spread, with Wednesday's knife attack on U.S. Ambassador to South Korea Mark Lippert by a pro-North Korea maniac who'd already attacked Japan's ambassador with a brick once but got let off with a suspended sentence.Until now, the barbarism has been largely Middle Eastern and related to radical Islam. Now it's a free-for-all.And to make sure that the world truly understood his intentions, the knife-wielding attacker Kim Ki-jong hollered, ""I committed a terrorist act"" as he was arrested.The attacks all send a cumulative message: The Obama administration doesn't particularly care about the fate of its representatives abroad, based on the mealy-mouthed reactions, foolish calls for ""smart diplomacy"" and vows to raise America's standing. Indeed, the U.S. is easier to kick around than ever.The Benghazi attack was blamed on a San Fernando Valley filmmaker, not the terrorists who did it, and it wasn't long before they were seen fearlessly walking around in fancy hotels and giving interviews to New York Times reporters. They still haven't been caught.The attackers in Turkey and the mullahs in Iran got away with it as well, with scarcely any official notice. The Americans killed in Islamic State territory drew public hand-wringing from the Obama White House, but no retaliation of the powerful kind shown by the King of Jordan when a Jordanian was burnt to death.But the North Korean attack on Lippert, who speaks Korean and often mixes with the locals, was met by a chirpy State Department and White House effort to sweep the matter under the rug — despite Lippert enduring two and a half hours of surgery and 80 stitches on his face, and despite North Korea's odious totalitarian regime applauding the attack.""We strongly condemn this act of violence,"" said State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf. Boilerplate.As for Lippert, ""I expect he'll be on his feet and in his job as soon as possible,"" said Obama's Deputy National Security Advisor Ben Rhodes in an interview with MSNBC. Nothing to see here, move along.It's weakness that makes terrorists cook up new violence. Was North Korea warned about its incitement from the U.S.? It had already gotten away with a cyberattack on Sony in the U.S. It obviously didn't get much of a message. And so now it's escalated its attack.Terrorists know what they are going to get if they dare attack a Russian or Israeli envoy abroad — disproportionate retaliation. And as a result it doesn't happen often. But from us, only denial. Weakness is provocative, former Secretary of State Donald Rumsfeld once said. That's something the U.S. refuses to learn.
"
439,KIM,"Nuclear War: By President Obama's Iran logic, the U.S. should stop worrying and learn to love North Korea's H-bomb. In the real world, what worked for four decades was mutual assured destruction.It is typical of the Obama administration that it reacts to one of the spokes on the Axis of Evil raising the nuclear ante by suggesting that it didn't really happen, so you can stop worrying, folks.The unpredictable and terrifying North Korea announces testing a hydrogen bomb, and White House spokesman Josh Earnest contends, ""The initial analysis is not consistent with the North Korean claims.""As IBD revealed less than a month ago, nuclear experts familiar with the atomic weaponry breakthroughs of North Korea's friend China in the 1960s found that for Beijing, it was ""much easier to build the thermonuclear weapon than a fission one"" because ""the basic scientific and technical expertise had already been assembled."" There was, in fact, a mere two years and eight months between Communist China's first A-bomb test in 1964 and its first H-bomb test in 1967.Instead of pretending that it didn't happen, the White House should be making it clear to North Korea's young, narcissistic ruler, Kim Jong Un, and his henchmen that any nuclear attack will be responded to in kind. The Mutual Assured Destruction doctrine may be seen as mad by many, but it prevented Soviet nuclear attack and blackmail against the West for four decades.President Bill Clinton, courtesy of unsolicited meddling from Jimmy Carter, thought he had solved North Korea's nuclear ambitions via negotiation. It ultimately failed, and we can now conclude that talk and bribery are no solutions to the North Korean WMD threat.Unlike Islamists, Kim and his militarist cadre don't find early entry into the afterlife an attractive prospect.But by the logic of the Obama administration, the U.S. response should now be to dispatch Secretary of State John Kerry and have him spend a year figuring out what Pyongyang's price is. At the end of that charade, naturally, North Korea would be allowed to keep its H-bomb while pretending not to.Whether or not Obama performs such an Asian peace pivot, Kim Jong Un's regime — with its history of helping Iran with developing both atomic weapons and the ballistic missiles that can carry them — could supply Tehran with an A- or H-bomb, Obama's Iran nuclear deal be damned.Seismic readings from Tuesday's North Korean test suggest to some experts interviewed that what Pyongyang detonated was just another small A-bomb, contrary to the regime's claims. Even if it turns out to be true, North Korean rhetoric strongly indicates that it is at least close to thermonuclear ability.Early in his first presidential campaign, Barack Obama promised to ""develop a strong international coalition to ... eliminate North Korea's nuclear weapons program"" through ""sustained, direct and aggressive diplomacy — the kind that the Bush administration has been unable and unwilling to use.""Wrong. The solution is to point an ICBM at Kim Jong Un's head.

468,KIM,"Scan the lodging options around most big U.S. airports, and you'll find an abundance of humble accommodations — along with a few best described as frightening. The tony hotels are typically found in city centers, where business travelers, tourists, and conventioneers tend to congregate.
"
469,KIM,"The post-recession U.S. hotel boom is changing that, with upscale airport hotels now planned in Minneapolis-St. Paul, New York City and Atlanta, as well as a 500-room Westin which opened Thursday at Denver International Airport.Given the generally higher costs for a full-service hotel such as a W or Hilton, these projects haven't traditionally mixed with airport traffic that comes and leaves quickly, often because of weather-marred flights. But two travel trends are converging to change that math.Commercial real estate developers are seeing airports as fertile locations, driven by rising demand for rooms and conference space. And U.S. airports are upgrading their facilities to appeal to a more sophisticated clientele, the kind who want such amenities as spas, trendy bistros, and even yoga spaces.""Passengers in general have increased their expectations of airports,"" said Kim Day, chief executive officer of Denver International. ""They want higher-end shopping, better food, and they want better places to stay when they stay.""That also means a stroll to the hotel lobby from the terminal — no shuttles — along with cutting-edge design, full-service spas, chic bars and upscale restaurants.This new breed of airport hotel also affords ample space for business meetings, given that many companies like the idea of flying employees to a central point near (or in) an airport and getting down to business without the hassles of transit. And with occupancy rates near record levels for most full-service hotels, it's harder for a business group to find room at the inn, which changes the economics of putting a full-service property at or near an airport.Introducing The 'Travel Plaza'Room demand at airport locations has grown from an average of 55 million room nights in 2010 to 65 million today, according to STR, a lodging data and research firm. Average room rates at airport locations have also increased, in line with the overall industry, and now top $110 per night. ""The occupancies are so high now some players are saying wait a second, maybe this is a place we should look,"" said Jan Freitag, an STR senior vice president.The Denver hotel, which has endured a history of fits and starts since the airport's 1995 opening, is designed as a destination for business travelers to meet and a way to bridge the airport with central Denver, which sits nearly 30 miles to the west. In April, a new light rail train will connect the Westin and airport with downtown via a $9 ride that's 37 minutes. Day predicts that line will help make the hotel a destination for weddings and other events.This summer, officials at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International sought bidders for a 300-room, ""top-tier"" four-star hotel to be built as part of a ""travel plaza"" that would have office space, a gas station and possibly residential units. Atlanta vies with Chicago's O'Hare as the world's busiest airport hub but has no hotel connected to a terminal, as airports such as those at Detroit, Tampa and Huntsville, Ala., offer.From Backstop To Better Product""In the 1960s and '70s, airport hotels were for distressed passengers"" grounded by bad weather or a broken airplane, said Tyler Morse, chief executive of MCR Development, which is building a 505-room hotel in the former TWA Flight Center at JFK International Airport. JetBlue Airways (JBLU) is a minority owner of the project, which will be connected to the airline's Terminal 5. The hotel is planned to open in the third quarter of 2018. ""They thought 'I should have this as a backstop. Let's do the bare-minimum kind of thing,'"" Morse said. ""And now people are saying, 'Hey, I can make money by having a higher-quality product.' ""Stephen Joyce, chief executive of Choice Hotels International (CHH), said the deep airline capacity cuts of the 2000s led airports to retrench as business travel waned. Hotel developers then looked elsewhere, and much of the airport lodging stock aged. Today, the airport market is ""becoming more interesting,"" Joyce said in a recent interview. ""I bet we've got 10-12 projects in and around airports"" that are under various stages of development.Mid- To High-End TravelersIn Minneapolis-St. Paul, Graves Hospitality is planning a $115 million hotel with a spa, rooftop suites, and as much as 40,000 square feet of meeting space. The 300-room property, attached to the airport's primary Terminal 1, will command rates that are 15% to 30% higher than local competing properties, at $225-$250 per night, said Benjamin Graves, president and chief executive.""The primary business is corporations that are dealing with mid- to high-end travelers that fly in, go to a meeting; they don't have to get a taxi, they don't have to figure out the market and how to get different places,"" Graves said. Graves Hospitality is negotiating with a trio of major chains — Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide (HOT), Hilton Worldwide Holdings (HLT) and InterContinental Hotel Group (IHG) — about which will brand and operate the property, which is scheduled to open in January 2018.""Go to any airport, and there's a zillion hotels within two miles,"" Morse said. ""To really do this right, you've got to be physically connected.""And at many airports, a day spa doesn't hurt either.

470,KIM,"Facing tough comparisons with year-earlier numbers, Wall Street expects Salesforce.com (CRM) late Wednesday to ease off its speedy earnings and sales growth rates just a bit.The consensus of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters estimates the leading customer relationship management software developer will report third-quarter earnings of 19 cents per share ex items, up 36% from the year-earlier quarter, on $1.70 billion in revenue, up 23%.In Q2, Salesforce boosted EPS ex items 46% and sales 24%. In Q3 of fiscal 2015, earnings rose 56% and sales 29%.The analysts sales estimates are in line with the company's revenue guidance.Despite the softening growth, if Q3 unfolds as expected, CEO Marc Benioff could echo his declaration when he announced Q2 performance:""That puts us on pace to reach a $7 billion run rate later this year, and our goal is to be the fastest (enterprise software company) to reach $10 billion in annual revenue.""Salesforce stock enjoyed a record closing high 79.41 on Nov. 6, but shares fell 3.5% Friday to close at 75.60, a one-month closing low.Not alone on Friday the 13th, Salesforce rivals Oracle (ORCL) fell 3.4%, SAP (SAP) 1.5% and Microsoft (MSFT) nearly 1% on a bad day for the market overall.Salesforce.com stock is up nearly 28% this year.""Our recent checks indicate all large system integrators are actively pitching Salesforce.com's solutions over that of SAP and Oracle,"" wrote Lake Street Capital Markets analyst Yun Kim in a research note.Lake Street initiated coverage of salesforce Monday with a buy rating and 95 price target.""We see this as a turning point in the enterprise application landscape and believe that the company is well positioned for incremental growth driven by accelerating momentum in the large enterprise market,"" Kim wrote.On Thursday, Piper Jaffray raised its price target for Salesforce stock to 84 from 80, with an overweight rating.Q3 earnings are scheduled for release after the market closes.

490,KIM,"Mobile video game maker Glu Mobile (GLUU) came unglued on the stock market today after giving sharply lower guidance for the current quarter despite the upcoming release of a game starring pop singer Katy Perry.Glu stock fell as much as 17.8% in morning trading. In early afternoon trading, Glu was down about 13% just above 3.The San Francisco-based company late Thursday beat Wall Street's targets for the third quarter. It earned 6 cents a share on sales of $64.4 million. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected Glu to break even on sales of $59.3 million. However, on a year-over-year basis, earnings per share were down 65% and sales were down 23%.For the fourth quarter, Glu expects sales of $50 million to $52 million, significantly below expectations for $94.2 million. It expects to lose 2 to 3 cents a share when analysts were looking for a profit of 6 cents a share.""Not pretty at all"" is how Cowen analyst Doug Creutz described Glu's Q2 financial report.More Celebrity Games Coming""Recent title launches have under-delivered, as we anticipated, but the financial downside was more severe than we expected,"" he said in a report Friday. ""The company clearly has some issues with its male-skewing action titles; however, with 'Katy Perry Pop' launching on Dec. 17, we think the stock still presents good risk/reward at current levels.""Creutz reiterated his outperform rating on Glu but lowered his price target to 5 from 8.Glu needs ""Katy Perry Pop"" to be a hit to validate its investment in celebrity-themed games. Its game ""Kim Kardashian: Hollywood"" is a hit, but whether its success can be duplicated with other celebrities is a big unknown.After the Perry title, it has three more celebrity-themed titles coming through next summer, including ones with the Jenner sisters, Britney Spears and Nicki Minaj. It also has signed two male, non-musician celebrities to its roster, but didn't identify them.Glu also announced Thursday that it has partnered with Tencent (TCEHY) to bring the latter's ""WeFire"" shooter game to Western markets. That game is estimated to generate more than $100 million a year in China, Creutz said.On a conference call with analysts, Glu CEO Niccolo de Masi said changes to the Apple (AAPL) App Store rankings have made it harder for game titles to reach and hold a top three ranking. That has adversely impacted game discovery and downloads, he said.The App Store changes led to the underperformance of key Q3 titles ""Deer Hunter 2016,"" ""Eternity Warriors 4,"" and ""James Bond World: World of Espionage,"" he said.Zynga Delays Two Big GamesThe Glu earnings report was the third in as many days from mobile game publishers.On Tuesday, Zynga (ZNGA), maker of games like ""Words with Friends"" and ""Zynga Poker,"" beat Q3 estimates but guided below views for the current quarter as it delayed two big games into next year. Those new games are ""Dawn of Titans"" and ""CSR2.""""It is clear that with the rolling delays Zynga is posting for its games that its development organization is not in a good place,"" Pacific Crest Securities analyst Evan Wilson said in a report. ""Delays are a fact of life in the game industry, but Zynga's are well beyond the standard and we think this lowers the probability that they will be successful when released.""Making matters worse, Zynga's user base continued to decline in the third quarter. Daily active users slipped to 19 million in the September quarter, from 21 million in the June quarter and 24 million in the September quarter last year. Zynga's monthly active users fell to 75 million in Q3 from 83 million in Q2 and 103 million in Q3 2014.In Q3, San Francisco-based Zynga broke even excluding items on sales of $176 million. Analysts were modeling for a 1 cent per share loss on sales of $170 million. Sales were up a fraction of a percent over the year-earlier period.King Posts Sweet Q3 EarningsOn Wednesday, King Digital Entertainment (KING), maker of ""Candy Crush Saga,"" soundly beat estimates for Q3.London-based King earned 45 cents a share excluding items on sales of $473 million. On a year-over-year basis, earnings per share were down 20% and sales were down 10%. But analysts were expecting King to earn 38 cents a share on sales of $459 million.PC and console game publisher Activision Blizzard (ATVI) announced Monday that it plans to buy King Digital in a deal worth $5.9 billion.Follow Patrick Seitz on Twitter @IBD_PSeitz and on Facebook.

506,KIM,"Etsy's handcrafted, artisanal listing for a $100 million IPO has perked up would-be investors — but piqued many of its sellers. The online crafts marketplace has always focused on its community as the ""heart and soul"" of the company. As that community, which now numbers 1.4 million active sellers and 19.8 million active buyers, grows, so has the company's cash flow. Revenue jumped 56.4% to $195.6 million in 2014.And this has merchants worried.""(E)tsy is becoming a money machine,"" wrote user Olga in one of the many Etsy forums discussing the IPO news. Olga's shop on the site, Polgani Studio, sells hand-painted silk scarves.She, like many other sellers, voiced concern that the marketplace would become more like eBay (EBAY) and Alibaba's (BABA) AliExpress, and lose its focus on unique crafts.Etsy previously faced user backlash in 2013 when it began permitting sellers to outsource the manufacturing of their designs, as sellers had already complained of cheaply made, mass-produced knockoffs flooding the marketplace.""They are moving away from the 'Handmade' aspect because that's not where the money is,"" wrote seller Kim J of Attis Treasures, which sells items such as loom rubber bands and wood buttons. ""It's not the same Etsy. It changed from what it was originally meant to be.""While it might be easy to dismiss the concerns of a few homegrown businesspeople, even Etsy seems aware that its current model might not be perfectly crafted for investors.The company, which charges 20 cents per product listing, admits in its SEC filing that it has ""a history of operating losses"" and ""may not achieve or maintain profitability in the future.""And Etsy founder Rob Kalin, a woodworker who founded the company 10 years ago, said in a 2011 Inc. magazine profile that trying to maximize shareholder value was ""ridiculous."" He has since stepped down as CEO and handed over the reins to former Yahoo (YHOO) executive Chad Dickerson.RapidRatings, a financial health assessment firm, gave Etsy a 23 on a scale of 0-100, with 100 being the best.""The rating continues to depict a High Risk credit profile as net profitability, operating profitability and capital structure efficiency are at low levels relative to the global data set,"" said RapidRatings in a report Thursday.""These have been traditional weaknesses for the company and are clearly areas in need of management's attention.""But Etsy does seem aware that its heart and soul can't stray too far onto Wall Street.""The authenticity of our marketplace and the connections within our community are important to our success,"" said Etsy in the filing.

536,KIM,"Tencent Stock Selling Off - Here's Why.Glu Mobile (GLUU) continues to mine the celebrity-themed video game niche that it created with ""Kim Kardashian: Hollywood"" by signing pop singer Britney Spears for a similar game.Glu stock jumped as much as 27% on the stock market today, a day after the company reported better-than-expected first-quarter results and announced a strategic investment by Tencent Holdings (TCEHY) and a partnership with Spears. In afternoon trading Thursday, Glu stock was up 22%, near 6.60.For the March quarter, Glu earned 2 cents a share excluding items on sales of $62.4 million. Analysts were expecting a per-share loss of a penny on sales of $51.6 million. Sales were up 33% year over year. Earnings were down 67% from 6 cents a share in the year-earlier quarter.""The outperformance during the first quarter was driven by the ongoing traction of 'Kim Kardashian: Hollywood,' 'Racing Rivals,' 'Deer Hunter 2014,' and 'Contract Killer: Sniper,'"" Glu CEO Niccolo de Masi said in a statement.Glu, a leading publisher of games for smartphone and tablets, also raised its full-year guidance. The San Francisco-based company now expects to earn 22 cents a share excluding items on adjusted sales of $275 million at the midpoint of guidance.For the June quarter, Glu expects a per-share loss of 4 cents excluding items on adjusted sales of $51 million at the midpoint of guidance.Tencent Buying StakeLate Wednesday, Glu announced that Chinese messaging and games giant Tencent had agreed to buy 21 million shares of Glu's common stock for $6 per share, for total of $126 million. Once the deal is complete, Tencent will own 14.6% of Glu.""Tencent was attracted to Glu due to its five-year growth track record, high-quality entrepreneurial management and unique approach to methodically building a portfolio of success in the shooter, action (role-playing game), narrative-RPG, time-management, sports and racing genres,"" Steven Ma, head of Tencent's Interactive Entertainment Group, said in a statement. ""Collaboration between our companies will enable Glu to tailor its games more powerfully by tapping Tencent's strength in online, social and MMO capabilities.""Tencent owns Riot Games, maker of ""League of Legends,"" and holds a stake in Activision (ATVI).Glu also announced late Wednesday that it has signed Spears to its celebrity roster. Glu plans to develop a new mobile game featuring Spears to be launched worldwide in the first half of 2016. The exclusive agreement spans five years with the possibility of a three-year extension.""Featuring the voice, likeness and creative influence of Ms. Spears, the game will allow players to interact with Britney and experience the glitz and glamour of the entertainment business,"" Glu said in a press release.Spears joins Kardashian, as well as singer Katy Perry and reality-TV stars Kylie and Kendall Jenner, in Glu's fast-growing celebrity stable.RELATED:Kendall and Kylie Jenner video game could break seventh sealTencent Stock Selling Off - Here's Why.

554,KIM,"As part of their marketing, financial advisers often try to differentiate themselves. They use lofty language to describe their expertise, passion and commitment to clients.They usually write value statements to encapsulate what they do, why they do it and how their methodology or philosophy benefits clients. These descriptions influence how prospective clients view the firm — and can either attract business or drive it away.""As you assess new prospects, your value proposition gives you a filter,"" said Kim Dellarocca, managing director at Pershing, a Bank of New York Mellon (BK) company. ""It's a way to evaluate clients so that you're running a profitable business with the clients you want.""Ideally, value propositions help prospects answer the question, ""Why should I do business with you?"" Yet a 2014 Pershing study found that 60% of investors say that most advisers tend to make similar promises, making it difficult to distinguish among them.What Clients WantAdvisers can fall into the trap of composing value statements that emphasize themes that they care about. But that raises the equally important question, ""What about the attributes that clients care about?""In the Pershing study, Dellarocca and her team found that advisers tend to highlight aspects of their practice that may not necessarily resonate with investors. For example, some advisers like to hype their ability to deliver ""simplicity"" and translate financial jargon into plain English. Many clients appreciate simplicity, but others may prefer to enlist the services of an adviser with a mastery of complex investment vehicles.When developing a value statement, think in terms of what distinguishes your practice as well as what clients hold in high regard. Try to underscore attributes that both set you apart and appeal to your target market.If you work with busy entrepreneurs who prefer not to read thick statements and explanatory materials, promise to educate clients in less time. For instance, you can promote and send to your clients a monthly ""top three list,"" consisting of the most crucial bulleted items they need to digest.To take another example, you may feel strongly about conveying your conservative approach to portfolio management. While there's nothing wrong with a safe, steady investment strategy, you might want to consider what your prospects want from their adviser.""Advisers who use the word 'conservative' know that they can take unnecessary risk out of the equation for investors,"" Dellarocca said. ""But some investors might be wary of that. They may be looking for an adviser who can manage risk but who also allows them to meet their investing goals that may change over time.""Spread The MessagePerhaps the biggest trap for advisers writing value statements is to overplay the trust card. Almost every adviser cites trust and integrity as core values of the business. Such concepts tend to lose their meaning unless they're linked to compelling and emotionally satisfying stories.""Instead of just using the word 'trust' a lot, tie it to a real narrative like how you were there for your clients during the financial crisis,"" Dellarocca said.Once you finish your value statement, make it come alive to your staff. List its key elements and visually reinforce them among your employees by, say, creating a screen saver that they see at their desk or designing framed summaries that adorn the walls of your conference room.Take every opportunity to educate clients about your value statement. Ideally, you want them to retain what makes you and your practice stand out.""The test is whether your clients are at a party and they can share with someone else what makes you such an effective adviser,"" Dellarocca said. ""You want them to evangelize for you and articulate your values. Their message should resonate with others who can identify with it.""

566,KIM,"You have a great business idea. Next: the cash hunt.Many firms sprint to business pitch competitions for awards of investment capital and support.""Shark Tank,"" a pitch competition in its sixth season on ABC, secured 7 million viewers last year. Smaller competitions are hopping in all 50 states. How to win: Go big. ""Talk about the size of the opportunity, right upfront,"" Kim Thanos, CEO of online education firm Lumen Learning, told IBD. ""Make sure it is significant enough to grab the attention of the investors and judges you're pitching to. If you cover that information in a compelling way at the beginning of your pitch, it will cue investors to pay attention.""Her company won the grand prize at the Educause Game Changers Business Competition in Orlando, Fla., last fall.""It surprises me how often company pitches don't discuss the size of the opportunity,"" Thanos added. ""That is such a fundamental part of convincing anyone your business concept has merit."" Talk perks. Focus on benefits. Sometimes that takes a little tweak in how you think about your work.Example: ""When you are talking about a Hoover vacuum cleaner with a 3.7 amp power motor, the benefit is you can vacuum in 30 minutes or less,"" said Keith Chamberlain, who organized the Game Changers meet where Lumen soared by emphasizing how students can advance by not having to buy their weight in textbooks. Aim for perfection.  ""Practice until you know your pitch by heart and you can do it over and over again in the time allotted,"" Thanos suggested. ""Practice your pitch around other people and ask them for feedback so you know which phrases get people nodding their heads and really getting what your company is about. Practice with people who know nothing about your business. If you can get them nodding and excited about your business concept, you're on the right track. And if they just stare at you blankly, you know you've still got work to do."" Speak up. ""Don't have your engineer get up there,"" Chamberlain said. ""Have your charismatic CEO or your public marketing person present."" Dig deep. The more you research to back up your gold mine's appeal, the better, Thanos and Chamberlain advise. ""An investor wants to hear that it's been validated in one shape or form,"" he said. Keep shining. Smart businesses should focus on grabbing another great prize — relationships with members of the panel.""Each time you do your pitch for an investor audience, it is a learning opportunity,"" Thanos said. ""Ask them for suggestions to improve your pitch, and then keep tightening it up and polishing it.""Emily Foote, co-founder of online learning company ApprenNet, agrees. Now in its fourth year of business, her firm is a veteran on the startup pitch circuit. ApprenNet went up against Lumen and 10 other firms at the Game Changers competition in Orlando.Not every meet has led to cash, she says, but business is still booming, partly because of the valuable exposure and networking time at pitch events. ""It's a cheap way to get good feedback,"" she said. Balance. Pitching often gives entrepreneurs an irresistible rush, but the most successful businesses treat it as just one of many ways to raise capital and bulk up the customer base. Advice: Don't let the sport of pitching get in the way of your day-to-day operations and long-term strategy. ""It's so fun,"" Foote said. ""But as you get older and get wind under your sails, (pitch competitions) can become a distraction.""

569,KIM,"Management at Store Capital has had plenty of cause to celebrate since its IPO. Store Capital (STOR), which went public in November, provides real estate financing in single-tenant properties including chain restaurants, supermarkets, drugstores and other retail, service and distribution facilities.It's an internally managed real estate investment trust. The REIT acquires single-tenant properties directly from customers in sale-leaseback transactions, where customers sell Store Capital their operating properties and simultaneously enter into a long-term triple net lease with the company to lease the property back.It focuses mainly on middle-market companies, with annual gross revenue between $20 million and $300 million, but some are bigger. Among its customers are electronics retailer Conn's (CONN) and casual dining eatery operator O'Charley's.Sale-Leaseback DealsA sale-leaseback transaction ""frees up"" the original owner's capital, while allowing it to keep possession and use of the property, Store Capital's website notes. It ""takes the place of"" the debt and equity capital that a company would otherwise require to finance its real estate.""They're basically monetizing their real estate so they don't have to have a significant amount of capital tied up in real estate,"" SunTrust analyst Ki Bin Kim told IBD.A triple net lease is a lease structure in which the tenant is responsible for all expenses on the property, including taxes, insurance and maintenance, in addition to the rent.Since its IPO, Store Capital stock has risen 23% from its offering price of 18.50. Contributing to investor enthusiasm is the point that the company has delivered financial results beyond expectations.In the fourth quarter, its first quarterly report to shareholders as a public company, Store Capital logged net income of 18 cents a share, topping the consensus forecast of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters for 11 cents. Rental revenue was $53 million. Total revenue rose 65% to $55.2 million. The REIT reported adjusted funds from operations of 35 cents a share for the quarter and $1.39 a share for the year.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect 2015 net income to slip 3% to 59 cents a share. But they see an 18% gain in 2016.""The triple net lease space is a very vibrant subsector in REITs,"" said Kim. ""We've seen a tremendous amount of transactions occur in the past couple of years. There's no sign of that slowing down for an acquirer with the right cost of capital. The business model continues to work for the triple net lease.""In 2014 the company invested $1.1 billion in 341 properties at an initial weighted average capitalization rate (a measure of return) of 8.3%.""This significant level of volume speaks to the important need we address in the marketplace as companies increasingly focus on managing capital more efficiently,"" said Store Capital CEO Christopher Volk in a statement.As of December 2014, the company's real estate portfolio totaled $2.8 billion in gross investment, representing 947 property locations, substantially all of which are profit centers for the company's customers, in 46 states. A hefty 97% of its properties are under triple net leases, which will serve to lessen its property cost, Volk added. In the fourth quarter, it originated $289.5 million of gross investments in 105 properties at an initial weighted average cap rate of 8%.""In their first earnings report (as a public company), they closed on more than expected acquisitions at a very healthy percentage yield,"" said Kim in commenting on the quarter. ""They did pretty well coming out of the gates.""Store Capital's assets have three payment sources, while other commercial real estate assets have just two, noted Volk on the fourth-quarter conference call.""The differentiator lies in the primary payment source, which is embedded in the profits produced at the properties that we own,"" he added. ""The remaining two payment sources reside in tenant credit quality and real estate residual values, which are payment sources that are common to all commercial real estate investments.""Fine In Dining And ShoppingThe service sector, which includes restaurants and fitness centers, is the company's biggest target market at 47%. Retail represents 37% and industrial is at 16%.The company invests primarily in retail properties, says Stifel analyst Simon Yarmak. He says its top industry is the restaurant sector, which accounts for 28% of Store Capital's rental revenue.How does Store Capital profit?""They hope to earn a spread on their cost of capital,"" said Yarmak. ""Say they're getting an initial 8% yield on the purchase. They hope to fund the acquisition with a cost of capital below that yield.""Here's how he explains it: ""Say the cost of capital is 6.5% and the yield is 8%. The company would earn an initial 150-basis-point spread on the transaction. If the lease is locked in for the next 15 to 20 years, Store Capital knows it's getting at least a 150-basis-point spread on the leases for the next 15 to 20 years.""Store Capital differs from its peers, which include REITs such as Realty Income (O), in a few ways.One way it differs is in the credit quality of its tenants, says Kim. ""It's not chasing investment-grade tenants,"" he said. ""To gain conviction and understanding regarding the tenant credit risk, it obtains information on the profit/loss details of the tenants they work with.""It also differs from its peer group in terms of the length of its leases, he adds. He says Store Capital's average lease term is 15 years vs. 11 years for its peer group.In terms of the outlook for Store Capital and its peers, ""the direction of interest rates will be an important determinant,"" said Kim.Store Capital is in IBD's Finance-Property REIT industry group, which also includes Simon Property Group (SPG) and Kimco Realty (KIM). Store Capital has an IBD Composite Rating of 93 out of a possible 99.

The firm came in ahead of a 36-cent EPS forecast from analysts polled by Thomson Reuters, also topping their expectation of $141.1 million in revenue.Manhattan Associates (MANH) now sees full-year adjusted EPS of $1.47 to $1.49, up from its prior prediction of $1.40 to $1.42. It left the full-year revenue forecast at $553 million to $558 million.

Gaining ground in the market are other, much larger players such as Salesforce.com (CRM), Automatic Data Processing (ADP) and Workday (WDAY), all of which have prospered lately.Another notable player, SAP (SAP), reported earnings Tuesday morning in line with pre-announced results from last week, helping the company's stock to its 12th gain in the last 13 trading sessions, up 17% in that time. Others in the sector used the Aug. 24 flash crash as a springboard for recovery, with Salesforce, ADP and Workday all adding 13% to 19% in that time.Manhattan's stock performance over the long term, as well as in the market's recent rough patches, has garnered investor attention. Manhattan shares have trended up since the flash crash by over 16% to not far off a July high of 69.81.The company has notched double-digit earnings growth for every reporting period since the second quarter of 2011, helping it achieve a Composite Rating of 98 out of a possible 99 from IBD. It also has a high EPS Rating and Relative Price Strength Rating.Analyst Yun Kim from Lake Street Capital Markets initiated coverage on Manhattan in a research note Monday with a buy rating, and said that the firm has ""quietly developed a reputation among investors as one of the best-executing software companies.""""With the industry's most comprehensive omnichannel solutions that are integrated to the company's strength in supply-chain operations, the company is well positioned to continue to maintain its leadership position in this fast-growing and expanding market opportunity, which we believe is still in the early stage of market adoption,"" Kim wrote. ""In addition, we believe the company is benefiting from decreasing competitive pressure and (a) legacy replacement cycle that is currently underway.""

573,KIM,"While emerging market equities receive a lot of attention, a large amount of assets also follow emerging market local debt. J.P. Morgan estimates that approximately $200 billion is tied to its Government Bond Index-Emerging Markets (GBI-EM) Index series. The countries included—or excluded—from the Index can have a major impact on performance. Case in point, Nigeria. Last week, J.P. Morgan announced that Nigeria's debt would be phased out of the GBI-EM Index Series over the next two monthly rebalances, occurring at the end of September and the end of October 2015.1 Nigeria first appeared in the index in October 2012, when the government removed a required one-year lock-in period for foreign investment in government bonds. In January 2015, Nigeria was put on watch, as a series of administrative measures began to impede the ability of foreign investors to transact in this debt, and in June 2015 the watch was extended because of the need to monitor the transparency and liquidity of the Nigerian foreign exchange market.2 Nigeria's challenges are not surprising, given the movement in oil prices. Oil represents approximately 90% of Nigeria's exports and two-thirds of the government's revenue3. Nigeria has placed restrictions on foreign exchange to stem the fall of the currency within this environment.Applying a Focus on Fundamentals Never Included Nigeria In 2010, the WisdomTree Emerging Markets Local Debt Fund (ELD) was introduced as an active investment approach to emerging local debt. The structured investment process of ELD runs counter to the concept of market capitalization-weighted approaches to emerging markets debt, which place the greatest weight in debt markets with the largest issuance. Instead, ELD's approach focuses on fiscal sustainability and external vulnerability indicators in order to monitor risk. Political risk and economic solvency are also considered. The process allocates weight according to three tiers, where the country exposures within each respective tier are equally weighted. The portfolio is rebalanced to targeted exposures on a quarterly basis, and the currency selection and universe definition are reassessed at scheduled intervals at least annually. The result? Troubled countries like Nigeria often don't make the cut. The August 31, 2015, Rebalance & ELD's New Target Weights Below, we compare ELD's target weights (post-August rebalance) to that of the J.P. Morgan GBI-EM Global Diversified Index and the J.P Morgan GBI-EM CORE Index, two of the more widely followed Indexes within J.P. Morgan's GBI-EM series.ELD Exposure Tiers versus Two GBI-EM Indexes

585,KIM,"Nuclear Enemies: North Korea said Tuesday it has restarted atomic-weapons fuel production. President Clinton's peace deal with this dangerous tyranny failed — a warning that President Obama's with Iran will, too.Four and a half months after 9/11, President George W. Bush warned, ""North Korea is a regime arming with missiles and weapons of mass destruction,"" and ""Iran aggressively pursues these weapons and exports terror, while an unelected few repress the Iranian people's hope for freedom.""Both North Korea and Iran were part of ""an axis of evil,"" as Bush called it, that ""could attack our allies or attempt to blackmail the United States."" And he promised, ""I will not stand by as peril draws closer and closer. The United States of America will not permit the world's most dangerous regimes to threaten us with the world's most destructive weapons.""Iraq's and Libya's WMD threats were eliminated during Bush's administration, but he warned that the global war on terror ""may not be finished on our watch.""And how. The nuclear-armed threat of North Korea and soon-to-be-nuclear-armed threat of Islamofascist Iran today loom larger than ever.North Korea's Yongbyon nuclear center, 55 miles north of Pyongyang, has now ""started normal operation,"" it was announced this week, and the regime warned it will launch long-range, multistage missiles to mark the ruling party's 70th anniversary next month.How did we get here? Well, 21 years ago, Clinton announced a deal with North Korea making a lot of the same presumptions that Obama is making in his nuclear pact with Iran.Nuclear fuel enrichment was going to be frozen, inspectors from the United Nations' International Atomic Energy Agency were going to monitor North Korea, and economic sanctions were eased. Clinton promised ""an end to the threat of nuclear proliferation on the Korean Peninsula"" as a consequence of this ""crucial step"" toward ending the country's global isolation.Within a decade, however, the dynastic dictatorship now ruled by Kim Jong-un reactivated its plutonium reprocessing, threw out the U.N. inspectors and withdrew from the global nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.It may be nearly 4,000 miles between Pyongyang and Tehran, but North Korea and Iran are shoulder to shoulder in actively seeking nuclear arms, supporting one another, fomenting global terrorism and waging war against America.As the Washington Free Beacon's Bill Gertz reported in the spring, Kim's regime even had to nerve to supply missile components to Iran ""during recent nuclear talks,"" violating U.N. ""sanctions on both countries, according to U.S. intelligence officials."" Gertz said that details of the shipments ""were included in Obama's daily intelligence briefings"" but kept secret from the U.N.North Korea has also helped Iran supply Hamas and Hezbollah terrorists; Iran, of course, is responsible for thousands of American military casualties in Iraq.The lesson that North Korea should have taught us is the same one that Munich should have, but it is forgotten in the Iran deal: Evil regimes are deterred not by paper agreements, but by military power.

Sony's tablet business has struggled outside of Japan vs. Apple (AAPL), Samsung and others.Sony stock in the U.S. is up more than 20% in 2014, though it's down more than 4% this month. Sony stock was flat in early trading in the stock market today.Goyal is upbeat on a company turnaround led by Sony CFO Kenichro Yoshida, who aims to focus the company on fewer businesses. It might sell its music publishing business, for example.""Sony is a victim here and this hacking storm will blow away,"" said Goyal in a report. He rates Sony stock a buy.The U.S. has blamed the attacks on North Korea.""The Interview,"" the Sony Pictures film about a fictional plot to assassinate North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, opened in more than 300 movie theaters across the U.S. on Christmas Day.A computer hacker group called the Guardians of Peace had threatened a 9/11-type attack on theaters if the movie were shown. The film also was available to U.S. online viewers through Google Play and YouTube, as well as Sony website www.seetheinterview.com.In an apparently unrelated cyberattack, the online game networks of Microsoft (MSFT) and Sony were knocked offline much of Christmas Day. A group called Lizard Squad took responsibility for the DDos (distributed denial of service) attack. Microsoft's Xbox Live and the PlayStation gaming network were still having problems on Friday.Sony is in trial with a new cloud-based TV service, called PlayStation Vue, with commercial launch planned in 2015. Pricing has not been disclosed. Sony will offer content from Viacom (VIA), CBS (CBS), Fox, Discovery (DISCA), Comcast 's (CMCSA) NBCUniversal, Scripps and others. ""Sony is ahead of the pack in offering a service that customers would love, providers want to offer, but no one has had the ability to deliver,"" said Goyal.Goyal says Sony's cost-cutting and focus on profitable content — movies, music, and games — will pay off.""We like Sony's ongoing restructuring efforts, led by CFO Yoshida ... and approach of focusing on fewer core/value-accretive businesses,"" he said.
"
598,KIM,"Blame Game: Sony Corp., having already taken a massive hit from North Korea's hack job, is now being attacked at home as a coward for canceling ""The Interview."" But what else was it supposed to do?The criticisms came from all sides. Fox News' Andrew Napolitano called Sony's decision to cancel the movie after hackers threatened to attack theaters showing it ""utterly gutless, utterly reprehensible and utterly cowardly.""Games of Thrones author George R.R. Martin said ""the level of corporate cowardice here astonishes me."" Jonah Goldberg remarked how ""a theater chain caved. The movie studio caved,"" thereby ""effectively giving one of the most evil regimes in human history a veto on our First Amendment.""Even President Obama joined in, saying Sony ""made a mistake."" The Department of Homeland Security washed its hands of blame, too, saying ""at this time there was no credible intelligence to indicate an active plot against movie theaters."" Except for the explicit threat itself, apparently.Yes, it would have been better if Sony told North Korea to go stick it and shown the movie. And we're not saying there aren't spineless wimps in Hollywood. New Regency's decision to kill a planned North Korea-set thriller is a true act of cowardly surrender, for example.So, too, was Paramount's refusal to let theaters show ""Team America: World Police"" after ""The Interview"" was scrapped. That puppet action comedy depicts a team of American heroes fighting a terrorist plot led by North Korea's previous leader Kim Jong-il.Plus, Hollywood is all too willing to cave under pressure from politically correct interest groups — without anyone ever raising an eyebrow.But before lumping Sony in with the rest of these cowardly acts, consider that DHS's reassurances apparently weren't enough to convince Sony executives there was no chance of an attack. What does that say about the administration's national security abilities?And it's not like public officials were reassuring. As Goldberg notes, ""New York Mayor Bill de Blasio didn't call the management of Landmark Theaters in New York, where Sony Pictures was slated to premiere 'The Interview,' and say, 'The city of New York will see that no harm will come to you.' He didn't say much of anything at all. President Obama did eventually say the public should 'go to the movies,' but that's about it.""Had Sony gone ahead and released the movie, and an attack did occur that caused injuries or deaths, the very same people calling Sony gutless today would be screaming about its recklessness tomorrow.Given that, does it really make sense to blame the victim rather than focus on what the federal government should be doing to beef up our defenses against this new and perilous threat?
"
599,KIM,"Cyberwar: Like a bomb detonating in slow motion, the scale and destructiveness of the Sony hack has only now become fully apparent. Telling Americans to go to the movies doesn't cut it as a government response.At first, it seemed as if Sony was the latest victim of hackers who delight in stealing confidential information and sending it along to WikiLeaks. The hackers called themselves ""Guardians of Peace"" and claimed, ""We want equality. Sony doesn't."" Sony initially labeled the event as ""an IT matter.""For a while, the hack seemed to threaten only the reputations of some Hollywood big shots, as the leaks exposed outsized salaries, mean-spirited backbiting and embarrassing private emails.It wasn't until eight days later that Sony said North Korea might be involved. And it was only this Tuesday — 22 days after the attack — that the hackers revealed their true and frightening purpose: to censor a movie that the North Korean government found offensive.The plot worked. The next day, Sony canceled the opening of ""The Interview"" — an action comedy about a CIA plot to assassinate Kim Jong Un. Newt Gingrich had it right when he tweeted, ""No one should kid themselves ... America has lost its first cyberwar.""In that light, President Obama's comments to ABC News seem wholly inadequate. All he could bring himself to say was that he's taking it seriously, and ""if we see something that we think is serious and credible, then we'll alert the public.""If we see something? Isn't stealing 100 terabytes of data — enough to hold 10 copies of the Library of Congress' entire collection — and destroying $200 million worth of Sony's capital and holding the country hostage to the whims of a brutal dictator 6,000 miles away ""serious and credible"" enough?Obama instead blithely said,""My recommendation would be that people go to the movies."" (This from the same guy who routinely mocked President Bush for saying Americans should go shopping after the 9/11 attacks — something Bush never really said.)If North Korea had detonated a bomb that destroyed $200 million worth of private property, do you think Obama's response would have been so tepid?Dave Aitel, former NSA scientist who heads cybersecurity firm Immunity, told Business Insider: ""We need to change the way we think about cyberattacks. In many cases, these aren't 'crimes'; they're acts of war.""You can bet that North Korea, ISIS and anyone else with a grudge against America are watching how we respond to this attack, and are trying to penetrate not so easily dismissed targets such as the nation's power grid and banking system.And remember that in cyberwar, America's geographical advantage — which has largely protected the country from foreign attacks — doesn't exist.

603,KIM,"Superpower In Decline: North Korea's nuclear-armed dictator Kim Jong-un announced his forces are in a ""quasi-state of war"" as they fire artillery into South Korea. Behind it are doubts of U.S. resolve.Just months before Communist North Korean troops invaded South Korea in the summer of 1950, beginning the Korean War in which over 36,000 Americans gave their lives, Secretary of State Dean Acheson let it be known that the Koreas were outside America's ""defense perimeter.""No one in the Obama administration may have made a statement projecting such provocative weakness directly in Pyongyang's direction. But actions speak louder than words, and with our withdrawals from Iraq and Afghanistan, and our appeasement of Iran, President Obama is letting it be known that the world's lone superpower doesn't do ground wars anymore.""When I ran for president eight years ago as a candidate who had opposed the decision to go to war in Iraq, I said that America didn't just have to end that war,"" Obama said at his recent American University speech defending the Iran nuclear deal. ""We had to end the mindset that got us there in the first place.""According to Obama, ""it was a mindset characterized by a preference for military action over diplomacy."" And one of his favorite talking points is that the U.S. must avoid ""getting dragged into another ground war.""That is clearly music to the ears of his Democrat Party base. But to America's enemies around the world, it's the sound of U.S. weakness — and the opportunity for aggression.We may have about 29,000 U.S. troops stationed in South Korea right now, but about a decade ago we had more than 40,000; in Ronald Reagan's second term we had 45,000. But what difference do numbers make if we are unwilling to use them if and when the enemy launches a war?The exchanges between oppressive North Korea and free South Korea are the most ominous hostilities between the two powers in many years. It could dissipate, as past exchanges have.Then again, supreme leader Kim Jong Un and his military advisors may well have determined that the second half of the second term of a president ""elected to end wars"" is the perfect time to strike.After all, if Obama is so adamant that ""another prolonged ground war in the Middle East"" is ""not in our national security interest,"" what would ever convince him that a major ground war in the Korean Peninsula would be?Another sign of U.S. weakness that can't have gone unnoticed by Kim and his henchmen is found elsewhere in Asia. Politico reported last month of friction between the White House and the Pentagon regarding artificial islands in the South China Sea upon which China is deploying arms:""Military officials and congressional hawks want the U.S. to make a major demonstration by sending warships within 12 miles of the artificial islands and make clear to China that the U.S. rejects its territorial claims.""By not doing so, they charge, the administration ""is tacitly accepting China's destabilizing moves, which are seen by U.S. allies in the region such as Japan, the Philippines and Vietnam as highly threatening.""The giant platforms could be mobile, and U.S. Pacific Command chief Adm. Harry Harris last month warned they could be used as bases for Chinese bombers, fighters, ships and surveillance.Whether it's North Korea invading the south, or China invading free Taiwan, our downsized military, which can no longer fight two major wars simultaneously, is led by a commander-in-chief who repeatedly makes it clear that he won't commit troops to a mission to repel aggression.

Americans won’t stand for two things: false advertising and portion control.Conan: A Southwest passenger gave birth in-flight. As soon as he was born, the new baby said, “I had more legroom in the womb.”Meyers: A San Francisco to Phoenix flight had to land in Los Angeles when a passenger gave birth in flight. The parents called the birth a miracle. The airline called it a second carry-on.Meyers: Time names Ebola caregivers as Persons of the Year. The Ebola workers were very excited when Time Magazine gave them the news -- via Skype.Fallon: South Korea has gotten in the holiday spirit. The government announced plans to erect a 30-foot-Christmas tree at its border with North Korea. Not to be outdone, North Korea has let an elf rule the country.Conan: Pope Francis criticizes rampant Christmas materialism. Unfortunately, no one heard the rest of the Pope’s speech. He was trampled in the PlayStation aisle of Walmart.Conan: Sunday’s security line at Midway Airport was over a mile long. On the bright side, many couples waiting in line joined the Mile Long Club.Conan: The World Health Organization has told men recovering from Ebola to avoid sex for three months.

611,KIM,"Cyberwar: Sony Pictures endured the worst cyberattack in history because an upcoming film upset North Korea's dictator. Seems they believed he was the comic villain they depict him as. The only problem, he really is evil.It's more surreal than any Hollywood plot: North Korea's Kim Jong Un was fed up with Hollywood's depictions of his vicious little dictatorship.First, there was 2004's ""Team America,"" which lampooned his father. Now it's ""The Interview,"" which depicts him as a bizarre, slightly comic villain.Kim took it so personally he unleashed the most damaging and costly cyberattack ever on Sony Pictures, complete with blackmail demands to pull the picture.North Korea denies it, of course, but calls the attack ""a righteous deed"" and admits that ""supporters"" did it. Cyberexperts say the attack mirrors one they conducted on a South Korean bank in 2013.What's more, North Korea vowed ""severe punishment"" for those behind the movie. And that's precisely what happened. As many as five stolen films worth millions were put on the Internet, while Social Security numbers, salaries and personal data of nearly 4,000 employees were published and the hard drives of the company were wiped out at a cost of millions to replace. Employees are now being threatened and blackmailed.It had to surprise jaded Hollywood. After all, the North Koreans seemed to be the easiest and least-risky villains in the world to depict. They aren't the Chinese, who control a vast market Hollywood moguls slaver over. Nor are they Islamofascists — who have lobbies in Washington and their own sizable market globally.Nor were they Christian groups or Tea Partyers, whose negative depictions can also cause box-office losses. For Hollywood, a good villain is hard to find. Not every movie can feature hostile space aliens.That's why North Korea seemed so perfect. The only problem is that nation's dictatorship is quite real. It has threatened to wipe out Los Angeles and has now demonstrated it's capable of a very real cyberattack.The fact that they are nuclear armed and unafraid of consequences ought to be a warning: These aren't comic book villains, these are real enemies.As Sony cleans up, one can only hope our national security establishment in Washington doesn't make the same unthinking mistake. If they do, we may all end up like Sony — or worse.

668,KIM,"Ernest Moniz, the Energy secretary with the hair from the 1973 Energy Crisis, who was joined at the hip with Secretary of State John Kerry during the Iran nuclear negotiations, made an offbeat sales pitch for the Iran nuclear deal during an NBC News interview on Wednesday.Moniz claimed ""we will be better off in terms of understanding any potential Iranian nuclear weapons program with the agreement than without it.""What exactly is it about the world's leading terrorist financier becoming nuclear-armed, a regime that considers America the Great Satan, that we don't already understand?The U.S. has been caught lacking in knowledge and foresight by our adversaries many times. When we discovered in September 1949 that the Soviet Union had built an atomic bomb, President Truman was being told by his own government experts that Moscow was at least four years away from being able to do so. A half century later, the U.S. government was shocked when India detonated a nuclear bomb, followed within weeks by Pakistan.The emergence of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria last year was another surprise.But Iran's nuclear program, and its ability to be adapted to weapons production, is something we've known about going back decades; it was nearly a quarter century ago when Russia and China started helping Tehran with its reactors.Whether or not inspectors for the United Nations' International Atomic Energy Agency are able to go where they want to go within Iran, and without delays that will allow the Iranians to mop up evidence of cheating, obsessing on the details they retrieve is missing the forest for the trees.They are a nuclear threat and their nuclear ability must be eliminated, either voluntarily or by force.If the Nazis had been building a ""peaceful nuclear program,"" would it have been a good idea to cut a deal with them so we'd be better off in terms of understanding any potential Nazi nuclear weapons program? Should we now send John Kerry to Pyongyang to give North Korea hundreds of billions of dollars, as with Iran, in exchange for gaining permission from Kim Jong-un for the entry of international inspectors, who might come back with a few interesting tidbits about the mechanics of their bombs?It was all very well understanding how the Soviet nuclear arsenal worked, that its intercontinental missiles, for instance, were less accurate than ours. But that knowledge is not what ended the Cold War. It was our willingness to resist them — militarily; being willing to walk away from a bad deal at the negotiating table as President Reagan did at Reykjavik; and calling them the Evil Empire they were.In Iran's case, we've failed on all three counts: President Obama has explicitly ruled out bombing the country's nuclear sites; he's let them manipulate the U.S. into a bad deal at the negotiating table; and he's refused to speak of the Islamic radicalism that underpins Tehran's behavior and genocidal objectives.Understanding doesn't always bring peace and love. When we already understand what's important, but talk rather than act, it can ultimately mean war on the enemy's terms rather than ours.Andrew Malcolm is on vacation.

710,KIM,"China Web portal and video game firm NetEase offers some of the most popular online games in China, including U.S.-based Activision Blizzard's titles ""World of Warcraft"" and ""StarCraft II.""NetEase (NTES) recently made the switch to developing mobile games, as revenue from video games played on mobile devices is expected to rise to $45 billion in 2018, from $29 billion this year, according to a May report from mobile-Internet advisor Digi-Capital.Looking to bring its most popular titles to more English speakers, NetEase opened its first U.S. office, in Redwood Shores, Calif., in February. That 26-employee unit expects later this year to release its first mobile game designed specifically for a Western audience, and to expand to 60 workers by year's end.With games companies having to boost ad spending in an increasingly crowded space, it's much more expensive for newcomers in any market to get noticed, Tim Merel, managing director of Digi-Capital, told IBD via email.""NetEase is a great company in China,"" Merel said, ""but breaking through against established incumbents in the U.S. is challenging for any market entrant.""Chinese games companies set up shop in the U.S. ""to either establish international management teams as a step toward true globalization, or as a source of great games that can be brought back into the Chinese domestic market,"" Merel said.Other Chinese games companies have established offices in the U.S. over the past decade and have been among the top acquirers and investors in U.S.-based games companies during the last few years, Merel said. China Internet giant Tencent Holdings (TCEHY), which already owns or has big stakes in Activision Blizzard (ATVI) and Riot Games, is adding Kim Kardashian to the mix. Tencent announced in April that it will invest $126 million in Glu Mobile (GLUU) to tap the U.S. company's success in producing smartphone games featuring Kim Kardashian and Katy Perry.In addition, last month Tencent reportedly invested $60 million for a 20% stake in San Francisco-based mobile-games startup Pocket Gems.NetEase says its strategy for its U.S. office is to take blockbuster hits from China and retool them to appeal to gamers in the U.S. and elsewhere in the West.Video game industry veteran David Ting, who came to NetEase from Blizzard Entertainment, is leading NetEase's new U.S. office. IBD recently spoke with Ting about that effort.IBD: Besides translating the language, what else goes into transforming games developed in China into ones likely to catch on here?Ting: The Chinese user interface tends to be complex; you have all of these functions exposed as buttons. It's very, very busy. There's very complex evolution and there's a lot of math involved in making choices within the game. So, if you're playing, say, a role-playing game or an MMO (a multiplayer video game capable of supporting large numbers of players simultaneously), there's a ton of options and a ton of choices. Chinese players love that, they feel that's part of the challenge.One of the things that we do here is try to simplify and also try to make it so that it's economically sensible for the (U.S.) players to ... enjoy the game. So we adapt the economy. For example, a mechanism in Chinese games is that some of the elite weapons for characters in our upcoming game, ""Speedy Ninja,"" may cost thousands of dollars, if you compute out the probability table of the weapon drops. We try to adapt it so it's acceptable and fair for the Western audience.IBD: Is that thousands of actual U.S. dollars, or some sort of in-game pretend currency?Ting: Real dollars. For example, if you want to max out the best ninja inside the Speedy Ninja game that we are publishing in China, literally it's close to $7,000 to do that.One of the things in China is that there's the phenomenon of the ""whale."" When they decide to play a game, the ""whales"" are always trying to be the best.It's not rare that these ""whales"" ... will spend tens of thousands of dollars to basically charge up their account with premium currency so they can max out their characters. So they get this advantage as they play through the game. That's one of the typical mechanics in these free-to-play games.IBD: What have you found to be an acceptable dollar amount in the U.S.?Ting: We're experimenting with a beta user group. We know we want to dramatically drop the price so it's more affordable and so that people can enjoy the game on a more ... level playing ground.IBD: Does your team have non-game initiatives?Ting: Our focus is games first, but that does not bar us from doing other things in the future. We also serve as a U.S. conduit. (With) other NetEase divisions, we actually help and assist with some of their deals. We also have (business) relationships, so we open doors for them so that (they) don't cold-call people. We deal with them on a friendly ground. One of the advantages of having a U.S.-based office (is) having expertise in the market. (It) is extremely important and it really helps us to make people feel like we are a U.S.-based entity vs. a China-based entity.IBD: In December, NetEase teamed up with U.S. video game company SGN to bring SGN's hit mobile matching-puzzle game ""Cookie Jam"" to China. How do your partnerships work in the U.S.?Ting: We want to be proactively helping this ecosystem so that mobile gaming will be a bigger phenomenon in the U.S. It's a saturated market (here). One of the feelings I have is that maybe it's a lack of innovation or maybe the product quality is not at par. So we're going to proactively be speaking and sharing our experience as we hopefully get some demonstrated success with the rest of the ecosystem. That's a phenomenon in the West that's a bit rare in the East.Also from a partnership perspective, we believe there are opportunities where there are mutually beneficial situations for us to work with other companies. We currently don't need another U.S. company to launch our games. In the future, in the event that we scale to a certain capacity and size, (the door may be opened) for us to have those discussions, but not at this moment. Right now, we are really heads-down on our product.IBD: How many games will your office have released in the U.S. by year's end?Ting: We have a number in our pipeline. When (they hit) the right (metrics), we'll release them. We'll have at least one release this year, which is ""Speedy Ninja.""We have a few more in incubation (that) will go through that same cycle that I described, which is the closed-beta soft launch. If the metrics look good, then we'll release a few more. As we learn in the market, we are taking the findings back to China, so when we start on fresh new projects, all the findings are factored in. It's a constantly evolving process.

711,KIM,"North Korea: Kim Jong Un is said to have executed his defense minister in an anti-aircraft fusillade. Seems the shark tank no longer suffices. This regime is very much the freak show the supreme leader said it wasn't.The South Korean intelligence report isn't the first story of Stalin-style summary executions in the Hermit Kingdom. But it does stand out.The report says North Korea's defense minister, Hyon Yong Chol, was executed by antiaircraft fire at a distance of 100 feet before a live audience of hundreds.His crime?Not leaking the North Korean nuclear secrets he was in charge of but dozing off during a Kim speech and giving him back talk over something else.It follows a report that 15 senior officials who complained about Kim's directives already have been executed this year as ""spies."" Two were vice ministers, and four were members of the national orchestra.There was also the similarly sourced South Korean intelligence report that Kim executed his own uncle and fed his body to pigs.We're not making this up, and neither could Hollywood. The reality on the ground in North Korea is that unreal. If the famous North Korean shark tank scene from the movie ""Team America: World Police"" seems too freakish, well Kim obviously aims to top them with his antiaircraft executions.Which calls to mind Kim's statement last week that he didn't want his visit to Russia to become ""a freak show,"" according to a South Korean newspaper. Apparently the supreme leader has bourgeois pretensions of appearing respectable.But more to the point, it highlights that as savage and Stalinistic as his regime is — complete with show trials, summary executions and an all-powerful autocrat in charge — the reports from diverse sources are too numerous to be false.And Kim is still being actively courted as an ally by Iran, Russia, China and Castroite Cuba.As the White House seeks rapprochement with former enemies, it had better remember that one prospect is a little freak show that possesses nuclear weapons, has initiated the world's most costly cyberattack and has now slaughtered its own defense minister just for giving the dictator some lip.A country that would execute its own on the whim of a dictator, in the most grotesque way, would have no compunctions about lethally menacing us.

Because, why should just the front be cracked?Conan: I’m halfway through Hillary Clinton’s book. I don’t want to ruin the ending, but I bet she kills this guy “Bill.”Meyers: In the World Cup, last week the U.S. was eliminated by Belgium. And next week, Belgium will be eliminated by drones.Meyers: if you’re sick of all the fake injuries at the World Cup, get ready for some real ones. Annual running of the bulls in Pamplona.Meyers: An 81-year-old British woman sky-dived to help raise money for a local hospital. She didn’t raise a lot of money, but the hospital did get a new patient.Headline in The Onion:Environmental study finds Chicago's air is now 75% bullets Conan: World Cup goalies like Germany's are extremely good. Many fans predict mostly very low-scoring games now. No more of those 1-0 blowouts.Conan: A judge has ordered the government to tell people why they’ve been put on the national ""No-Fly List."" And the government must be more specific than, ""You look a little Taliban-y.""Fallon: Target Field in Minnesota says it will have self-serve beer machines at the All-Star Game next week. Big deal, my dad had a self-serve beer machine 30 years ago. It was called ""Jimmy."" ""Jimmy, go get me a beer!""Conan: Michelle Obama says she wants Americans to elect a woman president ""as soon as possible."" So even she’s had enough of President Obama.Conan: A U.S. soccer fan in Brazil attracted a lot of attention for dressing up like Teddy Roosevelt and going by the name, Teddy Goalsevelt. Much less popular, however, was Germany’s No. 1 soccer fan, Adolf Kickler.Conan: The U.S. lost to Germany, but because FIFA rules dictate that teams get one point for a tie, 3 points for a win and zero points for a loss, AND both the U..S. and Portugal had a score of 4 and because the U.S. team had a higher goal differential, the U.S. still advanced. And that, ladies and gentlemen, in a nutshell, is why Americans don’t follow soccer.Fallon: I saw that this year’s movie box office revenue is down 20% from last summer. I’m not sure why that is, but I bet you there’s a documentary on Netflix about it.Meyers: A Ugandan police officer claims he was forced to shoot an aggressive tortoise that attacked him while he was drinking tea at home. In his defense, the officer had to act quickly, or move over a few feet and weigh his options for another hour.Conan: Seven million people watched 'The Game of Thrones' season finale. To break that down, that’s one viewer per Game of Thrones character.Meyers: Starbucks has a new program paying workers to take online classes through Arizona State. Starbucks workers replied: “We already did that. That's why we work at Starbucks.”Meyers: Kim Kardashian and Kanye West have rejected $11 million for the rights to their wedding pictures. Which can only mean one thing: Someone offered them $12 million.Meyers: The FDA has approved human testing of bananas engineered for higher vitamin content. Monkeys complain, “The one time we want to be tested.”Conan: Several protesters at the World Cup got into trouble for burning American flags. It’s a shame, really, because children in China worked very hard to make those flags.Meyers: A new report says “Brooklyn” is now one of the country’s most popular baby names.

I’m pretty sure I could tell if it was fake.Fallon: The TSA is offering a $5,000 reward for the best idea on how to speed up airport security lines. So far, the best idea is making a line for people who know what they're doing and another line for people who've never been to an airport before. ""I take my BELT off? Yeah, anything metal. ""Oh gosh. I take my wallet out?"" Yes! Everything in your pockets! ""My keys?"" Yes. ""What about my second belt?""

725,KIM,"""Summertime and the living is easy,"" especially at the beach, right?
"
726,KIM,"Not so fast. Beach properties come with special concerns, including high insurance costs, environmental regulations, rental rules and more. So we've put together data on the top U.S. beaches and 10 considerations for buying a coastal getaway.
"
727,KIM,"Four of the top 20 U.S. beach-town housing markets for 2014 are in Florida, according to housing analytics provider RealtyTrac.
"
728,KIM,"Hobe Sound came in first in the ranking. It's a town of fewer than 15,000 people in Martin County north of Palm Beach on the state's eastern coast. It has an average temperature of 76 degrees, 64% sunny days, 98% of days with good air quality and a crime grade of A+, says RealtyTrac. It also has a low median estimated market value for homes and condos of $191,189.
"
729,KIM,"Florida is still on sale after the housing bust, says Daren Blomquist, vice president at RealtyTrac. ""Home prices have come up there, but median prices across Florida are still 42% below the peak in 2006,"" he said.
"
730,KIM,"RealtyTrac came up with its top-20 list of beach-town housing markets by first identifying the top 100 in very favorable weather and crime statistics — a strict list — and then ranking them lowest-to-highest in median home value, taking into account both houses and condominiums.
"
731,KIM,"Other Florida beach towns in the top 5 going by those low median home values were Naples, at No. 2, and Marco Island, at No. 5. Both are in southwest Florida, with medians of $243,910 and $415,963, respectively.
"
732,KIM,"Hawaii accounted for 11 of the top 20 U.S. beach-town housing markets, the most of any state. But only two of those were in the top five — Waianae, on the island of Oahu, and Wailuku, on Maui, with median home values of $309,328 and $412,084, respectively.
"
733,KIM,"Five California locales made the top 20 — Los Osos, Morro Bay, Dana Point, Seal Beach and San Clemente. Of the California markets, only Los Osos has a median estimated home value under $500,000 — at $418,403.
"
734,KIM,"RealtyTrac's picks for best beach may or may not include your favorite sandbox. Wherever you're considering, don't be swayed by just the breeze and a pretty view.
"
735,KIM," Location: On the beach or near it? Do you yearn to be on the sand or is across the street or up the road close enough? Some beach areas, including Hawaii, have higher tax rates and higher homeowner association dues for oceanfront properties.
"
736,KIM,"Some properties near the beach may ""still have a view, and have all the amenities of the beach, without all the beachfront costs,"" said Beth McGregor, an agent with Hawaii Life Real Estate Brokers, in Wailea, Maui. McGregor works across the island of Maui, including in Kihei, which is No. 9 on RealtyTrac's list of top beach housing markets.
"
737,KIM," Water or beach access? If you do select a property near but not on a beach, you'll want to make sure the coast and waterways are accessible. Are there any access restrictions or fees, and is there parking?
"
738,KIM," Budget and property type: How much space do you really need and what's your budget for that space, including maintenance and taxes? Do you need garage or storage space for your beach toys — a paddleboard, a surfboard, kayaks, beach chairs and more? Many condos have little or no storage, so it's something to think about.
"
739,KIM,"Alternatively, if you'll be visiting only sporadically, do you want to maintain a house and yard? Or would a condo, with maintenance included in your HOA dues, make more sense?
"
740,KIM," Flood and wind insurance: This may be the most important consideration for coastal properties today. Costs for these types of insurance have soared. And if you're financing a property, you'll likely need three types of coverage: flood, wind/hurricane and general homeowners' coverage.
"
741,KIM,"In March, the Homeowner Flood Insurance Affordability Act of 2014 was signed into law. It repeals and modifies parts of the Biggert-Waters Flood Insurance Reform Act of 2012, which was supposed to help restore the national flood insurance program to solvency and induce property owners and communities to initiate flood prevention efforts. However, that earlier approach was causing huge premium spikes for some homeowners and impacting property sales.
"
742,KIM,"With the new law, annual rate increases are capped at 18%, but property owners in high-risk flood areas will pay a variable surcharge. Still, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which subsidizes flood insurance, is in the process of redrawing flood maps across the country — and new areas may become high-risk.
"
743,KIM,"""We always make purchase offers contingent on getting flood insurance or an acceptable flood insurance policy,"" said Pat Broghamer, a real estate agent with Carolina One Real Estate, in Mount Pleasant, S.C.
"
744,KIM," Weather patterns: Some beachfront communities stand at particular risk of strong storms and flooding. Even if you're willing to pay high flood insurance costs, you should consider how being in a flood zone or hurricane area will affect property values in the long term with weather and climate trends.
"
745,KIM," HOAs and maintenance: When buying any property in a homeowners' association, you must review the rules. What do they say about pets, parking, paint, etc.? Is it a 55 and older community, and if so what are the visitation rules for children? What are the monthly fees and what do they include? How well is the property managed? And does it have adequate reserves (a lending requirement)?
"
746,KIM,"Keep in mind that the coastal environment can be tough on interior furnishings as well as a property's exterior. The ""salt water environment"" is hard on furniture, appliances and particularly electronics, which ""aren't going to last as long"" as they do in other locations, said McGregor.
"
747,KIM," Rental restrictions? Vacation rentals aren't allowed in some single-family communities and condo complexes. Know the rules before you buy if you intend to offset some of your beach property costs with rentals.
"
748,KIM," Construction and remodeling: As beach properties are often in hurricane areas, buyers need to carefully consider the construction of the home or condo. Older homes, without reinforced roofs and windows, may not qualify for wind/storm insurance. The construction type will also affect your insurance premiums.
"
749,KIM,"And if you're planning to remodel, there are several factors to consider. On an older home, you may be forced to bring its roof, windows and other features up to current and more stringent codes. That can be costly. Also, if you want to remodel a condo's interior, the HOA may need to approve your plans, some design elements and construction work hours. It may also limit how many condos in the complex can be remodeled at once.
"
750,KIM," Financing: What's a ""condotel""? If you're looking at condos, beware of possibly limited financing options, higher down payments and higher interest rates. Also, lenders call some condos ""condotels,"" typically ones that offer weekly or nightly rentals and have a front desk, says Gayle Hood, a real estate agent with Re/Max 1st Choice in South Padre Island, Texas. For condotel units, you may need 30% down and will likely pay a higher interest rate than loans for other properties.
"
751,KIM,"However, condo financing has picked up. ""We are so relieved; we are finally getting some financing on condos,"" said Hood.
"
752,KIM,"In Maui, McGregor says condo financing, which was tough during the housing bust, has improved. ""Lenders, while they're still being pretty careful, are opening up a little bit,"" she said.
"
753,KIM," Environmental restrictions: If turtles nest in a beach you're considering buying near, your activities and possible remodels could be restricted. Sensitive wetlands and inland waterways will also likely have protections for mangroves and other flora and fauna, so ""you might not be able to put in a dock"" or do other improvements, said Kim Price, a real estate agent with Golden Bear Realty in North Palm Beach, Fla.
"
754,KIM,"Price works in the Hobe Sound area.

755,KIM,"Anniversaries are often celebrated with toasts over raised drinks.
"
756,KIM,"If any drink were in order when Constellation Brands (STZ) recently marked its anniversary of a game-changing acquisition, it would be beer — and a Mexican brand in particular.
"
757,KIM,"A year ago this past weekend, Constellation Brands became full owner of Grupo Modelo's U.S. beer business in a $5.3 billion deal with Anheuser-Busch InBev (BUD).
"
758,KIM,"Victor, N.Y.-based Constellation essentially got the remaining 50% stake in Crown Imports that it didn't already own.
"
759,KIM,"The deal included full U.S. rights to import, market and sell Mexican beers under the Modelo umbrella, including Corona Extra, Corona Light, Modelo Especial, Negra Modelo and Pacifico.
"
760,KIM,"The transaction, which included a brewery, doubled the size of Constellation, which also operates wine and spirits segments.
"
761,KIM,"It strengthened Constellation's position as the largest importer of beer in the U.S. and the country's third largest beer brewer and seller after Anheuser-Busch and MillerCoors, a division of Molson Coors Brewing (TAP).
"
762,KIM,"Constellation ""was a wine company before it imported beer, but they didn't own beer,"" said analyst Lauren Torres of HSBC Global Research. It ""now owns a brand (Grupo Modelo) with great equity in beer.""
"
763,KIM,"Tops In Hops
"
764,KIM,"Cheers go especially to Modelo Especial, Constellation's fastest-growing beer. Last year, U.S. shipments jumped 18%, reported Beer Marketer's Insights, making it the fastest-growing of the many beers that the beer-information provider tracks. Crown Imports' overall shipments were up nearly 6%.
"
765,KIM,"That growth arrived despite declining sales of many other beers, including Bud Light, Budweiser, Coors Light, Miller Lite, Miller High Life and Busch. Overall U.S. beer shipments, excluding exports, slid 1.3% in 2013, said Beer Marketer's Insights, continuing a multiyear trend of declining volumes.
"
766,KIM,"The economic downturn ""hit mainstream beer drinkers harder than wine or spirits markets,"" said Eric Shepard, editor of Beer Marketer's Insights' newsletter.
"
767,KIM,"But Modelo and Corona aren't expected to slow down anytime soon, Shepard says. Modelo spiked fairly quickly over the last 18 months, he says, largely because it's a hit with Latinos, a large and fast-growing demographic in the U.S.
"
768,KIM,"But, he says, Constellation's beer portfolio is reaching plenty of non-Latinos, including Millennials (the generation born from the early 1980s to the early 2000s).
"
769,KIM,"This year through April 20, volume sales of Modelo Especial surged 25%, Constellation said, citing data from Information Resources (IRI). Pacifico logged an 11% gain. Corona Extra and Corona Light were up 9% and 5%, respectively, and Negra Modelo 7%.
"
770,KIM,"For Pacifico, a new national web and social-media marketing campaign — the largest to date, called ""Yellow Caps,"" a play on the beer's bright yellow bottle caps — will roll out this summer. It will be supplemented by three TV ads on digital video, print ads in Southern California and spot TV ads in San Diego.
"
771,KIM,"Corona is one of the biggest imported beers in the U.S. But the mature brand had lost some share to newer, lower-priced imports in the recession, Torres says.
"
772,KIM,"But it has ""incredible brand equity"" and is back on the rise ""a bit,"" she said, no doubt due in part to the success of the ""Vacation in a Bottle"" ad campaign.
"
773,KIM,"""The Crown (beer) business is growing faster than their wine business,"" said Stifel Nicolaus analyst Mark Swartzberg. ""We're happy to see (Constellation) becoming less reliant on the wine business.""
"
774,KIM,"Beer generates better cash flow and margins than wine, which is ""a more capital-intensive business than beer,"" he said.
"
775,KIM,"""Wine is a business that requires a lot more inventory and land than beer,"" Swartzberg said. It's also not as reliant on brand names, he says.
"
776,KIM,"Torres says that a good portion of Constellation's wine business is being hurt by ""competitive pricing"" in the industry.
"
777,KIM,"For the beer business, the company's outlook for fiscal 2015 calls for mid to high single-digit net sales growth and operating income growth in the low- to mid-20% range.
"
778,KIM,"But for wine and spirits, it forecasts low- to mid-single-digit growth for both net sales and operating income.
"

780,KIM,"A Year In Beer
"
781,KIM,"Net sales in the company's fiscal year ending Feb. 28 jumped 74% to $4.9 billion, driven by $2 billion of incremental net sales related to the Crown beer business. Beer sales for the year rose 10%, while wine and spirits sales grew only 2%.
"
782,KIM,"Profit for the year rose 48% to an adjusted $3.25 a share. Fourth-quarter earnings were up 72%, a third straight quarter of double-digit gains.
"
783,KIM,"""I'm excited about the organic growth prospects for our beer business in fiscal 2015,"" said Constellation Brands CEO Robert Sands in the post-earnings conference call on April 9. He said that the firm expects sales and depletion trends to exceed U.S. beer industry and import levels once again.
"
784,KIM,"Sands called last year's beer deal ""our most transformational acquisition in the history of our company."" (Management was unavailable to comment for this article, citing the ""quiet period"" ahead of the first-quarter earnings release on July 2.)
"
785,KIM,"The acquisition also gave Constellation full ownership of a brewery in Nava, Mexico, which it's doubling in size. But management said in the last earnings report that the work would cost twice the original estimate, $900 million to $1.1 billion vs. $500 million to $600 million previously. The project is expected to be completed in 2016.
"
786,KIM,"Swartzberg says that the added cost isn't as big an issue as it might seem. He figures that Constellation will benefit from at least $135 million in cost savings from brewery operations through mid-2016.
"
787,KIM,"Roots In Wine Business
"
788,KIM,"Founded in 1945, Constellation began to focus on branded wines in the early 1950s. Sands joined his family's upstate New York wine business in 1979, helping to expand it organically and via acquisitions.
"
789,KIM,"The company shifted its focus to premium wines over the last decade. In 2004, for example, it acquired Robert Mondavi. A few years later, it sold off value brands Almaden and Inglenook.
"
790,KIM,"But some other wine buys weren't as successful as Robert Mondavi. In fiscal 2008, Constellation wrote off $822 million in impaired assets from its Australia and U.K. wine businesses.
"
791,KIM,"""They paid too much for their wine M&A's (mergers and acquisitions),"" Swartzberg said.
"
792,KIM,"Besides Robert Mondavi, Constellation's wine lineup comprises Clos du Bois, Kim Crawford, Rex Goliath, Mark West, Franciscan Estate, Ruffino and Jackson-Triggs. Liquor brands include Svedka Vodka and Black Velvet Canadian Whisky.Anniversaries are often celebrated with toasts over raised drinks.If any drink were in order when Constellation Brands (STZ) recently marked its anniversary of a game-changing acquisition, it would be beer — and a Mexican brand in particular.A year ago this past weekend, Constellation Brands became full owner of Grupo Modelo's U.S. beer business in a $5.3 billion deal with Anheuser-Busch InBev (BUD).Victor, N.Y.-based Constellation essentially got the remaining 50% stake in Crown Imports that it didn't already own.The deal included full U.S. rights to import, market and sell Mexican beers under the Modelo umbrella, including Corona Extra, Corona Light, Modelo Especial, Negra Modelo and Pacifico.The transaction, which included a brewery, doubled the size of Constellation, which also operates wine and spirits segments.It strengthened Constellation's position as the largest importer of beer in the U.S. and the country's third largest beer brewer and seller after Anheuser-Busch and MillerCoors, a division of Molson Coors Brewing (TAP).Constellation ""was a wine company before it imported beer, but they didn't own beer,"" said analyst Lauren Torres of HSBC Global Research. It ""now owns a brand (Grupo Modelo) with great equity in beer.""Tops In HopsCheers go especially to Modelo Especial, Constellation's fastest-growing beer. Last year, U.S. shipments jumped 18%, reported Beer Marketer's Insights, making it the fastest-growing of the many beers that the beer-information provider tracks. Crown Imports' overall shipments were up nearly 6%.That growth arrived despite declining sales of many other beers, including Bud Light, Budweiser, Coors Light, Miller Lite, Miller High Life and Busch. Overall U.S. beer shipments, excluding exports, slid 1.3% in 2013, said Beer Marketer's Insights, continuing a multiyear trend of declining volumes.The economic downturn ""hit mainstream beer drinkers harder than wine or spirits markets,"" said Eric Shepard, editor of Beer Marketer's Insights' newsletter.But Modelo and Corona aren't expected to slow down anytime soon, Shepard says. Modelo spiked fairly quickly over the last 18 months, he says, largely because it's a hit with Latinos, a large and fast-growing demographic in the U.S.But, he says, Constellation's beer portfolio is reaching plenty of non-Latinos, including Millennials (the generation born from the early 1980s to the early 2000s).This year through April 20, volume sales of Modelo Especial surged 25%, Constellation said, citing data from Information Resources (IRI). Pacifico logged an 11% gain. Corona Extra and Corona Light were up 9% and 5%, respectively, and Negra Modelo 7%.For Pacifico, a new national web and social-media marketing campaign — the largest to date, called ""Yellow Caps,"" a play on the beer's bright yellow bottle caps — will roll out this summer. It will be supplemented by three TV ads on digital video, print ads in Southern California and spot TV ads in San Diego.Corona is one of the biggest imported beers in the U.S. But the mature brand had lost some share to newer, lower-priced imports in the recession, Torres says.But it has ""incredible brand equity"" and is back on the rise ""a bit,"" she said, no doubt due in part to the success of the ""Vacation in a Bottle"" ad campaign.""The Crown (beer) business is growing faster than their wine business,"" said Stifel Nicolaus analyst Mark Swartzberg. ""We're happy to see (Constellation) becoming less reliant on the wine business.""Beer generates better cash flow and margins than wine, which is ""a more capital-intensive business than beer,"" he said.""Wine is a business that requires a lot more inventory and land than beer,"" Swartzberg said. It's also not as reliant on brand names, he says.Torres says that a good portion of Constellation's wine business is being hurt by ""competitive pricing"" in the industry.For the beer business, the company's outlook for fiscal 2015 calls for mid to high single-digit net sales growth and operating income growth in the low- to mid-20% range.But for wine and spirits, it forecasts low- to mid-single-digit growth for both net sales and operating income.Analysts expect full-year earnings to grow 26% to $4.09 a share.A Year In BeerNet sales in the company's fiscal year ending Feb. 28 jumped 74% to $4.9 billion, driven by $2 billion of incremental net sales related to the Crown beer business.

"

"
803,KIM,"treatment for vets from the media, which had chronicled his original
"
804,KIM,"outrage over unconscionable delays fully six years ago. Delays he
"
805,KIM,"vowed then to fix should he become king president.But,
"
806,KIM,"according to Obama, he was not stunned or surprised at all, not even
"
807,KIM,"mildly shocked by the nationwide, bipartisan outrage over his illegal
"
808,KIM,"swapping of the Taliban's Terrorism Board of Directors for an American
"
809,KIM,"who not only volunteered for the U.S. Army, but then volunteered to walk
"
810,KIM,"over to the enemy busy killing his comrades.And to see that man and his eccentric parents hailed in a special Saturday Rose Garden photo-op celebrating his release with an heroic tone. True, this prisoner-bargain controversy buried the VA scandal for the moment. But it's also hijacked coverage of the president's week-long attempted reset of security policy in Europe.""I'm never surprised by controversies that are whipped up in Washington,"" the president claimed in a Thursday news conference.What planet has he been on? Does Obama ever talk with his staff, who didn't tell him about the IRS, ObamaCare and the VA? They've been quoted all week saying (anonymously) they were caught flat-footed by the political wildfire ignited by the deal to release five of the world's worst bad guys in or out of prison. ""Blind-sided,"" was their preferred word.""Sire,"" a minister once told the French monarch. ""The peasants are revolting.""""I know,"" said that country's last king, ""They never bathe.""Then, conveniently misunderstanding the target of widespread criticism, Obama added: “I make absolutely no apologies for making sure we get back a young man to his parents."" What a thoughtful politician! Always thinking of others.OK. Well, how about making sure that five top-ranking terrorists -- two of them wanted elsewhere for crimes against humanity -- don't get back with their IED-making, girls-school machine-gunning colleagues? No regrets there either, the Democrat professes, because he'll be ""keeping eyes on them.""This from the man whose administration can't lay eyes on the Benghazi murderers 633 days after the president vowed swift justice for them and months after raid leaders were interviewed by U.S. media outlets.According to Obama and his apologists, speed was suddenly of the essence in this bargain because the American might be in poor health and -- who knows? -- the Taliban might kill him.Which -- let's be honest for a change, sir -- they could have done during any one of the 2,592,000 minutes they held him. But they didn't -- did they? -- because they knew he was worth more alive.So, big Obama hurry after five years of nothing. Come to think of it, that's about the same time-frame Obama's held the Keystone XL pipeline as prisoner.The U.S. commander-in-chief acts like he had no leverage on these Taliban guys, who kept returning to the table for years. What might that suggest to even the dimmest of used-car salesmen?
"
811,KIM,"Vladimir Putin, Bashir al-Assad, Nouri al-Maliki, Kim Jong-Un, Hamid Karzai and Iran's mullahs have been playing Obama like this for years.The alleged need for speed is also Obama's excuse for violating the law he signed last December requiring 30 days' notice to Congress before moving any Guantanamo prisoner. Susan Rice's credibility is even lower than Obama's job approval. But she says the prisoner deal was essentially done May 27 and finalized the next day.So, that's only three days to get a call through the 16 blocks to Capitol Hill.“The White House,"" Democrat Sen. Dianne Feinstein observed with a collegial shrug, ""is pretty unilateral about what they want to do when they want to do it.""Obama claims that years ago his people told Congress he might do a prisoner deal. But then, years ago he also promised the Recovery Summer of 2010. Obama is so smart he doesn't want to waste time talking with mere Americans, as opposed to at us. So, we're left to mine news conference blather to detect his thinking.Of course, Obama won't be the one to feel the blast of his mistakes. But in Warsaw, the president made a stunning public admission about the released Taliban for someone in charge of United States national security:“Is there a possibility of some of them trying to return to activities that are detrimental to us?"" Obama asked himself out loud. ""Absolutely!""Obama said the possibility of freed terrorists returning to battle has been true of all the prisoners he's released from Guantanamo. And many have.You've almost got to admire someone with the nerve to cite his own failures as evidence he has the courage to repeat them.Almost.

"
883,KIM,"By the late 1990s, Walt Disney shareholders could have whistled toward work — or retirement.
"
884,KIM,"The company stood atop the entertainment world, growing strongly as its animation division churned out hits, its live-action films flowered, and its dusty video library turned into content gold.
"
885,KIM,"Shares surged 8,943% from their 1984 low to their March 2014 peak, with the biggest run from '84 to '98.
"
886,KIM,"But in the spring of 1984, all of that was far off.
"
887,KIM,"A few years after the death of the visionary founder Walt in 1966, Disney (DIS) foundered under weak leadership and little sense of direction. Once the company's crown jewels, the animated movies had fallen by the wayside, and its live-action films — think of ""Escape to Witch Mountain"" (1965) and ""Tron"" (1982) — weren't much better.
"
888,KIM,"In fiscal 1982, net income plunged 18% and fell 7% again the following year. The next year, corporate raider Saul Steinberg targeted Disney, which eventually paid him $32 million to go away.
"
889,KIM,"The Disney board knew that it needed change. In September of 1984, Michael Eisner started as CEO and chairman, and Frank Wells as president.
"
890,KIM,"""It was a fabulous management team. People were at their absolute best,"" said Chris Dixon, who covered Disney as a PaineWebber analyst at the time. ""Eisner was terrific in terms of imagination and energy, and Frank, because of his long-term experience, added a little gray hair.""
"
891,KIM,"""The '80s were golden,"" said Hal Vogel, a long-time entertainment industry analyst and investor who wrote ""Entertainment Industry Economics."" ""It was a very positive change and a very fruitful period.""
"
892,KIM,"One of the team's first smart moves, analysts say, was to recognize the cash potential of Disney's assets. By the early 1980s, the theme parks were generating 70% of company income, according to the website Funding Universe.
"
893,KIM,"""They sensed correctly that they could raise ticket prices and not affect demand for the parks,"" Vogel said.
"
894,KIM,"In fact, raising ticket prices by just $1 would yield $30 million more per year, wrote Kim Masters in ""The Keys to the Kingdom: The Rise of Michael Eisner and the Fall of Everybody Else.""
"
895,KIM,"Disney got lucky with demographics, says Vogel, as children of baby boomers got old enough to appreciate the theme parks. But it was a stroke of genius, not luck, that led Eisner to see Disney's existing film stock as an asset to be tapped.
"
896,KIM,"""Such a bounty has fallen into my lap. Every day a new asset falls out of the sky,"" Eisner said in Masters' book. Wells was said to have quipped, ""Every time I open a door at this company, there's money behind it.""
"
897,KIM,"No company had thought of marketing videocassettes cheaply enough that parents could buy them for children to watch over and over, Masters wrote, and that brainstorm made video a ""staggering source of revenue"" for Disney. Its video library, more than those of most studios, was easily distributed overseas because the films didn't require a lot of sophisticated translation.
"
898,KIM,"Eisner's recognition that old content had value changed the face of entertainment. It helped cable fill empty channels and gave rise to new business models such as Netflix (NFLX) and Roku.
"
899,KIM,"Again, Disney was in the sweet spot. Consumers weren't the only ones looking for videocassette content; scores of new TV channels also needed it, and Disney had family-friendly films galore.
"
900,KIM,"To create new movie and TV content, Eisner and Wells hired Jeffrey Katzenberg, who'd worked under Eisner at Paramount, as Disney Studios chairman.
"
901,KIM,"Under Katzenberg's direction, Disney revitalized its animation division, turning out hits like ""The Little Mermaid,"" which won two Oscars and grossed a record-setting $85 million; ""Beauty and the Beast,"" the first animated film to be nominated for a best-picture Oscar; and ""The Lion King,"" which took in a staggering $423 million in theatrical box-office revenues according to the website BoxOfficeMojo.
"
902,KIM,"Katzenberg ""lit a fire under people,"" said Bill Cotter, author of ""The Wonderful World of Disney Television."" Cotter worked for that Disney medium for years.
"
903,KIM,"Thomas Sito, who helped animate many of the hit films of the Disney renaissance, including ""Little Mermaid"" and ""Aladdin,"" believes another manager was also key to that revival: Roy Disney, Walt's nephew, who became head of the animation division in 1984.
"
904,KIM,"Roy was personally invested in the revival of animation, which had been the Disney Co.'s heart and soul. Sito told IBD that when it came to making decisions about the quality of the products, Roy used to growl, ""I have to care. My name's on the damn door.""
"
905,KIM,"The entire management team focused on bringing that sense of quality back to Disney films, Sito says. That was partly due to outside competition; former Disney animator Don Bluth had left and was producing popular animated films such as 1986's ""An American Tail.""
"
906,KIM,"Katzenberg used to liken Disney's status as synonymous with quality family entertainment just as the Kleenex brand is to tissues.
"
907,KIM,"""It was very exciting at the time, because as artists we always had faith in the art of animation and its ability to entertain,"" Sito said.
"
908,KIM,"Disney's new successes also showed Hollywood that animation could be big business again. The Lucasfilm spinoff Pixar had enormous hits with ""Toy Story,"" ""Finding Nemo"" and other films before being bought by Disney in 2006. And Katzenberg had hits like the ""Shrek"" films at DreamWorks Animation (DWA) after leaving Disney.
"
909,KIM,"Eisner, who was president of Paramount Pictures when Disney tapped him for the CEO job, also knew that there was value in live-action, non-G-rated movie fare. Disney had established Touchstone Films in 1983, before Eisner started, and had even had a hit with the Tom Hanks comedy ""Splash.""
"
910,KIM,"Eisner gave Touchstone lots of attention, and Touchstone hits such as ""Outrageous Fortune,"" ""Ruthless People"" and ""Pretty Woman"" were box-office gold.
"
911,KIM,"Eisner also expanded the moneymaking theme parks. He broadened Walt Disney World in Orlando, Fla., via a partnership with MGM for a studio-themed entertainment park, which opened in 1989.
"
912,KIM,"But Eisner thought even bigger. Tokyo Disneyland had opened in 1983, and while it did well, it was considered a missed opportunity because Disney had leased its characters and name to a local concessionaire rather than owning everything in the park outright. Still, Vogel said, ""It was quite lucrative, and Europe was the next logical decision."" Eisner began working on establishing a Disneyland in Paris: Euro Disney, which opened in 1992.
"
913,KIM,"Vogel lauds the decision to pursue global expansion. It spread Disney products to consumers around the world and reinforced the brand's iconic status.
"
914,KIM,"More than that, Eisner's long-distance shift meant that every interaction that a consumer had with Disney sparked another. A theme-park vacation would remind children of a love for Disney films, and re-viewing an old favorite movie could send a parent to buy a toy with a character's likeness. Some 22% of Disney's revenue came from international operations by 1991.
"
915,KIM,"All of those ventures were a prelude to one of Eisner's biggest steps: buying ABC/Capital Cities in 1996 for $19 billion. ""Once they were successful in being able to expand and demonstrate they could take the company to the next level and scale it, the next step was buying ABC,"" Dixon said.
"
916,KIM,"The acquisition got Disney a broadcast network along with TV and radio stations — plus ESPN, which at the time had 95 million worldwide viewers. ""ESPN was the crown jewel,"" Vogel said.
"
917,KIM,"The purchase was especially bold because it guaranteed Disney a network for its programs, Masters notes.
"
918,KIM,"ABC could air new Disney programming, which could be resold as reruns to cable. Yet Disney remained focused on quality entertainment rather than on churning out lots of content to dump on the network, says Cotter.
"
919,KIM,"The sense of rebirth touching the film animators reached the TV division as well, Cotter said: ""The more you keep a feeling of fire and ambition under a creative crowd, the more they're going to rise to the occasion.""
"
920,KIM,"Disney's market cap increased from $2 billion to $53 billion from 1984 to 1996. Eisner could point to 18 new businesses into which he'd led the company since taking the reins, including professional sports teams, live Broadway shows and Disney stores.
"
921,KIM,"""In the history of American business, this was a great group of people who complemented each other at the same time as expanding demand for American entertainment and rapidly developing technology delivered entertainment in new and different ways,"" Dixon said.By the late 1990s, Walt Disney shareholders could have whistled toward work — or retirement.The company stood atop the entertainment world, growing strongly as its animation division churned out hits, its live-action films flowered, and its dusty video library turned into content gold.Shares surged 8,943% from their 1984 low to their March 2014 peak, with the biggest run from '84 to '98.But in the spring of 1984, all of that was far off.A few years after the death of the visionary founder Walt in 1966, Disney (DIS) foundered under weak leadership and little sense of direction.

922,KIM,"Nonleadership: Fiscal catastrophe looms, thanks to out-of-control entitlement spending. But the man in charge responds to serious policy proposals like a fourth-grader. Cool, President ""Stinkburger""!
"
923,KIM,"If the ultimate measure of a man really can be found not where he stands in moments of comfort and convenience, but in times of challenge, then the man in the seat of power in this country falls short.
"
924,KIM,"If ever there was a challenge demanding patriotic cooperation across the aisle, it is the entitlement crisis. The fiscal path we are on means successive trillion-dollar deficits within the next decade, even assuming the federal government receives a high level of tax revenues.
"
925,KIM,"The Congressional Budget Office last year projected the national debt would increase by $6.3 trillion from 2014 to 2023; in February, the CBO revised that forecast upward to a terrifying $7.3 trillion.
"
926,KIM,"But when a serious Republican leader puts forward a plan that cuts $5 trillion over 10 years, while strengthening Medicare without causing disruptions to seniors currently enrolled, and forcing the White House and Congress to face the impending bankruptcy of Social Security and get to work on reforms, here is President Obama's reaction:
"
927,KIM,"""If they tried to sell this sandwich,"" he told an audience of University of Michigan students, ""they'd have to call it the stinkburger, or the meanwich.""
"
928,KIM,"This, from the president who likes to tell us after the tragic shooting of government officeholders that ""only a more civil and honest public discourse can help us face up to our challenges as a nation.""
"
929,KIM,"How civil and honest is it to respond to the seriousness of House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan with infantile sneers such as ""stinkburger""?

"
931,KIM,"Somewhere along the way, the youthful excitement people saw in Barack Obama, who in 2007 was making rousing statements such as, ""I don't want to pit red America against blue America; I want to be the president of the United States of America,"" turned into puerile name-calling, which obviously falls beneath the dignity of the presidency.
"
932,KIM,"It may not seem like it, but ""stinkburger"" even fits right in with the red line Obama drew regarding the terror state of Syria's use of chemical weapons. Syrian ruler Bashar Assad knew this president wasn't serious, because he hasn't been serious about waging war in Afghanistan and Iraq, and because so much of what he has said is unserious — ""You can keep your plan,"" ""I'll work with Republicans,"" ""We've got to be civil in politics,"" etc.
"
933,KIM,"Vladimir Putin knows he's dealing with an adolescent sensibility too, as does Iran's Ayatollah Khamenei and North Korea's Kim Jong-un.

The fiscal path we are on means successive trillion-dollar deficits within the next decade, even assuming the federal government receives a high level of tax revenues.The Congressional Budget Office last year projected the national debt would increase by $6.3 trillion from 2014 to 2023; in February, the CBO revised that forecast upward to a terrifying $7.3 trillion.But when a serious Republican leader puts forward a plan that cuts $5 trillion over 10 years, while strengthening Medicare without causing disruptions to seniors currently enrolled, and forcing the White House and Congress to face the impending bankruptcy of Social Security and get to work on reforms, here is President Obama's reaction:""If they tried to sell this sandwich,"" he told an audience of University of Michigan students, ""they'd have to call it the stinkburger, or the meanwich.""This, from the president who likes to tell us after the tragic shooting of government officeholders that ""only a more civil and honest public discourse can help us face up to our challenges as a nation.""How civil and honest is it to respond to the seriousness of House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan with infantile sneers such as ""stinkburger""?But the quip is not unlike the unseriousness he displayed toward concerns about our shrinking military, courtesy of his policies: ""We also have fewer horses and bayonets,"" Obama said in one of the 2012 debates.Somewhere along the way, the youthful excitement people saw in Barack Obama, who in 2007 was making rousing statements such as, ""I don't want to pit red America against blue America; I want to be the president of the United States of America,"" turned into puerile name-calling, which obviously falls beneath the dignity of the presidency.It may not seem like it, but ""stinkburger"" even fits right in with the red line Obama drew regarding the terror state of Syria's use of chemical weapons. Syrian ruler Bashar Assad knew this president wasn't serious, because he hasn't been serious about waging war in Afghanistan and Iraq, and because so much of what he has said is unserious — ""You can keep your plan,"" ""I'll work with Republicans,"" ""We've got to be civil in politics,"" etc.Vladimir Putin knows he's dealing with an adolescent sensibility too, as does Iran's Ayatollah Khamenei and North Korea's Kim Jong-un. The immaturity found today within the Oval Office goes a lot further than the president's shoes scuffing up the historic Resolute Desk.

"

"
938,KIM,"Previous collections of late-night jokes are available here.Late-night comedians and their writers pounce on the day's news as their primary source to twist and distort into laughs. Russia, of course, remains a hot item following the ""uncontested arrival"" of its troops in Crimea.Reflecting the diminished approval of President Obama, the late-night shows have been aiming their laughs at him more. See David Letterman's sly March Madness pivot below. Even Jimmy Fallon, who kicked off his Jay Leno replacement tour with a Michelle Obama interview, has aimed some laughs at his presidential pal. Although he quickly returns with something barbed at Republicans.Joe Biden's cliched cluelessness is an evergreen that pops up this week as does Jimmy Carter's dimness. The disparity between this harsh winter and the administration's persistent claims of global warming is another common link. Conan O'Brien has his usual laughs over Pope Francis (Conan's Irish, you see.) North Korea's little leader is back. But the Kardashians' weekly marriages were absent for a change. Then there are the hyperbolic takeoffs on the week's weird news.Personally, we're enjoying Seth Meyers' refreshing later-night offerings the most these days. See what you think below:SethMeyers: An upstate New York town is giving birth control to deer to combat over-population. If you think hunting deer is a challenge, try putting a condom on one.Fallon: Obama saw Putin's approval rating jump after attacking Crimea. So Obama is sending troops into Canada.Fallon: China develops “smart tags” that change color when food goes bad. Plus another thing that changes color when food goes bad—food.SethMeyers: Today was the first day of spring. And just in time, because yesterday was the 400th day of winter.SethMeyers: A Virginia woman was arrested this week after showing up drunk and naked to visit her husband in jail. But in fairness, is there a RIGHT way to visit your husband in jail?Fallon: In a speech on women's economic issues, Obama said government policies would be different if men were having babies. Joe Biden said, “How would that work?”SethMeyers: March Madness has begun! And by March Madness I am, of course, referring to people wearing shorts when it’s 55 degrees.SethMeyers: Three circus elephants escaped in St. Louis the other day. Before they were re-captured, they had damaged two vehicles, injuring over 50 clowns.Fallon: Russia's Putin didn’t attend the recent nuclear conference in the Netherlands. He said he doesn't want to visit any country he can't keep.SethMeyers: Jimmy Carter says he sends no emails because the NSA is reading them. Also because he can’t find the “send” button on his typewriter.Conan: Jimmy Carter says he’s stopped using email because the NSA was spying on him. And also because he’s 89 years old and what he thought
"
939,KIM,"was email was actually a thermostat.Fallon: Russia's Putin ordered fireworks over Moscow to celebrate his Crimea takeover. Either that or one of Putin's opponents started his car.Fallon: Actually, Putin explained the real reason behind those Moscow fireworks: He had Stanford beating Kansas in his March Madness pool.Conan: The “Noah” movie gets Pope Francis’ blessing. However, the Pope refused to bless the new Muppets Movie. He says, “It needed more Scooter.”Conan: Michelle Obama visited China with her daughters. It was the first time in China’s long history that an American has ARRIVED with daughters.Conan: While in China, First Lady Michelle Obama commented on Chinese censorship. Or as the Chinese news reported it, “Michelle Obama greatly admires Chinese censorship.” Conan: Michelle Obama fed China’s pandas during her visit. Like most people she feeds, the bears politely took the bamboo, then had a cheeseburger the minute she left.Letterman: About March Madness. It starts at 64, then 32, 16 and down. It's like Obama's approval rating.Letterman: President Obama met with the G-7 again. Can you name them? I tried. I always forget Bashful.Letterman: President Obama has met with the G-7 leaders. It must be fun now to be able to put faces on all the voices he listens to on the NSA wiretaps.Letterman: No one got Warren Buffets $1 billion prize for picking a perfect NCAA bracket. Now he's offering $1 billion to any married man who can properly load a dishwasher.Conan: Ukraine said it plans to take Russia to court to try to get the Crimea back. So, ladies and gentlemen— get ready next week for a very special Judge Judy.SethMeyers: The other day Russia flew an American astronaut to the International Space Station. And you thought driving someone home after a breakup was awkward.SethMeyers: Time Warner was voted America’s worst company in an online poll by the blog Consumerist. I have to say, I’m kind of surprised that Time Warner customers were able to get online.Fallon: The G-7 has moved its summer summit out of Russia to meet in Brussels. Putin said, “By summer, Brussels will be part of Russia.”Fallon: Officials in Europe seized a cocaine shipment addressed to the Vatican. That means Rob Ford just received a giant box of communion wafers.Fallon: Ukraine withdraws its last troops from Crimea. So the split is now final. Well, they're not calling it a split. They’re calling it a ""conscious uncoupling.""Fallon: Obama has called for a united front with Europe against Russia. Obama promised that if Russia invades another country, America will stand behind Europe. Way, way, WAY behind Europe.Fallon: Apparently with no cell or email Putin is unfamiliar with texting and the Internet. When he says “LOL,” he actually means, “Look out, Latvia.”Conan: All North Korea men are now required to get Kim Jong Un’s haircut. Or, as that style is known in the U.S., “The First Year Lesbian.”SethMeyers: After discovering a new dwarf planet orbiting the sun beyond Pluto, scientists have named it “2012 VP113” -- or “Biden” for short. Scientists say they chose the name because the planet, like Biden, is pretty far out there.SethMeyers: A New Jersey man who was released last week after 15 years in prison for robbing a shoe store was arrested the next day for robbing the exact same store. He learned a valuable lesson though. Next time, steal both shoes at the same time.SethMeyers: A new study says the No.1 reason women fake orgasms is to avoid hurting their partner’s feelings. The No. 2 reason is “’Scandal’ is on in five minutes.”Fallon: The Philadelphia 76ers tied the NBA record with 26 consecutive losses. The team has no cheerleaders anymore, just grief counselors.Fallon: Obama was in Saudi Arabia meeting with King Abdullah. Joe Biden told him, ""Be sure to give my best to King Abdullah and his wife, Paula.”RELATED:Despite Obama promises, thousands of vets die awaiting benefitsWhy jobs and the economy grow better under GOP governorsWho you gonna believe about their meeting, Obama or the Pope?'The surest path to danger is always weakness and indecision'--Romney

940,KIM,"Ushering in good news for its shareholders, Agree Realty Corporation (ADC  -  Free Report) announced that it has received investment grade rating from Moody's Investors Service. Particularly, the rating agency has assigned a Baa2 issuer rating to the company, with a stable outlook.Agree Realty cited that the rating agency’s Baa2 issuer rating highlights the company’s enduring operating history, adherence to conservative leverage policy, solid balance-sheet strength with sufficient liquidity for growth, as well as a well-laddered debt maturity schedule.The rating agency also recognized the company’s considerable investment grade tenant roster, large pool of unencumbered asset, a healthy net lease portfolio having long-term leases and nominal lease expirations in the near term.The conferring of this investment grade credit rating to Agree Realty boosts the company's creditworthiness in the market and is likely to enhance investors' confidence in the stock. In fact, such moves provide companies an opportunity to enjoy favorable costs on debts and solid access to capital, and are therefore encouraging.With the ownership and operation of a portfolio of 468 properties across 44 states, Agree Realty primarily deals with properties net leased to industry-leading retail tenants. Recently, the company announced a hike in its quarterly cash dividend. It will now pay a dividend of 54 cents per share, marking a 3.8% increase from the prior dividend payout. The raised dividend will be paid on Jul 13, to shareholders of record as of the close of business on Jun 29, 2018.Notably, retail REITs have been displaying a lackluster performance as traffic at their properties continues to suffer due to the rapid shift in consumers’ shopping preferences toward e-retail. In fact, with e-commerce grabbing market share from the brick-and-mortar stores, retailers are compelled to reconsider their footprint and eventually opt for store closures in recent years while others unable to cope with competition have been filing bankruptcies. As a result even industry stalwarts like Simon Property Group Inc. (SPG  -  Free Report), GGP Inc. (GGP  -  Free Report) and Kimco Realty Corp. (KIM  -  Free Report) have been affected.However, with focus on retailers having omni-channel strategy, a value-oriented business model, or a service base component, Agree Realty remains well poised to navigate through the broader market blues.

941,KIM,"Simon Property Group Inc. (SPG  -  Free Report) is making every effort to boost its portfolio quality through substantial redevelopment program. Recently, the company announced the continuation of its plan to recapture former Sears locations across its portfolio, transforming those into retail, fitness, dining and entertainment hubs, and thereby drawing more traffic at these shopping destinations.In fact, earlier in April, Simon Property announced the company’s transformational redevelopment plans for the former Sears stores, at five major locations. The properties included in the refurbishment plan were Brea Mall (Brea, CA), Burlington Mall (Burlington, MA), Midland Park Mall (Midland, TX), Ocean County Mall (Toms River, NJ) and Ross Park Mall (Pittsburgh, PA). Enhancements to the properties included entertainment, fitness, restaurants and dining pavilions, residential, as well as new retail brands.Admittedly, a rapid shift in customers' shopping preferences to online channels has jeopardized the traffic flow in malls. In fact, with e-commerce grabbing market share from brick-and-mortar stores, retailers are compelled to reconsider their footprint and eventually opt for store closures, while others unable to cope with competition have been filing bankruptcies.Amid these, tenants are also demanding substantial lease concessions, which, however, mall landlords find unjustified. Such an environment has cast a pall over retail REITs like Simon Property, GGP Inc. (GGP  -  Free Report), Kimco Realty Corp. (KIM  -  Free Report), Macerich Company (MAC  -  Free Report), and others, and the companies’ share prices have been suffering for the past 12 months.However, Simon Property is making every possible move to counter this challenging situation. The company is making heavy investments not only to elevate the value of its retail properties, but also for exploring mixed-use development option which has gained immense popularity in recent years.Such developments lower the distance between housing, workplaces, retail businesses, and other amenities and destinations. Hence, such developments enable companies to grab the attention of people who prefer to live, work and play in the same area — a trend that drove development in several other cities in the United States.Nevertheless, the implementation of such measures requires a decent upfront cost and therefore, would limit any robust growth in its near-term profit margins. Also, rate hike has added to its woes.Simon Property has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

943,KIM,"Simon Property Group Inc. (SPG  -  Free Report) has been making rigorous efforts to drive footfall at its properties. In sync with that, the company recently announced an association with Electrify America to install electric-vehicle charging stations at over 30 of its properties.Simon Property has been undertaking every possible step to ensure that footfall remains high at all of its properties. This move also aids Simon Property in its corporate-sustainability ambitions.Mona Benisi, Simon Property’s vice president of corporate sustainability informed, ""Having been one of the first retail property owners in the U.S. to offer customer EV charging stations, we understand the importance of this infrastructure to facilitate the transition towards smart sustainable cities.”Gulfport Premium Outlets in Gulfport, MS has been chosen as the first property where the charging station is going to be installed in early June. Moreover, Electrify America, Mississippi Power and Simon Property are going to host a 'First Charging Ceremony' in that location. After which, the charging stations will be installed at few notable properties of the company across the United States.Simon Property has been undertaking these efforts to combat the declining mall traffic, which continues to suffer due to the rapid shift in customers' shopping preferences, with e-retail taking precedence. In fact, retailers are compelled to reconsider footprints and eventually opt for store closures while others, unable to cope with competition, are filing bankruptcies as e-commerce is gaining market share from brick-and-mortar stores.This resulted in tenants demanding substantial lease concessions, which mall landlords find unjustified.

945,KIM,"Realty Income Corporation’s (O  -  Free Report) first-quarter 2018 adjusted funds from operations (FFO) per share of 79 cents came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate and increased 3.9% from the prior-year quarter.The company benefited from revenue growth in the quarter and also attained its highest quarter-end occupancy in more than 10 years. Further, the company reiterated its guidance for 2018 adjusted FFO per share.Total revenues for the reported quarter came in at $318.3 million, up 6.8% year over year. However, the reported figure missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $321.6 million.Quarter in DetailDuring first-quarter 2018, same-store rents on 4,747 properties under lease expanded 1.0% to $276.7 million from the prior-year quarter. Portfolio occupancy of 98.6% as of Mar 31, 2018, expanded 20 basis points (bps) sequentially and 30 bps year over year.Further, the company had 75 properties available for lease, out of a total of 5,326 properties in the portfolio as of Mar 31, 2018, compared with 83 properties as of Dec 31, 2017. Moreover, during the reported quarter, it re-leased 55 properties to existing and new tenants, at a rent recapture rate of 100.4%.Portfolio ActivityThe company made solid property acquisitions in the quarter that are leased to mainly investment grade rated tenants. During the reported quarter, Realty Income invested $509.8 million in 174 new properties and properties under development or expansion, situated in 27 states. The assets are fully leased, with a weighted average lease term of around 14 years, and an initial average cash lease yield of 6.2%. Around 85% of the rental revenues from acquisitions reported during the quarter came in from investment grade-rated tenants.On the other hand, during the quarter, the company sold 14 properties for $13.8 million, with a gain on sales of $3.2 million.LiquidityFinally, Realty Income exited first-quarter 2018 with cash and cash equivalents of $20.6 million, down from $6.9 million at the end of 2017.However, the company has a $2.25-billion unsecured credit facility, comprising $2.0 billion revolving credit facility and a $250-million five-year unsecured term loan. The credit facility also bears a $1.0-billion expansion feature. As of Mar 31, 2018, Realty Income had borrowing capacity of $918 million available on its revolving credit facility.Moreover, the borrowing capacity of the revolving credit facility improved to $1.4 billion, subsequent to the use of proceeds from the April notes offering to payback borrowings under the revolving credit facility.Furthermore, Realty Income raised $2.3 million from the sale of common stock at a weighted average price of $51.08 per share during the first quarter.OutlookFor full-year 2018, Realty Income reiterated its adjusted FFO per share of $3.14-$3.20. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is currently pegged at $3.16.Our TakeRealty Income’s high occupancy of its properties in the first quarter looks impressive. Notably, dwindling mall traffic amid shift of consumers toward online channels, store closures and bankruptcy of retailers have emerged as pressing concerns for most retail REITs, including Kimco Realty Corp. (KIM  -  Free Report), GGP Inc. (GGP  -  Free Report) and Macerich Company (MAC  -  Free Report). However, not all firms are affected, as a few companies are gaining even in this dismal scenario, backed by the robust business models.In fact, this freestanding retail REIT — Realty Income — derives more than 90% of its annualized retail rental revenues from tenants belonging to service, non-discretionary and low-price retail business. Such businesses are less susceptible to economic recessions and competition from Internet retailing. Furthermore, the company’s solid underlying real estate quality and prudent underwriting at acquisitions have helped maintain its high occupancy levels consistently. Additionally, its same-store rent growth displayed limited operational volatility. Also, the company adheres to a conservative capital structure.Nevertheless, substantial exposure to single-tenant assets increases risks associated with tenant default. In addition, generation of notable rental revenues from assets leased to drug stores and rate hikes are other key concerns.Realty Income currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

946,KIM,"Realty Income Corp. (O  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results after the market closes on May 8. The company’s funds from operations (FFO) per share and revenues are estimated to have witnessed a rise year over year.In the last reported quarter, this monthly-dividend-paying real estate investment trust (REIT) posted a negative surprise of 1.3%, in terms of FFO per share. It witnessed modest year-over-year growth in same-store rents and had exited the quarter with lower liquidity.Notably, Realty Income has a mixed surprise history. The company surpassed estimates in two occasions, missed in one and met in the other, over the trailing four quarters, resulting in an average positive surprise of 0.34%. This is depicted in the graph below:Realty Income Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Realty Income Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Realty Income Corporation QuoteLet’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderRealty Income’s portfolio is well diversified with respect to tenant, industry, geography and property type. Besides retail properties, the company’s portfolio comprises industrial, office as well as agricultural properties. Further, it derives more than 90% of its annualized retail rental revenues from tenants with a service, non-discretionary, and/or low price point component to their business. Such businesses are less susceptible to economic recessions, as well as competition from Internet retail. This is expected to have helped the company enjoy higher retail revenues in the Jan-Mar quarter. In fact, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues from the company’s retail segment for first quarter is pegged at $303 million. This reflects a robust 6% increase from the prior-year quarter.Also, the company targets industrial properties leased to Fortune 1000, mainly investment grade-rated companies, which ensures stable revenues from these properties.Encouragingly, Realty Income’s FFO per share estimates witnessed positive revision. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter FFO per share has been revised upward by a cent to 79 cents, over the last 30 days, reflecting bullish analyst sentiment. This also reflects 3.9% year-over-year increase from the prior-year quarter.Additionally, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter revenues is pegged at $321.6 million, indicating a year-over-year rise of 7.9%.However, the retail real estate market remained turbulent amid retailer bankruptcies and store closures. Particularly, mall traffic has been affected, and retail landlords, including GGP Inc. (GGP  -  Free Report), Regency Centers Corporation (REG  -  Free Report) and Kimco Realty Corporation (KIM  -  Free Report), have felt the heat due to consumers’ preferences increasingly shifting toward e-retail. In addition, the company has substantial exposure to single-tenant assets which raises its risks associated with tenant default.Amid these, growth in revenues from tenant reimbursements is expected to have been modest.

949,KIM,"Equity Residential (EQR  -  Free Report) reported first-quarter 2018 normalized funds from operations (FFO) per share of 77 cents, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 78 cents by a whisker.Per management, although the nation’s coastal, gateway cities are witnessing strong rental housing demand, growth in new lease rates continues to be dampened by new apartment supply.However, normalized FFO per share figure came in higher than 74 cents reported in the year-ago quarter. Results mirror enhanced same-store net operating income (NOI) and lease-up NOI. Nonetheless, the company incurred higher corporate overhead in the quarter.Moreover, total revenues in the reported quarter came in at $633.0 million, up 4.8% from the prior-year tally. In addition, the revenue figure surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $631.3 million.Quarter in DetailSame-store revenues (includes 72,204 apartment units) were up 2.2% year over year to $590.4 million, while expenses flared up 3.9% year over year to $180.4 million. As a result, same-store NOI inched up 1.5% year over year to $410.0 million.The company experienced 1.9% growth in average rental rate to $2,721. Physical occupancy expanded 10 basis points year over year to 96.0% for same-store portfolio.The company exited the first quarter with cash and cash equivalents of around $44.5 million, down from $50.6 million recorded at the end of the prior quarter.Portfolio ActivityDuring the reported quarter, Equity Residential acquired a Seattle property — a 117-unit consolidated apartment property — for around $53.7 million and an acquisition capitalization rate of 4.6%.On the other hand, the company sold a consolidated apartment property each in New York City, the New York suburbs, sub-urban Seattle and sub-urban Los Angeles (aggregating 786 apartment units), for a total of about $290.0 million, at a weighted average disposition yield of 4.4%. Further, the company completed 855 Brannan — a 449-unit apartment development project — in San Francisco for $322.2 million.OutlookFor second-quarter 2018, Equity Residential projects normalized FFO per share in the range of 77-81 cents. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is currently pegged at 80 cents.For full-year 2018, the company expects normalized FFO per share of $3.17-$3.27. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.22 lies within this range. The company’s full-year outlook is backed by same-store portfolio revenue growth of 1.0-2.25%, physical occupancy of 96.0% and NOI change of 0.0-1.5%. Also, expense is projected to flare up 3.5-4.5%.Our ViewpointEquity Residential is expected to benefit from its efforts to reposition the portfolio in high barrier-to-entry/core markets, favorable demographics, lifestyle transformation, and creation of new households. The company’s current focus is on the acquisition and development of assets primarily in the six core coastal metropolitan areas — Boston, New York, Washington D.C., Southern California, San Francisco and Seattle. Nevertheless, elevated supply in a number of its markets is likely to put pressure on rental rates and result in high concessions.

950,KIM,"PS Business Parks, Inc. (PSB  -  Free Report) reported first-quarter 2018 funds from operations (FFO) of $1.59 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.50. The figure also came in 4.6% higher than $1.52 recorded in the prior-year quarter.Results highlight a rise in Same-Park net operating income (NOI) that was backed by growth in rental rates.Rental income came in around $103.8 million, marking 3.7% growth from the year-ago figure. Additionally, the figure outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $100.6 million.Quarter in DetailSame-Park rental income was up 2.4% year over year, while Same-Park NOI edged up 0.7% year over year, mainly driven by improving rental rates.Same-Park annualized rental income per occupied-square-foot rose 2.3% to $15.40, while weighted average square-foot occupancy was 94.6%, flat year over year.LiquidityPS Business Parks exited first-quarter 2018 with cash and cash equivalents of $39.2 million, down from $114.9 million at the end of the prior quarter.Portfolio UpdateDuring the first quarter, the company sold Corporate Pointe Business Park in Orange County, CA — consisting of five multi-tenant office buildings and aggregating 161,000 square feet of space — for net proceeds of $41.7 million. Following the end of the quarter, the company accomplished the sale of Orange County Business Center, which comprises five multi-tenant office buildings, spanning 437,000 square feet of space, for $73.3 million.The company plans selling additional 107,000 rentable square feet of office product in Orange County, CA, as well as 194,000 square feet of flex product in Dallas, TX, in 2018.Dividend UpdateOn Apr 24, the company announced a regular quarterly dividend of 85 cents per share, same as the previous payout. The dividend is payable on Jun 28, to shareholders of record as of Jun 13, 2018.ConclusionWe are encouraged with the better-than-expected performance of PS Business Parks in the first quarter. Notably, healthy fundamentals in the multi-tenant flex, office and industrial asset categories are anticipated to stoke growth, over the long run. Nonetheless, stiff competition from other office and industrial asset owners in the market hampers its ability to attract and retain tenants at higher rents.

951,KIM,"We are in the heart of the Q1 reporting cycle and the real estate investment trust (REIT) space is bustling with activity. In fact, there is a deluge of Q1 earnings releases lined up for this week, of which Digital Realty Trust (DLR  -  Free Report), Iron Mountain Incorporation (IRM  -  Free Report), Kimco Realty Corporation (KIM  -  Free Report) and Cubesmart (CUBE  -  Free Report) will release their quarterly numbers on Apr 26.Per our latest Earnings Preview, total Finance Sector earnings for the Jan-Mar quarter are expected to be up 27% on 4.7% increase in revenues, as compared to the prior-year quarter. In fact, the sector witnessed 0.6% earnings growth in the prior quarter, primarily due to 4% rise in revenues.Notably, with the underlying asset categories and the location of properties playing a crucial role in determining REITs’ performance, not all players in the space are equally poised to excel or fall behind, this season.Therefore, let’s have a close look at the factors that will impact the above-mentioned REITs’ first-quarter results.Digital Realty Trust is a data-center REIT that offers colocation and interconnection solutions for domestic and international tenants through its portfolio of data centersNotably, data-center REITs have been experiencing a boom market, of late. Additionally, demand has been outpacing supply in top-tier data-center markets. Other than enjoying high occupancy, these markets are also absorbing new construction at a faster pace. Further, according to a Cisco forecast, data-center IP traffic is projected to witness a compound annual growth rate of 25%, over the 2016-2021 period.Notably, Digital Realty, with its high-quality date centers, is well poised to benefit from this trend. Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for occupancy of 90% for the first quarter indicates year-over-year growth of 1.1%.However, Digital Realty faces intense competition in its industry. In fact, the company competes with several data-center developers, owners and operators, many of which enjoy ownership of similar assets in locations same as Digital Realty. Also, there are a number of local developers in the United States, and several regional operators in Europe, Asia and Australia. Amid this, aggressive pricing pressure is predicted to have been prevalent in the data-center market in the quarter to be reported. (Read more: Digital Realty to Post Q1 Earnings: What's in Store?)Hence, prior to the first-quarter earnings release, there is lack of any solid catalyst. As such, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of funds from operations (FFO) per share for the first quarter remained unchanged at $1.57, over the past month.Moreover, our proven model does not conclusively show that Digital Realty is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP, and a bullish Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here, as you will see below.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.In fact, though Digital Realty has a favorable Zacks Rank of 3, its Earnings ESP of -0.25% makes surprise prediction difficult.Over the trailing four quarters, the company beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all four occasions, the average beat being nearly 2.18%. This is depicted in the graph below:Digital Realty Trust, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Digital Realty Trust, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Digital Realty Trust, Inc. QuoteIron Mountain’s focus on setting up data-center businesses bodes well for the company.  Internal storage rental growth rate for 2018 is expected in the 3-3.5% range, backed by volume growth and pricing improvement. We believe stellar organic growth and the company’s initiatives to expand its core storage business will benefit the first-quarter results.Nevertheless, Iron Mountain has grown its business principally through acquisitions, which have affected its balance sheet in the form of a high level of goodwill. Hence, a highly leveraged balance sheet is predicted to have limited any robust margin improvement in the quarter. (Read more: What's in the Offing for Iron Mountain in Q1 Earnings?)The Zacks Consensus Estimate for FFO per share for the soon-to-be-reported quarter is pegged at 50 cents. This indicates a 4.2% increase year over year.Furthermore, with an Earnings ESP of 0.00% and a Zacks Rank of 2, our proven model does not conclusively show that the company will likely beat estimates this season. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The story about Iron Mountain’s surprise history is better told by the chart below:Iron Mountain Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise Iron Mountain Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise | Iron Mountain Incorporated QuoteKimco Realty is taking long strides, and is progressing well with its strategic 2020 Vision. In fact, for first-quarter 2018, the company continued aggressively selling its non-core assets.In line with its strategy, the company announced dispositions of 21 shopping centers, spanning 2.3 million square feet of space, for $219.5 million in the first quarter. Of this, the company’s share included $210.2 million. High-disposition activity can lead to earnings dilution and depress the company’s growth momentum in the quarter to be reported.  While challenges faced by retail REITs have been well documented, recent data from real estate research firm Reis states that U.S. retail real estate vacancies remained moderately unchanged at 10% for first-quarter 2018. In fact, the first few months of the year witnessed several preeminent retail bankruptcy filings and record-high defaults by retail corporate.Although Kimco is actively enhancing omni-channel capabilities and heavily investing in redevelopment to draw customers, it might take a while for these efforts to offset the dent created in the operating results. (Read more: Why is Earnings Beat Unlikely for Kimco Realty in Q1?)Although the company has an Earnings ESP of +0.51%, an unfavorable Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) makes it difficult for our proven model to conclusively predict a likely earnings beat this season.Kimco Realty Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Kimco Realty Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Kimco Realty Corporation QuoteCubeSmart is a self-administered and self-managed real estate company focused on the ownership, operation, acquisition and development of self storage facilities in the United States.Notably, the self-storage industry is anticipated to experience solid demand backed by favorable demographic changes, improving job market and rising incomes, as well as events like marriages, shifting, death, and even divorce. Also, due to shorter leasing periods, this REIT has the power to adjust its rents quickly to any rate hike.Nevertheless, increased supply of self-storage units in a number of the company’s markets during the Jan-Mar quarter is predicted to have affected its performance. This might have dampened its same-store revenue growth as well.  Amis these, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter revenues of $144.9 million indicates 8.9% year-over-year growth. Further, the company’s activities during the quarter could not gain adequate analyst confidence. Consequently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for FFO per share of 39 cents for the first quarter remained unchanged, over the past month. The figure reflects 8.3% rise from the prior-year quarter.In fact, though it has a favorable Zacks Rank of 3, its Earnings ESP of -0.37% makes surprise prediction difficult.Over the preceding four quarters, the company met the FFO per share estimates in two occasions and beat in the other two, resulting in an average positive surprise of 1.91%.

952,KIM,"Kimco Realty (KIM  -  Free Report) is making efforts to concentrate its open-air center assets in key retail destinations across the United States. This will likely enhance the company’s portfolio. However, continued asset disposition is expected to hinder bottom-line performance.For third-quarter 2017, Kimco’s adjusted funds from operations (FFO) of 38 cents surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a cent. Concurrent with its third-quarter earnings release, Kimco announced a quarterly cash dividend of 28 cents, which reflects a 3.7% sequential hike. Given the company’s healthy financial position and lower debt-to-equity ratio compared to that of the industry, this dividend payout is anticipated to be sustainable.In order to achieve an optimal portfolio, Kimco is shifting its focus to the small-shops portfolio. The small-shops portfolio enjoys frequent customer traffic and is Internet-resistant. This diversification will help Kimco limit its operating and leasing risks.The company is also making solid progress to achieve its 2020 Visions, which outlines the concentration of assets in primary markets and a reduction in joint ventures. The company is channelizing the proceeds from portfolio reduction to Signature Series assets which offer scope for redevelopment. In fact, since 2010, the company has reduced its portfolio size from more than 900 assets to 508 assets by disposing real estate worth more than $6 billion. Such strategic measures are projected to drive Kimco’s bottom line in the long term.While such aggressive dispositions are aimed at simplifying its business structure, the dilution of earnings in the short term cannot be bypassed. In fact, during the recently-reported quarter, Kimco sold five non-core assets for $62 million and is expected to close another 19 dispositions by the end of the year.     Further, it is revitalizing assets that are accretive for long-term growth by investing in development and redevelopment projects. Recently, the company announced its plan to redevelop the Owings Mills Mall into an open-air shopping center — Mill Station. (Read more: Kimco Announces Plans to Refurbish Owings Mills Mall). However, these projects typically have a long gestation period and also expose the company to various risks such as rising construction costs, entitlement delays and lease-ups in the near term.  Also, shift in consumers’ shopping preferences and pattern, and shrinking footfall at the brick-and-mortar outlets amid the e-commerce boom continue to thwart the performance of this retail real estate investment trust (REIT). Retailers that are not being able to cope with competition are shutting doors as well as filing bankruptcies.Amid the gloomy retail environment, shares of Kimco have underperformed the industry it belongs to, year to date. During this time frame, shares of the company have declined 27.3%, whereas the industry registered 9.6% growth.Kimco currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Key PicksBetter-ranked stocks in the real estate investment trust space include Clipper Realty (CLPR  -  Free Report), Extra Space Storage (EXR  -  Free Report) and Urstadt Biddle Properties (UBA  -  Free Report).

953,KIM,"The end of Cyber Monday, a day which witnesses the single largest volume of online purchases, is possibly a good time to take stock of e-commerce’s fortunes. Fresh estimates from Adobe Systems Inc. (ADBE) indicate that expenditure via the e-commerce route registered a near 17% increase to hit $6.6 billion this Cyber Monday.In fact, the holiday season as a whole will see online expenditure touch nearly $107 billion, more than 11% of total retail holiday sales. While this is great news for the likes of Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN), brick and mortar retailers are an embattled lot. But the fallout of the e-commerce assault isn’t limited to this segment alone. Retail REITs are also increasingly feeling the heat.General Growth Property’s DilemmaThe problems faced by U.S. retail REITs are best illustrated by the case of GGP, Inc. (GGP  -  Free Report). On Nov 11, GGP received a $15 billion offer from Brookfield Property Partners, aimed at buying the shares it still doesn’t in this major mall owner.Reportedly, GGP had already been in talks with Brookfield about going private. But Brookfield offered to pay only $23 per share, only marginally higher than Nov 10’s closing price of $22.20 in a cash and equity deal.  This case serves to illustrate how acute the situation seems for retail REITs. This Chicago-based REIT is believed to be well above its peers in terms of the quality of its real estate portfolio. Most of its malls are considered to be “Class A” level, those which generate the highest level of sales per square foot.Has E-commerce Caused Retail Overcapacity?But GGP is already facing a large number of problems, store closures and retail bankruptcies to name a few, all of which are a fallout of the switch to online purchases. Share prices of several major retail REITs are down year to date. This includes the likes of Simon Property Group (SPG  -  Free Report), Federal Realty Investment Trust (FRT  -  Free Report) and Kimco Realty Corporation (KIM  -  Free Report) which have lost 12%, 8% and 27.7% over the last one year.And yet, most of these REITs enjoy occupancy levels of 95%, according to most industry estimates. This means that demand from multiple sources remains high. In fact, year to date leasing volumes for Kimco Realty are at a record high, a fact which serves to illustrate the sector’s inherent strength. Rental prices and leasing volumes continue to remain high and earnings have been mostly promising.Is Diversification the Way Forward?Coming back to the GGP story, a deal with Brookfield would provide the mall owner with an opportunity to diversify across various segments of the REIT industry. For instance, it could follow a mixed usage strategy, putting office space and apartments into several of its properties. This is because Brookfield itself holds a more diversified real estate portfolio, including retail stores, offices and multifamily housing.This is likely a situation which retail REITs across the board are facing. As brick and mortar retailers increasingly come under fire, retail REITs are having to make rapid changes, sometimes only in order to combat falling share prices. Though stock fundamentals continue to look solid, activist investors are demanding rapid changes in the face of the e-commerce boom.Price Declines Likely OverdoneThere is no denying that the retail REIT segment is facing a number of challenges. Among them is increased competition, both at malls and at shopping centers anchored by groceries. This could lead to a significant decline in margins for retailers who would in term pay lower levels of rent.REITs are suffering because it is difficult to predict the outcome of the so called retail apocalypse. But strong earnings and leasing volumes indicate that the extent to which prices of retail REIT stocks have declined is difficult to justify.2 Retail REIT ChoicesDespite the troubles plaguing the industry currently, retail REITs remain solid prospects. Strong fundamentals imply that price declines are overdone. This is why investing in select retail REITs remains a good option.A favorable EV/EBITDA ratio is desirable for any REIT given the large levels of debt which they utilize to funds their operations. Both of our picks have EV/EBITDA levels which are lower than the industry average of 23.3. Additionally, each of them has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

954,KIM,"Kimco Realty (KIM  -  Free Report) and Rockefeller Group Development, joint-venture partners in the Miramar Town Center, recently sold a portion of the mixed-use development to IMC Equity Group for $24.8 million. The Rock-Kim Miramar LLC partnership transferred 17 apartments spanning 27,000 square feet of space, 127,000 square feet of retail and office space, a 585-space parking garage, along with a 3.7-acre vacant land for future development, to IMC Equity.   Per IMC Equity management, the company has secured a $17.25-million loan from Loan Core Capital Markets — a commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) lender — for the above-mentioned acquisition.Miramar Town Center, which broke ground in 2006, is suitably located at the 2401 Main Street and 11645 Red Road. This town center includes a 487-unit residential community, the Miramar City Hall, a performing arts center, an educational building and a police headquarter as well. Its tenant roster includes several well-known names like 24-Hour Fitness, Subway, UPS Store, Juana’s Sports Bar, La Famiglia Restaurant, Salonz Suites and Comcast Corporation.  In fact, per IMC Equity, the property offers immense scope to unlock additional value, with 90% of the retail and office space and 76% of the apartments being occupied. The company acquired 154,000 square feet space in the mixed-use project, for a cap rate of 8.25%, and a price per square foot that compares favorably with its replacement cost.  IMC Equity plans to develop the 3.7-acre vacant land as a mixed-use property, with retail and entertainment options on the ground floor, and apartments as well as retail space, anchored by a solid retailer, on the top floor.  It also plans to acquire a vacant parcel along the Hiatus Road, quite near to the town center.The aforementioned sale is in line with Kimco’s 2020 Vision, which is aimed at shrinking the company’s JV portfolio and increasing ownership of premium assets in core U.S. markets.However, year to date, amid the choppy retail real estate environment, shares of Kimco have underperformed the industry it belongs to.

955,KIM,"Kimco Realty Corporation (KIM  -  Free Report) is slated to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 26, before the market opens. Its revenues are expected to inch up in the quarter, while funds from operations (FFO) per share will witness a year-over-year decline.Last quarter, this New Hyde Park, NY-based retail real estate investment trust (REIT) reported in-line results with respect to FFO per share. In 2017, the company recorded the strongest leasing volume in the past decade.Over the trailing four quarters, Kimco beat estimates in one occasion and posted in-line results in the other three, recording an average beat of 0.68%. The graph below depicts this surprise history:Kimco Realty Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Kimco Realty Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Kimco Realty Corporation QuoteFactors to Influence Q1 ResultsKimco is taking long strides and is progressing well with its strategic 2020 Vision. In fact, the company is reducing its portfolio size and channeling the proceeds toward high-quality assets. Further, the company is engaged in boosting the capital structure while enhancing its growth profile and tax efficiency.Kimco revealed transaction activities for first-quarter 2018. The company disclosed dispositions of 21 shopping centers, spanning 2.3 million square feet, for a total $219.5 million. Of this, the company’s share included $210.2 million. A portfolio of five properties in the St. Louis market was disposed of for $49.5 million. Along with that, five-property portfolio, located in Florida and Georgia, was sold for $72.7 million.However, the retail real estate market continued to bear the brunt as mall traffic continues to suffer amid a rapid shift in customers’ shopping preference through online channels, resulting in an increasing number of retailers joining the dot-com bandwagon. These made retailers reconsider their footprint and eventually opt for store closures in recent years, while others unable to cope with competition, are filing for bankruptcies.These emerged as serious concerns for retail REITs as it is limiting demand for the retail real estate space considerably. Moreover, the choppy retail real estate market situation is said to have led to tenants demanding substantial lease concessions, which mall landlords find unjustified.Although retail REITs like Kimco are actively enhancing omni-channel capabilities and heavily investing in redevelopment to draw customers, it may take a while for these efforts to offset the dent created in the operating results.Furthermore, as part of its portfolio-upgrade strategy, Kimco is aggressively disposing of non-core assets. Also, the company expects to be a net seller of properties in 2018. While such efforts are encouraging for the long term, the earnings dilution, led by high-disposition activity, cannot be averted in the near term. Therefore, these moves are expected to hurt Kimco’s growth momentum in the to-be-reported quarter.Amid these, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $298.4 million for the quarter under review, reflecting projected growth of 3.1% from the year-ago period.Kimco’s activities during the quarter could not gain adequate analyst confidence. Consequently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for FFO per share of 36 cents for the first quarter remained unchanged over the past month. The figure also witnessed a decline of 2.7% from the prior-year quarter.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Kimco will likely beat FFO estimates this time around. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen. However, that is not the case here as you will see below.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: Kimco has an Earnings ESP of -0.05%, representing the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Zacks Rank: Kimco has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) which further decreases the predictive power of ESP.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are a few stocks in the REIT sector that you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to report a positive surprise this quarter:PS Business Parks, Inc.

956,KIM,"Taubman Centers Inc. (TCO  -  Free Report), a retail real estate investment trust (REIT), has been in limelight after a Bloomberg report revealed that Elliott Management’s Paul Singer is in preliminary talks with the company to go private.  Shares of Taubman Centers traded high after the news surfaced yesterday, ascending 1.3% to $53.80 at market close.The article, which cited people familiar with the matter, reported that after accumulating considerable stake in the company, this New York-domiciled hedge fund is advocating strategy changes in the shopping mall giant that includes disposing the company.In addition to this, the above-mentioned activist fund has less than 5% interest in Taubman Centers. Hence, it can avoid regulator disclosure obligations.This is not the first time that a shareholder, with significant interest in the company, has attempted to garner support and target the mall owner. Earlier this year, Land & Buildings Investment Management had attempted to oust two Taubman Centers’ board members in a proxy fight. The activist fund, run by Jonathan Litt, also suggested that the retail REIT should consider cost-cutting strategies as well as spin-off part or whole of the company.Nevertheless, Litt failed to take over the reins of the company and lost the proxy fight against Taubman’s lead director Myron E. Ullman III, as well as chairman and chief executive officer — Robert Taubman. On Nov 9, the company announced the appointment of two new independent directors and made changes in its corporate governance.Similarly, Brookfield Property Partners , which currently owns 34% stake in GGP Inc. (GGP  -  Free Report), offered $14.8 billion to take the company private. Brookfield will reportedly pay $23 per share to acquire the remaining 66% stake in GGP.

This has resulted in widespread store closures and bankruptcy filing by the owners. These challenging times have encouraged acquirers to take retail REITs private at favorable terms.Shares of Taubman Centers have underperformed the industry it belongs to, year to date.

957,KIM,"Kimco Realty Corp.(KIM  -  Free Report) announced the ground breaking at The Boulevard, the company’s signature series $186-million redevelopment project that will replace the Hylan Plaza shopping center. Encouragingly, this grocery-anchored redevelopment in Staten Island, NY, has grabbed much attention and is already 80% preleased to a number of well-known national and regional brands.Retailers such as ShopRite, Alamo Drafthouse, Marshalls, Ulta, PetSmart and LA Fitness have signed leases with Kimco to expand their footprint in the Staten Island market. In fact, ShopRite, a regional grocer, will relocate from a nearby location to a 68,000-square-foot store at The Boulevard. Alamo Drafthouse will also open one of its first cinemas in Staten Island, spanning 46,000 square feet of space.Slated to open in early 2020, this multi-level man-street format project will span around 460,000 square feet of space. Upon completion, the ground level will offer retail shops, restaurants and outdoor dining, while the second level is set to house anchor tenants as well as entertainment provisions.   Notably, this open-air center, located along the major commercial corridor of Hylan Boulevard, is well connected to the entire island. Located in New York City’s wealthiest neighboring market, Staten Island’s demography consists of high-income consumers. Per management, with solid preleasing and a big box tenant focus, The Boulevard will register organic growth and boost shareholders’ value. In addition, the company owns five properties, aggregating one million square feet of space, in the Staten Island market. It had previously revamped more than 560,000 square feet of retail space in the island. The redevelopment at The Boulevard will further fortify its position in the area and enhance the company’s growth profile as well.Furthermore, the redevelopment is in line with Kimco’s 2020 Vision, which envisages the ownership of premium assets in core markets in the United States and a reduction in its joint-venture portfolio.However, year to date, amid the choppy retail real estate environment, shares of Kimco have underperformed the industry it belongs to.

958,KIM,"Kimco Realty Corp. (KIM  -  Free Report) announced that it will break ground on the second phase of Dania Pointe on Jul 12. Encouragingly, this mixed-use development project in Southern Broward County, FL, has grabbed much attention and the initial 325,000 square feet of space is already 93% leased.Notably, the project on 102 acres of land is situated just next to I-95 and will serve as the central location for residents going north and south on I-95. Moreover, it is situated less than 10 minutes from the Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport and Port Everglades.The strategic location of the project has likely enabled the company to rope well-known tenants like TJ Maxx, Ulta Beauty (ULTA  -  Free Report), Five Below (FIVE  -  Free Report), YouFit, Starbucks (SBUX  -  Free Report) and Verizon, among others in its first phase, that is scheduled to open in August.  The second phase of Dania Pointe will take place in multiple stages. Per management, strong demand for retail space in the first phase has encouraged the company to proceed with the second phase. The second phase will add 300,000 square feet of retail space that is already 50% pre-leased, as well as another 125,000-square-foot area which will be included later.Further, management announced that it will break ground on the first 300 apartments at Dania Pointe this summer. Also, the site has received approval for 500,000 square feet of office space. This could mark the first office space and will likely stir interest from Class A office tenants.Notably, healthy leasing activity for retail space in the development is in stark contrast to the lackluster retail environment prevailing in the United States. Importantly, the predominance of e-retailers over brick-and-mortar sales has emerged as a serious concern for retail REITs. In fact, a number of retail landlords have been affected due to online channels increasingly gaining popularity. This has also resulted in widespread store closures and bankruptcy filing by the retailers.Hence, positive response for retail space in the development gives us confidence that the site will enjoy high occupancy. Moreover, open-air retail centers have performed better than enclosed malls.Although Kimco owns premium properties in high-growth areas, it is not completely immune to the wrath of rising online sales, store closures and tenant bankruptcy.Kimco currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

959,KIM,"Kimco Realty Corp. (KIM  -  Free Report) has provided an update of its Q2 transaction activity and reported that it has sold 17 shopping centers, aggregating 2.7 million square feet of space, in the quarter. With these dispositions, the company’s second-quarter sales volume has surpassed $330 million and for the first half of the year, the same aggregated $556 million. This retail REIT now remains on track to meet its full-year disposition target of $700-$900 million.Specifically, the 17 shopping centers were sold off for $334.0 million, of which Kimco’s share of dispositions amounted to $319.3 million. The bunch of properties that were sold off included a 368,000-square-foot property in Springfield, MO — Primrose Marketplace — that was sold for $51.8 million, a 356,000-square-foot property in Chula Vista, CA — Broadway Plaza — for $58.5 million as well as a 269,000-square-foot center in Downers Grove, IL — Downers Park Plaza — for $26.7 million. The company also disposed a 145,000- square-foot property in Hoover, AL — The Grove — for $21.0 million which marked its exit from the state of Alabama.The company witnessed solid demand for open-air shopping centers and the Q2 property sales’ blended cap rate came in line with its expected range of 7.5-8%.Notably, mall traffic continues to suffer from the rapid shift in customers' shopping preference through online channels, resulting in store closures and retailers bankruptcies. These have cast a pall on retail REITs like Simon Property Group Inc. (SPG  -  Free Report), GGP Inc. (GGP  -  Free Report), Kimco Realty, Macerich Company (MAC  -  Free Report) and others, and their share prices have suffered in the past 12 months.However, Kimco has been countering the challenges and the company is on track with its 2020 Vision that envisages the ownership of high-quality assets, concentrated in major metro markets which offer several growth levers. Particularly, the company is aimed at improving its portfolio mix and experiencing decent demand from high-growth category retailers, including off-price and home improvement.In fact, amid transformation in the retail landscape, Kimco remains well poised to navigate through mall traffic blues, with focus on service and experiential tenants, and omni-channel players who generate 56% and 39% of annual base rent, respectively. Moreover, the company is aiming to expand its small shops portfolio. These shops basically comprise service-based industries, such as restaurants, salons and spas, personal fitness and medical practices. The shops enjoy frequent customer traffic and are Internet resistant. Amid limited new supply and favorable demographics, this diversification is likely to help Kimco limit its operating and leasing risks.However, in connection to its strategic efforts, Kimco is making significant disposition of the company’s assets. It disposed 38 shopping centers and four land parcels, aggregating 5 million square feet of space year-to-date for $556.1 million, of which, the company’s share of the sales price was $531.8 million. While such efforts are encouraging for the long term, the dilutive effect on earnings from high disposition activity cannot be averted in the near term.Kimco currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

960,KIM,"DDR Corp. (DDR  -  Free Report) recently completed the previously-announced spin-off of a portfolio of 48 properties into a new public company — Retail Value Inc. (“RVI”).RVI will now begin regular-way trading on the NYSE under the ticker symbol of RVI. Its portfolio consists of 36 continental U.S. assets and DDR’s entire Puerto Rico portfolio of 12 assets. Per the press release of RVI, the company has a gross book value of nearly $2.8 billion as of Mar 31, 2018.  DDR shareholders, holding 10 common shares of DDR at the close of business on Jun 26, received one RVI common share. However, since fractional shares of RVI were not distributed, DDR common shareholders will receive cash in lieu of any such fractional shares that would be entitled to receive from the distribution.RVI will be managed by DDR executives to capitalize on maximum cost efficiencies. Further, the company will be managed to dispose its properties. Nonetheless, the newly-formed company will have a separate board of directors.   The spin-off will transform DDR’s portfolio and offer significant re-leasing opportunities that will accelerate net operating income (NOI) growth. The company’s trimmed portfolio will no longer have exposure to Puerto Rico. This will enable DDR to maintain scale of operations and focus on core assets in the United States.Per DDR management, the spin-off of RVI will benefit shareholders who can realize higher value through RVI’s operations and disposition. Also, redevelopment, same-store NOI growth and higher investment opportunities will provide additional value for shareholders.Notably, the split-up is seen as a business strategy to create two companies with distinct strategies. DDR now owns 210 properties exhibiting top-tier demographics, and offering maximum scope for growth and redevelopment. On the other hand, Retail Value is expected to liquidate its entire portfolio within two to three years in order to realize the private market values for the company’s properties which are currently discounted by public markets.Such significant measures by the company demonstrate its priority to enhance portfolio mix and are accretive for long-term growth as well. However, the predominance of e-retailers over brick-and-mortar sales is a serious concern for this retail REIT. In fact, a number of retail landlords, including The Macerich Company (MAC  -  Free Report), Kimco Realty Corporation (KIM  -  Free Report) and Taubman Centers (TCO  -  Free Report), have been affected due to online retail channels increasingly gaining popularity.

It will likely open in 2019, offering more than 30,000 square feet of entertainment.

The building, previously occupied by Macy's, Inc. (M  -  Free Report), is currently under construction. The developers have planned a grand opening for Round1, which is scheduled to occur prior to this year’s holiday season.Such redevelopment efforts are aimed at diversification of properties, as well as battling mall traffics blues which have brought in bad news for retail REITs like GGP Inc.

Also, with limited retail supply, refurbishment of existing properties is gaining traction.Retail REITs are now avoiding dependence on apparel and accessories, and rather expanding their dining options, opening movie theaters and fitness centers, as well as offering recreational facilities, in particular.Such efforts are expected to bring the sparkle back in the sector and with the recent tax overhaul likely to benefit wages, consumer confidence and consumption levels, demand for prime properties are anticipated to remain decent, moving ahead.Moreover, shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have outperformed the industry over the past three months.

962,KIM,"Simon Property Group, Inc. (SPG  -  Free Report) announced that it will expand the Happy Returns services available at its malls to several other locations. This will enable an increasing number of customers to return purchases made online at malls where Simon Guest Services is available.Notably, Happy Returns already has a significant presence in Simon’s malls. The recent agreement will see the company expanding in additional 16 centers owned by Simon Property.Using the Happy Returns platform, shoppers will be able to return online purchases made from select retailers to the Simon Guest Services desk, with an immediate credit. Hence, customers can effectively skip the lengthy return process of packing and shipping items. Moreover, refunds can be made faster.While customers can experience an easy return process, it also provides them an opportunity to find what they need at Simon Property’s retail centers.  Notably, this transaction is Simon Property’s trump card — there is a high tendency of shoppers making returns to make additional purchases from malls — thereby boosting mall footfall.Notably, with e-retail becoming the latest favorite shopping channel, traffic flow in malls has taken a backseat. In fact, with e-commerce grabbing market share from brick-and-mortar stores, retailers are now forced to reconsider their footprint and opt for store closures, while those unable to match up with competition are filing bankruptcies. Amid these, tenants are also demanding substantial lease concessions, which, however, mall landlords find unjustified. This turbulent environment has cast a pall over retail REITs like Simon Property, The Macerich Company (MAC  -  Free Report), Taubman Centers (TCO  -  Free Report) and Kimco Realty Corporation (KIM  -  Free Report) among others.Nonetheless, Simon Property is making every possible move to bridge the gap between Internet retail, and the brick and mortar stores. The company is undertaking strategic measures to help online retailers fortify their physical presence.

Moreover, DDR is now shifting its focus from deleveraging to redevelopment strategy aimed at retenanting and densification of the company’s properties.Nevertheless, this involves large scale dispositions which are anticipated to impact the company’s bottom-line performance in the near term. In addition, the choppy retail real estate environment with store closures and bankruptcies, and shift in customers’ shopping preferences toward online purchases remains a concern for this retail real estate investment trust (REIT). Rate hike adds to its woes.Notably, DDR has been trying to streamline its organizational structure, which is likely to drive the company’s long-term growth. The restructuring is aimed at raising efficiencies, achieving appropriate staffing level, centralizing key operational decision making and bringing down operating costs. This will enable the company to reduce general and administration expenses by $6 million, annually.Additionally, DDR has been following an aggressive capital-recycling program through strategic asset management, which is aimed at reducing currency and development risks, as well as aiding expansion in premium U.S. markets. Consequently, the company is divesting its non-prime and non-income producing assets, and using the proceeds for reinvestment in premium U.S. shopping centers. It has nearly completed the existing $900-million disposition program. Such initiatives are likely to pave way for top-line growth, as well as demographic improvement in the long term.Also, the deleveraging process has helped the company improve its liquidity profile and expand DDR’s unencumbered asset pool. It also helped extend the weighted average maturities of the company’s debt. In fact, its pro forma average debt maturity is 6.3 years, at present. Further, with less than 10% of total debt outstanding maturing prior to 2022, DDR remains well poised to maximize on growth scopes.In first-quarter 2018, DDR sold assets worth $365.9 million, with the company’s share being $208.7 million. Dispositions for 2017 totaled approximately $1.3 billion. While dispositions are a strategic fit for long-term growth, the near-term dilution effect of such moves is unavoidable. In fact, the company witnessed a year-over-year decline of funds from operations (FFO), primarily due to the dilutive impact of asset sales. Nonetheless, management anticipates this dilution to end in 2018.Furthermore, with e-retail taking precedence, retail REITs continue to suffer as mall traffic has taken a beating. In fact, with e-commerce gaining market share from the brick-and-mortar stores, retailers are compelled to reconsider their footprint and eventually opt for store closures, while others unable to cope with competition have been filing bankruptcies.This dreary environment has also resulted in tenants demanding substantial lease concessions, which, however, mall landlords find unjustified. As such, retail REITs like DDR, GGP Inc. (GGP  -  Free Report), Kimco Realty Corp. (KIM  -  Free Report), Macerich Company (MAC  -  Free Report) and others have been affected, and the companies’ share prices have been suffering for the past 12 months.Rise in interest rate remains another concern as this might restrict the company’s ability to refinance existing debt and increase the interest cost on new debt. This, in turn, is feared to negatively impact the company’s financial results and dividend payout.Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have outperformed the industry it belongs to in the past three months. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.DDR has gained 28.4%, while the industry has rallied 7.1%. Also, the stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 FFO per share being revised upward 2.1% in a month’s time. Note: Anything related to earnings presented in this write-up represents funds from operations (FFO) — a widely used metric to gauge the performance of REITs.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

964,KIM,"As we tread into another busy week of the current reporting cycle, a lot of activity can be noticed in the real estate investment trust (REIT) space. The Q3 earnings line-up for this week includes Digital Realty Trust, Inc. (DLR  -  Free Report), Duke Realty Corp. (DRE  -  Free Report), Kimco Realty Corporation (KIM  -  Free Report) and Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc. (MAA  -  Free Report).Improvement in the macroeconomic scenario has fueled demand amongst several asset classes in third-quarter 2017.Data-center REITs thrived amid growth in cloud computing, Internet of Things and big data, and an increasing number of companies opting for third-party IT infrastructure.As giant e-commerce chains continue to invade market share from physical retailers, greater inventory build-up and increasing focus on supply-chain efficiencies spiked demand for logistics infrastructure and warehouse facilities. This has driven the industrial real estate market’s growth during the quarter.Further, recovery in the economy and labor markets has resulted in increased manufacturing activities. This has helped warehouses and distribution centers enjoy higher occupancy and demand.    However, rising popularity of e-retail has become a key cause of concern for retail REITs. The increasing number of retailers jumping on the dot-com bandwagon is putting pressure on the top-line figure for these REITs. Subsequently, the significant drop in mall footfall has compelled a number of retailers to opt for store closures and file for bankruptcy.Residential REITs enjoyed high occupancy rates and stable rent growth in the third quarter. Let us take a look at how the following REITs are placed ahead of their quarterly releases on Oct 25.Amid escalating demand for data centers, Digital Realty’s focus on offering upgraded technology to lure clients is likely to bolster its revenue stream in the to-be-reported quarter.  In addition to this, the company is anticipated to ride on its growth curve backed by strategic acquisitions. We expect such diligent efforts to drive the company’s top line in the quarter to be reported.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter revenues of $593.2 million indicates a year-over-year increase of 8.6%.Currently, the Earnings ESP for Digital Realty is -0.26%. Although the stock’s Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) increases the predictive power of ESP, we also need to have a positive ESP to be confident of an earnings beat.

Price and EPS Surprise  Digital Realty Trust, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Digital Realty Trust, Inc. QuoteCommercial REIT Duke Realty has been putting in diligent efforts to lower its suburban office assets and turn the company into a leading domestic pure-play industrial REIT. Subsequently, in the second quarter, it sold its medical office building (MOB) portfolio for $2.8 billion. Part of the transactional proceeds will likely be reflected in the third quarter results.Amid an e-commerce boom, the company has made sound efforts to enhance its industrial portfolio. While such streamlining efforts are a strategic fit for the long term, the near-term dilutive effect cannot be bypassed. In fact, such short-term impact is expected to mar the company’s quarterly results.At present, Duke Realty has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and an Earnings ESP of -3.93%. Though the company has a favorable Zacks Rank, the negative ESP lowers chances of an earnings beat.

The company has been purchasing premium assets in key U.S. markets and carrying out joint-venture buyouts.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter revenues of $294.8 million indicates growth of around 5.6% year over year.As part of its portfolio-upgrade strategy, Kimco is aggressively disposing non-core assets. While these efforts are encouraging for the longer run, the earnings dilution led by high-disposition activity cannot be averted in the near term. Therefore, these moves are expected to hurt the company’s growth momentum in the quarter to be reported.At present, Kimco has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of 0.00%.

It has a robust presence in around 39 Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs), located in the Southeast and Southwest regions of the United States. Also, remarkable job growth in target markets is anticipated to keep demand for the company’s portfolio higher.MAA is expected to experience high occupancy and achieve stability. For the third quarter, the company projects FFO per share in the range of $1.39-$1.49 per share. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same inched up 0.7% to $1.48 over the past week.At present, MAA has an Earnings ESP of +0.95% and a Zacks Rank #3.

965,KIM,"Kimco Realty Corporation (KIM  -  Free Report) is slated to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 25, after the market closes. Both its revenues and funds from operations (FFO) per share are anticipatedto be up year over year.Last quarter, this New Hyde Park, NY-based retail real estate investment trust (REIT) reported in-line results with respect to FFO per share. The company also recorded the strongest leasing volume in the past decade.Over the trailing four quarters, Kimco beat estimates in one occasion and posted in-line results in the other three, recording an average beat of 30.9%. The graph below depicts this surprise history:Kimco Realty Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Kimco Realty Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Kimco Realty Corporation QuoteHowever, the stock has lost 23.7% year to date versus the industry's loss of 4%.Note: All EPS numbers presented here represent funds from operations (FFO) per share.Factors to Influence Q3 ResultsKimco has been taking long strides and is progressing well with its strategic 2020 Vision. The company has been purchasing premium assets in key U.S. markets and carrying out joint-venture buyouts. Its efforts included exit from Canada as well as exodus from secondary markets.In fact, in July, Kimco announced the purchase of Jantzen Beach Center for $131.8 million. This is the company’s eighth property in the Portland-Vancouver-Hillsboro MSA. The move comes as part of Kimco’s strategic 2020 Vision that envisages portfolio-quality upgrade with premium acquisitions in selective locations, financed by proceeds reaped from dispositions.Further, the company is engaged in the execution of strategic measures to boost the capital structure, and enhance its growth profile and tax efficiency.However, the increasing number of retailers jumping on the dot-com bandwagon has created pressure on the top-line figure for this REIT. A number ofretailers are filing for bankruptcy and opting for store closures, as mall traffic has been shrinking due to the soaring online purchases. Although retail REITs like Kimco are actively enhancing the omni-channel capabilities and heavily investing in redevelopment to draw customers, it may take a while for these efforts to offset the dent created in the operating results.Furthermore, as part of its portfolio upgrade strategy, Kimco is aggressively disposing non-core assets. While such efforts are encouraging for the long term, the earnings dilution led by high disposition activity cannot be averted in the near term. Therefore, these moves are expected to hurt the company’s growth momentum in the to-be-reported quarter.Kimco’s activities during the quarter could not gain adequate analyst confidence. Consequently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for funds from operations for the third quarter remained unchanged at 38 cents, over the past month.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Kimco will likely beat estimates this season. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen. However, that is not the case here as you will see below. (You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.)Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Kimco is 0.00%.Zacks Rank: Kimco currently has a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we also need to have a positive ESP to be confident of an earnings beat.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are a few stocks in the REIT space that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to report a positive surprise this time around:The Macerich Company (MAC  -  Free Report), scheduled to release earnings on Oct 30, has an Earnings ESP of +1.58% and a Zacks Rank of 3.

966,KIM,"Kimco Realty Corp. (KIM  -  Free Report) has been making strategic efforts to strengthen its small shops portfolio. It is relying on omni-channel retailing, in a bid to counter pressure from the rising online sales.Kimco, like other retail real estate investment trusts (REIT), is suffering due to shrinking mall traffic, with online purchases taking precedence. As a result, retailers, unable to counter the mounting competition, are filing for bankruptcies and opting for store closures. This has aggravated the problems of the brick-and-mortar industry that is already reeling from increase in e-commerce sales.In addition, shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have underperformed the industry, year to date. During this time frame, the company has lost 23.7%, whereas the industry recorded loss of 7.4%.Amid these challenging times, the company’s focus on Internet-resistant alternatives will likely help it limit operating and leasing risks. The company is aimed at enhancing its small-shops portfolio, which comprises service-based industries like restaurants, saloons and spas, personal fitness and medical practices. Also, these industries enjoy frequent customer traffic.Kimco has well-capitalized retailers in its tenant roster which contribute significantly to its rental revenues. Moreover, these retailers have a strong omni-channel presence that positions the company well to ride on the growth trajectory.Additionally, the company’s 2020 Vision is aligned with the aim to reposition and optimize its portfolio. Adhering to these strategic measures, Kimco is increasing ownership of premium assets in major metro markets in the United States and shedding interest in its joint-venture initiatives. The company has already exited the South America market and disposed all its Canada-based operating assets as well. These diligent efforts are anticipated to boost the company’s growth profile over the long run.The company’s Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current-year funds from operations (FFO) per share has been revised 1.3% upward to $1.53 in two months’ time.Stocks to ConsiderBetter-ranked stocks in the REIT space include Getty Realty Corporation (GTY  -  Free Report), Seritage Growth Properties  and Prologis Inc.

Shares have lost about 2.3% in the past month.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to the stock's next earnings release, or is it due for a breakthrough? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Kimco Realty Meets FFO Estimates in Q2 EarningsKimco’s second-quarter 2017 adjusted FFO came in at $0.38 per share, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The company had reported adjusted FFO of $0.37 per share a year ago.Total revenue for the quarter was $297 million, up 2% from the year-ago quarter.

Kimco share of the purchase price was $340,000. The parcel located in Augusta, GA, is adjacent to the company’s Augusta Exchange shopping center.On the other hand, its second-quarter sales aggregated $155.8 million, with Kimco’s share of sale price being $128.1 million. This involved the disposition of nine shopping centers, aggregating 892,000 square feet of space and two land parcels. With these disposals, the company wound up its business in the states of Maine and Louisiana.GuidanceKimco reaffirmed its FFO as adjusted per share outlook in the $1.50–$1.54 band.Notably, the company estimates the U.S. portfolio occupancy to be in the range of 95.8–96.2%, same-property NOI to grow 2–3%, operating property acquisitions of $300–$400 million and dispositions of $300–$400 million.Dividend UpdateKimco’s board of directors announced a quarterly cash dividend of $0.27 per share.

968,KIM,"Ushering in good news for its shareholders, Realty Income Corporation (O  -  Free Report) recently announced its 97th dividend hike since the company’s NYSE listing in 1994. The company will now pay 22 cents per share compared with the 21.95 cents paid earlier.Realty Income will pay the dividend on Jul 13 to shareholders on record as of Jul 2, 2018. The latest dividend rate marks an annualized amount of $2.64 per share versus the prior rate of $2.634 per share. Based on the company’s share price of $52.85 on Jun 19, this results in a dividend yield of around 5%, which is marginally ahead of the industry’s yield of 4.94%. This is likely to draw investors’ attention to the stock, to some extent.Admittedly, solid dividend payouts are arguably the biggest enticement for REIT investors and Realty Income remains committed to boosting shareholders’ wealth. The company enjoys a trademark on the phrase “The Monthly Dividend Company” and the July 2018 dividend payment will mark its 83 consecutive quarterly increases, as well as payment of more than $5.5 billion throughout the company’s 49-year operating history. In fact, this retail REIT has generated a compound average annual dividend growth of around 4.7% since its listing on the NYSE. Given its financial position and lower debt-to-equity ratio compared to the industry, the latest dividend rate is likely to be sustainable.Notably, dwindling mall traffic, amid shift of consumers toward online channels, store closures and bankruptcy of retailers have emerged as pressing concerns for most retail REITs, including Kimco Realty Corp. (KIM  -  Free Report), GGP Inc. (GGP  -  Free Report) and Macerich Company (MAC  -  Free Report). However, Realty Income has been able to differentiate itself by deriving 90% of its annualized retail rental revenues from tenants belonging to service, non-discretionary and low-price retail business. Such businesses are less susceptible to economic recessions and competition from Internet retailing.The company’s solid underlying real estate quality and prudent underwriting at acquisitions has helped maintain high occupancy levels consistently. In fact, since 1996, the company’s occupancy level has never been below 96%. Moreover, in first-quarter 2018, it attained the highest quarter-end occupancy in more than 10 years. Additionally, its same-store rent growth underlines limited operational volatility.Moreover, Realty Income adheres to a conservative capital structure. It has modest leverage, robust liquidity, and continued access to attractively priced equity and debt capital. In addition, it has a well-laddered debt maturity schedule.Nonetheless, the company’s substantial exposure to single-tenant assets raises risks associated with tenant default. Further, generation of notable rental revenues from assets leased to drug stores and rate hike add to its woes.Shares of Realty Income have outperformed the industry it belongs to, in the past three months. This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has gained 5.9%, while the industry reported growth of 5.5% during the same time frame. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

969,KIM,"Simon Property Group Inc. (SPG  -  Free Report) has a diversified exposure to retail assets in the United States and abroad. Further, the company’s efforts to support omni-channel retailing, portfolio-restructuring initiatives and healthy balance sheet augur well for long-term growth.However, as Simon Property is trying to counter the choppy retail real estate environment through various initiatives, these require upfront costs and thus, it is likely to limit any robust growth in the company's profit margins in the near term. Also, stiff competition from online sales and rise in interest rate pose challenges for the company.Notably, Simon Property has been active in restructuring its portfolio, and is aimed at premium acquisitions and transformative redevelopments. In fact, at the end of the first quarter, it had redevelopment and expansion projects, including the addition of new anchors, in progress at 28 properties across the United States, Canada and Asia.In May, Simon Property launched a $4+ billion of investment plan to transform its properties aimed at creating value and drive footfall at the company's properties. The transformational plans included addition of hotels, restaurants and luxury stores.Also, later in May, Simon Property announced the continuation of its plan to recapture former Sears locations across its portfolio, transforming those into retail, fitness, dining and entertainment hubs.In fact, earlier in April, Simon Property announced the company’s transformational redevelopment plans for the former Sears stores, at five major locations. The properties included in the refurbishment plan were Brea Mall (Brea, CA), Burlington Mall (Burlington, MA), Midland Park Mall (Midland, TX), Ocean County Mall (Toms River, NJ) and Ross Park Mall (Pittsburgh, PA). Enhancements to the properties included entertainment, fitness, restaurants and dining pavilions, residential, as well as new retail brands.The company has also resorted to micro-retail modeling that offers store units ranging from 20-200 square feet of space. With such a huge pipeline, the company is well poised to effectively leverage the improving spending habits of wealthier customers amid improving economy.Such initiatives are expected to draw more traffic at the company’s properties.In addition, Simon Property boasts a strong and improving balance sheet. At the end of first-quarter 2018, the company had more than $7.0 billion of liquidity. This comprised cash on hand, including its share of joint-venture cash, and available capacity under the company’s revolving credit facilities.Furthermore, solid dividend payouts are arguably the biggest enticement for REIT shareholders and Simon Property remains committed to that. The company has steadily raised its dividend, over the past years, increasing from $3.50 in 2011 to the present annualized rate of $7.80 per share.Nevertheless, with e-retail taking precedence, retail REITs continue to suffer as mall traffic has taken a beating. In fact, with e-commerce gaining market share from the brick-and-mortar stores, retailers are compelled to reconsider their footprint and eventually opt for store closures, while others unable to cope with competition have been filing bankruptcies.This tepid environment has also resulted in tenants demanding substantial lease concessions, which, however, mall landlords find unjustified. As such, retail REITs like Simon Property, GGP Inc. (GGP  -  Free Report), Kimco Realty Corp. (KIM  -  Free Report), Macerich Company (MAC  -  Free Report) and others have felt the heat, and the companies’ share prices have been suffering for the past 12 months.Further, though Simon Property is putting in every effort to enhance the value of its assets, implementation of such measures requires a decent upfront cost. This would, therefore, limit any robust growth in its near-term profit margins.Rise in interest rate remains another concern as this might restrict the company’s ability to refinance existing debt and increase the interest cost on new debt. This, in turn, is feared to negatively impact the company’s financial results and dividend payout.Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have outperformed the industry it belongs to in the past three months. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Simon Property has gained 6.2%, while the industry has rallied 4%.

970,KIM,"Mall traffic continues to suffer from the rapid shift in customers' shopping preference through online channels. In fact, with e-commerce gaining market share from brick-and-mortar stores, retailers are compelled to reconsider their footprint and eventually opt for store closures in recent years, while others unable to cope with competition have been filing bankruptcies. Such an environment has also led to tenants demanding substantial lease concessions which mall landlords find unjustified.These have cast a pall on retail REITs like Simon Property Group Inc. (SPG  -  Free Report), GGP Inc. (GGP  -  Free Report), Kimco Realty Corp. (KIM  -  Free Report), Macerich Company (MAC  -  Free Report) and others, and their share prices have suffered in the past 12 months.However, not all are equally likely to fall behind. In fact, Kimco is making every effort to unlock the embedded value of its portfolio through development and re-development initiatives. Most recently, the company has achieved more than 75% of preleasing for its $108-million Mill Station Signature Series development project. The shopping center is being constructed on the site of the previous Owings Mills Mall in Baltimore County, MD.The company is on track with its 2020 Vision that envisages the ownership of high-quality assets, concentrated in major metro markets which offer several growth levers. Particularly, the company is aimed at improving its portfolio mix and experiencing decent demand from high-growth category retailers, including off-price and home improvement.In fact, amid transformation in the retail landscape, Kimco remains well poised to navigate through mall traffic blues, with focus on service and experiential tenants and omni-channel players who generate 56% and 39% of annual base rent, respectively. Moreover, the company is aiming to expand its small shops’ portfolio. These shops basically comprise service-based industries, such as restaurants, salons and spas, personal fitness and medical practices. The shops enjoy frequent customer traffic and are Internet resistant. Amid limited new supply and favorable demographics, this diversification is likely to help Kimco limit its operating and leasing risks.Further, Kimco is engaged in the execution of strategic measures to boost its capital structure, and enhance the company’s growth profile and tax efficiency as well. The company maintains a strong liquidity profile, with $2.25-billion unsecured line of credit, and aims at growing its unencumbered asset pool which consists of 75% of its properties.However, in connection to its strategic efforts, the company is making significant disposition of its assets. The company disposed 21 shopping centers for $219.5 million in the first quarter, with its share of the sales price being $210.2 million. Furthermore, the company expects to be a net seller of properties in 2018 and projects its pro-rata share of dispositions, net of any acquisitions, to be in the range of $700-$900 million. While such efforts are encouraging for the long term, the dilutive effect on earnings from high disposition activity cannot be averted in the near term.Addition, hike in rate of interest is expected to affect the REIT’s rate-sensitive business. It would restrict the company’s ability to refinance existing debt while increasing the interest cost on new debt. This has the power to adversely impact the company’s financial results and its dividend payout as well. In addition, amid rising interest rates, the common stock buyers demand a higher dividend yield and this may negatively impact the market price of the common stock.Kimco currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

971,KIM,"Amid the challenges in the retail sector, the news of GGP Inc.’s (GGP  -  Free Report) special committee unanimously recommending Brookfield Partners’  buyout deal has been ruling the roost. The transaction, valued at $15.3 billion, will give Brookfield the remaining 64% ownership of the retail real estate investment trust (REIT). This will lead to the formation massive entity with nearly $90 billion in assets and more than $4 billion in annual net operating income.According to the latest bid, GGP shareholders can choose to receive either $23.5 in cash or one BPY unit or one share of BPR — a new REIT that will be created through the buyout.  Valuation ConcernsAlthough the cash consideration of the deal indicates a 24% premium over GGP’s closing price as on Nov 6, 2017 — the day before talks between the companies was reported — the news was not well received by the Wall Street.  Per an article by National Real Estate Investor, GGP has agreed to be bought at a cap rate of low 6% to high 5% range. This range is well above market expectations and significantly undervalues the underlying real estates owned by GGP.In fact, it raises investors’ concerns that a low acquisition offer for GGP could have a ripple effect on peer retail REITs and drag down valuations. This indicates a revised lower pricing for even the best-in-class retail centers that are already facing headwinds from e-commerce and store closures in the retail industry. Specifically, as e-commerce continues to take market share from store-based retailers, mall traffic continues to suffer. This has spiked tenant move-outs and bankruptcy filing while decreasing demand for retail real estate properties.Three LosersGiven the latest development in the retail real estate market with the GGP deal and the ongoing troubles in the retail sector, investors may consider portfolio reshuffling and discarding these stocks from the said sector.DDR Corp.

972,KIM,"For the past few years, mall traffic has been plagued with challenges thanks to the shift in shopping patterns, with e-retail taking precedence, keeping retail REITs on tenterhooks. This has shrunk demand for retail real estate space, as changing shopping patterns are compelling retailers to reconsider their footprint, and eventually opt for store closures or file bankruptcies.This has been a prevailing concern for retail REITs like Simon Property Group Inc. (SPG  -  Free Report), GGP Inc. (GGP  -  Free Report), Kimco Realty Corp. (KIM  -  Free Report), Macerich Company (MAC  -  Free Report) and others.And not all companies are equally poised to beat mall traffic blues. However among those, reputed retail REIT — Simon Property Group — has been making concerted efforts focused on overhauling its properties and increasingly adopting omni-channel strategies. These will help the company to counter the retail blues and make its shopping malls more alluring.In line with this, the company has re-launched its brand and marketing programs. Moreover, with the omni-channel strategy gaining popularity among retailers, Simon Property is initiating programs and events, as well as entering into several partnerships for upgrading services and amenities provided to its consumers. In fact, over the last five years, this retail REIT invested more than $5 billion in development projects, and further intends to invest around $1 billion annually through 2018 for development and redevelopment projects.   Simon Property has been active in restructuring its portfolio, and is aimed at premium acquisitions and transformative redevelopments. In fact, at the end of fourth–quarter 2017, the company had redevelopment and expansion projects, including the addition of new anchors, in progress at 25 properties across the United States, Canada and Asia. With such a huge pipeline, it is well poised to effectively leverage the improving spending habits of wealthier customers amid a strengthening economy.In addition, Simon Property boasts a strong and improving balance sheet. At the end of the last reported quarter, the company had around $8.0 billion of liquidity. Also, this February, Simon Property announced amendment and extension of its 3.5-billion unsecured multi-currency revolving credit facility. The newly refinanced credit facility, when combined with the existing $4.0-billion revolver, offers the company $7.5 billion of total revolving credit capacity.Furthermore, solid dividend payouts are arguably the biggest enticement for REIT shareholders and Simon Property remains committed to that. Concurrent with the fourth-quarter earnings release, the company announced a quarterly dividend of $1.95 per share, denoting an increase of 5.4% sequentially and 11.4% year over year. It has steadily raised its dividend over the past years, increasing from $3.50 in 2011 to the current annualized rate of $7.80 per share.Nevertheless, though Simon Property is putting in every effort to enhance the value of its assets, implementation of such measures requires a decent upfront cost. This would, therefore, limit any robust growth in its near-term profit margins.Additionally, rise in interest rate remains another concern as this would restrict the company’s ability to refinance existing debt and increase the interest cost on new debt. This might impact the company’s financial results and dividend payout.Simon Property has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). The stock has declined 8.7% in the past three months which is narrower than its industry’s decline of 10.9%. Over the past week, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter 2018 funds from operations (FFO) per share remained unchanged at $2.83.

973,KIM,"Pennsylvania Real Estate Investment Trust (PEI  -  Free Report) — better known as PREIT — is leaving no stone unturned to attract consumers to its shopping malls. In fact, the company recently announced the remerchandising of Dartmouth Mall with a few new retailers taking up space, which is situated in southeast Massachusetts.This comes as part of PREIT’s proactive anchor redevelopment initiative, which aims at diversifying the tenant mix, meeting demand of the shoppers and boosting sales per square foot of the retail property. With its continuous efforts, the company was successful in increasing the comp sales year over year in Dartmouth Mall by 9% to $509 per square foot for past 12 months, calculated as of January 2018.This latest efforts include the addition of the brand Newbury Comics, which focuses on music, movies and pop culture items. It is intended to open in spring and will take up 3,900 square feet of space.  Forever 21 will be occupying 11,500 square feet of retail space for its outlet. Another new tenant that is slated to open its doors this fall is Eblens, which is a fashion label in England. It will be leasing 6,000 square feet.Recently, a few retailers have also opened stores in Dartmouth Mall. Specifically, H&M opened a brand new store, spanning 23,000 square feet of space in the property. Encore, a shoe brand and Torrid, a brand specialized in fashion, have also launched their stores recently. Moreover, earlier in 2015, AMC Entertainment Holdings (AMC  -  Free Report) renovated their theaters by adding reclining seats and a bar in the mall.Joseph F. Coradino, CEO of PREIT informed, ""With a well-balanced and high performing mix of retail, dining and entertainment options for local consumers, Dartmouth Mall has become the dominant shopping hub within a 30-mile radius – with growing market share and more new additions slated.""Notably, the shrinking mall traffic, store closures and retailer bankruptcies, amid aggressive growth in online sales, have kept retail REITs, including PREIT and others like Simon Property Group, Inc. (SPG  -  Free Report) and Kimco Realty (KIM  -  Free Report), on tenterhooks. In addition, tenants are demanding substantial lease concessions, owing to a turbulent retail real estate market scenario.Nonetheless, retail REITs are countering this dreary situation and putting in every effort to enhance the productivity of the malls by revamping their properties and trying to grab attention from new and productive tenants, and disposing off the non-productive ones. While portfolio-redevelopment efforts are a strategic fit for the long term, such measures tend to drag margins in the near term.Amid the dull retail real estate environment, this Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) company underperformed its industry in the past three months.

974,KIM,"Kimco Realty (KIM  -  Free Report) has initiated a program, Pop It Up Here!, which will help retailers discover locations for pop-up shops from within its portfolio.With the increased demand for pop-up shops among consumers, retailers are trying to benefit from the growing trend. Generally, pop-up shops are meant to occupy a vacant space for a short period and that’s how retailers can test the demand for the particular product.David Jamieson, chief operating officer of Kimco Realty, thinks retailers like the idea of short-term leasing.  He further added, “Pop-up shops have become a way for retailers to test market ideas, create a customer following, or transition from clicks to bricks without the liability of a long-term lease, and we’re proud to offer a program that assists them in their journey.”Pop It Up Here!, developed by Kimco’s LABS (Leaders Advancing Business Strategy) Program, enables brands to look through the available spaces online that are pre-approved and ready to be moved in. Currently, 34 units across 13 shopping centers are available in six markets for this initiative. The markets include Denver, CO; Dallas, TX; San Francisco, CA; Phoenix, AZ; Bellevue, WA and Wilton, CT.To make its shopping malls more appealing, Kimco is leaving no stone unturned to attract consumers in its shopping malls with such initiatives.Although such revolutionary initiatives are encouraging for the company, retail landlords, including Kimco, Regency Centers Corp. (REG  -  Free Report), Simon Property Group (SPG  -  Free Report) and Taubman Centers (TCO  -  Free Report), have felt the heat due to consumers’ preferences increasingly shifting toward online retail. This has also resulted in widespread store closures and bankruptcy filing.Amid the lackluster retail environment, this Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) company has underperformed its industry in the past six months.

975,KIM,"Kimco Realty’s (KIM  -  Free Report) financials are likely to be hurt by decreasing footfall at malls amid the shift of consumers toward online channels, store closures and bankruptcy of retailers. Moreover, the dilutive impact on earnings from the sale of assets cannot be bypassed in near term. Competition from other players in the industry and rate hike pose other challenges to this retail REIT. However, Kimco’s 2020 Vision, which aims ownership of premium assets in strategic locations, will enhance its portfolio.For fourth-quarter 2017, Kimco reported adjusted funds from operations (FFO) of 38 cents per share, in line with Zacks Consensus Estimate. The company reported the same figure in the year-ago quarter as well. Kimco posted revenues from rental properties of $310.6 million in the reported quarter, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $299.0 million. The figure compared favorably with the year-ago number of $292.9 million. Moreover, the company leased more than 10 million square feet in 2017, denoting the highest leasing volume in past 10 years.Kimco is focused on simplifying its business structure and thus is making significant disposition of its assets. In fact, Kimco’s disposition activity in 2017 consisted of 25 consolidated operating properties and nine parcels, for an aggregate sales price of $352.2 million. The company expects to be a net seller of properties in 2018 and projects its pro-rata share of dispositions net of any acquisitions to be in the range of $700-$900 million. While such efforts are encouraging for the long term, the dilutive effect on earnings from high disposition activity cannot be averted in the near term.Further, though upbeat consumer confidence and an improving economy have infused optimism into the retail market, mall traffic continues to suffer amid a rapid shift in customers’ shopping preferences and patterns with online purchases growing by leaps and bounds. These have made retailers reconsider their footprint and eventually opt for store closures. Retailers that are not being able to cope with competition are filing for bankruptcies. This has emerged as a pressing concern, as the trend is curtailing demand for the retail real estate space considerably.Moreover, the rising rate of interest is likely to hurt the REIT’s rate-sensitive business. It would restrict the company’s ability to refinance existing debt while increasing the interest cost on new debt. This has the power to adversely impact the company’s financial results and its dividend payout. In addition, amid rising interest rates, the common stock buyers demand a higher dividend yield and this may negatively impact the market price of the common stock.Shares of Kimco have underperformed the industry it belongs to in the past three months. During this time frame, shares of the company declined 21.3% compared with the industry’s descend of 11%.Nevertheless, Kimco’s 2020 Vision envisages the ownership of premium assets in major metro markets in the United States as well as a reduction in the joint-venture portfolio. Its efforts included the exit from Canada and the exodus from secondary markets. Further, the company is engaged in the execution of strategic measures to boost its capital structure and enhance its growth profile and tax efficiency. These efforts are expected to drive Kimco’s bottom line over the long term.However, we expect the net effect to be negative in the near-term. Kimco currently holds a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell)Stocks Worth a LookInvestors interested in the real estate industry can consider top-ranked stocks like HFF, Inc.

976,KIM,"Retail REIT, Kimco Realty Corp. (KIM  -  Free Report) announced the groundbreaking at Dania Pointe’s Phase 1 retail part. Encouragingly, this project in Southern Broward County, FL, has grabbed much attention and its Phase 1 is already around 80% preleased to a number of national and regional retailers.Slated to open for the 2018 holiday season, Phase 1 consists of 300,000 square feet of retail space. It will enjoy presence of popular brands like TJ Maxx of The TJX Companies, Inc. (TJX  -  Free Report), Ulta Beauty, Inc. (ULTA  -  Free Report), Hobby Lobby, BrandsMart, as well as several restaurants.The move is a solid step toward the realization of the broader mixed-used project – Dania Pointe.

Also, the site is only 20 minutes from upscale communities of Weston and Plantation to the west, Fort Lauderdale and Pompano Beach to the north, and Hollywood and North Miami Beach to the south. This makes the property easily accessible to tourists and tri-county residents.Mixed-use DevelopmentsNotably, mixed-use developments have gained popularity for their solid neighborhood character, greater housing variety and density. These developments bring down the distance between housing, workplaces, retail businesses, and other amenities and destinations. Hence, such developments enable the companies to grab the attention of people, who prefer to live, work and play in the same area – a trend that drove development in several other cities in the U.S.In addition to Kimco, Regency Centers Corp. (REG  -  Free Report) is exploring the positives of mixed-use developments. The company announced a new mixed-use ground-up development – Mellody Farm – in Vernon Hills, IL, in Apr 2017.In ConclusionKimco’s premium properties in high-growth areas, presence of well-capitalized retailers in its tenant roster, investments in high-quality neighborhood and community shopping centers, and shedding of non-core assets augur well for growth.

The off-market buyout helps the company boost its portfolio with a property that enjoys an experienced tenant roster.The acquired properties — 33,000-square foot center anchored by Petco (Hewlett I) and the 20,000-square foot center anchored by Duane Reade (Hewlett II) — were separately operated. However, Regency’s acquisition will make these properties operational as a single center known as Hewlett Crossing.Advantageously located on the major retail corridor, Hewlett Crossing has premier demographics. In fact, around 70% of the tenants have been occupying space at the center for 15 years or above. Moreover, since 1955, the Hewlett Fish Market has been a tenant. Notably, the dense and wealthy population base helped the property experience such a seasoned tenant roster and raises our hopes for the continuation of robust footfall at this property over the long term.With this buyout, Regency fortified its presence in the Long Island to 14 centers, aggregating around 1.9 million-square feet of space.Over the past several quarters, a number of issues have cropped up in the retail REIT market, with consumers preferring online platforms over in-store purchases, resulting in store closures and bankruptcies. These have affected the share price of several major retail REITs, including The Macerich Company (MAC  -  Free Report), Taubman Centers (TCO  -  Free Report) and Kimco Realty Corporation (KIM  -  Free Report).Amid these, Regency’s focus on flourishing properties with highly productive grocers, restaurants, service providers, and best-in-class retailers seems a strategic fit. Its centers are usually necessity driven and steer a dependable traffic.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time. It’s a once-in-a-generation opportunity to invest in pure genius.Click for details >>

981,KIM,"Regency Centers Corporation (REG  -  Free Report) announced that it has purchased Scripps Ranch Marketplace — a shopping center — in San Diego. This acquisition is anticipated to fortify the company’s presence in the San Diego market.This purchase underpins Regency’s focus on grocery-anchored assets in thriving sub markets. The property, spanning 132,000 square feet of space, is anchored by supermarket chain Vons, CVS, Starbucks as well as other regional operators.The shopping center is located within Scripps Ranch — an affluent master planned community in San Diego — which demonstrates impressive demographics and solid daytime population. Further, the property’s proximity to Interstate 15, off Scripps Poway Parkway, that experiences heavy traffic, makes it easily accessible.    In addition, this property is a long-term asset for the company and will likely witness high footfall as it is situated in a vibrant and growing retail corridor. Management aims to enhance this center and its merchandising mix to upgrade the community destination.The above-mentioned acquisition also complements Regency’s two existing centers in the locality — 4S Commons Town Center and Twin Peaks Plaza in Poway. In fact, it expands the company’s presence in the San Diego market with more than two million square feet of community-serving retail space. Some other notable Regency shopping centers in San Diego include Costa Verde Center, Balboa Mesa Shopping Center, Friars Mission Center and The HUB Hillcrest Market.   Amid the challenging retail environment, Regency is focused on building a premium portfolio of grocery-anchored shopping centers through tenant-driven acquisitions. Such centers are usually necessity driven and attract dependable traffic. Hence this strategy is appropriate for Regency’s growth.Particularly, of late, mall traffic has been adversely affected due to the rapid shift in consumers’ shopping preferences toward online channels. With a number of retailers joining the dot-com bandwagon or reconsidering their footprint and opting for store closures, retail landlords, including The Macerich Company (MAC  -  Free Report), Taubman Centers (TCO  -  Free Report) and Kimco Realty Corporation (KIM  -  Free Report), have been facing challenging times.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have underperformed the industry over the past year.

982,KIM,"Regency Centers Corporation’s (REG  -  Free Report) focus on building a premium portfolio of grocery-anchored shopping centers, aimed at driving dependable traffic, bodes well. However, the company’s growing development and redevelopment pipeline exposes it to various risks such as rising construction costs, entitlement delays and lease-ups.  Specifically, this retail real estate investment trust (REIT) has 80% of its properties anchored by leading grocers, which augurs well for steady cash flows and long-term growth. Moreover, long-term leases with its tenants protect the company from short-term market swings.Amid these, Regency is also focusing on the acquisition of grocery-anchored properties. Its merger with Equity One created a high-quality portfolio of more than 400 properties — mainly grocery anchored. Moreover, strategic acquisitions will strengthen its foothold in thriving sub-markets.A healthy balance sheet also enables Regency to pursue its growth plans. Importantly, as of Dec 31, 2017, 85.7% of the company’s wholly owned real estate assets were unencumbered. This will enable the company to enjoy favorable access to secured and unsecured debt markets. Notably, this March, the company amended a $1.25-billion unsecured revolving credit facility. This will help drive operational efficiency and financial flexibility.However, the retail apocalypse has considerably curbed demand for retail real estate space in the United States. Mall traffic has been affected and retail landlords, including Macerich Company (MAC  -  Free Report), Taubman Centers (TCO  -  Free Report) and Kimco Realty Corporation (KIM  -  Free Report), are suffering due to consumers’ preferences increasingly shifting toward online retail. This has resulted in widespread store closures and bankruptcy filing by the retailers. In fact, deeper penetration of online retailers into the grocery business has emerged as a pressing concern for the company.As the company continues to counter mall traffic blues, Regency is increasingly investing in development and redevelopment projects. It had 19 properties, with estimated cost of $454 million in development or redevelopment, at the end of the first quarter. With a huge outlay for refurbishments, growth in profit margins of the company in the near term will likely remain limited.Regency has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

983,KIM,"Retail REIT Kimco Realty Corp. (KIM  -  Free Report) is experiencing decent demand for its Mill Station Signature Series Development project. In fact, recently, the company announced addition of a number of retailers to its tenant lineup at this project, including Lowe’s Home Improvement (LOW  -  Free Report), Marshalls, TJX’s new HomeSense concept, Burlington and Five Below (FIVE  -  Free Report).With these retailers joining Costco and AMC Theatre in the tenant roster, the company has been able to achieve more than 75% of preleasing for this $108-million Signature Series development project. The shopping center is being constructed on the site of the previous Owings Mills Mall in Baltimore County, MD. While Costco is slated to open later this year, the other retailers are likely to open their stores throughout the first half of 2019.Spanning around 620,000-square-foot of space, the Mill Station development will have a dynamic line-up of up to 30 retailers and restaurants. It will have retail outlets and offices interconnected through an extensive walkway network.The property is likely to command more attention since it is easily accessible, backed by its favorable positioning directly off I-795 and next to the Owings Mills Station stop on Baltimore’s Metro SubwayLink. The site also boasts favorable demography, with a population of 167,000 in the surrounding five-mile area, having average household income of around $95,000. As such, mall traffic is likely to be high and the property is expected to witness decent demand from tenants.Admittedly, a rapid shift in customers' shopping preferences to online channels has jeopardized traffic flow in malls. In fact, with e-commerce grabbing market share from brick-and-mortar stores, retailers are compelled to reconsider their footprint and eventually opt for store closures, while others unable to cope with competition have been filing bankruptcies.Amid these, tenants are also demanding substantial lease concessions, which, however, mall landlords find unjustified. Such an environment has cast a pall over retail REITs including Simon Property Group Inc. (SPG  -  Free Report), GGP Inc. (GGP  -  Free Report), Kimco Realty and others, and the companies’ share prices have been suffering for the past 12 months.Nevertheless, Kimco is countering the tepid scenario, and the company’s 2020 Vision envisages the ownership of premium assets in major metro markets in the United States as well as a reduction of its non-core portfolio. Particularly, the company is aimed at improving its portfolio mix with development and redevelopment efforts, and experiencing decent demand from high-growth category retailers, including off-price and home improvement.However, in line with its 2020 vision, the company is making substantial dispositions. While such efforts are encouraging for the long term, the dilutive effect on earnings from high disposition activity cannot be averted in the near term.Kimco currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

With premium properties in high-income and high-growth areas, Kimco is well poised for growth.However, we note that mall traffic continues to decline owing to a change in shopping patterns. Online purchases have taken precedence over in-store purchase. These have made retailers reconsider their footprint and eventually opt for store closures. Further, retailers not being able to cope with competition are filing bankruptcies.

The acquisition is in line with the retail real estate investment trust (REIT), which is seeking expansion in the market.The shopping center, spanning across 150,000 square feet of space, is located in the premium trade area of the Roosevelt neighborhood, which displays solid demographics. In fact, the shopping center is fully leased and is anchored by Whole Food.Per management, the acquisition is a strategic fit for the company as it is aimed at adding premium shopping centers in its urban portfolio on the back of acquisitions and developments. It anticipates that the property will draw decent footfall due to its proximity to the University of Washington and the neighboring communities.    Notably, with this buyout, the company is fortifying its presence in the market where it currently offers 1.5 million square feet of community serving retail options. In fact, Roosevelt Square marks the company’s 11th property in the market. Other existing properties include Broadway Market, Grand Ridge Plaza, Klahanie Shopping Center and Sammamish Highlands.Of late, mall traffic has been adversely affected due to the rapid shift in consumers’ shopping preferences toward online channels.

986,KIM,"DDR Corp. (DDR  -  Free Report) recently experienced a rating downgrade by Moody's Investors Service. Specifically, the rating of its senior unsecured debt has been downgraded by a notch to Baa3 from Baa2. However, the rating outlook has been revised from negative to stable.The downgrade comes after DDR’s decision to spin-off a portfolio of 50 sellable assets into a separate public-traded real estate investment trust (REIT) — Retail Value Trust (“RVT”). (Read more: DDR to Spin-Off Sellable Properties Into a New Company)While this portfolio repositioning strategy eliminates the company’s exposure to Puerto Rico and other U.S. properties with low growth potential, it leaves DDR with a less sustainable portfolio as compared to other shopping center REITs.   Per the rating agency, DDR’s remaining portfolio will be more prone to leasing pressure and tenant bankruptcies. Further, its portfolio might face challenges in markets where the company does not have a sturdy presence.In addition, retail landlords, including DDR, The Macerich Company (MAC  -  Free Report), Kimco Realty Corporation (KIM  -  Free Report) and Taubman Centers (TCO  -  Free Report), have been witnessing decline in store sales as e-commerce continues to transform the retail landscape. This has resulted in a number of store closures and bankruptcy filing by retailers. The rating agency predicted that this choppy retail environment will impact DDR’s leasing and occupancy in the upcoming 12-18 months. Also, the company might increase rent concessions and relax co-tenancy clauses in a bid to improve occupancy. This is expected to mar DDR’s operating performance, per Moody’s.  Per the rating agency, the downgrade also reflects DDR’s unclear long-term growth strategy.    The revised rating outlook reflects volatility in operating results stemming from retail headwinds. However, it also acknowledges DDR’s efforts to maintain a conservative capital structure supported by decent net debt/ EBITDA ratios. In fact, the Baa3 senior unsecured rating also reflects fixed charge coverage in the mid 2x band. The company also has solid liquidity with a well-laddered debt profile. DDR has a $1-billion unsecured revolver and a large pool of unencumbered assets. Moody’s expects that these factors will reduce operating volatility for the next two years.Rating upgrades and downgrades are important for investors because these indicate a company’s creditworthiness in the market. Such movements denote the company’s accessibility to capital and determine borrowing costs on debts. Notably, the downgrade will affect DDR’s securities worth $3.3 billion.DDR currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Shares of the company have underperformed its industry year to date.

987,KIM,"In the final leg of its disposition program, DDR Corp. (DDR  -  Free Report) announced the decision of the company’s board of directors to spin-off a portfolio of 50 sellable assets into a separate public-traded real estate investment trust (REIT) — Retail Value Trust (“RVT”).The split-up is seen as a business strategy to create two separate companies with distinct strategies. Post spin-off, DDR will own 236 properties exhibiting top-tier demographics and offering maximum scope for growth and redevelopment. On the other hand, RVT is expected to liquidate its entire portfolio within two to three years in order to realize the private market values for the company’s properties that are currently discounted by the public markets.The spin-off is likely to close in mid 2018, after which RVT will hold a portfolio of 38 continental U.S. assets and the entire Puerto Rico portfolio of 12 assets, valued at $3 billion as of Sep 30, 2017. These continental U.S. properties have a strong liquidity as compared to the assets worth $1 billion sold by DDR in the year so far.The Spin Co will be tied to a committed mortgage loan of $1.35 billion, the proceeds of which will be used to repay DDR’s debt. This will help DDR achieve its goal of Net Debt/Adjusted EBITDA of 6x for 2018 and strengthen the company’s balance sheet as well.The spin-off will transform DDR’s portfolio and contain significant re-leasing opportunities that will accelerate growth in net operating income (NOI). Its trimmed portfolio will no longer have exposure to Puerto Rico. This will enable DDR to maintain scale of operations and focus on core assets in the United States.RVT will be externally managed by DDR to capitalize on maximum cost efficiencies. DDR shareholders will receive shares of RVT through a taxable pro rata stock distribution. Further, no changes will be made to the company’s quarterly dividend prior to the RVT spinoff.   Such significant measures by the company demonstrate its priority to enhance portfolio mix and are accretive for long-term growth. However, growth of e-retailers at the expense of brick-and-mortar sales is a serious concern for this retail REIT. In fact, many retail landlords, including The Macerich Company (MAC  -  Free Report), Kimco Realty Corporation (KIM  -  Free Report) and Taubman Centers (TCO  -  Free Report), have been adversely affected due to consumers’ preferences increasingly shifting toward online retail. This has also resulted in widespread store closures and bankruptcy filing by the retailers.Amid the lackluster retail environment, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company has underperformed its industry year to date.

988,KIM,"DDR Corp (DDR  -  Free Report) has been putting in strategic efforts to revamp its portfolio through an aggressive capital-recycling program. However, this involves large scale dispositions which are anticipated to impact the company’s bottom-line performance in the near term.Specifically, this retail real estate investment trust (REIT) intends reducing currency and development risks, as well as expanding its presence in upscale U.S. markets through strategic asset management. Hence, the company is shedding non-core and non-income producing assets, and reinvesting the proceeds in premium U.S. shopping centers.Apart from portfolio restructuring, DDR is also enhancing its capital structure and improving liquidity. In September, the company refinanced two revolving credit facilities that expanded its line of credit and extended maturities. In fact, it has a well-laddered debt maturity profile with no significant unsecured debt maturing until 2021.DDR remains focused on its deleveraging process as it continues to sell assets. Notably, the company sold $392 million of assets in the third quarter, in addition to the $237 million in the second quarter. Further, the company sold an additional $190 million shortly after the end of the recently-reported quarter.While these dispositions are likely to enhance its portfolio mix, the near-term dilution effect of such moves is unavoidable.  In fact, the dilutive impact of deleveraging generated through sale of assets was primarily responsible for the decline in third-quarter 2017 funds from operations (FFO) from the prior-year quarter.Moreover, the retail apocalypse has considerably curbed demand for the retail real estate space in the United States. Mall traffic has been adversely affected and retail landlords, including DDR, Macerich Company (MAC  -  Free Report), Taubman Centers (TCO  -  Free Report) and Kimco Realty Corporation (KIM  -  Free Report), are suffering due to consumers’ preferences increasingly shifting toward online retail.

In fact, Brookfield is considering a new proposal for the deal.   The report also mentioned that neither companies intend to make any further announcements in the matter until a definitive deal is agreed upon.The alliance would result in one of the largest publicly-traded real estate companies of the world. In fact, according to a Reuters article, which cited Brookfield, this buyout will create a conglomerate with ownership interest in global real estate assets worth around $100 billion and an annual net operating income (“NOI”) of around $5 billion.Per Brookfield, the above-mentioned acquisition will offer growth opportunities to GGP by transforming and repurposing its retail assets.Of late, mall traffic has been adversely affected and retail landlords, including Regency Centers Corporation (REG  -  Free Report), Taubman Centers (TCO  -  Free Report) and Kimco Realty Corporation (KIM  -  Free Report), have felt the heat due to consumers’ preferences increasingly shifting toward online retail.

The building, previously occupied by Macy's, Inc. (M  -  Free Report), is currently under construction. The developers have planned a grand opening for Round1, which is scheduled to occur prior to the holiday season of 2018.Notably, the growing popularity of Round1 is expected to increase the mall traffic and attract visitors from other regions too. The multi-entertainment activity complex was initiated in 1980 and now has over 100 locations in Japan and about 21 in the United States. It offers bowling, an arcade, karaoke, billiards, food and drinks under one roof.Stephen Lebovitz, president & CEO of CBL Properties informed, “CBL has made excellent progress on its redevelopment program over the last several months, with demand from many exciting retailers, entertainment users, and restaurant operators. We are thrilled to move forward with this phase of redevelopment and welcome this world-class entertainment operator to Jefferson Mall.”Of late, mall traffic has been adversely affected due to the rapid shift in consumers’ shopping preferences toward online channels. With a number of retailers jumping on the dot-com bandwagon and reconsidering their footprints and opting for store closures, retail landlords, including CBL Properties, The Macerich Company (MAC  -  Free Report) and Kimco Realty Corporation (KIM  -  Free Report), have been facing challenging times.However, retail real estate investment trust’s (REIT) are fighting back and avoiding heavy dependence on apparel and accessories. Instead, the REITs are expanding dining options, opening movie theaters, offering recreational facilities and opening fitness centers in particular, to drive more footfall at their properties.

991,KIM,"Retail REITs are not in the pink of health, as mall traffic continues to suffer due to the rapid shift in customers' shopping preferences, with e-retail taking precedence. In fact, with e-commerce gaining market share from the brick-and-mortar stores, retailers are compelled to reconsider their footprint and eventually opt for store closures, while others unable to cope with competition have been filing bankruptcies.This environment has also resulted in tenants demanding substantial lease concessions, which, however, mall landlords find unjustified. As such, retail REITs like Simon Property Group Inc. (SPG  -  Free Report), GGP Inc. (GGP  -  Free Report), Kimco Realty Corp.

These will help the company counter the retail blues and make its shopping malls more alluring.In April, Simon Property announced the company’s transformational redevelopment plans for the former Sears stores, at five major locations. This move will help the retail REIT draw more traffic to these malls in order to benefit the existing retailers.The properties included in the refurbishment plan are Brea Mall (Brea, CA), Burlington Mall (Burlington, MA), Midland Park Mall (Midland, TX), Ocean County Mall (Toms River, NJ), and Ross Park Mall (Pittsburgh, PA). Enhancements to the properties include entertainment, fitness, restaurants and dining pavilions, residential, hotel and office, as well as new retail brands.  In fact, over the past five years, this retail REIT invested more than $5 billion in development projects, and further intends to invest substantially for development and redevelopment projects. Such initiatives are expected to draw more traffic at the company’s properties.Moreover, at the end of first-quarter 2018, Simon Property had redevelopment and expansion projects, including the addition of new anchors, in progress at 28 properties across the United States, Canada and Asia. The company has also resorted to micro-retail modeling that offers store units ranging from 20-200 square feet of space. With such a huge pipeline, the company is poised to effectively leverage the improving spending habits of wealthier customers amid improving economy.Also, total portfolio net operating income growth for first-quarter 2018 came in at 4.8%. This reflected increase in operating income from comparable properties, as well as additions from new development, redevelopment, expansion and acquisitions. As such, the company managed to surpass expectations in the first quarter and also raised its outlook for 2018.In addition, Simon Property boasts a strong and improving balance sheet. At the end of first-quarter 2018, the company had more than $7.0 billion of liquidity. This comprised cash on hand, including its share of joint-venture cash, and available capacity under the company’s revolving credit facilities.Furthermore, solid dividend payouts are arguably the biggest enticement for REIT shareholders and Simon Property remains committed to that. The company has steadily raised its dividend over the past years, increasing from $3.50 in 2011 to the present annualized rate of $7.80 per share.Nevertheless, though Simon Property is putting in every effort to enhance the value of its assets, implementation of such measures requires a decent upfront cost. This would, therefore, limit any robust growth in its near-term profit margins.Additionally, rise in interest rate remains another concern as this might restrict the company’s ability to refinance existing debt and increase the interest cost on new debt. This might impact the company’s financial results and dividend payout.Simon Property has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). The stock has gained 3.8% in a month’s time, while the industry rallied 2.4%. Also, the stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 funds from operations (FFO) per share being revised marginally upward in a month’s time.

992,KIM,"With the holiday season in full swing, Simon Property Group (SPG  -  Free Report) is leaving no stone unturned to attract consumer to its shopping malls. In its latest efforts to counter the e-retail pressure, this mall giant launched “Santa Messenger Bot” which will link retail experience with the digital world through Facebook Messenger.The Santa Bot add-on on Facebook Messenger will guide shoppers to purchase gifts by locating an appropriate retail outlet based on their interests and preferences. The company has also organized a series of interesting activities and programs at selective malls. It is set to roll out an augmented reality game — Santa’s Helpers — on a new Simon Family app, which will require gamers to help Santa get ready for Christmas.For added consumer convenience, Simon Property has arranged the “Santa by Appointment” option through which shoppers can make reservations online. Also, the ‘Fast Pass’ option will help customers book an exclusive two-hour window to meet Santa. Further, Simon Properties Malls will be buzzing with programs like “I Saw Santa,” “Pet Photo Night” and “Caring Santa.”Given the ability of people to spend more during the holiday season, such recent efforts to enhance shopping experience will likely drive mall traffic and boost sales.Notably, in a bid to beat the retail blues, Simon Property is focused on offering a comprehensive digital experience to its customers. In August, it rolled out the industry’s first concierge bot service, available on Facebook Messenger, to guide customers at its 208 malls. This chatbox seeks to offer real-time information about Simon’s malls, including store locations, hours of operation, promotions, and other amenities offered in the mall.To make its shopping malls more appealing, the company is overhauling its properties and increasingly adopting omni-channel strategies. It has also resorted to micro-retail modeling that offers store units ranging from 20-200 square feet of space. Further, amid rising popularity of Internet purchases, Simon’s efforts to introduce online brands in the showroom retail space bode well.Although such revolutionary initiatives are encouraging for the company, retail landlords, including Simon Property, Regency Centers Corp. (REG  -  Free Report), Kimco Realty Corp. (KIM  -  Free Report) and Taubman Centers (TCO  -  Free Report), have felt the heat due to consumers’ preferences increasingly shifting toward online retail. This has also resulted in widespread store closures and bankruptcy filing by the owners.Amid the lackluster retail environment, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company has underperformed its industry year to date. Shares of Simon have descended 8.4%, as compared to the industry’s gain of 9.8%.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Zacks' Hidden TradesWhile we share many recommendations and ideas with the public, certain moves are hidden from everyone but selected members of our portfolio services.

Total operating revenues of around $190.2 million for the quarter also outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $169.5 million.On a year-over-year basis, the company’s FFO per share climbed from 60 cents per share recorded in the year-earlier quarter, while total operating revenues increased 14.7% year over year. The company also raised its guidance for 2018.During the reported quarter, Liberty Property accomplished lease deals for 6.3 million square feet of space.

The company is shifting its focus toward industrial properties due to favorable demand supply conditions. Its premium quality industrial properties, situated at key locations, are likely to drive long-term growth by leveraging on the e-commerce boom and supply-chain strategy transformations. Moreover, Liberty Property plans to fund investments in industrial assets through proceeds from dispositions of office properties.

994,KIM,"Kimco Realty (KIM  -  Free Report) is set to transform the Owings Mills Mall into an open-air shopping center, Mill Station. The move is expected to enhance the shopping experience of local people. The $108-million project will break ground in early 2018 and is expected open in early 2019.The company’s signature series redevelopment project will have a dynamic line-up of nearly 30 national, regional and local brands, offering a variety of dining and retail options. In fact, Costco will be the anchor tenant of the 575,000 square foot shopping center. It is set to open a warehouse club spanning 148,000 square feet at the center. Further, this outlet will be the sole Costco outlet within a 15-mile radius of the Mill Station.Other tenants are expected to be announced after Kimco signs leases with other retailers to take over an additional 350,000 square feet of the renovated center. The existing AMC Theatre will also be revamped under the renovation plan. The outdoor shopping destination will offer a large parking lot and pedestrian-friendly walkways. Further, retail outlets and offices will be interconnected through an extensive walkway network. Located in Baltimore County, MD, Mill Station is easy accessible from Carroll County to Baltimore County through I-795. The site also boasts favorable demography with a population of 166,000 in the neighborhood. Additionally, with an average household income of nearly $93,000, the center is expected to witness decent traffic and demand.Owings Mills Mall was inaugurated in the mid-1980s as a premium shopping destination with a big-box tenant focus. However, rising popularity of e-retail resulted in a decline in footfall, leading to its closure in 2015. Consequently, Owings Mills Mall was demolished in 2016.Kimco’s increased interest in redeveloping retail centers reiterates the significance of these brick-and-mortar stores that offer a diverse range of amenities.However, year to date, amid the choppy retail real estate environment, shares of Kimco have underperformed the industry it belongs to. During the said time frame, shares of the company declined 25.5%, as against the industry’s 10.7% growth.  Kimco currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the real estate investment trust space are Cedar Realty Trust (CDR  -  Free Report), Urstadt Biddle Properties (UBA  -  Free Report) and Regency Centers Corporation (REG  -  Free Report).

995,KIM,"Simon Property Group Inc. (SPG  -  Free Report) recently announced the company’s substantial redevelopment program at five properties. This move will help the retail REIT transform the former Sears stores and draw more traffic to these malls to benefit the existing retailers.The properties included in the refurbishment plan are Brea Mall (Brea, CA), Burlington Mall (Burlington, MA), Midland Park Mall (Midland, TX), Ocean County Mall (Toms River, NJ), and Ross Park Mall (Pittsburgh, PA).Per the plan, Brea Mall will have additional mixed uses. This comprises a new three-story, 120,000-square-foot Life Time Athletic healthy living, healthy aging, healthy entertainment destination, residential, entertainment, restaurants and new retail brands. In the Burlington Mall, the spaces will be revamped into new shops and restaurants, while in Ross Park Mall, the refurbishment plan includes a new dining hall, new retailers, restaurants, entertainment on three levels.Further, the Ocean County Mall plan comprises inclusion of new stores and transformation into dining and fitness spaces. At the Midland Park Mall, renovations include additions of two new restaurants and a new bigger Dillard's store, along with a new-to-the-market large format retailer, per the company’s press release.Notably, for the past few years, mall traffic has been plagued with challenges thanks to the shift in shopping patterns, with e-retail taking precedence, keeping retail REITs on tenterhooks. This has shrunk demand for retail real estate space, as changing shopping patterns are compelling retailers to reconsider their footprint, and eventually opt for store closures or file bankruptcies.This has been a prevailing concern for retail REITs like Simon Property, GGP Inc. (GGP  -  Free Report), Kimco Realty Corp. (KIM  -  Free Report), Macerich Company (MAC  -  Free Report) and others.Amid these, Simon Property has been making concerted efforts focused on overhauling its properties and increasingly adopting omni-channel strategies. These will help the company counter retail blues and make its shopping malls more alluring.In line with this, the company is initiating programs and events, as well as entering into several partnerships for upgrading services and amenities provided to its consumers. In fact, over the past five years, this retail REIT invested more than $5 billion in development projects, and further intends to invest around $1 billion annually through 2018 for development and redevelopment projects.   At the end of fourth-quarter 2017, the company had redevelopment and expansion projects, including the addition of new anchors, in progress at 25 properties across the United States, Canada and Asia. With such a huge pipeline, Simon Property is well poised to effectively leverage the improving spending habits of wealthier customers amid a strengthening economy.Simon Property has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

996,KIM,"Retail real estate investment trust (REIT) Kimco Realty Corporation’s (KIM  -  Free Report) third-quarter 2017 adjusted funds from operations (FFO) came in at 38 cents per share, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 37 cents. The company reported the same figure in the year-ago quarter.Total revenues came in at $294.8 million, up 3.4% from the prior-year quarter. Adjusted revenues for the quarter were $290.9 million, up 4.2% from the year-earlier quarter. However, the figure missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $294.8 million.At the end of the reported quarter, pro-rata occupancy came in at 95.8%, indicating a sequential increase of 30 basis points (bps).Same-property net operating income (NOI) flared up 3.1% year over year. Pro-rata rental-rate leasing spreads grew 16%, with rental rates for new leases and renewals/options, climbing 52% and 8.1%, respectively.Kimco Realty Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Kimco Realty Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Kimco Realty Corporation QuoteNote: The EPS numbers presented in the above chart represent funds from operations (FFO) per share.Balance Sheet PositionKimco exited third-quarter 2017 with cash and cash equivalents of around $156.6 million, up from $142.5 million recorded at year-end 2016.The company also received $23.7 million as cash distribution from its investment in Albertsons LLC.Portfolio ActivityDuring the third quarter, the company announced acquisitions of Jantzen Beach Center, an open-air shopping center spanning 752,000 square feet of space, for $131.8 million. The company also acquired a land parcel adjacent to Del Monte Plaza for $24.1 million.In addition, Kimco acquired land parcels adjacent to the company’s Gateway Station, Jantzen Beach and Webster Square shopping centers, for $26.4 million.On the other hand, the company’s third-quarter sales aggregated $62.5 million. This involved the disposition of four shopping centers and a land parcel totaling 579,000 square feet of space.GuidanceKimco narrowed its outlook for 2017. The company projects FFO as adjusted per share in the $1.51-$1.52 band as compared to the previous range of $1.50-$1.54. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for full-year 2017 is currently pegged at $1.53.Notably, for the current year, Kimco projects the U.S. portfolio occupancy to be in the range of 95.8-96.2%, same-property NOI to be up 1.5-2%, operating property acquisitions of $340-$375 million, and dispositions worth $350-$400 million.Dividend UpdateKimco’s board of directors announced a quarterly cash dividend of 28 cents. This reflects a 3.7% sequential hike in dividends. The dividend will be paid on Jan 16 to shareholders of record as of Jan 2, 2018.Our ViewpointSolid operating performance mirrors encouraging prospects for the company, going forward. Kimco remains on track with its strategic 2020 Vision, which envisages the disposal of non-strategic assets and ownership of premium assets in major metro markets in the United States. This is reflected in its portfolio-restructuring activities in the reported quarter.Further, its focus to enhance the company’s small-shops portfolio has resulted in a year-over-year increase in occupancy. With premium properties in high-income and high-growth areas, Kimco is well poised for growth.However, we note that aggressive disposition activities have an earnings-dilution impact and can likely constrain the company’s growth in the short run. Also, store closures and bankruptcy filing by retailers amid rising popularity of e-retail remains a pressing concern for this retail REIT.Kimco currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The stock has lost 26.5% year to date, underperforming the 7% loss incurred by the industry it belongs to.We now look forward to the earnings releases of other REITs like Ramco-Gershenson Properties Trust (RPT  -  Free Report), DDR Corp.

997,KIM,"The Macerich Company (MAC  -  Free Report) enjoys a premium portfolio and the presence of well-capitalized tenants in its roster. Additionally, the company’s increasing adoption of the omni-channel model in retailing is anticipated to enhance shopping experience and bolster sales volume at the tenant stores, thereby raising demand for Macerich’s properties.Notably, Macerich has a high concentration of premium malls in some vibrant U.S. markets. The company has been diversifying its traditional tenant base by including several emerging digital and store-based retailers for offering enhanced shopping experience at the company’s retail centers.Additionally, Macerich has been focusing on an aggressive capital-recycling program, involving divestiture of non-core and slower-growth assets, and usage of the proceeds in higher-growth properties through acquisitions, developments, and redevelopment initiatives. As part of such measures, since 2013, Macerich sold 21 non-core retail centers for an aggregate of $1.8 billion in proceeds.Moreover, the company remains on track with its redevelopment pipeline and pre-leasing deals.  Further, Macerich is aiming to enhance its assets quality as well as customer relationships. Going forward, we expect such moves to offer an upside potential to the company and strengthen its high-end portfolio.Nevertheless, with e-retail taking precedence, retail real estate investment trusts (REIT) continue to suffer as mall traffic has taken a beating. In fact, with e-commerce gaining market share from the brick-and-mortar stores, retailers are compelled to reconsider their footprint and eventually opt for store closures, while others unable to cope with competition have been filing for bankruptcies.This dreary environment has also resulted in tenants demanding substantial lease concessions, which, however, mall landlords find unjustified. As such, retail REITs like Macerich, GGP Inc. (GGP  -  Free Report), Kimco Realty Corp. (KIM  -  Free Report), Simon Property Group (SPG  -  Free Report) and others have been affected, and the companies’ share prices have been suffering for the past 12 months.Further hike in interest rate can also pose a challenge for the company. Essentially, rising rates imply higher borrowing cost for the company, which would affect its ability to purchase or develop real estate and lower dividend payouts as well. Moreover, the dividend payout itself might become less attractive compared to the yields on fixed income and money market accounts.Amid such retail woes, shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have underperformed the industry it belongs to in the past three months. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Macerich has lost 0.6% against the industry’s growth of 7.8%.

999,KIM,"Kimco Realty Corp. (KIM  -  Free Report) revealed its transaction activities for first-quarter 2018. The company disclosed dispositions of 21 shopping centers, spanning 2.3 million square feet, for a total $219.5 million. Of this, the company’s share included $210.2 million.A portfolio of five properties in the St. Louis market was disposed of for $49.5 million. Along with that, a five-property portfolio, located in Florida and Georgia, was sold for $72.7 million.As per Ross Cooper, president and chief investment officer at Kimco, because of the increased demand for open-air shopping centers, the company was able to make substantial advances toward its disposition target for 2018. He further added, “We continue to see favorable interest for these types of assets, and together with the considerable sales volume achieved during the first quarter as well as the additional properties under contract, we remain confident in our ability to meet our 2018 net disposition target of $700 to $900 million.”In 2018, Kimco intends to be a net seller of properties. The company has  about $465 million worth of properties already in contract and assets worth $330 million in the market as of Mar 31, 2018.The company’s strategic 2020 Vision envisages simplifying its business structure by concentrating on its U.S. shopping center portfolio, targeting for the ownership of large and high-quality assets in major metro markets, and simultaneously shedding non-core assets and exiting from its joint-venture portfolio. In connection to this, the company is making significant disposition of its assets. While such efforts are encouraging for the long term, the dilutive effect on earnings from high disposition activity cannot be averted in the near term.Moreover, amid the choppy retail real estate environment Kimco’s shares have declined 20.7% over the last three months compared with the industry’s decline of 12.6%.Currently, Kimco carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Stocks Worth a LookA few better-ranked stocks from the REIT space are Arbor Realty Trust (ABR  -  Free Report), Extra Space Storage Inc.

Specifically, it has also been lowering the number of joint ventures.In fact, during the second quarter, Kimco made stake dispositions in nine shopping centers, aggregating 892,000 square feet of space, as well as two land parcels, for a gross price of $155.8 million.However, mall traffic continues to suffer amid a rapid shift in customers’ shopping preferences and patterns, with online purchases growing by leaps and bounds. These have made retailers reconsider their footprint and eventually opt for store closures. Also, retailers not able to cope with competition are filing bankruptcies. This has emerged as a pressing concern for retail REITs, like Kimco.Management anticipates same-site NOI growth to be in the range of 2–3% for full-year 2017. This estimate includes the negative impact from the Sports Authority bankruptcy of approximately 225 basis points in the second quarter.In addition, Kimco’s activities during the quarter could not gain adequate analyst confidence. Consequently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for funds from operations for the second quarter remained unchanged at 38 cents over the last 30 days.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Kimco will likely beat estimates this season.

1006,KIM,"Kimco Realty Corporation (KIM  -  Free Report) is slated to report fourth-quarter and full-year 2017 results on Feb 15, before the market opens. The company’s revenues are expected to inch up in the quarter, while funds from operations (FFO) per share will likely remain flat year over year.Last quarter, this New Hyde Park, NY-based retail real estate investment trust (REIT) delivered better-than-expected results with respect to FFO per share.Over the trailing four quarters, Kimco beat estimates in one occasion and posted in-line results in the other three, recording an average beat of 0.68%. The graph below depicts this surprise history:Kimco Realty Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Kimco Realty Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Kimco Realty Corporation QuoteHowever, the stock has depreciated 25.2% in the past three months versus the industry's loss of 9.7%.Factors to Influence Q4 ResultsKimco has been taking long strides and is progressing well with its strategic 2020 Vision. In fact, the company has been strategically reducing its portfolio size and channeling the proceeds toward high-quality assets. Further, the company is engaged in the execution of strategic measures to boost the capital structure, and enhance its growth profile and tax efficiency.Kimco announced fourth-quarter 2017 and full-year 2017 transaction activities. Acquisitions for the fourth quarter totaled $123 million. Moreover, the company’s share from dispositions aggregated $174 million. In 2017, Kimco acquired three shopping centers and 10 land parcels for $382.1 million, out of which, $377.4 million marks the company’s pro-rata share. Disposition activity of the company in the year consisted of 38 shopping centers and three land parcels, for an aggregate gross value of $565.7 million, out of which, the company’s share included $430.4 million.Also, the holiday season turned out to be blissful for the retailers with upbeat consumer sentiment amid an improving economy, rising income and low unemployment level. Per government data, consumer spending remained robust during this season, with retail sales rising 0.9% and 0.4% in November and December, respectively.However, the retail real estate market continued to bear the brunt as mall traffic continues to suffer amid a rapid shift in customers’ shopping preference through online channels, resulting in an increasing number of retailers joining the dot-com bandwagon. These have made retailers reconsider their footprint and eventually opt for store closures in recent years, while others unable to cope with competition are filing bankruptcies.These have emerged as serious concerns for retail REITs, as it is limiting demand for the retail real estate space considerably. Moreover, the choppy retail real estate market situation is said to have led to tenants demanding substantial lease concessions, which mall landlords find unjustified.Although retail REITs like Kimco are actively enhancing the omni-channel capabilities and heavily investing in redevelopment to draw customers, it may take a while for these efforts to offset the dent created in the operating results.Furthermore, as part of its portfolio-upgrade strategy, Kimco is aggressively disposing non-core assets. While such efforts are encouraging for the long term, the earnings dilution led by high disposition activity cannot be averted in the near term. Therefore, these moves are expected to hurt the company’s growth momentum in the to-be-reported quarter.Amid these, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $298.9 million for the quarter under review, reflecting projected growth of 0.6% from the year-ago period.Kimco’s activities during the quarter could not gain adequate analyst confidence. Consequently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for FFO per share for the fourth quarter remained unchanged at 38 cents, over the past month. The figure also remains flat compared to the prior-year quarter.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Kimco will likely beat FFO estimates this time around. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen. However, that is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Kimco has an Earnings ESP of +0.16%.
