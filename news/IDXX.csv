6,IDXX,"Idexx Laboratories (IDXX) broke out Friday after the maker of veterinary diagnostic products topped Wall Street's expectations for the first quarter and raised its 2018 guidance for both earnings and revenue growth.On the stock market today, Idexx popped 8.4% to close at 212.20, blowing past a buy point of 202.36 and to an all-time high. Shares began forming a cup-with-handle baseÂ in March around the time they closed at the previous high of 207.14.For its first quarter, Idexx reported $538 million in sales, increasing 16% year over year and 12% on an organic basis. That easily crushed the consensus view for $524.9 million in sales. Idexx noted that 13% organic growth in its companion animal group helped drive the strong results.""We are pleased with the outstanding execution of our expanded commercial teams around the world in the first quarter, which resulted in 21% growth in premium instrument placements,"" Chief Executive Officer Jonathan Ayers said in a written statement.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

7,IDXX,"Idexx Laboratories (IDXX) caters to a niche clientele, keeps pushing back the launch of its next product, and trades at a multiple of about 60 times earnings.XTo investors, that might sound like a big ""no thanks.""Yet Wall Street pros laud this veterinary diagnostics company's management as ""brilliant,"" with an ""unbelievable grasp of their business.""""Simply put, the company's execution continues to be second to none,"" Raymond James analyst John Ransom said in a recent note to clients.Ransom went on to say: ""Further, it is not often that a player in any space with dominant (approximately) 60% market share is able to maintain the base in highly competitive markets, yet Idexx posted placement numbers that suggest it could even be gaining share.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseFor one thing, the niche market in question is the veterinary market, one that may sound small in number. There are fewer than 66,000 veterinarians across 31,000 animal health clinics in the U.S., according to the Census Bureau.Â Annually, though, vets serve millions of very passionate customers: pet owners. And, well, their pets.About 68% of U.S. households have a pet, according to the American Pet Products Association. That translates to nearly 90 million dogs and more than 94 million cats â not to mention the multitudes of birds, fish and other creatures hanging out in people's homes. Its most recent annual survey reveals that dog owners spent an annual average $731 on routine and surgical vet visits combined. Cat owners shelled out $427.Idexx is the industry leader in supplying vets with the technology to run those in-clinic tests and blood work. It caters primarily to beloved canines and felines in the U.S. and abroad. Like Raymond James' Ransom, Canaccord Genuity analyst Mark Massaro pegs the company's stateside market share at a hefty 60%.No. 2 player Abaxis (ABAX) has cornered a quarter of the American market, while smaller competitorÂ Heska (HSKA) has about a tenth. VCA unit Antech Diagnostics and Zoetis (ZTS) âthe latter of which is acquiring AbaxisÂ â also number among its rivals.Water treatment and livestock products account for a sliver of Idexx's revenue, but the big money comes from its companion animal diagnostics business. That includes a suite of in-clinic products such as chemistry panels, rapid test kits, veterinary instruments and analyzers. There are also external laboratory services such as diagnostic imaging and testing.The companion animal diagnostics unit brought Idexx more than $1.7 billion in net revenue in 2017, or 86.5% of its overall $1.97 billion haul for the year.When a person simply takes a pet to the vet, it is likely to result in Idexx's tests and equipment being used. In the U.S., some kind of diagnostic test is administered about 40% of the time people bring their fluffy friends to the clinic, Idexx said during its investor day presentation last August.Pet owners tend not to object. In fact, millennial pet owners are more likely than their older peersÂ to say ""money is no object to me when it comes to my pets,"" according to Idexx survey work. Forty-one percent of 19- to 36-year olds felt that way, vs. 36% of Gen Xers and 21% of Baby Boomers.As younger people get laser-focused about their careers and wait longer to get married and have kids, ""(they) go out and get the dog at 24, 25,"" years old, said Massaro.Millennials, he said, are ""prioritizing pets over some other things that maybe people from one or two generations ago held in greater esteem.""Idexx's most recent quarter was lauded by analysts, as per-share profit rose 55% to $1.01 a share and revenue grew 16.5% to $538 million, topping views for 93 cents and $526 million, respectively, according to Zacks Investment Research.The company has seen success with SediVue, the industry's first in-clinic urine sediment analyzer. And its recently launched product, Catalyst SDMA, an in-clinic test used by vets to look for kidney disease, was adopted by 42% of its North American customers in the first few months of its debut. Idexx Chief Executive Jonathan Ayers contends that's ""an amazing, amazing accomplishment.""""Nothing happens fast in veterinary,"" he told analysts on the call. ""The adoption rates are typically very slow. And in that context, the adoption of SDMA on the slide has been exceptional. And so we're very, very pleased with the success we've had.""The quarterly beat reinforced Piper Jaffray's bullish call on the companion animal industry, and William Blair analysts said they ""believeÂ the long-term investment merits of Idexx remain very compelling.""""They beat on every single line, every single reference category,"" said Canaccord Genuity's Massaro, adding that ""it gets down to extremely strong commercial execution. (Idexx has) one of the most savvy sales organizations I've ever seen."" He points to the company's unusually large direct sales force â 435 sales reps in North America and more than 100 in Europe â as a particular strength.Shares of Idexx ended trading Thursday down close to 1% to 202.37 but barely remained above a 202.36 buy point. Shares were up marginally on Friday. It brokeÂ sharply out of a cup-with-handle base in high volume following the company's earnings report on May 4.Management also lifted its full-year earnings guidance by 2 cents to $4.06 to $4.20 and organic revenue outlook to 10.5% to 12.5% growth on a currency-neutral basis. It reaffirmed its sales outlook, adjusted for exchange rates, at 12% to 14% growth.Even though Raymond James' Ransom had high praise for the company, he only reaffirmed his market perform rating in the same note to clients, citing the high price-to-earnings multiple as a hindrance to a more positive rating.That comes after Idexx has, on more than one occasion, pushed back the launch of its SNAP Fecal Dx, which will allow vets to test, in house, for the presence of hookworm, whipworm and roundworm infections.Canaccord's Massaro brushed off the delay. In his view, that Idexx continues to ""crush their numbers, raise their guide without a product launch coming. (It) tells me and the Street they're beating their numbers.""It's ""startling that Idexx can consistently trade almost three times the premium multiple of other good health care companies,"" said Massaro. For example,Â Hologic (HOLX), a medical imaging company that he calls the ""undisputed leader in 3D mammography,"" trades at about 19 times earnings (vs. Idexx's 60 times earnings).But Idexx's consistent beat-and-raise quarters and model of nearly 90% recurring revenue â ""unusually high for a health care number"" â bolster his confidence.Idexx's management team has an ""unbelievable grasp of their business,"" he said.William Blair analyst Ryan Daniels believes that the company is ""a durable business franchise that warrants a premium multiple,"" and wrote in early May that the firm ""would be more aggressive with share purchases on pullbacks.""More broadly, Raymond James' Ransom said in April that investors shouldn't expect growth to ramp up in the end-market for companion animal diagnostics. That means shares of companies like Idexx, Abaxis and Heska are ""more likely toÂ move on individual successes (share gains, new product launches, etc.) than to move uniformly on an all-encompassing cyclicalÂ dynamic.""But given the baseline growth rate of the animal health diagnostics industry, Canaccord Genuity's Massaro says that means that ""even the worst company in the space would grow 6% to 8%"" each year.""It really is a spectacular industry,"" he said.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:This Medtech Stock Breaks Out After Zoetis Snags It For $2 BillionStocks Showing Improving Market Leadership: Idexx Laboratories Earns 84 RS RatingThis Top Medical Stock Breaks Out After Its Beat-And-Raise

13,IDXX,"Millennials are ""moving the needle"" for animal-health companies likeÂ Idexx LaboratoriesÂ (IDXX),Â AbaxisÂ (ABAX) andÂ HeskaÂ (HSKA), an analyst said MondayÂ as he reiterated a buy rating on Idexx following the firm's Investor Day.XOver the past five to 10 years, pet-related spending has risen as new millennial pet owners have entered the market, Canaccord analyst Mark Massaro said. Millennials are taking their pets to the vet at higher rates than their Gen X and Baby Boomer counterparts.""We believe the millennial impact is twofoldÂ â millennial pet owners are spending more and taking their pets to the vet at a higher rate, and millennial veterinarians appear to be more willing to order new cutting-edge diagnostic testing,"" he wrote in a note to clients.Based on survey data Idexx presented during its Investor Day, 67% of millennials, customers ages 19 to 36, noted bringing their pets to the vet more than once per year, compared with 58% of Gen X owners and 39% of baby boomers, MassaroÂ said.This is likely to best benefit Idexx, which makes diagnostic testsÂ and chemistry panelsÂ for veterinary offices. Massaro sees Idexx as ""dominant and hardly rivaled"" in the global vet landscape where demand could remain highÂ for at least the nextÂ two years.According to Idexx, 41% of about 200 million clinical vet visits any year include a diagnostic test, though only 12% of visits include a chemistry panel.Â PracticesÂ ranking within the top 2% of Idexx's clients complete 2.4 times more chemistry panels than the average client.""We think this number is likely to increase as preventative care visits become more popular and millennials continue to 'humanize' their pets,"" Massaro said. ""We believe this number could tick up to 15% as favorable macro trends materialize and as Idexx adds additional tests to its chemistry panel.""IBD'S TAKE:Â Idexx has an IBD Relative Strength Rating of 77, though it has lifted as high as 83 out of a best-possible 99 earlier this month. Head toÂ IBD Data StoriesÂ for more on what goes into ranking a stock.Massaro kept his buy rating and 180 price target on Idexx stock. A recent slump in Idexx represents a rare buying opportunity, he said.Idexx beganÂ forming a flat base in early June with a buy point at 173.11. But shares are well below their 50-day trading average this month.During its Investor Day last week in Maine, Idexx reiterated its outlook for 10% top-line growth to 2022 and 15% to 20% growth on a constant currency basis. Growth in the U.S. is expected to be 9%-13% with 12%-16% growth in international recurring revenue.Recurring revenue, driven by diagnostics, now represents 88% of total sales, Idexx said. Its customer retention rate isÂ 98% to 99%. The company also has doubled its sales force to 435 in North America since 2012. Massaro argues neither of its key diagnostic rivals ""can meaningfully challenge Idexx.""The next catalyst will be in late October when Idexx reports third-quarter results and likelyÂ offers 2018 guidance.Â Massaro raised his 2017-18 adjusted earnings view to $3.17 per share and $3.66 per share, respectively. He also sees 2019 sales of $2.33 billion and adjusted income of $4.25 a share.On theÂ stock market today, Idexx was nearly flat, losing 3 cents tot 150.41.RELATED:All Eyes Will Be On This Dow Component's 'Star' Drug Next WeekHow Two Drugmakers Will Benefit On AstraZeneca's CoattailsBiogen, Teva Slip After Democrats Launch MS Drug Pricing Probe

41,IDXX,"There could be upside to Intuitive Surgical's (ISRG) 2017 guidance, but an analyst suggested Tuesday that investors are ""already paying for that"" and downgraded the stock on the likelihood of subdued demand in Asia.Canaccord analyst Jason Mills also sees Medtronic (MDT), known for making heart-valve replacements that rival those ofÂ Edwards Lifesciences (EW), as a stout competitor in surgery robotics in 2018-19.Year to date, Intuitive Surgical stock is up 44% after a ""phenomenal year"" in 2016, Canaccord analyst Jason Mills wrote in a note to clients.Â Intuitive ended the year with 18% sales growth, 26% earnings growth and $5 billion in cash.""As the health care sector has been a top performer so far in 2017, Intuitive Surgical has been leading the charge,"" Mills said. ""However, investors' exuberance about the company's strong performance over the past few years has driven the stock to unprecedented valuation levels.""Mills downgraded Intuitive Surgical stock to a hold rating from buy after two years, though he kept his 870 price target.Â At the close on the stock market today, Intuitive Surgical was up 0.5%, to 914.43.""While we expect Intuitive Surgical to deliver solid results in 2017 and 2018, we believe the risk/reward setup tilts too much to the former at the present,"" he said. The stock hasn't traded at this valuation sinceÂ 2012 and is now at a 34% premium to its own five-year average.IBD'S TAKE:Â Intuitive Surgical stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 96 out of a best-possible 99. It's ranked fourth in IBD's 58-company Medical-Systems/Equipment industry group. Idexx Laboratories (IDXX) stock leads the group, with a CR of 98. For a look at the group setup, head to IBD Stock Checkup.Guidance has played a big role in Intuitive Surgical's stock, Mills said. The company typically offers conservative guidance that it easily outperforms, thus investors expect ""positive guidance revisions through the balance of 2017.""But that might not be the case. The Easter weekend tailwind in the first quarter will become a headwind in the second quarter, and outside-U.S. business is slowing, Mills wrote. Procedure growth is expected to be subdued in Japan and to moderate in China.""While we think there could be upside to current guidance, we think you're already paying for that,"" he wrote.In the meantime, competition is looming, he said. Intuitive Surgical makes robotics that assist in performing surgery.Â MedtronicÂ reiterated on its earnings call last week its plan to launch its surgical robotics outside the U.S. before April 2018 and in the U.S. during fiscal 2019.""Medtronic's competitive approach seems to be centered on its ability to target the customer across myriad surgical spectrums, but we also deduce from our conversations with management they will target the cost side of the equation as well,"" Mills said.Though Medtronic might not become much of a competitor until late 2018 or early 2019, as its domestic launch creeps closer Intuitive Surgical investors ""may begin to account for the upcoming competitionÂ vis-a-vis the multiple afforded these shares,"" he said.RELATED:Robot Surgeon Maker Launches To Record High On Strong Q1

Facebook (FB), one of its principal components, climbed more than 3% in heavy trading, rising from support around the 200-day moving average. The social media company announced it will add 500 workers in its Britain operations, from about 1,000 currently, showing confidence in the U.K. despite Brexit.

The SPDR Energy ETF (XLE) moved above a 72.08 buy point.Retail, chemicals and some internet industry groups also were among Monday's best performers.IBM (IBM) inched above the 161.96 buy point of a cup-with-handle base. Volume was tracking 40% above average, which was a good sign. Still, the price move was relatively limp for a breakout, and the handle in the pattern was short and had a wedging shape. Those characteristics make the breakout suspect, and IBM's fundamentals aren't exactly sparkling. The Composite Rating is 54.Idexx Laboratories (IDXX) broke out of a cup-shaped base with a 117.94 buy point. Volume was on pace to more than double its average. The company â which makes diagnostic products and services for veterinary, livestock and poultry in addition to water testing â has posted earnings gains of 2% to 23% the past four quarters. That's not impressive for growth companies, but enough for a decent 89 EPS Rating.Cirrus Logic (CRUS) rose past the 58.18 buy point of a flat base, but the stock reversed lower.

49,IDXX,"Leading tech stocks tumbled last week as mutual funds sold shares in the likes of Facebook, Apple, Amazon and Google. But the manager of $3 billion Franklin DynaTech Fund, an IBD Best Mutual Fund 2016 Award winner, isn't panicking.Judging by DynaTech's (FKDNX) lowly portfolio turnover rate of 31% and comments by lead manager Matthew Moberg on the power driving growth in several key holdings, the fund remains hitched in a big way to the market's leading stocks.DynaTech has an outsized bet on technology, with a 48% weighting as of June 30, according to Franklin Templeton.That sort of megabet on a single sector could make a fund volatile. But this fund'sÂ performance is consistent as well as strong. The fund was up 3.15%Â so far this year as of Oct. 31. The S&P 500 was up 5.87%. DynaTech's return topped 78%Â of its peers tracked by Morningstar Inc., all of which averaged a 0.91%Â gain.The fund generated average annual returns of 8.42%, 13.2% and 9.26% the past three, five and 10 years.The fund is an IBD Best Mutual Funds 2016 Awards winner for having outperformed the S&P 500 over the one-, three-, five- and 10-year periods ended Dec. 31.Â Only 9% of U.S. diversified stock fundsÂ met that standard. It was in the top 100 in three categories: all U.S. equity, all large caps and all growth funds.Click Here To See A List Of IBD Mutual Fund Six-Month LeadersMoberg, 45 years old, has been shepherding DynaTech since 2004.Â He talked with IBD about his investment approach from his office in San Mateo, Calif.IBD: Matthew, why does the fund have such a large technology weighting?Moberg: The fund focuses on innovation and growth.Our name, ""DynaTech,"" stands for dynamic technologies. We define dynamic as a force that stimulates change or progress. Innovation is where the bulk of wealth creation occurs. But we view this as a broad mandate. We're able to look for innovation anywhere.And we believe you need active management to invest in innovation. It's a part of the market that is often misunderstood. Some people believe it is too expensive, or too unknown. So that's an area we look through because those misunderstandings mean opportunities get overlooked.Click Here To See A List Of Mutual Fund Category Performance LeadersIBD: Is your current tech weighting typical for the fund?Moberg: It's been as high as 50%.Â But sector classifications change. Amazon (AMZN)Â is now classified as a consumer discretionary stock. Early on, it was tech.Visa (V) and MasterCard (MA) are holdings. They're still considered information technology companies. But one could argue that they are financials.We look for innovation, which can be found in a lot of places.IBD: Health care was your second largest sector, with a 27% weighting. That's another hotbed of innovation, right?Moberg: It's not a great year for health care because of the election (and some candidates talking about price controls). But, yes, there's a lot of innovation there. You see it in possibly emerging treatments for diseases like hepatitis C, cystic fibrosis, even cancer.IBD: What are some names you like in that space?Moberg: Celgene (CELG)Â and Incyte (INCY).Click Here To See A List Of Biggest Mutual Funds Ranked By PerformanceIBD: Is the fund's performance consistent because it is diversified? Because it's exposed to other sectors, not just tech and health care? Why else?Moberg: Yes, we are diversified. And consistency is also due to our fundamental research. Sometimes we find stocks that the market doesn't appreciate how quickly they will come to market. The best example is Facebook (FB). They launched their mobile ads in Q2 2012. In the first quarter they only did $13 million in revenue. That was 1.3% of their total revenue. Two years and three months later, mobile was doing $1.659 billion. That's more advertising revenue than CBS' $1.63 billion in the similar quarter.Technology adoption is accelerating. The world is more global. Investors often don't appreciate how fast a new technology rises. So we try to think long-term. Our short-term performance is just a byproduct of how we think long-term.IBD'S TAKE:Â See how near Facebook and other highly rated stocks are to proper buy points. Visit IBD's Leaderboard.IBD: What part of Facebook's story do you like the most now?Moberg: First, mobile usage. Mobile ads will be more effective than other ads, one could argue. Facebook probably has the best set of mobile applications. And there's a runway for growth there.Second, they're starting to monetize Instagram, where people share pictures. The next step is to monetize Messenger and WhatsApp. Usage on them has been explosive. And there's a good chance that this goes into commerce (rather than remain solely a social activity).Finally, when you're thinking about what they could monetize five or 10 years out, Oculus (which makes a virtual reality headset) is another interesting acquisition. Facebook didn't pay much for it. And they can probably monetize it in five to 10 years. It has a long runway, like Messenger and WhatsApp.IBD: Edwards Lifesciences (EW) seems to be benefiting from a new management fiscal discipline and from a key new product, their transcatheter aortic value replacement (TAVR).Moberg: Yes, right now they're going through a very nice product cycle with TAVR. It had a rough start. But now TAVR is an example of a sensational innovation. It enables patients to avoid the need for open-heart surgery, cracking open your rib cage, making a giant incision. Instead, they put the TAVR in through an artery with a small incision. Patients spend less time in the hospital, go through less pain. And with each iteration, the valve gets smaller and easier to insert.That product cycle will last another five-plus years.They're also working on something for mitral valves, which are harder to reach. We hope and expect them to be the leader in that field as well. If they can do it, it would double their addressable market.IBD: Edwards had disappointing sales in Q3 and its stock plummeted. How has this changed your outlook for the company and stock?Moberg:Â We remain positive on Edwards Lifesciences. Edwards is still in the early stages of capturing the transcatheter aortic valve replacement opportunity (65% share of a $2.5 billion or so market that is only about one-third penetrated).Â  Its stock also fails to account for any potential for the transcatheter mitral valve replacement opportunity, and mitral valve disease is twice as prevalent as aortic valve disease.Â  It has faced missteps in new products before â again the world doesn't work as linearly as we would like â but we believe this is an excellent business.IBD: I'll make a wild guess that you are not one of those investors who finds Amazon'sÂ product experiments wasteful.Moberg: They're incredibly innovative. They're continually investing in new things. They've had three big successes. The first was Prime. They get money upfront (from consumers). And it drove up usage of Amazon significantly. The second was letting third parties sell on the website, with fulfillment by Amazon. It required no investment in inventory, and generated higher margins.In addition, they have Amazon Web Services, which is increasingly important. It's one of the fastest growing software-as-a-service companies ever.Amazon continues to invest, find new ideas. They've had quite a few failures along the way, but I understand you need to take risk to succeed. That attitude gives us confidence in their continued growth.IBD: Any concerns about Amazon's miss on Q3 results? Any sign of more weakness to come?Moberg:Â They have gone through many investment cycles in the past. Step-ups in investments don't always, in fact rarely, work within a quarterly reporting cycle. We understand that.Â  Over the long term Amazon has had very good returns on invested capital, prefers to grow organically and has a culture of innovation.Â  We didn't see anything in the quarter that suggests that is no longer the case.IBD: Pioneer Natural Resource (PXD) is somewhat new to the portfolio. But it has seven straight quarters of slowing earnings. What's your thesis?Moberg: We like to invest in small positions, see how they do and try to hold on for the long-term. If anything fundamental changes and it's right, we add to it.Pioneer is one of the best positions in oil services. They are one of the lowest priced producers. We think oil will stabilize in the 50 to 60 per barrel range.IBD: Why do you like Chinese online gaming company NetEase (NTES)?Moberg: We believe the gaming space is a secular winner. NetEase has some games that have done well. And the secular trends on gaming are better in China than in the U.S., and it is very strong in the U.S. We will see more virtual reality and different kinds of games and ways for people to spend leisure time playing games.IBD: Do you still like Broadcom (AVGO) as much as you used to?Moberg: We don't believe it is as innovative as it used to be. Most of their accelerating earnings per share is due to consolidation. We prefer companies with innovation, which this was at first.Still, they are doing a great job buying companies, rationalizing costs, raising prices. Their CEO is incredibly well thought of in the (chipmaking) industry. He's executing on strategy extremely well. We're pleased that someone is taking the lead and starting consolidation in that industry.IBD: Nvidia (NVDA) is another relative newcomer to your portfolio. What do you like about their chipmaking?Moberg: They were viewed as a provider of graphics chips inside PCs. Then they expanded, making chips inside game consoles. Now they're broken free of that prison and making central processing units for virtual reality. They're also needed in cars, for autonomous driving. Also in hyperscale servers, they're used as co-processors. CAD-CAM, artificial intelligence â their total addressable market is exploding.We think there's a lot of sustainability to the company and a long trajectory for earnings growth.IBD:Â You have exposure to the pet care industry. What do you like there?Moberg:Â It's shocking how well we treat animals now vs. 20 or 30 years ago. Cancer treatment, CT scans â they were unavailable years ago. So we like the secular trend. The company we like mostÂ and have owned longer and have the largest position in is Idexx Labs (IDXX). Idexx is a particularly well-positioned business competitively, given its unique ability to single-handedly bundle both outsourced diagnostics and in-practice diagnostic instruments.Â  Idexx also offers superior information management capabilities regarding animal diagnostic reporting and record-keeping relative to competitors.IBD: What's special about Aspen Technology (AZPN), the software firm?Moberg: They do supply-chain management for process industries. This software is so important that even when companies go bankrupt, they pay their Aspen bill. It is the backbone for many companies.They have tremendous operating margin and profitability. There's some competition, but if you are a serious and large company, you need their technology. And customers are incredibly sticky.IBD: Tell me about your co-manager.Moberg: I am lead manager. The fund was founded in 1968. Rupert Johnson, my co-manager, was the fund's first manager. And as you may know he is also vice chairman of Franklin Resources.IBD: Matthew, people often wonder what portfolio managers do in their off hours. How about you?Moberg: I used to run 25 miles a week. I used to have hobbies. Now I have a 7-, 5- and a 1-year-old. They're my hobbies.And I forgot to mention that I'm an avid reader of history. I was a history major in college. I find that useful in looking at micro trends, adoption rates, periods of major and minor innovation, and pattern recognition of new technologies, as well as macro trends like low interest rates, Federal Reserve actions, periods and government responses.RELATED:Top Mutual Fund Manager Captures Solid Returns Without Messy EmotionsThis Top Mutual Fund Manager Wins With 3 Flavors Of Growth StocksHow Hartford Growth Opportunities Fund Targets Stocks With GiddyapHow Fidelity Contrafund Manager Will Danoff Played The Downturn

50,IDXX,"Abaxis (ABAX) and Heska (HSKA) last quarter wrested some market share fromÂ Idexx Laboratories (IDXX) in the animal-health field, according to a survey of 100 veterinarians, but Canaccord analyst Mark Massaro was bullish Friday on Idexx's 96% customer retention rate.Four customers swapped out Idexx chemistry products for Abaxis and Heska products according to the Canaccord survey, Massaro wrote in a research report. Seven out of 100 indicated they plan to switch rapid-test providers in 2017, citing cost as their reason. That should bode well for Abaxis, Massaro says.The survey results earned Abaxis stock a price target hike to 50 from 48, but Massaro kept his hold rating. In the stock market today, Abaxis stock dipped a fraction to 92.01, as Idexx stock rose a fraction to 111.10. Heska stock sank a fraction, to 53.32. All three are lightly traded, but they all have Composite Ratings above 90. Idexx touched a record high of 117.03 on Monday.IBD'S TAKE: IBD's 60-company Medical-Systems/Equipment industry group has toppled to No. 32, out of 197 groups tracked, from No. 8 over the past four weeks. Biotechs, too, have floundered. Keep tabs on Industry Themes for upswings and downswings in each sector.Idexx has done a good job of stabilizing its rapid-test business and one quarter doesn't equal a trend, Massaro said. But cost continues to pressure medical tech makers â 18% of vets said they buy the lowest cost rapid tests vs. 15% in the prior quarter, and broad test appeal dropped to 53% from 55%.Abaxis is now rolling out its Fuse app to catch up with Idexx's software, Massaro wrote. But the initial impact will likely be limited as the rollout takes time to implement. For the September quarter, he views Abaxis reporting $60.5 million in sales and 37 cents earnings per share ex items, up a respective 8% and 9% vs. last year.This month, Massaro expects Abaxis to complete a 900-unit hematology rollout to Banfield Pet Hospital. Abaxis expects Banfield to add 3-5 cents EPS ex items annually on high levels of hematology testing.Meanwhile, Idexx's SediVue and SDMA testing products are well underway, Massaro says. Idexx sees $100 million in cumulative sales for urinalysis product SediVue by 2021. Massaro sees that as easily beatable. Of those surveyed, 6% use SediVue and 15% plan to order it next year.""Assuming about 26,000 U.S. clinics and about a 20% penetration rate, we think Idexx could drive about 5,000 orders for SediVue by the end of 2017 in the U.S., though we model 4,100,"" he wrote. ""We believe Idexx will bolt on $72 million of revs from SediVue by end of 2017.""Of 100 respondents, 39% said they would do more urinalysis testing if it was easier or faster, and 72% said sending out fresh urine for testing can diminish its quality.Already, 34% of those surveyed use Idexx's SDMA test for kidney function and another 19% indicated that they want to start using it, up from 17% in the Q2 survey. Another 16% said they're willing to send samples to Idexx for testing, and 6% said they are likely to switch lab providers just to get SDMA access.Idexx pegs SediVue and SDMA as $200 million and $100 million opportunities, respectively, by 2020, Massaro says.Â He boosted his price target on Idexx stock to 125 from 120, and retained his buy rating.

51,IDXX,"Medical stocks, particularly drugmakers, played a key role in buoying a challenged market in the first half of 2015.

"
52,IDXX,"Techies often quip that the internet is made of cats.Â And whether you love or hate the proliferation of cat videos traveling around social media, they reflect an important underlying trend: Americans take videos of cats partly because they have more of them.In times of robust consumer spending -- like now -- people are more willing to adopt pets and commit to the long-termÂ care of those animals. That includes their health care, which unlike most human health care, is paid out of pocket by the patient's doting family.This has worked to the benefit ofÂ VCA (WOOF), America's leading chain of animal hospitals. The company benefits from the amusing ticker symbol of ""WOOF,"" but the interest in the sector is serious.""Big money is flowing into defensive areas such as food, beverage, tobacco and utility stocks,"" ETF manager Matthew Tuttle of Tuttle Tactical Management said in an email. ""Pet-care stocks fit that mold and have caught a strong bid recently as consumers now consider pets as part of their family. Even if the economy slows down, or enters a recession, consumers will continue to spend on their pets.""To be fair, the big recession of 2007-09 was deep enough to hit the veterinary business, including VCA. But over the last 20 years, spending on pets has grown an average of 7% per year, according to Morningstar.And since the third quarter of 2011, VCA's profit and sales growth has been almost continuous, driven by unceasingÂ increases in pet ownership.""According to Pethealth, Inc., a leading provider of management software toÂ animal welfare organizations in North America, year-over-year growth in pet adoptionsÂ across 1,226 animal shelters rose 5.5% in December, with average growth of 6.0% overÂ the trailing three-month period,"" Credit Suisse analyst Erin Wilson wrote in her Feb. 3 initiation report on VCA. ""Pet euthanasia, inversely correlated to pet demand,Â dropped 15% in December, consistent with recent monthly trends, which was a positive forÂ overall pet ownership.""These trends continued in the first quarter, according to VCA Chief Executive Robert Antin, noting that growth went beyond just hospitals.""The numbers that I see are contradictory on the new pets, but I don't think there's any question, there's a lot more pets that are out there,"" Antin said on the conference call discussing first-quarterÂ results with analysts on April 27.""We have a great vantage point through Camp Bow Wow,"" Antin went on to say. ""The most disposable (spending) level that you have is doggy day care, and it's rising at around 10% same-store growth.""Camp Bow Wow, with around 120 sites, is one of several non-hospital services that VCA offers that currently provide about 20% of revenue. The most significant is Antech Diagnostics, its chain of 60 reference laboratories -- that is, labs performing specialty tests referred to it by hospitals and clinics. VCA and Idexx Laboratories (IDXX) hold a virtual duopoly in this market, and it is considered aÂ lucrative trade.""We find the hefty lab operating margins -- often north of 40% -- extremely appealing and far better than Quest Diagnostics' (DGX) human diagnostic operating margins of 15%,"" wrote Morningstar analyst Debbie Wang in an April 27 report.The margins also are higher than those of VCA'sÂ hospital business -- so even though AntechÂ provides 18% of revenue, itÂ provides 42% of operating profit. Still, the company has continued to enlarge its hospital network because it sees the industry as ripe for consolidation.VCA, North America's largest free-standing chain -- privately held rival Banfield has around 900 locations, but mostly inside PetSmart retail stores -- owns 762 hospitals in the U.S. and Canada. But that's out of some 26,000 total hospitals north of the Rio Grande, according to Credit Suisse.Some of these are smaller chains, which VCA sees as acquisition targets. Most recently, on May 3 it acquired an 80% interest in Companion Animal Practices, North America, a Las Vegas-based chain of 56 animal hospitals.But it also likes to buy up single-site practices, provided that they have annual revenue of at least $1.2 million and employ at least two full-time veterinarians. To that end,Â it has a permanent ""Selling Your Hospital"" section on its website that says it can complete a transaction in 60 to 120 days.VCA also has been willing to buy to fill out its reference lab business. Last year it acquired the reference lab business of Abaxis (ABAX) for $21 million, helping build out its moat against competitors.""It would be difficult for a startup to replicate VCA's reference lab infrastructure,"" analyst Wang wrote in her report. ""Labs compete on the basis of high levels of service, access to veterinary specialists for consultations, accuracy, and timeliness. (VCA) has established a sizable footprint in the most densely populated metropolitan areas where both density of pet ownership and relatively high household income support VCA's efficient lab operations.""All this buyout activity leads Phil Davis, CEO of PSW Investments, to call VCA a ""roll-up play."" However, in recent quarters it has also shown some organic growth. In the first quarter, same-store sales grew 7.6% at outlets on the hospital side that were open for more than a year, while internal growth in the lab business was 9.1%.Overall, VCA's earnings in the quarter rose 32% over the year-earlier quarter to 66 cents a share, while revenue climbed 13% to $563 million. That beat Wall Street's expectations, which had fallen after it issued a weak fourth-quarter report and guidance in January, and broke the stock out of a nine-month consolidation. On June 9, shares touched an all-time high of 66.26.Shares were down a little more than 1% on Friday but staked out new gains on Monday and hit an all-time high intradayÂ of 66.98. The same happened on Tuesday, as shares hit a new intraday high of 67.78 before settling back to 67.35, a new closing high. With an overall Composite Rating of 97, VCA is No. 22 on the IBD 50 list of leading growth stocks.It can be tough to forecast the growth of an acquisition-loving company, but analysts expect earnings to grow 21% this year to $2.87 a share, representing a slight deceleration from last year's 26% increase. Revenue is forecast to rise 16% to $2.47 billion, the highest growth rate since 2007.Analyst Wilson estimated on May 3 that the single-digit organic growth should continue, though not quite as robustly as in the first quarter. She forecasts 3% to 5% full-year growth on the hospital side and 6% to 8% growth on the lab side.

75,IDXX,"At Idexx Laboratories, longtime workers enjoy a pause that refreshes.In their 10th year with the company, full-time salaried employees become eligible for a four-week sabbatical. They can spend the paid time off doing whatever they want. The only condition is that they must use their ""professional growth leave"" as a full block of time in the year in which they're eligible. Employees continue to earn sabbaticals once every five years after their 10th anniversary with the company.""They can get their mind off the business, and they come back recharged,"" said Jon Ayers, chairman, president and chief executive of Idexx Laboratories (IDXX). ""Absence makes the heart grow fonder.""The sabbatical is one of many ways in which Ayers seeks to drive innovation and maximize the contribution of the company's approximately 6,000 employees. Based in Westbrook, Maine, the firm provides diagnostic and information-technology products and services to improve animal health and the safety of water and milk.Testing Dogs For Lyme DiseaseAyers, 58, became CEO in early 2002. He says that one of his most important leadership roles is articulating a vision that employees can embrace.The company works closely with veterinarians to help them succeed. The work involves identifying vets' needs and developing tests and technologies that they can use to enhance the services they provide to pet owners.""We benefit when veterinarians grow their practice,"" Ayers said. ""We're aligned with their success. We grow when they grow.""In 2001, for example, Idexx launched a diagnostic test to screen dogs for Lyme disease. Vets were already testing dogs for heartworm disease, but Idexx's new test kit gave them one more valuable tool to strengthen their diagnostic arsenal.""No one had tested for Lyme disease in dogs before we developed this test,"" Ayers said. ""We've now established a very big market for preventive testing of dogs for tick-borne diseases.""To spur innovation, Ayers says that his R&D staffers spend 80% of their job on specific projects. He lets them use the other 20% of their time ""to play with their ideas on their own.""This freedom pays off. In early 2014, an employee devised a mobile app that gives vets instant notification of test results along with access to a pet's history of diagnostic data.""It's part of our cloud-based solution to help vets track their patients at any time, from anywhere, even when they're out of the office,"" Ayers said. ""Vets love it, and we now offer it in 16 countries.""Ayers decided to make the mobile app, called VetConnectPLUS, free to use. He met some initial resistance from colleagues who sought to charge for it.""It was a controversial decision to give it away for free, because we spent millions on it,"" Ayers said. ""But I argued it would grow usage of our diagnostics and we'd have a faster adoption rate. And that's what we're seeing.""
"
76,IDXX,"Francis Pulizzi wouldn't think of scrimping on his pets' health care, even if it's a bit pricey.The New York City native and owner of three Chihuahuas figures that he spends a minimum of $300 each time he takes one of the dogs to the veterinarian.A recent visit to the vet for his 9-month-old puppy, Sebastian, took an even bigger bite out of his cash flow. It cost Pulizzi around $500 for the exam, various tests and medication.But Pulizzi isn't squawking.""I'll go without going out to dinner to make sure my pet has the proper health care,"" he told IBD. ""This is my priority. It's like having a child.""Judging by the performance of high-rated Idexx Laboratories (IDXX), Pulizzi has plenty of company. Idexx manufactures and develops diagnostic and information technology-based products and services for the companion animal veterinary, livestock and poultry, water testing and dairy markets. Around 80% of its revenue comes from its Companion Animal Group, the division that provides diagnostic products and services to vet practices, says Raymond James analyst Nicholas Jansen.Its Livestock, Poultry and Dairy segment provides diagnostic and health-monitoring products for those markets.Products Selling WellThe company's vast lineup includes in-clinic diagnostic solutions comprised of both its VetLab suite of in-clinic chemistry and hematology analyzers as well as associated proprietary consumable products â tests and supplies.The chemistry analyzers, which include products such as the Catalyst Dx and Catalyst One, are used by vets to measure levels of certain enzymes and other substances in blood or urine.Another offering is VetConnect PLUS, a cloud-based technology that lets vets access and analyze patient data from Idexx's diagnostic modalities.Around 40% of its revenue comes from outside the U.S.Idexx delivered good news to investors Wednesday when it pre-announced some results for the fourth quarter, which it reports Jan. 30.The company said it saw record total placements of over 2,000 premium chemistry and hematology analyzers globally in the fourth quarter. In America, it saw a 9% increase vs. a year earlier in placements of Catalyst analyzers and an 18% rise in premium hematology analyzers. It also saw a record in total U.S. premium instrument quarterly placements.International placements of premium analyzers grew 27%.""Our fourth-quarter results capped a year of excellent progress, reflected in full-year Catalyst placement gains of 29%, including growth of 20% in the U.S. and 40% in international,"" said CEO Jonathan Ayers in a press release.The company also raised its guidance for full-year 2014 organic revenue (excluding the impact from the distribution change on channel inventories related to a transition to an all-direct product distribution model in the U.S. for its Companion Animal Group diagnostics) to a range of 9.5% to 10% from its prior guidance of a 9.5% gain.Wednesday's upbeat report comes in the wake of a move from a hybrid to an all-direct product distribution model in America for Companion Animal Group diagnostic products, all elements of which became fully operational in the fourth quarter. The move was announced last July.Sales Go DirectGoing direct means Idexx has dropped its U.S. distributors, which it used in the past, and is selling the group's diagnostic products directly through its own sales force.Under the direct approach, Idexx takes orders, ships product, invoices and receives payment, and recognizes revenue for all rapid assay test kits and instrument consumables in the U.S.That aligns with its direct model for instruments, reference lab service and other Companion Animal Group products, Ayers adds.The change will allow a ""significant expansion in our direct sales coverage and capacity, including an estimated 40% increase in the veterinary diagnostic consultant field sales role and a 60% in customer field call frequency,"" Ayers said.Cutting out the distributors also means Idexx can keep the margin it had been paying them, Jansen says.""There was some controversy over whether there would be a mixed performance during the transition or if Idexx would lose a little share to competitors,"" he said.Wednesday's announcement allayed some of those concerns: ""The distribution changes appear to be having very little impact on the company's business momentum, which seems to de-risk the primary concern on IDEXX shares,"" wrote Jansen in a research note following the announcement. ""While we acknowledge that (the) currency headwind will only get bigger, given recent exchange rate volatility, we believe underlying fundamentals are strengthening.""Guidance ReaffirmedAlso on Wednesday, the company reinforced its guidance for 13% to 14% organic revenue growth in 2015. The 2015 outlook ""reflects expectations for organic revenue growth of 9.5% to 10.5% excluding the benefit of margin capture associated with the U.S. all-direct sales and product distribution strategy,"" the company said in a statement.Idexx stock hit a new high Wednesday and closed up 2.9%. It gave back a little over 1% Thursday.The company has been enjoying a nice run. Earnings have grown by double digits in all but one of the past 15 quarters. But analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect fourth-quarter earnings to slip 1% to 81 cents a share.""Reported EPS is not going to be a relevant metric for the fourth quarter as the company is impacted by the transition (to the direct model), which weighs on reported margins,"" said Jansen. ""This normalizes in 1Q, and everything should be back to normal.""Analysts expect full-year 2014 earnings to rise 10% to $3.82 a share, and a 16% lift in 2015.Jansen says Idexx's primary strength is its innovation, which is fueled by its R&D spending.Its R&D spending represents about 80% of all the industry's diagnostic product R&D, he says.Package ApproachAnother strength, he adds, is the fact that Idexx offers a complete solution of diagnostic products and services, which they can bundle.Idexx has a ""razor/razor blade"" model, says Jansen. It not only sells the diagnostic equipment, but it also develops and sells the tests â or consumables â that the equipment analyzes.""Once you placed the system (with a vet or an animal hospital), you have a highly recurring revenue stream,"" said Jansen.The overall landscape for its business has been improving post-Great Recession, says Jansen.""Now, with unemployment down and consumer confidence (up), that translates into more spending on people's pets,"" said Jansen. ""And diagnostics is a faster growth area within pet spending.""Idexx is part of IBD's Medical-Systems/Equipment industry group, which is a strong performer, ranking No. 6 of the 197 groups tracked. Idexx gets a 97 score out of a possible 99 in IBD's Composite Rating, a metric that factors in things such as earnings growth and stock gains.The group also includes Steris (STE) and Cantel Medical (CMN), both of which have a Composite Rating of 98. Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) is the group's largest firm by market cap and has a Composite Rating of 91.

"
370,IDXX,"The $570 million Nuveen Large Cap Growth Opportunities is a top echelon portfolio, seeking to resume its winning ways after having hit a rough patch in 2011.
"
371,IDXX,"The fund's average annual gain of 14.60% in the three years going into Thursday ranked in the top 16% of its large-cap growth rivals tracked by Morningstar Inc. But in calendar 2011 its 2.69% loss meant it trailed 56% of its peers.
"
372,IDXX,"This year the fund is up 9.81% vs. 9.15% for its category and 10.69% for the S&P 500.
"
373,IDXX,"Hal Goldstein, 53 years old, is co-lead manager with Scott Mullinix. James Diedrich is co-manager. Goldstein discussed his approach from his office in Minneapolis.
"
374,IDXX,"IBD: What are you doing differently this year?
"
375,IDXX,"Goldstein: We were challenged particularly in the fourth quarter. There was a rapid turn toward stocks that benefit from an economic recovery â lower-quality, more cyclical names. And that's the environment in which we do least well.
"
376,IDXX,"Our year was sort of respectable. We were in the middle of the pack.
"
377,IDXX,"IBD: And this year?
"
378,IDXX,"Goldstein: We won't do anything differently. We stay true to our process. There are occasions when our approach, like in Q4, is completely out of favor. But even when we underperform in a tough quarter, our long-term performance remained strong.
"
379,IDXX,"IBD: Have you fished for bargains?
"
380,IDXX,"Goldstein: Yes. Some of our favorite growth companies' earnings prospects have stayed strong while their valuations have been compressed. So we've added to or repurchased names after not having owned them for a bit.
"
381,IDXX,"IBD: Such as?
"
382,IDXX,"Goldstein: Citrix Systems (CTXS). They're involved in desktop virtualization. Much like the way that VMware (VMW), a provider of software behind virtualization servers, helps client enterprises with efficiency and cost reductions, Citrix lets enterprises purchase less powerful desktop computers for employees and manage the software more centrally. It's much less expensive than maintaining software on each desktop.
"
383,IDXX,"We sold Citrix last year because we felt the cycle for desktop virtualization was advancing at a slower pace than anticipated. The growth thesis was not coming true. But even when we sell a company, we keep monitoring it. It may get to a point where we want to buy it back. And since then we've seen more evidence that desktop virtualization is advancing, so we added it back.
"
384,IDXX,"IBD: What's another example?
"
385,IDXX,"Goldstein: Amazon (AMZN). We added to our holding this year. The reason is that while it has not been controversial that revenue growth has been strong, we believe Amazon is gaining share within online sales while at the same time online is gaining share from bricks-and-mortars.
"
386,IDXX,"Many investors were concerned that Amazon's profitability was permanently impaired as it made significant infrastructure investments and as its shipping costs as a percent of sales have gone up quite a bit.
"
387,IDXX,"We believe in Q1 there were signs that margins were at least stabilizing and perhaps showing early signs of improving.
"
388,IDXX,"IBD: Where is the bargain bin aspect?
"
389,IDXX,"Goldstein: It's hard to argue that Amazon is super cheap. But we felt it was attractively valued as growth continued and margins stabilized or improved. For example, shipping costs as a percent of sales declined for the first time in three years.
"
390,IDXX,"But, yes, we did add more stable companies because of the challenging economic environment.
"
391,IDXX,"IBD: Some examples, please.
"
392,IDXX,"Goldstein: In the consumer space, PetSmart (PETM). They have merchandizing initiatives that will allow for accelerating growth within each store. Same-store comps should improve. It's already happening to some degree. So there's an earnings upside surprise opportunity as well. If sales are better than expectations, that can lead profits above expectations.
"
393,IDXX,"In health care, Idexx Laboratories (IDXX) provides veterinary lab testing products. They benefit from the rising trend of pet adoptions.
"
394,IDXX,"We think rising pet adoptions is a sign of the economy being a little better. Employment trends are a little better. Housing is bottoming or improving. Residential rental activity is up. More people are moving out of their parents' homes and starting households.
"
395,IDXX,"IBD: In general, what's your approach?
"
396,IDXX,"Goldstein: First, we buy a subset of a highly selective universe of what we call exceptional growth companies. The subset is those companies for which our expectations most exceed consensus expectations.
"
397,IDXX,"Second, we develop a proprietary growth thesis for each holding.
"
398,IDXX,"We hold each investment for the vast majority of its opportunity. When that opportunity no longer exists, we sell. It's critically important to sell when it is appropriate.
"
399,IDXX,"One last thing we do is construct a balanced portfolio. Our objective is to dampen volatility.
"
400,IDXX,"IBD: You do that through diversification, right?
"
401,IDXX,"Goldstein: Yes. We diversify by sectors, by market capitalizations and by style.
"
402,IDXX,"IBD: What is style diversification?
"
403,IDXX,"Goldstein: We have cyclical growth names, more stable growth names and high growth companies.
"
404,IDXX,"We don't own many companies domiciled outside the U.S. But we have a meaningful number of holdings that have revenue exposure outside the U.S.
"
405,IDXX,"One way we don't diversify is by relative weighting. We don't allow ourselves to have more than 10 percentage points more or less than a sector's weighting in the Russell 1000 Growth Index. We're typically closer to the benchmark weighting than that.
"
406,IDXX,"And we allow ourselves as much as a 300 basis points overweight on any individual security. Again, in practice our largest overweights tend to average about 200 basis points.
"
407,IDXX,"IBD: Does your diversification within sectors reflect your style diversification?
"
408,IDXX,"Goldstein: Right. Our health care holdings, for example, are not all of the same type.
"
409,IDXX,"We own Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN), a fast-growing, high-multiple pharmaceutical company. The company is involved with ultrarare disease pharmaceuticals. We also own Gilead Sciences (GILD), which is involved with hepatitis C vaccines. And we own Vertex (VRTX), which is also involved with hepatitis C, but whose next opportunity is (the drug Kalydeco for) treatment of cystic fibrosis. Those biotech companies are developing tomorrow's cures.
"
410,IDXX,"Also, we own Perrigo (PRGO), which is a more stable company that is the leading maker of store-brand over-the-counter medicines.
"
411,IDXX,"IBD: Describe your diversification within another sector, such as consumer discretionary, please.
"
412,IDXX,"Goldstein: On the one hand we own Dollar Tree (DLTR) and TJX Cos. (TJX). Of course they benefit from the reality that more people are economically challenged and are trading down to dollar stores and discount stores.
"
413,IDXX,"On the other hand, we own Lululemon Athletica (LULU) and Coach (COH). Both of those are focused on a much higher-end demographic, more of a luxury end.
"
414,IDXX,"IBD: How does this approach show up in your largest sector, technology, with 33% of your assets?
"
415,IDXX,"Goldstein: On the one hand we have Apple (AAPL). Like Lululemon it is gaining meaningful, profitable market share and tends to sell higher priced products to a more affluent demographic.
"
416,IDXX,"On the other hand we own Accenture (ACN), which is a consulting and outsourcing company, which serves global Fortune 100 companies. Apple is consumer focused. Accenture is enterprise focused, helping clients cut costs.
"
417,IDXX,"We also have Visa (V) and MasterCard (MA), which fall into the tech sector but aren't tech per se. But they do use a lot of technology in what they do. They're really about increasing the use of plastic globally as a method of payment. There's terrific profitability that accrues to Visa and MasterCard. The more that people swipe cards, the incremental costs to Visa and MasterCard are way below their incremental revenues. It's a terrific margin opportunity.
"
418,IDXX,"IBD: Apple's recent quarterly earnings report disappointed. Do you see a long-term problem?
"
419,IDXX,"Goldstein: We don't believe it's a sign of any long-term crack. Our thesis is that they will gain profitable global market share in consumer electronics. When we first bought Apple, all it meant was Mac computers. Now they have mobile phones, and a new category they invented, tablets. All of that is still intact.
"
420,IDXX,"One reason there was a pause (in Apple stock performance) is that many consumers are waiting for the next iteration of the iPhone before updating. I'm one of them. Pent-up demand for the iPhone 5 is large, not only among existing iPhone users but also among consumers who don't own an iPhone. So it's a temporary pause (in sales) before a bigger ramp-up later this year and next year.
"
421,IDXX,"IBD: Teradata (TDC) has four quarters of 25% or higher earnings per share growth. What's your thesis?
"
422,IDXX,"Goldstein: They benefit from the proliferation of data. They sell hard and software combinations that let very large enterprises collect and analyze large amounts of data, which in turn they use to make strategic decisions.
"
423,IDXX,"Demand for data analytics and their other services is very strong. So we love their top-line growth. We look for companies with top-line growth, not just margin improvement.
"
424,IDXX,"IBD: Netsuite's (N) EPS growth jumped to 100% and 200% the past two quarters. What's your take?
"
425,IDXX,"Goldstein: This is one of our emerging high growth, high valuation companies.
"
426,IDXX,"They're in software-as-a-service, so it's a cloud play. Like Salesforce.com (CRM) they benefit from enterprises that want to get business-critical software through cloud delivery. It's software on a buy-as-you-need-it basis, rather than owning an old-fashioned in-house suite of software.
"
427,IDXX,"IBD: Is Cerner's (CERN) story basically the shift to electronic health care records?
"
428,IDXX,"Goldstein: Cerner is one of the leading public companies in health care information technology. They have a strong backlog, whether it's due to government regulatory changes or merely a reflection of economics encouraging hospitals to automate and digitize. This is a really well run, leading health care IT company.
"
429,IDXX,"IBD: Monster Beverage (MNST) has two quarters of accelerating EPS growth. What's your view?
"
430,IDXX,"Goldstein: Monster has done well and is still attractive. They are gaining share within the energy drink market. Their international opportunities are sizable. As they mature internationally, there's a nice margin improvement opportunity as well. We own it for reasons other than it might get purchased by, for example, Coke (KO). But we're not betting on that.
"
431,IDXX,"IBD: Whole Foods (WFM) has exploded off its recession trough. How much more can this specialty market grow?
"
432,IDXX,"Goldstein: We believe there is still a lot of room to run. Their same-store sales in a tough economy suggest they deliver what American consumers want. Comps were up 8% (in fiscal Q3). The rise in store-level operating margins shows great discipline. We expect they will continue to grow their store base. Combined with same-store growth, you get meaningful profit growth.
"
433,IDXX,"IBD: GNC's (GNC) EPS growth has slowed for two quarters. Do they need a shot of Geritol?
"
434,IDXX,"Goldstein: In the most recent quarter, same-store sales were up almost 13%, which is higher than most retailers.
"
435,IDXX,"Secondly, their opportunity to grow internationally attracts us.
"
436,IDXX,"We think earnings estimates will rise the rest of this year and most of next year. Collectively, all of those factors point to an attractive opportunity.The $570 million Nuveen Large Cap Growth Opportunities is a top echelon portfolio, seeking to resume its winning ways after having hit a rough patch in 2011.The fund's average annual gain of 14.60% in the three years going into Thursday ranked in the top 16% of its large-cap growth rivals tracked by Morningstar Inc.

521,IDXX,"The U.S. Medical Device industry trend in 2018 is reflective of extensive discovery and innovation in the life sciences industry over the past few years.Per a study published by CNBC, medical device companies have gained importance in the healthcare world on improved research and development (R&D) of technology. Far-reaching innovation like gene therapy, newer drug combinations, patient monitoring with the help of big data this year will shape up the medical fraternity of the United States.Tax Suspension to Fuel R&DThe Medical Device market has further gained momentum owing to the recent two-year suspension of the controversial 2.3% Medical Device tax. The 2.3% excise tax was implemented in 2013 as part of Obamacare on MedTech manufacturers, significantly restricting R&D activities.According to an article published in Xtalks, the Medical Device tax was responsible for a $34-million reduction in R&D spending along with a $188-million decline in overall sales.However, it is to be seen whether the tax will be fully eliminated or resumed after the two-year period. For now, the deferral will encourage R&D activity in this space, which bodes well for MedTech companies.Notably, in the past month, the medical instruments industry has rallied 3.8% against the S&P 500 indexâs return of 1.5%.R&D Leads to Revolution in MedTechThe MedTech space currently offers unprecedented opportunities for growth and market share expansion. Solid investment in R&D has helped manufacturers use the benefits from big data, artificial intelligence (AI) and medical mechatronics.The industry is also catching up with the digital-data age. Enormous size of data can be captured through technology for arriving at business insights. This helps the healthcare sector provide better care and reduce wastage. The latest trend of adopting electronic health record (EHR) services in the U.S. MedTech space has also been gaining popularity.Some of the major HCIT (Healthcare I.T.) bigwigs, which have carved out a niche in the big-data domain, are Cerner Corporation and athenahealth, Inc. These companies are making significant investments in R&D to boost up their EHR platforms.Meanwhile, medical Mechatronics is a much-awaited digital evolution in the global healthcare industry, providing innovation to the healthcare industry through reduction in the size of the age-old medical devices and development of low-cost disposable devices.Engineering concern eInfochips believes that mechatronics is the future of medical devices. The benefits of Mechatronics have been seen in the form of 3D printing, cancer study and development of better medication for deadly diseases.Notably, Intuitive Surgicalâs (ISRG  -  Free Report) minimally-invasive da Vinci surgical system and Stryker Corporationâs (SYK  -  Free Report) robotic-arm assisted surgery platform, Mako, deserve a mention here.Choosing the Winning StocksGiven the favorable scenario, investment in Medical Device stocks with strong potential seems to be a wise choice.

IDEXX Laboratories has gained 35.7% since the start of the year compared to the -3.4% move for the Medical sector and the -8.5% year-to-date return for its peer group.What's Driving the Outperformance?The stock has a great record of positive earnings surprises, having beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on May 4, 2018, IDEXX Laboratories reported EPS of $1.01 versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.93 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 2.18%.For the current fiscal year, IDEXX Laboratories is expected to post earnings of $4.11 per share on $2.22 billion in revenues. This represents a 25.3% change in EPS on a 12.56% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $4.86 per share on $2.44 billion in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 18.1% and 10.07%, respectively.Valuation MetricsIDEXX Laboratories may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for IDXX? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level.On this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as these give investors a variety of ways to comb through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.IDEXX Laboratories has a Value Score of D. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are A and B, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of B.In terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 51.6X current fiscal year EPS estimates. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 49.1X versus its peer group's average of 21.5X. Additionally, the stock has a PEG ratio of 2.57. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. Price and ConsensusÂ  IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. Price and Consensus | IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. QuoteZacks RankWe also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, IDEXX Laboratories currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) thanks to rising earnings estimates.Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if IDEXX Laboratories passes the test. Thus, it seems as though IDXX shares could have a bit more room to run in the near term.How Does IDEXX Laboratories Stack Up to the Competition?Shares of IDEXX Laboratories have been moving higher, and the company still appears to be a decent choice, but what about the rest of the industry? Some of its industry peers are also looking good, including iRadimed (IRMD  -  Free Report), Integer Holdings (ITGR  -  Free Report), and Varian Medical Systems (VAR  -  Free Report), all of which currently have a Zacks Rank of at least #2 and a VGM Score of at least B, making them well-rounded choices.However, it is worth noting that the Zacks Industry Rank for this group is in the bottom half of the ranking, so it isn't all good news for IDEXX Laboratories. Still, the fundamentals for IDXX are promising, and it still has potential despite being at a 52-week high.

534,IDXX,"âGrowth based on debt is unsustainable, artificialâ â Jose Manuel Barroso.With capital being one of the basic requirements for production, companies need exogenous funds to finance their corporate expenses, run operations smoothly as well as expand the realm of their business. This is because depending solely on retained earnings for business growth is next to impossible.It is worth noting that among equity and debt â the two most common options used to boost a companyâs future earnings â debt is the more popular one. This is perhaps due to the cheap and easy availability of debt over equity financing. Moreover, interest on debt is tax deductible, which makes it an attractive option.However, debt financing has its own drawbacks. The problem arises when leverage, referred to as the amount of debt a company bears, becomes exorbitant. In particular, companies with large debt loads are more vulnerable during economic downturns and can even go bankrupt in the worst case scenario.Of course, this does not mean that debt financing, which is an inherent instrument for corporations to grow their earnings, should be a taboo in corporate financing.Nevertheless, given the current macroeconomic scenario in the United States, in favor of interest rate hikes, the market seems to be not so suitable for borrowers. In March 2018, the Federal Reserve raised rates for the sixth time since the policymaking Federal Open Market Committee began lifting rates from near zero in December 2015.Therefore, to be on the safe side, investors should try to avoid stocks that bear large debt loads. Empirically, several leverage ratios have been constructed to measure the exact amount of debt risk a company faces in order to safeguard investors from debt traps.Debt-to-equity ratio is one such measure, perhaps the most popular one, which has been used to evaluate a companyâs credit worthiness, for potential equity investments.Analyzing Debt/EquityDebt-to-Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities/Shareholdersâ EquityThis metric is a liquidity ratio that indicates the amount of financial risk a company bears. A company with a lower debt-to-equity ratio indicates improved solvency for a company.With the first-quarter reporting cycle in full swing right now, investors must be targeting stocks that are exhibiting solid earnings growth. But if the stocks bear a high debt-to-equity ratio, in times of economic downturns, their so-called booming earnings picture might turn into a nightmare.Considering this, it will be wise for investors to select companies with low leverage. These are financially more secure and immune to financial bankruptcy.The Winning StrategyConsidering the aforementioned factors, it is wise to choose stocks with a low debt-to-equity ratio to ensure safe returns.However, an investment strategy based solely on the debt-to-equity ratio might not fetch the desired outcome. To choose stocks that have the potential to give you steady returns, we have expanded our screening criteria to include some other factors.Here are the other parameters:Debt/Equity less than X-Industry Median:Â Stocks that are less leveraged than their industry peers.Current Price greater than or equal to 10:Â The stocks must be trading at a minimum of $10 or above.Average 20-day Volume greater than or equal to 50000:Â A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.Percentage Change in EPS F(0)/F(-1) greater than X-Industry Median:Â Earnings growth adds to optimism, leading to a stockâs price appreciation.VGMÂ Score of A or B:Â Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) offer the best upside potential.Estimated One-Year EPS Growth F(1)/F(0) greater than 5:Â This shows earnings growth expectation.Zacks Rank #1 or 2:Â Irrespective of market conditions, stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 have a proven history of success.Excluding stocks that have a negative or a zero debt-to-equity ratio, here are five of the 40 stocks that made it through the screen.Louisiana-Pacific CorporationÂ (LPX  -  Free Report): The company manufactures building materials and engineered wood products in the United States, Canada, Chile and Brazil.

535,IDXX,"IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.Â (IDXX  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report its first-quarter 2018 results on May 4, before the opening bell. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 5.48%. Notably, the stock has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the preceding four quarters, the average beat being 7.3%.Letâs take a look at how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Key CatalystsÂ IDEXX is expected to continue with its gain momentum in the first quarter, courtesy of a strong global rise in Companion Animal Group (CAG) Diagnosticsâ revenues. Last time, this upside was driven by consistent strong double-digit growth in reference labs and consumables plus owing to a high-single-digit increase registered in rapid assay sales. Management vouches for this trend to be retained further.IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. QuoteÂ We are also upbeat about IDEXX enhancing its commercial capabilities in the United States to maintain recurring revenue growth at CAG Diagnostics. We expect first-quarter results to reflect a rise in productivity as new sales representatives establish fresh customer relationships. Also, we anticipate the company to report exceptional customer retention rates for reference labs as well as instrument consumables in the United States and worldwide.The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $460 million for CAG Diagnostics revenues represents a 5.9% improvement from the last-reported quarter.Notably, IDEXXâs 13-14.5% revenue growth projection for the quarter to be reported Â highlights its organic gains of 9.5-10.5%. Overall, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the total quarterly revenues is pegged at $525 million..Other factors predicted to influence IDEXXâs first-quarter results are:We pin considerable hopes on progress in the Water Business, lying on a growth trajectory of late, backed by encouraging test results in the United States as well as benefits drawn from the global go-direct initiatives. Moreover, the business witnessed 16% organic growth last quarter. Management also eyes gains from two favorable regulatory developments pertaining to wastewater in the United States and drinking water in Europe. The company earlier stated that it is perfectly on track for a continued high-single digit organic revenue boost in this business through 2018. The consensus mark for Water revenues stands at $28.3 million for the yet-to-be-reported quarter.IDEXX carries on to expand its global footprint. It has been significantly drawing advantages from the bountiful opportunities in the emerging companion animal diagnostics markets. Further, managementâs consistent share buybacks underscores its robust free cash flow reserve. We believe the outcome of these endeavors will bear reflection on first-quarter conference call.On the flip side, foreign currency fluctuation is a major headwind. Another concern is the companyâs heavy reliance on third-party distributors. The purchasing dynamics of distributors leave a significant impact on the companyâs sales of instrument consumables as well as its rapid assay products. Moreover, IDEXX has been witnessing a rise in operating expenses due to increased head count along with higher investments in portfolio development and expansion in the United States plus internationally.Additionally, a competitive landscape in the domestic and overseas markets weighs on IDEXXâs performance. Thus, the struggle to gain market traction might be a drag on first-quarter results.Hereâs what the quantitative model predicts:Per the proven Zacks model, a company with a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has higher chances of beating estimates if it also has a positive Earnings ESP.IDEXX has a Zacks Rank #2, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the companyâs Earnings ESP of -0.90% leaves our surprise prediction inconclusive.We caution against the Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before theyâre reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Stocks Worth a LookHere are a few medical stocks worth considering with the right combination of elements to surpass estimates this time around:Baxter International Inc. (BAX  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.86% and is a Zacks #2 Ranked player.Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings (LH  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +1.52% and a Zacks Rank of 2.Stryker Corporation (SYK  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.13% and is a #2 Ranked player.

539,IDXX,"Companies with favorable efficiency levels are likely to be on investorsâ radar irrespective of market conditions. This is because a company with a favorable efficiency level is expected to provide impressive returns as it is believed to be positively correlated with its price performance.Key Ratios to Identify EfficiencySometimes it becomes difficult to measure the efficiency level of a company. This is the reason why one must consider popular efficiency ratios while selecting stocks. These efficiency ratios are:Inventory Turnover: The ratio of 12-month cost of goods sold (COGS) to a four-quarter average inventory is considered one of the most popular efficiency ratios. It indicates a companyâs ability to maintain a suitable inventory position. While a high value indicates that the company has a relatively low level of inventory compared to COGS, a low value indicates that the company is facing declining sales, which resulted in excess inventory.Â Receivables Turnover: Â This is the ratio of 12-month sales to four-quarter average receivables. It shows a companyâs potential to extend its credit and collect debt in terms of that credit. A high receivables turnover ratio or the âaccounts receivable turnover ratioâ or âdebtorâs turnover ratioâ is desirable as it shows that the company is capable of collecting its accounts receivables or that it has quality customers.Asset Utilization: This ratio indicates a companyâs capability to convert assets into output and is thus a widely known measure of efficiency level. It is calculated by dividing total sales over the past 12 months by the last four-quarter average of total assets. Like the above ratios, high asset utilization may indicate that a company is efficient.Operating Margin: This efficiency measure is the ratio of operating income over the past 12 months to sales over the same period. It measures a companyâs ability to control operating expenses. Hence, a high value of the ratio may indicate that the company manages its operating expenses more efficiently than its peers.Screening ParametersIn addition to the above-mentioned ratios, we have added a favorable Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) to the screen with an objective to make this strategy more profitable. You can see the complete list of todayâs Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Inventory Turnover, Receivables Turnover, Asset Utilization and Operating Margin greater than industry average (Values of these ratios higher than industry averages may indicate that the efficiency level of the company is higher than its peers.)Â Â Â Â The use of these few criteria has narrowed down the universe of over 7,906 stocks to only 14.Here are five stocks from the 14 that made it through the screen:Chemed Corporation (CHE  -  Free Report) provides hospice and palliative care services in the United States.

540,IDXX,"Have you been paying attention to shares of LeMaitre Vascular (LMAT  -  Free Report)? Shares have been on the move with the stock up 12.2% over the past month. LMAT hit a new 52-week high of $41.28 in the previous session. LeMaitre Vascular has gained 25.8% since the start of the year compared to the -2.2% move for the Medical sector and the 3.8% year-to-date return for its peer group.What's Driving the Outperformance?The stock has an impressive record of positive earnings surprises, having beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on February 21, 2018, LeMaitre Vascular reported EPS of $0.21 versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.19 while it missed the consensus revenue estimate by 0.5%.For the current fiscal year, LeMaitre Vascular is expected to post earnings of $0.98 per share on $111.06 million in revenues. This represents a 13.95% change in EPS on a 10.1% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $1.12 per share on $122.35 million in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 14.96% and 10.17%, respectively.Valuation MetricsLeMaitre Vascular may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for LMAT? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level.On this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM score as well. The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.LeMaitre Vascular has a Value Score of D. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are A and B, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of B.In terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 41X current fiscal year EPS estimates. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 36.4X versus its peer group's average of 19.4X. Additionally, the stock has a PEG ratio of 2.73. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.LeMaitre Vascular, Inc. Price and ConsensusÂ  LeMaitre Vascular, Inc. Price and Consensus | LeMaitre Vascular, Inc. QuoteZacks RankWe also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, LeMaitre Vascular currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) thanks to rising earnings estimates.Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if LeMaitre Vascular fits the bill. Thus, it seems as though LMAT shares could have potential in the weeks and months to come.How Does LeMaitre Vascular Stack Up to the Competition?Shares of LeMaitre Vascular have been soaring, and the company still appears to be a decent choice, but what about the rest of the industry? Some of its industry peers are also looking good, including Stryker Corporation (SYK  -  Free Report), ICU Medical (ICUI  -  Free Report), and IDEXX Laboratories (IDXX  -  Free Report), all of which currently have a Zacks Rank of at least #2 and a VGM Score of at least B, making them well-rounded choices.However, it is worth noting that the Zacks Industry Rank for this group is in the bottom half of the ranking, so it isn't all good news for LeMaitre Vascular. Still, the fundamentals for LMAT are promising, and it still has potential despite being at a 52-week high.

541,IDXX,"The S&P 500, which had more than tripled on Mar 9 after a grueling spell following the Great Recession, is now on the second-longest and second-highest bull market run in history. The bull run through the 1990s has been the longest. Stocks scaled new highs on Republican tax cuts and robust economic growth at home and abroad.But, recent trade war tensions, uproar in the White House, higher interest rates and half a trillion dollars of loss for tech stocks in just over a two-week span have pushed the index back to critical support at its 200-day moving average. The S&P, in fact, fell into correction territory, while volatility has more than doubled so far this year.Not all S&P stocks are, however, facing a tumultuous Q1. Some of them have been able to dish out impressive year-to-date gains and have remained unperturbed by the higher bouts of gyrations.What Backed the S&P Rally?The S&P started Q1 on a positive note. Trumpâs polices, including tax cuts, repealing regulations and increased infrastructure outlays restored expectations of a pro-growth agenda that helped the S&P move north.The latest tax laws gave companies massive tax relief as they will now be paying between 8% and 15.5% instead of the earlier 35% for bringing back money held overseas. This means around $1.2 trillion in foreign profits that the S&P 500 companies are hoarding be brought back. This in turn can be used to create jobs and reward shareholders â something the Trump administration has been aiming for since the campaigns days.Trumpâs economy is also in good shape, with the jobless rate near a 17-year low. Initial jobless claims remained near the lowest level since 1970 and the number of people collecting unemployment benefits tanked to a fresh 45-year low.But, there is another major factor behind the strong American growth. Itâs the global economic growth, with every major country from China to Europe and Latin America to Japan expanding at a healthy pace. According to the International Monetary Fund, the global economy expanded at rate of 3.7% last year, the fastest since 2010.S&P Ends Q1 on a Sour NoteSelling in stocks intensified after the Trump administration announced that it will levy tariffs on tens of billions of dollars of Chinese imports on top of imposing duties on foreign steel and aluminum. In response to Trumpâs tariffs, Beijing said that it will target 128 U.S. products with an import value of $3 billion. Investors panicked as a full-blown trade war might deal a heavy blow to economies, resulting in widespread unemployment.A number of high-profile departures from the Trump administration, in the meantime, pushed political-risk to the highest level since the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Such events threatened to upset the Trump administrationâs business-friendly policies.Amid all these, the Fedhas tightened its monetary policy. At the conclusion of the FOMC meeting on Mar 21, Jerome Powell-led Federal Reserve hiked interest rates by a quarter-percentage point and projected a steeper path of rate hikes in 2019 and 2020. This hasnât gone down well with investors as we all know that they had piled up on U.S. stocks with the notion that quantitative easing will help the domestic economy grow at a better rate than emerging economies like China.Adding to the downbeat tone is also a sharp selloff in the technology sector. Investors remained concerned about tighter regulations for large tech companies. The sector took a beating following the backlash over Facebook, Incâs (FB  -  Free Report) handling of user data. Everyone raised questions as to how Cambridge Analytica, which worked on Trumpâs election campaign, had gained access to personal data on roughly 50 million Facebook users without their knowledge.The S&P tech sector, which was the most crowded trade of the year, peaked on Mar 12 to 1,233.93, putting its market cap at about $6 trillion. However, the market cap is currently down to nearly $5.5 trillion, a decline of 8.8%, per WSJ Market Data Group.5 Best S&P 500 Stocks of Q1The S&P, now, has fallen more than 10% from its peak in January. The average number of stocks on the index is almost 15% below the 52-week high, while the average stock in some of the sectors are already in bear-market territory, defined as a decline of 20%, as per Bespoke Investment Group.Despite the brutal selloff of the past few weeks, some stocks have managed to give encouraging returns, thanks to a great story or maybe a little luck. Here is the rundown of the best stocks from the S&P 500 in Q1. These stocks also flaunt a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).Seagate Technology plc (STX  -  Free Report) provides data storage technology and solutions the United States and internationally. Even though the company is part of the larger tech sector, traders have been ploughing back into STX stock. The stock has a Zacks Rank #1. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings rose 12.5% in the last 60 days. The company is expected to give a solid return of 18.2% this year. Seagate Technology has outperformed the broader industry in the year-to-date period (+36% vs +17.4%).Considering Seagate Technology has done so well in Q1, it comes as no surprise that close-cousin Micron Technology, Inc.âs (MU  -  Free Report) performance has been pretty encouraging. The provider of semiconductor systems has a Zacks Rank #2. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings rose 11.8% in the last 60 days. Micron Technology is expected to give a staggering return of 121.6% this year, while the stock has already given a steady return of 25.2% in the year-to-date period.IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. (IDXX  -  Free Report) develops, manufactures, and distributes products and services primarily for the companion animal veterinary, livestock and poultry, dairy, and water testing markets.

542,IDXX,"Baxter International Inc. (BAX  -  Free Report) has had an impressive run on the bourses of late. Last year, the company has added 46.9%, outperforming the broader industryâs gain of 24.9%. The current level is also higher than the S&P 500âs return of 19.9%. Recurring revenue stream, expanding product portfolio and strong presence in the international markets are key positives. The stock has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Here we take a sneak peek at the major factors driving growth for Baxter at the moment:The year 2017 has been a favorable one for Baxter on the regulatory front. Recently, management confirmed that the FDA has granted two new approvals for temporary importation of certain drugs from the facilities in Canada and Mexico. With this development, Baxter now has four operational sites approved to meet demand in the U.S. markets.Furthermore, the FDA approval of new premixed injectables is a key catalyst. The companyâs new product â the home peritoneal dialysis (PD) technology â also received an FDA nod. The platform leverages on Baxterâs flagship AMIA automated peritoneal dialysis (APD) system.In the recent past, Baxter achieved a regulatory milestone for its advanced dialysis technology. The company received an approval from the FDA for its home PD solution system to improve patient access to home dialysis.Baxter has a strong presence in foreign markets which makes international diversification a core component of its strategy. In a bid to fortify its overseas presence, the company has launched the oXIRIS set for continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) and sepsis management protocols in select markets of Europe, Middle East and Africa.Notably, oXIRIS, which leverages on the companyâs flagship PRISMAFLEX system, is expected to lend Baxter a competitive edge in the global market. With a large proportion of sales coming from overseas markets, Baxter should benefit from developing countries' incremental investments in health care systems. Recent acquisitions position the company well for revenue growth in the rapidly-expanding Asian and Latin American markets.Â Â Other Key PicksA few other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are PetMed Express (PETS  -  Free Report), Luminex Corporation (LMNX  -  Free Report) and IDEXX Laboratories (IDXX  -  Free Report).Notably, PetMed Express sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

543,IDXX,"IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. (IDXX  -  Free Report) has been gaining investor confidence on consistently positive results. The stock has surged 31% over a year, ahead of the S&P 500âs 25.8% gain and the broader industryâs 25.8% rally.Moreover, the company has a market cap of $17.45 billion. Its five-year historical growth rate is also favorable at 15.9% compared with the industryâs 10.2%.Dwelling on solid prospects, this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock is an attractive bet for investors at the moment.The companyâs estimate revision trend for 2018 has been positive.

The consensus mark for earnings increased around 11.4% to $4.11 per share.Per our Style Score, IDEXX Laboratories sports a Growth Score of A, reflective of the companyâs strong fundamentals. Our research shows that stocks with an impressive Growth Style Score of A or B combined with a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 offer the best upside potential.IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. Price IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. Price | IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. QuoteÂ In this regard, IDEXX Laboratories has a favorable Net Margin (Net Income/Sales) of 13.4% against the industryâs negative 12.9%. Also, the companyâs sale to assets ratio of 1.19 compared with the industryâs 0.64 signifies it as a sturdy growth pick.Letâs find out whether the recent positive momentum is a sustainable one.The company is a leading manufacturer of products and services primarily for the companion animal veterinary, livestock and poultry. It exited the fourth quarter on a promising note. Stable year-over-year growth in organic revenues is also encouraging.The stockâs stellar performance was driven by robust sales at the CAG (Companion Animal Group)business. In the fourth quarter of 2017, CAG organic revenues rose low double digits on the back of strong CAG Diagnostics recurring organic revenue growth and VetLab consumables organic revenue growth. Additionally, we are upbeat about the companyâs expanding premium instrument base in the United States and the international markets including improved competitive instrument placements, increasing utilization and continued customer retention.In this regard, we are also optimistic about gains from the commercial launch of Catalyst SDMA Test in North America in January 2018. With this breakthrough, the companyâs point-of-care customers will be able to add SDMA as an essential element to the routine chemistry panel.Continuing with a slew of developments, IDEXX Laboratories entered into a global agreement this January with the diagnostic company Applied BioCode. Per the agreement, IDEXX Laboratories will bring its Reference Laboratories customers on the digital multiplex platform built by Applied BioCode.

Managementâs innovation-based, multi-modality global strategy accelerated recurring CAG Diagnostics revenue growth in the reported quarter. Moreover, substantial top-line growth in the quarter was driven by considerable contributions from other business segments. Furthermore, a raised guidance for 2018 earnings per share instills confidence in the stock.We are also upbeat about the company witnessing double-digit organic revenue growth in the international business. This upside reflected consistent consumable revenue gains supported by a Catalyst instrument base and average testing utilization.Additionally, the company has a secure cash balance, allowing it toÂ carry out share repurchases.Meanwhile, IDEXX Laboratoriesâ heavy reliance on third-party distributors raises a concern. Moreover, a tough competitive landscape in the domestic and overseas markets weighs on the companyâs margin.Other Key PicksSome other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are Bio-Rad Laboratories (BIO  -  Free Report), athenahealth, Inc.

In addition, management experienced steady growth in reference labs led by consistent gains in Europe.Â Furthermore, CAG organic revenue growth in low-double digits on strong VetLab consumables and CAG Diagnostics recurring organic revenue growth is impressive. We are also optimistic about the companyâs expanding premium instrument base in the United States and international markets, including growth in competitive instrument placements, increasing utilization and continued customer retention.Moving ahead, we expect the company to gain from the commercial launch of Catalyst SDMA Test in North America in January. IDEXX too entered into a global agreement with a diagnostic company â Applied BioCodeÂ­ â in the same month.Moreover, IDEXX has a strong cash balance that allows it toÂ carry out share repurchases.

545,IDXX,"Varian Medical (VAR  -  Free Report) recently announced its partnership with Penn Medicine to develop and launch a comprehensive proton therapy training and education program. Management at Varian confirmed that training and online courses will be available from January 2018.The latest development is likely to enhance the knowledge and skills of clinicians and therapists in the global proton therapy space. In fact, continued education and training are likely to boost the availability of proton therapy products in the niche markets.The Proton Therapy Space at a GlanceProton therapy or proton beam therapy is a type of particle therapy that uses a beam of protons to treat diseased tissue, most often in the cases of cancer. A research report by the CISION PR Newswire suggests that the global proton therapy systems market is expected to reach $2.88 billion by 2025.Favorable reimbursement policies in the United States and Europe and rising awareness in cancer-related healthcare policies along with expenditures in emerging nations are likely to propel the proton therapy space in the long haul. In fact, various reports suggest that this proton therapy space will be dominated by the United States, thanks to its massive investment in the development of therapy centers.Now coming to the leading players in the space, Hitachi, Ion Beam Applications, Mevion Medical Systems and Sumitomo also deserve a mention. Meanwhile, proton therapy market is growing in manifolds and expects to witness a stellar demand in the coming days.Varianâs Strong FootholdApart from enjoying a dominant market share in conventional radiotherapy, we believe proton therapy also holds significant promise for Varian. This is because the companyâs flagship â ProBeam Compact Proton Therapy System â is superior to other external beam radiotherapies available in the markets.ProBeam precisely locates cancerous tumors, thereby causing lesser side-effects to surrounding tissues. In this regard, Varianâs proton therapy portfolio has products like ProBeam Proton Therapy System, ProBeam Compact Single-Room Proton Therapy Solution, ProBeam Multi-Room Proton Therapy Solution.However, the company has seen lackluster performance at the proton therapy segment recently. In the last quarter, revenues at the segment were $52 million, down 23% on a year-over-year basis. In the quarter, Varian booked two orders including the Concord Medical Proton Center in Guangzhou, China for $52 million and HCG in India for $19 million. Yet, proton therapy orders grew 94% in the same period, on a year-over year basis.We believe such developments might help Varian to gain traction in the niche space.Shares Shine BrightOver the past six months, Varian outperformed the broader industry in terms of price performance. The company returned 15.1% comparing favorably with the broader industryâs gain of just 6.7%. Also, the current return is higher than the S&P 500âs gain of 7.2% over the same time frame.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderVarian has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).A few other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are PetMed Express (PETS  -  Free Report), Luminex Corporation (LMNX  -  Free Report) and IDEXX Laboratories (IDXX  -  Free Report).Notably, PetMed Express sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

546,IDXX,"On Nov 28, we issued an updated research report on Stryker Corporation (SYK  -  Free Report). The companyâs acquisition-driven strategy is expected to boost growth by expanding existing product offerings across all business segments.However, challenging global economic conditions, supply side issues, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and a strengthening dollar are likely to dent top-line growth in the near term.

549,IDXX,"Companies with favorable efficiency levels are likely to be on investorsâ radar irrespective of market conditions as price performance is believed to be positively correlated with efficiency. Efficiency, a companyâs ability to transform inputs into outputs, is a potential indicator of a companyâs financial health.Key Ratios to Identify EfficiencySometimes it becomes difficult to measure the efficiency level of a company. This is the reason why one must consider popular efficiency ratios while selecting stocks. These efficiency ratios are:Inventory Turnover: The ratio of 12-month cost of goods sold (COGS) to a four-quarter average inventory is considered one of the most popular efficiency ratios. It indicates a companyâs ability to maintain a suitable inventory position. While a high value indicates that the company has a relatively low level of inventory compared to COGS, a low value indicates that the company is facing declining sales, which resulted in excess inventory.Â Receivables Turnover: Â This is the ratio of 12-month sales to four-quarter average receivables. It shows a companyâs potential to extend its credit and collect debt in terms of that credit. A high receivables turnover ratio or the âaccounts receivable turnover ratioâ or âdebtorâs turnover ratioâ is desirable as it shows that the company is capable of collecting its accounts receivables or that it has quality customers.Asset Utilization: This ratio indicates a companyâs capability to convert assets into output and is thus a widely known measure of efficiency level. It is calculated by dividing total sales over the past 12 months by the last four-quarter average of total assets. Like the above ratios, high asset utilization may indicate that a company is efficient.Operating Margin: This efficiency measure is the ratio of operating income over the past 12 months to sales over the same period. It measures a companyâs ability to control operating expenses. Hence, a high value of the ratio may indicate that the company manages its operating expenses more efficiently than its peers.Screening ParametersIn addition to the above-mentioned ratios, we have added a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) to the screen with an objective to make this strategy more profitable.Inventory Turnover, Receivables Turnover, Asset Utilization and Operating Margin greater than industry average(Values of these ratios higher than industry averages may indicate that the efficiency level of the company is higher than its peers.)Â Â Â The use of these few criteria has narrowed down the universe of over 7,906 stocks to only 22.Here are five stocks from the 22 that made it through the screen:Lululemon Athletica (LULU  -  Free Report), an athletic apparel company, together with its subsidiaries, designs, distributes, and retails athletic apparel and accessories for women, men, and female youth.

553,IDXX,"The latest $1.5-trillion tax reform plan has been a landmark achievement for President Trump. As usual, in its initial stage, the nation gave mixed reactions on the controversial bill. While a few Americans slammed the new plan as a âjob killer,' others found it to be âan excellent opportunity to fix a broken tax code.'While the bill claims to primarily focus on the easing of tax woes for middle-class Americans, the massive cut in corporate taxes tells a different story altogether. In fact, a research report by CNBC reveals that Frank Clemente, executive director of Americans for Tax Fairness, slammed the new tax code as a ""a big giveaway to millionaires and corporations,"" neglecting the ones who are in real need of it.Now, it is to be seen whether the bill is fated to meet an overall failure or it gets to fulfill its promises of âinclusive economic growthâ.Whatâs in it for MedTech?âThey are cutting taxes on the wealthy and taking health care away from millions,â â Senate Democratic Minority Leader Chuck Schumer.Customer Base to ShrinkWhile the reduction in corporate taxes will encourage the development of expensive cutting-edge MedTech products, the question over its profitability looms large. This is because with a higher number of uninsured and lesser deductions on healthcare costs, the industry is likely to witness a shrinking customer base, indicating a decline in demand for expensive medical procedures and devices.Tax Decision on MedTech Devices ImpendingThe MedTech community has been hopeful since Trump proposed policies that entailed the abolition of the infamous 2.3% medical device sales tax. Such high taxes forced companies to lay off employees, limit research and development activities, and reduce capital investment.Furthermore, AdvaMed, a leading American medical device trade association, had referred to the medical device tax as a âsignificant drag on medical innovationâ. Notably, small device companies suffered the most. Amid such worries, a repeal of the tax paradigm is expected to resume an aggressive pace of hiring and investment among the 9,000 America-based medical device manufacturers, instilling investor confidence in the stocks.Per data provided by the medical device trade group (in a Ken Blackwell article published by The Daily Caller), the partial two-year repeal of the MedTech tax had resulted in a roughly 83% rise in research and development (R&D) investments by MedTech players. The comeback of the tax in 2018 will lead to a $15 billion rise in taxes, largely discouraging R&D activities. Undoubtedly, the future of the U.S. MedTech industry depends on the Republicansâ decision on the 2.3% medical device tax.Key PicksPer Trump, the democrats have established a âlousy healthcareâ model. However, with a complete medical device tax renovation, it is being widely believed that a new set of streamlined rules will benefit the medical device space.Meanwhile, stocks with strong fundamentals will give you assured returns amid this tax conundrum. We have zeroed in on five stocks that sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and boast strong fundamentals. Notably, all these stocks promise long-term expected earnings growth rate of 10% or more.IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.

A strong guidance for fiscal 2017 instills our confidence in the stock. Cooper recently completed the acquisition of Procornea. This added a leading ortho-k technology to Cooperâs lens portfolio and marked its foray into the emerging myopia controlled markets.The stock has a Zacks Rank #2 and an expected earnings growth rate of 10.8%. Over the last year, the stock has added 43.9%, much higher than the broader industryâs 19.9%.Â Â Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars? Here's another stock idea to consider.

554,IDXX,"IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.Â (IDXX  -  Free Report) is expected to beat earnings when it reports fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 1, before the opening bell.Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 5.3%. It is worth noting that IDEXX has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the preceding four quarters, the average being 9.4%. Letâs take a look at how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Key CatalystSimilar to the prior quarter, IDEXX is expected to gain from strong global growth in Companion Animal Group (CAG) Diagnostics recurring revenues. The upside was driven by double-digit organic revenue gains across consumable and reference lab, strong acceptance of rapid assays and veterinary software, services and diagnostic imaging systems as well as continued expansion of IDEXX's premium instrument installed base. Management expects the solid performance to reflect in the fourth-quarter results as well.We are also upbeat about IDEXX enhancing commercial capabilities in the United States to maintain recurring revenue growth at CAG Diagnostics. Management expects fourth-quarter results to show a rise in productivity as new sales representatives establish new customer relationships and switch to commission-based compensation for instrument placements. Also, we expect the company to report exceptional customer retention rates for reference labs and instrument consumables in the United States and worldwide in the fourth quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for CAG Diagnostics revenues of $425 million reflects an increase of 11.9% from the year-ago quarter.Overall, the Zacks Consensus Estimates for fourth-quarter total revenues are projected at $491 million, up 10.9% from the prior-year quarter. Notably, IDEXX expects 2017 revenues in the range of $1,950-$1,960 million, reflecting organic revenue growth of 9.5% to 10%.IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseÂ  IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. QuoteÂ Here are the other factors that might influence IDEXXâs fourth-quarter results:We are upbeat about growth in the Water Business, which has been on a growth trajectory of late on encouraging test results in the United States and benefits from global go-direct initiatives. Moreover, in the last reported quarter, the business witnessed 10% organic growth. Management is also looking forward to benefits from two favorable regulatory developments pertaining to wastewater in the United States and drinking water in Europe. Accordingly, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Water revenues of $27.3 million reflects an increase of 12.3% from the year-ago quarter.IDEXX continues to expand globally. It has been significantly benefitting from the bountiful opportunities in the companion animal diagnostics market of emerging nations. Further, managementâs consistent share buybacks reflect its strong free cash flow reserve. We believe the outcome of these endeavors will be reflected in the fourth-quarter performance.Management also estimates 2017 EPS in the band of $3.22-$3.26, supported by continued operating margin expansion aligned with its long-term goals. The outlook represents year over year EPS growth of 32-34% on a reported basis. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of 73 cents shows an increase of 25.9% from a year ago.On the flip side, foreign currency fluctuation is a major headwind. Another concern is the companyâs high reliance on third-party distributors. The purchasing dynamics of distributors have a significant impact on the companyâs sales of instrument consumables and rapid assay products. Also, IDEXX has been seeing a rise in operating expenses owing to increased head count along with higher investments in portfolio development and expansion in the United States and internationally.Also, the competitive landscape in the domestic and overseas markets weighs on IDEXXâs performance. The struggle to gain market traction might prove to be a drag on fourth-quarter results.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:IDEXX has the right combination of two main ingredients â a positive Earnings ESPÂ and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher â needed for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for IDEXX is +0.82%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before theyâre reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: IDEXX carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Other Stocks Worth a LookHere are a few other medical stocks worth considering as they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Bio-Rad Laboratories (BIO  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +4.45% and a Zacks Rank #1 (Stron Buy).

556,IDXX,"On Dec 20, we issued an updated research report on Intuitive Surgical Inc. (ISRG  -  Free Report). Growing adoption of the companyâs da Vinci system, increasing procedure volumes, strategic acquisitions, continuous innovation and solid recurring revenue base are key catalysts. The stock has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Intuitive Surgical is the manufacturer of the da Vinci surgical system (an advanced robot-assisted surgical system) and related instruments and accessories. The system enables minimally-invasive surgery that helps avoid trauma associated with open surgery. In the last quarter, Intuitive Surgical launched two additional instruments and accessories for da Vinci X and Xi platforms in seven countries.Notably, the company initiated a limited launch of a refined vessel sealer in Europe in the quarter. Management announced plans to file the first 510(k) for FDA approval of da Vinci SP program by 2017,and submissions for additional indications thereafter.Â For 2018, Intuitive Surgical has strong opportunities in the U.S. general surgery market, particularly driven by procedures for hernia repair and colorectal surgery. Internationally, the company has significant opportunities in Japan, South Korea and China.On the flip side, foreign exchange movements are affecting the companyâs results. Though Intuitive Surgical generates a major portion of revenues from the domestic market, continued investments in international businesses are widening the companyâs exposure to international markets. Hence, unfavorable foreign exchange is a major concern for 2018.Further, the Medical Product space, has been a precarious game for the Republicans since day one, courtesy of President Trumpâs repeated failure to repeal and replace Obamacare. However, major MedTech players like Intuitive Surgical have been pinning their hopes on Trumpâs promise to abolish the infamous 2.3% medical device sales tax, though its elimination is far from being achieved.In this regard, let us not forget the massive chaos in the MedTech space triggered by the failure of the first Republican healthcare bill which was proposed this summer. The so-called American Health Care Act (AHCA) failed to garner support in the House owing to solid opposition from conservative and moderate lawmakers. The persistent uncertainty has given rise to concerns regarding the sustainability of MedTech companies, including Intuitive Surgical.Investorsâ optimism has been growing, thanks to President Trumpâs promise of âenactment of new tax reformsâ. However, the market has not benefited due to the lack of favorable developments in the regulatory front. Notably, this tax had been suspended for two years and is likely to be put into effect again on Jan 1, 2018.Shares Shine BrightIntuitive Surgicalâs price movement has been robust over the last three months. The company represented a solid return of almost 6.8%, comparing favorably with the r industryâs rally of just 2.9%. The current level is a bit lower than the S&P 500 indexâs gain of 8%.Key PicksA few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are PetMed Express (PETS  -  Free Report), Luminex Corporation (LMNX  -  Free Report) and IDEXX Laboratories (IDXX  -  Free Report).PetMed Express flaunts a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

558,IDXX,"Medtronic plc (MDT  -  Free Report) reported second-quarter fiscal 2018 adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.07, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 8.1%. Earnings however declined 4.5% year over year.Â Adjustments in the quarter primarily included the impact of restructuring charges, intangible asset amortization, divestiture-related items, adverse effects of Hurricane Maria and acquisition-related items. After adjusting for unfavorable foreign exchange impact of a penny, adjusted EPS was $1.06.Without these adjustments, the companyâs reported EPS was $1.48, up 85% year over year.Total RevenuesWorldwide revenues in the reported quarter grossed $7.05 billion, up 3.5% on a constant exchange rate or CER basis (down 4.1% on a reported basis). The top line missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.07 billion. Foreign currency fluctuation affected Medtronicâs second-quarter revenues by $35 million.In the quarter under review, U.S. sales (52.9% of total revenues) declined 10.1% year over year to $3.73 billion. Non-U.S. developed market revenues totaled $2.24 billion (31.8% of total revenues), reflecting a 4.7% increase at CER (up 1.4% as reported). Emerging market revenues (15.3% of total revenues) amounted to $1.08 billion, up 12.4% at CER (up 9.8% as reported).Medtronic PLC Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Â Medtronic PLC Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Medtronic PLC QuoteÂ Segment DetailsThe company currently generates revenues from four major groups, viz. Cardiac & Vascular Group (CVG), Minimally Invasive Therapies Group (MITG), Restorative Therapies Group (RTG) and Diabetes Group.CVG comprises Cardiac Rhythm & Heart Failure (CRHF), Coronary & Structural Heart (CSH) and Aortic & Peripheral Vascular divisions (APV). MITG now includes the Surgical Innovations (SI) and the Respiratory, Gastrointestinal & Renal (RGR) divisions after the divestiture of Patient Care, Deep Vein Thrombosis (Compression), and Nutritional Insufficiency (Enteral Feeding) businesses. RTG comprises the Spine, Brain Therapies, Specialty Therapies and Pain Therapies segments, while the Diabetes Group incorporates the Intensive Insulin Management (IIM), Non-Intensive Diabetes Therapies (NDT), and Diabetes Service & Solutions (DSS) divisions.CVG revenues improved 7% at CER (up 7.4% as reported) to $2.77 billion, driven by strong, balanced growth across all three divisions.CRHF sales totaled $1.47 billion, up 4% year over year at CER (up 5% as reported). This came on the back of growth in Arrhythmia Management led by high-teens growth in atrial fibrillation Solutions and low-double digit rise in Diagnostics at CER, amplified penetration of the Micra transcatheter pacing system, and strong uptake of the TYRX absorbable antibacterial envelope. This apart, strong demand for the company's suite of quadripolar cardiac resynchronization therapy-pacemakers (CRT-P) along with growth in Mechanical Circulatory Support drove Heart Failure division revenues.CSH revenues were up 12% at CER (13% as reported) to $854 million on the back of high-30s constant currency growth in transcatheter aortic valves as a result of strong customer uptake of the CoreValve Evolut PRO platform. Moreover, the company's recent launch of the Resolute Onyx drug-eluting stent in the United States and Japan revived the Coronary business.APV revenues registered 4% growth at CER (up 5% as reported) to $452 million, driven by continued adoption of the ValiantÂ Captiviathoracic stent graft systems and strength in the Heli-FX EndoAnchor System. Peripheral was driven by double-digit growth in percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and drug-coated balloons. Moreover, the recently-launched Concerto 3D detachable coil system drove mid-single digit growth in endoVenous.In MITG, worldwide sales reached $1.95 billion, marking a 2% year-over-year increase at CER (down 21% on a reported basis) on mid-single digit growth in SI, which was affected by Hurricane Maria, and partially offset by low-single digit decline in RGR.In RTG, worldwide revenues of $1.86 billion were up 2% year over year at CER (same as reported) on low double-digit growth in Brain Therapies, offsetting declines in Spine, Specialty Therapies and Pain Therapies. Moreover, the Spine and Pain Therapies divisions along with the Pelvic Health business in the Specialty Therapies division in the United States were affected by Hurricane Maria.However, revenues at the Diabetes group declined 2% at CER (flat as reported) to $462 million.MarginsGross margin in the reported quarter expanded 160 basis points (bps) to 69.9% despite a 1.8% decline in gross profit to $4.93 billion. Adjusted operating margin contracted 40 bps year over year to 27.5% owing to a 0.2% rise in research and development expenses (to $555 million) along with a 0.8% uptick in selling, general and administrative expenses (to $2.44 billion). Other expenses in the reported quarter totaled $111 million as compared with $89 million in the year-ago quarter.GuidanceMedtronic reiterated its fiscal 2018 constant-currency revenue and EPS guidance. The company maintains full-year revenue growth projection in the range of 4-5% at CER. However, the company revised its foreign currency fluctuation estimation, which is now projected to have a positive $275-$375 million impact on fiscal results compared with $380-$480 million estimated earlier. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 revenues remains at $29.36 billion.Fiscal 2018 adjusted earnings per share growth is still expected in the range of 9-10% at CER. Currency translation is expected to have an adverse impact of two cents compared with the earlier expectation of a negative effect of 3 cents to a positive impact of a penny. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2018 earnings is pegged at $4.7.For the third quarter of fiscal 2018, Medtronic expects currency translation to have a favorable impact of $155-$175 million on revenues. Currency translation is expected to contribute a penny to third-quarter earnings per share.Our TakeMedtronic exited the fiscal second quarter on a mixed note. While the company demonstrated improved segmental performances at CER, escalating costs and expenses continue to weigh on the bottom line. Unfavorable currency translation also acted as a dampener.On the bright side, all the major business groups contributed to solid top-line growth at CER, which highlighted sustainability across groups and regions, in addition to displaying successful integration and achievement of synergy targets. We are also encouraged by the companyâs solid growth trend in the United States as well as healthy global acceptance of its advanced therapies. Apart from product innovation, the company is focusing on geographical diversification of its businesses. Moreover, the companyâs recent receipt of FDA approval and commercial launch of Azure pacemakers with BlueSync technology buoy optimism.Zacks Rank & Peer PerformancesMedtronic currently has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).A few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are PetMed Express (PETS  -  Free Report), Luminex Corporation (LMNX  -  Free Report) and IDEXX Laboratories (IDXX  -  Free Report).Notably, PetMed Express sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

Earnings were also lower than the year-ago figure of 56 cents. Hurricanes hurt Patterson Companiesâ earnings per share by approximately a penny in the quarter.Net sales fell 2.3% from the year-ago quarter to $1.39 billion, which also missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.42 billion. Adjusting the effects of foreign currency exchange, sales declined 2.8% on a year-over-year basis, including a negative impact of approximately 60 basis points (bps) from the hurricanes.Patterson Companies has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Â Patterson Companies, Inc. Price and ConsensusÂ  Patterson Companies, Inc. Price and Consensus | Patterson Companies, Inc. QuoteÂ Segmental AnalysisAnimal Health Segment: This segment is a leading distributor of products, services and technologies to the production and companion animal health markets in North America and the U.K. Coming to the second-quarter performance of the platform (60% of total sales), sales increased almost 1.4% at constant currency (cc) on a year-over-year basis to $823.6 million.Companion animal sales declined 1.4%. Production animal sales increased 4.2%, reflecting strong performance across all segments, especially in the swine business.Dental Segment: This segment provides a virtually complete range of consumable dental products, equipment, software, turnkey digital solutions and value-added services to dentists and dental laboratories throughout North America. In the second quarter, dental sales (40% of total sales) declined 8.4% at cc year over year to approximately $553.6 million. The decline was led by decreased sales of CEREC and digital technology products.Equipment sales in the dental segment fell 17.7%. Consumable dental supplies decreased 4.4%. However, other services and products, primarily comprising technical service, parts and labor, software support services and office supplies, increased 0.6%.Share Repurchase UpdatePatterson Companiesrepurchased approximately 1 million shares of its outstanding common stock for $36.5 million in the reported quarter. The company also paid $24.8 million in cash dividends to shareholders.Guidance DownbeatThe company expects adjusted earnings per share for fiscal 2018 in the range of $2.00 to $2.10, way below the previously issued band of $2.25 to $2.40. Patterson Companies expects deal amortization expenses of $25.3 million or 27 cents per share. The company estimates integration and business restructuring expenses at $5.3 million or 6 cents per share.Our TakePatterson Companies exited the second quarter on a tepid note, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate for both the counts. Furthermore, a downbeat guidance indicates looming concerns. Lackluster performance by the dental segment is a concern. Management expects headwinds in the technology-based equipment business to persist through fiscal 2018. However, we are upbeat about the companyâs Animal Health segment that witnessed strong sales last quarter. Patterson Companies provides a wide range of consumable supplies, equipment, software and value-added services. The companyâs broad spectrum of products cushions it against economic downturns in the MedTech space. We believe a diversified product portfolio, strong veterinary business prospects, accretive acquisitions and strategic partnerships are key growth catalysts.Stocks to ConsiderA few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are PetMed Express (PETS  -  Free Report), Luminex Corporation (LMNX  -  Free Report) and IDEXX Laboratories (IDXX  -  Free Report).Notably, PetMed Express sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

561,IDXX,"Astute investors are always on the lookout for a plan that is likely to yield high returns regardless of market circumstances. Efficiency level, which measures a companyâs capability to transform its available input into output, is often considered an important parameter used to gauge a companyâs potential to rake in handsome returns.A company with a promising efficiency level is likely to deliver stellar returns as it is assumed to be positively correlated with its price performance.How to Measure Efficiency? We have considered four popular ratios in order to find efficient companies that have the potential to provide impressive returns.Inventory TurnoverInventory level is one of the key indicators of a companyâs business health. While a high inventory level may indicate that the company is going through a rough patch in terms of sales, a dwindling level may indicate that the company will run out of stock in a favorable sales condition. This is where inventory turnover comes into play. It is the ratio of 12-month cost of goods sold (COGS) to a 4-quarter average inventory. Thus, a high value of the ratio indicates a low level of inventory relative to COGS, while a low ratio signals that the company has excess inventory.Receivables TurnoverThis ratio is used to measure a companyâs capability to extend its credit and collect debts on the basis of that credit. Receivables turnover ratio or the âaccounts receivable turnover ratioâ or the âdebtorâs turnover ratioâ is calculated by dividing 12-month sales by four-quarter average receivables. While a high ratio indicates that the company efficiently collects its accounts receivables or has quality customers, a low ratio signals that the company has an inefficient collection procedure or has low-quality customers or an inefficient credit policy.Asset UtilizationThis is a widely used measure of a companyâs efficiency. Asset utilization indicates a companyâs potential to utilize its assets. It is a ratio of total sales over the past 12 months to the last 4-quarter average of total assets. So, the higher the ratio, the greater is the chance that the company is utilizing its assets efficiently. On the contrary, a low value of the ratio signals that it is failing to use its assets effectively.Operating MarginAnother popular efficiency ratio is operating margin. Operating profit margin, which is simply operating income over the past 12 months divided by sales over the same period, indicates how well a company is controlling its operating expenses. If a company has a high operating profit margin in relation to its competitors, it is doing a better job at controlling operating expenses.All these ratios can be considered as effective measures if one compares different companies within a particular sector or industry. This is the reason why we have considered only those companies that have higher ratios than their respective industry averages.Screening ParametersIn addition to the above mentioned ratios, we have added a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) to the screen with an objective to make this strategy more profitable.Inventory Turnover, Receivables Turnover, Asset Utilization and Operating Margin greater than industry average (Values of these ratios higher than industry averages may indicate that the efficiency level of the company is higher than its peers.)Zacks Rank better than or equal to #2 (Buy)(Only Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and Buy-rated stocks can get through.)The use of these few criteria has narrowed down the universe of over 7,904 stocks to only 13.

562,IDXX,"On Nov 13, we issued an updated research report on DaVita HealthCare Partners Inc. (DVA  -  Free Report). The company recently concluded third-quarter 2017 on a mixed note. A slashed guidance for the full year hints at trouble down the road. The stock has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Hurricanes Harvey and Irma dealt a heavy blow to DaVitaâs operating income in the third quarter. The company incurred a loss of $7 million owing to higher production costs and approximately $7 million because of disruption of the billing process. Third-quarter adjusted operating earnings of 81 cents per share missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 94 cents. Further, earnings declined 14.7% on a year-over-year basis.Per management, hurricanes affected DaVitaâs inorganic growth by approximately 25 basis points in the reported quarter. For the fourth quarter of 2017, management at DaVita expects hurricanes to the impact revenues by $2 million to $3 million.Managementâs tepid forecast for the full year adds to the concerns. DaVita expects adjusted consolidated operating income in the range of $1.620 billion to $1.685 billion for 2017, lower than the previously issued range of $1.675 billion to $1.775 billion. For the full year, the company expects adjusted consolidated operating income in the band of $50 million to $85 million, significantly lower than the previous guidance of $110 million to $150 million.The lowered forecast failed to instill confidence in investors, resulting in a 4.2% decline in shares since the earnings release till yesterdayâs close of $54.66. DaVita's share price movement has been also unfavorable on a year-to-date basis. The company has lost 14.9%, wider than the broader industryâs decline of 13.8%.Â Â However, DaVita announced plans to restructure DaVita Medical Group with the elimination of 350 non-clinical positions. The company expects the resulting annualized savings to be approximately $40 million per year, starting 2018.Stocks to ConsiderA few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are PetMed Express (PETS  -  Free Report), Luminex Corporation (LMNX  -  Free Report) and IDEXX Laboratories (IDXX  -  Free Report).Notably, PetMed Express sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). The company has a long-term expected earnings growth rate of 10%. You can see the complete list of todayâs Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Luminex represented a return of 6.4% over the last year. The stock has a Zacks Rank #1.IDEXX Laboratories has a long-term expected earnings growth rate of 19.8%. The stock has climbed 39.2% over a yearâs time and has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce """"the world's first trillionaires,"""" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

565,IDXX,"Investors are always looking for stocks that are poised to beat at earnings season and IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. (IDXX  -  Free Report) may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because IDEXX Laboratories is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings â with the most up-to-date information possible â is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for IDXX in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at 76 cents per share for IDXX, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of 75 cents per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for IDXX, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +1.60% heading into earnings season.Why is this Important?A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market. Our recent 10-year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more Top Earnings ESP stocks here).Given that IDXX has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings.You can seeÂ the complete list of todayâs Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Clearly, recent earnings estimate revisions suggest that good things are ahead for IDEXX Laboratories and that a beat might be in the cards for the upcoming report.Wall Streetâs Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

566,IDXX,"PetMed Express, Inc.Â (PETS  -  Free Report) announced earnings per share (EPS) of 43 cents for the second quarter of fiscal 2018, up 79.2% from the year-ago quarterâs 24 cents. Also, earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 43.3%.The year-over-year rise in earnings was driven by an increase in sales and improved margins.Net sales in the reported quarter rose 10% year over year to $66.7 million, outpacing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 5.9%.PetMed Express, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseÂ  PetMed Express, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | PetMed Express, Inc. QuoteÂ Per this leading pet pharmacy in Americas, the upside in sales was a result of increased new orders and reorders during the quarter.In the reported quarter, reorder sales increased 9.9% to $55.1 million on a year-over-year basis, while new order sales rose 8.8% to $11.6 million.Average order value was approximately $85 in the quarter compared with $82 in the year-ago quarter. We note that the variation in average order value is mainly driven by a shift of sales to higher priced items.Per the company, the seasonality in its business is mainly because of the proportion of flea, tick and heartworm medications in the product mix. Spring and summer are considered peak seasons while fall and winter represent off-seasons.During the quarter under review, PetMed acquired 134,000 new customers, up from 131,000 a year ago.

General and administrative expenses were up 7.5% year over year to $6.2 million. Also, advertising expenses rose 3.3% to $4.5 million. This led to a 5.6% increase in adjusted operating expenses (without depreciation expense), which amounted to $10.7 million. Nevertheless, adjusted operating margin in the quarter rose 610 bps to 19.1% from the year-ago quarter.PetMed exited the fiscal second quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $68.4 million compared with $68.5 million at the end of the first-quarter fiscal 2017.

In the fiscal second quarter, the company once again topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate on both revenues and earnings. We are also encouraged to note the stellar increase in reorder and new order sales in the quarter.The company is also striving to implement several strategies to revitalize its top line. These include increased focus on advertising efficiency to boost new order sales and shifting sales to higher margin items, while also expanding product offerings.PetMed currently offers a wide range of products catering to dogs, cats and horses besides working on upgrading its existing portfolio.Zacks Rank & Key PicksPetMed currently has a Zacks Rank #3(Hold). A few better-ranked stocks in the medical sector are Abbott (ABT  -  Free Report), IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. (IDXX  -  Free Report) and Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.

567,IDXX,"We expectÂ IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.Â (IDXX  -  Free Report) to beat expectations when it reports third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 31, before the opening bell. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 11.8%. It is worth noting that IDEXX has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the preceding four quarters, at an average of 9.3%. Letâs take a look at how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Key CatalystSimilar to the prior quarter, IDEXX is expected to gain from strong global growth in Companion Animal Group (CAG) Diagnostics recurring revenues. The growth in CAG Diagnostics was led by double-digit organic revenue gains across consumable, reference lab and rapid assay revenues, as well as continued expansion of IDEXX's premium instrument installed base.We are upbeat about the 300% year-over-year rise in the uptake of SNAP Pro units in North America last quarter. Management expects the solid performance to continue in the to-be-reported quarter as well.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for CAG Diagnostics revenues of $426 million reflects an increase of 10.6% from the year-ago quarter.Here are the other factors that might influence IDEXXâs third-quarter results:IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseÂ  Â IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. QuoteIDEXX expects its Livestock, Poultry and Dairy (LPD) business to witness flat-to-modest growth in the second half of 2017. The segment has been seeing continued strength in China. Also, expansion of the recurring pregnancy testing franchise buoys optimism. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the LPD business of $30.3 million for the third quarter reflects an increase of 1.7% from the year-ago quarter.The company continues to expand globally. It has been significantly benefitting from the bountiful opportunities in the companion animal market of emerging nations. Further, managementâs consistent share buybacks reflect its strong free cash flow reserve. We believe the outcome of these endeavors will be reflected in the companyâs third-quarter performance.Encouraged by these factors, IDEXX expects 2017 revenue in the range of $1,945-$1,965 million, reflecting organic revenue growth expectations between 10% and 11%.Â The Zacks Consensus Estimates for third-quarter total revenues are projected at $494 million, up 10.3% from the prior-year quarterManagement also estimates its 2017 EPS guidance to the band of $3.12-$3.22 per share, supported by continued operating margin expansion aligned with its long-term goals. The outlook represents EPS growth of 28-32% on a reported basis. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of $3.17 reflects an increase of 29.9% from the year-ago quarter.Moreover, management is upbeat about the 12% rise in the sales force in the U.S. market and some other areas in the third quarter.On the flip side, foreign currency fluctuation is a major headwind. Another concern for the company is its high reliance on third-party distributors. The purchasing dynamics of distributors have a significant impact on the companyâs sales of instrument consumables and rapid assay products. Also, the company is exposed to higher operating expenses pertaining to increased head count along with higher investments targeted toward portfolio development and geographic expansion in the United States and internationally.Also, the competitive landscape in the domestic and overseas markets weighs on IDEXXâs performance. The struggle to gain market traction might prove to be a drag on third-quarter 2017 results.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:IDEXX does not have the right combination of two main ingredients â a positive Earnings ESPÂ and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher â needed for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for IDEXX is 0.00%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before theyâre reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: IDEXX carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we also need to have a positive ESP to be confident of a positive earnings surprise.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of 75 cents reflects a 20.9% improvement on a year-over-year basis.Stocks Worth a LookHere are a few medical stocks worth considering as they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.The Cooper Companies, Inc. (COO  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.43% and a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can seeÂ the complete list of todayâs Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (TMO  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.19% and a Zacks Rank #2.Align Technology, Inc. (ALGN  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.74% and a Zacks Rank #3.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.See This Ticker Free >>

568,IDXX,"âAmerica has the best doctors, the best nurses, the best hospitals, the best medical technology, the best medical breakthrough medicines in the world.â â Rep. Bill FristIn terms of market size, the U.S. health care market is the largest in the world. A report by Health Access suggests that Americaâs unparalleled purchasing power, massive demand for medical services and equipment, and opportunity for innovation has lent it a competitive edge.Further, the markets got a boost after President Donald Trump â an ardent proponent of âliving big, living largeâ â came into power. His constant efforts to boost American lifestyle, focus on middle class and incorporate the best health care in America have been creating a stir.Trumpâs efforts to eliminate the countryâs jobless stature are remarkable. Per reports, the U.S. unemployment rate was pegged at 4.1% in November, the lowest since February 2001. Undoubtedly, Trumpâs âAmerica first!â pitch has been driving employment growth like never before.Four Factors to Drive MedTech in 2018Increasing Consolidation in HealthcareThe latest trend of increasing consolidation in the healthcare space has led to a reduction in the number of players, greater market concentration and reduced competition as well as increasing barriers of entry in the industry. The companies will benefit from higher market cap, which will put them in a position to negotiate with suppliers and consumers.The recent $69-billion deal between Aetna Inc. (AET  -  Free Report) and CVS Health (CVS  -  Free Report) is a significant example. It qualifies as vertical integration, which will enable the newly formed entity to sell a range of services and products from drug to insurance cover.President Trumpâs Focus on Emerging MarketsPer a recent BCG report, the share of emerging market revenues, which is less than a quarter of MedTechâs global revenues, is likely to increase to nearly one-third by 2022.Thus, the United States' trade plans with emerging countries are likely to favor the domestic companies.In this regard, investors may find President Trumpâs 12-day Asia trip last month interesting. The visit was aimed at boosting inter-country trade relations, particularly with the emerging nations. Trumpâs promise to augment bilateral trade agreements with Indo-Pacific nations instills our confidence in his APAC policies. He also emphasized âfree and open Indo-Pacific tradeâ with a focus on the nations of Japan, Australia and India.IVD & PBM Markets to Thrive A research report by EvaluateMedTech World Preview indicates that global MedTech sales are expected to witness a CAGR of 5.1% to $522 billion by 2022, with IVD (in Vitro diagnosis) raking in annual sales of $69.6 billion at a CAGR of 5.9%. Increasing investments from government and private players in the form of reimbursement coverage and speedy patent approvals are driving demand.The role of pharmacy benefit managers (PBM) in the U.S. healthcare sector has been evolving. PBMs manage pharmaceutical spending and enhance health benefits for end users. Per a report by Market Research Reports.biz, the global PBM market will see a CAGR of 7.16% between 2014 and 2019. Investing in PBM stocks can be a prudent move for registering solid gains in 2018. Looking for the Best Stocks for 2018? Be among the first to see our Top Ten Stocks for 2018 portfolio here.Robot-based Applications to Boost MedTechThe AI-based applications have been enhancing the healthcare space with clinical applications, diagnostic support, operational efficiency, Electronic Health Record systems, practice workflows and supply chain management. The growing prevalence of minimally-invasive robot-assisted surgeries, self-automated home-based care, use of IT for quick and improved patient care and shift of the payment system to a value-based model.For example, MedTech major Intuitive Surgical designs, manufactures and markets the da Vinci surgical system â an advanced robot-assisted surgical platform. This AI platform enables minimally-invasive surgery that helps avoid the trauma associated with open surgery. The company plans to expand the usage of da Vinci in general and thoracic surgery, colorectal surgery and hernia repair in the days to come.Picking the Right StocksBased on certain parameters, we have selected six MedTech growth stocks which are poised for impressive returns in 2017.

571,IDXX,"President Trumpâs latest tax bill to repeal a significant part of the Affordable Care Act was again rejected by House Republicans on Nov 13. According to a Washington Post article, only modest changes were made to the legislation. While the President aims to give the bill a final attempt stressing on the importance of tax cut and reforms for economic growth (vote on the tax cut bill slated for Nov 16), letâs see how the MedTech industry is gearing up for it.According a report by Business Insider, theÂ Republican tax planÂ repeals an itemized deduction that applies to healthcare expenses. If the new bill gets implemented, families with high healthcare expenditure will be impacted as these expenses will no longer be deducted from their taxes. Hence, the masses will no longer be interested in expensive healthcare or MedTech procedures. Â A report by The Hill says that the Section 4303Â of the Republican tax bill plan imposes a 20% excise tax on goods manufactured overseas by subsidiaries of U.S. companies. Under the U.S. tax code, Puerto Rico is considered a foreign land which implies that U.S. parent companies will have to pay excise taxes if they purchase from their subsidiaries in the island. In this regard, the FDA recently found that around 30% of Puerto Ricoâs gross domestic product was driven by pharmaceuticals and medical devices in 2016. Undoubtedly, the latest tax plan has created an uproar among MedTech players who might witness a huge reduction in their turnover with the approval of the bill.Without a doubt, the latest political developments have resulted in widespread volatility in the MedTech space.4 Growth Stocks in FocusIn such a tumultuous scenario, we have used the Zacks Stock Screener to pick stocks for significant gains.

572,IDXX,"The fourth-quarter 2017 earnings season is gaining momentum with 133 S&P 500 participants having already released financial numbers as of Jan 26. Per the latest Earnings Preview, the reporting cycle was off to an encouraging start with above-average proportion of companies edging past the top and bottom-line expectations.Total earnings for these members have improved 11.6% on 6% increase in revenues.With results of roughly 121 members slated to be announced this week, per the Zacks data, estimates for the period are gradually trending upward across the board for nine of the 16 Zacks sectors. The Medical as one in the bracket, is expected to witness a 2.1% earnings rise in the fourth quarter on 2% revenue growth projection.Whatâs in Store for Medical Device Industry?The medical device space within the broader Medical sector somewhat displays a mixed bag of sorts. As part of the tax overhaul, corporate tax rates have been slashed down to 21% from the previous 35%, thus lending a huge relief to the MedTech mammoths.However, ahead of the industryâs fourth-quarter earnings release, a section of analysts expect this new tax law to negatively impact the industry due to a possible cut in overall Medicare spending, if certain criteria are not fulfilled by a specific date. The Congressional Budget Office apprehends that in absence of any alternative to meet the fiscal deficit from the huge tax reduction, automatic cut backs worth $136 billion including $25 billion in Medicare cuts from the mandatory budget of spending in 2018, could be triggered.Amid tax reform related concerns, the news of Congress delaying the medical device tax for another two years came as a huge boost to industry players and investors. This 2.3% tax was earlier delayed by Congress in 2015 for a couple of years. The deferral will once again largely propel R&D activities within this space.Letâs take a sneak peek at the performance of five major medical device companies, waiting to report earnings on Feb 1.Boston Scientific Corporation (BSX  -  Free Report): We are optimistic about the companyâs gradually improving performance in Interventional Cardiology, led by an innovative portfolio and robust commercial teams, globally. More specifically, The WATCHMAN platform is expected to experience another excellent quarter on consistent global momentum as Boston Scientificâs multiple market development efforts continue to push for growth.The company has a positive Earnings ESP of +1.07% and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). While a favorable Zacks ESP indicates a likely positive surprise, a bullish Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 increases the predictive power of ESP.Conversely, Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.

(BAX  -  Free Report): In the fourth quarter of 2017, Baxter International is anticipated to gain from strong Hospital Products, driven by solid sales in the U.S. Fluid Systems business as well as robust demand for injectable pharmaceuticals. Within the Hospital Products segment, we expect Fluid Systems to maintain the momentum, evident from the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $634 million for the to-be-reported quarter, which reflects a 3.3% improvement from the year-ago period.Banking on solid prospects, our quantitative model also shows a beat for the company, given the combination of a Zacks Rank of 3 and an Earnings ESP of +1.28%.

Also McKesson Specialty Health unit is likely to drive the companyâs top line in the same time frame. The unit is likely to benefit from the closing of the intraFUSION acquisition and the recent BDI Pharma buyout.We are unable to conclude whether McKesson is likely to beat on earnings this quarter.

573,IDXX,"Abbott Labs (ABT  -  Free Report) reported third-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings from continuing operations of 66 cents per share, ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny and up 11.9% year over year. This adjusted quarterly number also remained at the upper end of the companyâs guidance range of 64 cents to 66 cents.Reported earnings for the quarter came in at 32 cents per share, as compared to the year-ago loss of 24 cents per share.Third-quarter worldwide sales came in at $6.83 billion, up 28.8% year over year on a reported basis. This quarterly figure also remains slightly ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.71 billion.Abbott Laboratories Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Abbott Laboratories price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Abbott Laboratories QuoteOn a comparable operational basis (adjusting the impact of foreign exchange, certain acquisitions and divestments), sales increased 5.6% year over year in the reported quarter.Quarter in DetailAbbott operates through four segments â Established Pharmaceuticals Division (EPD), Medical Devices, Nutrition and Diagnostics.EPD sales were up 15.7% on a reported basis (up 14.3% on comparable operational basis) to $1,171 billion. There was a positive impact of 1.4% on the back of currency fluctuations. Sales in key emerging markets increased 18.5% (up 18%), driven by double-digit growth in Brazil, Russia, India and China. As expected, sales in India were positively impacted by purchasing patterns following the implementation of a new Goods and Services Tax system that lowered second quarter sales in that country.The Medical Devices business sales spiked 98.2% on a reported basis to $2.59 billion. On a comparable operational basis, sales increased 5.6%.Cardiovascular and Neuromodulation sales soared 214.1% on a reported basis (up 3.6% on comparable operational basis) on double-digit growth in Electrophysiology, Structural Heart, Heart Failure and Neuromodulation.Vascular product sales growth however, was sluggish at 0.2% on a on a comparable operational basis. Within Rhythm Management, the company registered a loss of 12.1% on a comparable operational basis as sales in the U.S. were impacted by continued competitive dynamics in the magnetic resonance (MR)-conditional category of products.Diabetes Care sales improved 19.1% on a comparable operational basis, driven by double-digit international sales growth, led by continued consumer uptake of FreeStyle Libre â the revolutionary continuous glucose monitoring system of Abbott.Nutrition sales were up 0.8% year over year on a reported basis (same on a comparable operational basis). Foreign exchange favorably affected sales by a marginal 0.1%. Pediatric Nutrition sales increased 0.7% on a comparable operational basis. Adult Nutrition sales were up 0.9% on a comparable operational basis.Diagnostics sales rose 5.4% year over year on a reported basis (up 5.2% on a comparable operational basis). Core Laboratory and Point of Care Diagnostics sales both grew 5.6%, on a comparable operational basis. Molecular Diagnostics sales were up 1.1% as strong growth in the infectious disease testing business was partially offset by the planned scale-down of the genetics business.GuidanceAbbott has narrowed down its full-year 2017 guidance. Adjusting for certain net specified items for the full year, the adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations are now expected to stay within a band of $2.48-$2.50 (earlier guidance was $2.43-$2.53). The current Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $2.49, at the midpoint of the projected range.The company has also provided its fourth-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings per share guidance. It expects to report adjusted earnings from continuing operations in the range of 72 cents to 74 cents for the quarter. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate of 73 cents falls at the midpoint of the projected range.Our TakeOne more time, Abbott has successfully exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate on both earnings and sales front. We are optimistic about the companyâs strong and consistent EPD and Medical Devices performance. However, these strong performances were to some extent offset by sluggish Nutrition business.The company continues to benefit from the recently completed acquisition of St. Jude Medical, which has started offering it an industry leading pipeline across cardiovascular, neuromodulation, diabetes and vision care.In 2017, the company is effectively executing its existing operating model which focuses on selling portfolio in core therapeutic areas. Also, emerging market performance remains extremely promising on several new strategic developments.Abbott currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Stocks to ConsiderA few other top-ranked stocks in the medical sector are Integra LifeSciences Holdings Corp.

574,IDXX,"On Oct 16, we issued an updated research report onÂ Phibro Animal Health CorporationÂ (PAHC  -  Free Report). This NJ-basedÂ company is a leading global diversified animal health and mineral nutrition company.Over the last six months, Phibro has been trading above theÂ broaderÂ  industry. Currently, the stock has gained 35.9% compared with 10.9% of the broader industry.Animal Health was a key contributor, delivering positive growth over the last few quarters.Â According to Phibro, its animal health products are excellent in preventing, controlling and treating diseases in animals as well as improving nutrition to improve health. We believe a diverse portfolio will allow the company to address the distinct growing conditions of livestock in different regions of the world.Â Â Outside the United States, Phibro has extended its reach to Brazil and other countries in South America, China, India and Asia Pacific, Russia and Africa. This we feel will help the company counter competition.The company continues to invest in the Far East Asia where the poultry and dairy industries are expected to grow exponentially. Currently, the company is expanding its dairy business in the markets of Australia, Brazil and Mexico. We believe that despite the turmoil in the economies of Russia, Greece, Brazil and China, Phibro has performed quite well and has the potential to maintain its performance.On the flip side,Â Phibro operates in highly competitive industries. With respect to its major products, it faces threat from a substantial number of global and regional players. Furthermore, withdrawal of approval for Mecadox (carbadox) by the FDA is a concern. Additionally, Phibro conducts operations globally, which entails transactions in a variety of currencies.Â As a result, currency fluctuation is a major issue for the company.Zacks Rank & Key PicksPhibro carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Â A few better-ranked stocks in the medical sector are Abbott (ABT  -  Free Report), IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.

576,IDXX,"Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (TMO  -  Free Report) has been gaining investor confidence on consistently positive results. The stock has rallied 25.2% over the last six months, ahead of the S&P 500âs 8.8% gain and the broader industryâs 12.9% rise.Moreover, this Massachusetts-based medical instruments manufacturer has a market cap of $77.01 billion. The companyâs five-year historical growth rate is favorable at 14.3% compared with 9.4% of the industry.With solid prospects, this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock is an attractive pick for investors at the moment.The company has an impressive earnings surprise history, having surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters with an average beat of 2.3%.The companyâs estimate revision trend for the current year has been positive. In the last 60 days, seven analysts revised their estimates upward, with no movement in the opposite direction. The magnitude of estimate revision for earnings increased around 1.1% to $9.33 per share over the same time frame.Letâs find out whether the recent positive trend is a sustainable one.The company has been steadily adding capacities and enhancing existing ones through acquisitions. In this regard, the acquisition of FEI, which has already started generating synergies and contributing largely to the companyâs analytical instruments portfolio, has in turn boosted market optimism surrounding the stock. Moreover, we are looking forward to the companyâs latest Patheon buyout through which Thermo Fisher forayed into the high-potential contract development and manufacturing organization (CDMO) space.Moreover, the company plans to continue to strengthen its foothold in emerging markets, such as China and India, and to translate this success to other high-priority opportunities in regions such as South Korea, Russia and Brazil. In the second quarter of 2017, the company recorded solid contributions from China, India and the Middle East. We are also upbeat about the companyâs recent opening of a Center of Excellence for electron microscopy in Saudi Arabia.Additionally, the company has a strong cash balance that enables it to carry out share repurchase programs and in turn provide solid returns to investors. Moreover, we believe the companyâs strong cash balance will enable it to carry on with the strategy of inorganic expansion.On the flip side, Thermo Fisher derives majority of its revenues from the international market, which exposes it to fluctuations in foreign currency. Management currently estimates unfavorable foreign exchange to have a negative impact on its top line in 2017.Also, a tough competitive landscape continues to pose challenges for the company.Other Key PicksOther top-ranked stocks in the medical sector are Abbott (ABT  -  Free Report), IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.

580,IDXX,"On Oct 13, we issued an updated research report on Henry Schein, Inc.Â (HSIC  -  Free Report), a leading distributor of health care products and services across the globe. The company carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).In terms of price return performance, over the past month, the stock remained in line with the broader industry.We expect this trend to improve on balanced growth across all four operating segments of Henry Schein. We are also encouraged by the companyâs efforts to grow internationally. Apart from North America and Europe, it has presence in Australia and New Zealand as well as emerging nations like China, Brazil, Israel, Czech Republic and Poland.Â Also, the company continues to ride high within its dental business on majorly accretive strategic mergers and integrations. One colossal merger in this field is Poland-based Dental Cremer in 2016.Henry Schein Animal Healthâs revenue growth has been consistently supported by niche acquisitions.Â At the beginning of 2017, the company had made a foray in the Brazilian animal health market with a 51% investment in Tecnew. Around the same time, the company announced its decision to acquire Southern SAS, which in turn might benefit its dental business through controlled and non-controlled pharmaceuticals as well as surgical supplies.Also, Henry Schein might gain from several trends in end markets like customer demographics. The increasing number of lives covered, following healthcare reforms in the United States, is likely to boost the company.Â Additionally, Henry Schein gains traction in animal health business on the back of tailwinds in North America as well as overseas markets. The burgeoning demand for animal health products in the United States should further drive the companyâs growth.Â On the flip side, escalating costs and expenses continue to be a drag on the companyâs margins and the bottom line. A tough competitive landscape and pricing pressure also weigh on Henry Scheinâs stock.Key StocksSome better-ranked stocks in the medical sector are QIAGEN (QGEN  -  Free Report), IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.

581,IDXX,"NuVasive, Inc. (NUVA  -  Free Report) has been in the news of late for the receipt of expanded FDA 510(k) approval for its advanced magnetic and non-invasive limb lengthening technology â PRECICE.Falling under NuVasive Specialized Orthopedics (NSO), PRECICE can now be used to treat open and closed fracture fixation, pseudoarthrosis, malunions, nonunions and bone transport. Notably, this product was earlier allowed for use in limb lengthening procedures to elongate the femur and tibia. The approval is expected to considerably drive Nuvasiveâs customer base.The PRECICE platform comprises an intramedullary device that on being implanted uses an external remote controller in order to non-invasively compress and distract long bones. Per the company, the key to the PRECICE platform is the magnetic interaction between the external remote control and PRECICE intramedullary nail.Notably, NSO operates as a wholly owned subsidiary of NuVasive since the acquisition of Ellipse Technologies in 2016. NuVasive continues to gain share in its NSO portfolio, which includes MAGnetic External Control (MAGEC) for early-onset scoliosis and PRECICE technology,Â  both built on the MAGEC technology platform.Through this latest development, NuVasive expects to gain traction in the fast growing limb reconstruction and trauma market. A report from Allied Market Research published by Ortho Spine News on the global extremity reconstruction market substantiates this view. Per the report, the global extremity reconstruction market is expected to reach a value of $3,041 million, at a CAGR of 7.5% between 2016 and 2022.Â Â We believe unhealthy lifestyle resulting in several joint disorders, rapidly ageing population, rising awareness, technological advancement and increased spending in healthcare by government and individuals will continue to drive the limb reconstruction and trauma market. Thus, NuVasiveâs latest FDA approval will likely help it to cash in on the bountiful opportunities in the niche market.Share Price MovementNuVasive has been trading below the broader industryÂ  over last. The stock has lost 11.9% in comparison to the broader industryâs decline of 0.1%. We believe this latest development will help the company boost investorsâ sentiments and reverse the downtrend.Â Â Zacks Rank & Key PicksNuVasive currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

582,IDXX,"As a major setback to the companyâs investors, Medtronic (MDT  -  Free Report) Â recently foresees a significant impact of Hurricane Maria on second-quarter fiscal 2018 sales. Having acquired a category 5 status, Hurricane Maria has been placed among the top 10 most intense Atlantic hurricanes on record, thus hitting the companyâs business in Puerto Rico quite hard.Adding to the woes, the company has a level of manufacturing setup for all its four business groups â viz. Cardiac & Vascular Group (''CVG''), Minimally Invasive Therapies Group (''MITG''), Restorative Therapies Group (''RTG'') and Diabetes Group â in Puerto Rico. While the facilities are gradually getting operative since Oct 2, the sites are only partially active at present on power supply from back-up generators.With considerable repairing done, the company expects the normal manufacturing process to get fully restored in the coming weeks.Financial ImpactsMedtronic has provided a statement on the companyâs financial health badly hurt by Â Maria and further affecting the overall business. Notably, in line with business continuity protocols, the company is utilizing the existing inventory levels and increasing manufacturing processes in locations outside Puerto Rico for multiple products.Medtronic projects both fiscal second-quarter 2018 revenue and adjusted net earnings to show the impact to the extent of $250 million. More specifically, the MITG and the RTG groups are expected to be worst hit. Notably, this quarter will close on Oct 27, 2017.Significantly, the company forecasts some non-recurring expenses, directly related to recovery efforts in Puerto Rico, which will be excluded from adjusted earnings. However, expenses related to the effects outside Puerto Rico will be considered operating expenses.Incidentally, Medtronic is lacks enough visibility about the impact of Maria, post the second quarter. However, forecasting a strong new product demand, particularly in the CVG and Diabetes Group, the company continues to expect mid-single digit revenue growth (on a comparable, constant currency basis) in the second half of fiscal 2018.Despite the Maria-related impact, the company reaffirmed the fiscal second quarter and full-year fiscal 2018 guidances.Among the companyâs many supports toward disaster management, the Medtronic Foundation has directed $1 million for disaster relief to date and is matching employee contributions to authorized agencies.Price PerformanceÂ Over the last three months, Medtronic has been observed to underperform the broader industry.Â  The stock has declined 8.5% versus the broader industryâs Â 4.7% gain during this period.

However, it missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $494 million.The year-over-year increase was driven by strong global gains in Companion Animal Group (CAG) Diagnostics recurring revenues, including double-digit organic revenue gains across consumable and reference lab as well as strong acceptance of rapid assays and veterinary software, services and diagnostic imaging systems.IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Â IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. QuoteÂ Segmental AnalysisIDEXX derives revenues from four operating segments: CAG; Water; Livestock, Poultry and Dairy (LPD); and Other.In the third quarter, CAG revenues rose 10.7% (up 9.6% organically) year over year to $426.7 million.

The updated outlook represents EPS growth of 32-34% on a reported basis. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 EPS is pegged at $3.17, below the guided range.Our TakeIDEXX exited the third quarter on a mixed note, with earnings beating and revenues missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate. However, solid year-over year growth in organic revenues buoys optimism. The companyâs raised EPS guidance for 2017 is also encouraging.The stellar quarterly performance was driven by strong sales within the companyâs companion animal business. The companion animal market fundamentals remain solid with tremendous global runway for growth. Managementâs innovation-based, multi-modality global strategy, enabled by enhanced commercial capability, accelerated recurring CAG Diagnostics revenue growth. Moreover, the strong top-line growth in this quarter was driven by considerable contributions from the rest of the business segments.However, foreign currency fluctuations are expected to continue to hurt the companyâs operating results, although lower than the extent expected earlier.Zacks Rank & Other Key PicksIDEXX currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are PetMed Express, Inc.

584,IDXX,"Ecolab Inc. (ECL  -  Free Report) has had a dismal run on the bourses of late. Over the last three months, the company has returned 0.9%, below the S&P 500âs 3.4%.Intensifying competition, foreign exchange volatility, higher raw material costs and integration risks are primary headwinds for the company as of now. Let us take a look at the other major factors that have been impeding Ecolabâs growth trajectory.Ecolab Grapples With IssuesHurricanes Deal a Blow: Various reports suggest that the Hurricanes dealt a heavy blow on all MedTech majors. Ecolab is no exception in this regard, with forced shut downs of three manufacturing plants in Houston area. Management at Ecolab estimates third-quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share at the low end or slightly below the previously forecasted band of $1.36 to $1.44. For the full year, Ecolab expects adjusted earnings at the low end of the previously issued $4.70 to $4.90 range.Divestiture: Despite yielding stellar returns last year, in August, management at Ecolab announced that last quarter has been a quiet one for its Equipment Care business, which registered just 2% growth on a year-over-year basis.Adding to the woes, the segment ran short of manpower in the recent past. As a result, Ecolab announced plans to divest Equipment Care to Audax Private Equity. Growing in upper single digits, the segment witnessed strong sales of $180 million in 2016 (almost 1.4% of net sales).Diversified offerings like Equipment Care have lent Ecolab a competitive edge in the global market so far.

587,IDXX,"On Oct 11, we issued an updated research report on New York-based DENTSPLY SIRONA Inc. (XRAY  -  Free Report) â a global leader in the design, development, manufacture and marketing of dental consumables and dental laboratory products.DENTSPLY recently announced the renewal of an existing distribution agreement with Henry Schein Canada, Inc, which will continue till Dec 31, 2020. Henry Schein's agreement with DENTSPLY was initiated in August 2005.We feel that the deal extension is a smart move by DENTSPLY as the preexisting agreement did not include the CEREC CAD/CAM restoration system and the Schick line of imaging sensors. By including the aforementioned lines of products, the company will benefit from Henry Scheinâs distribution network in Canada.Among the recent developments, DENTSPLY announced the renewal of its partnership with Pacific Dental Services. The duoâs latest agreement extends for a period of five years which was signed in 2012.This move is also a strategic one as Pacific Dentalâs network consists of over 580 centers across 17 states. During the tenure of the present agreement, management expects the number of such offices utilizing DENTSPLY technologies to exceed 800.DENTSPLYâs dual branding strategy, product innovation, growth opportunities in emerging markets (especially Asia-Pacific and Middle East/Africa), diversified product portfolio and recurring revenue base are key catalysts. The company expects a solid guidance for full-year 2017 projecting adjusted EPS in the range of $2.65-$2.75.On the flip side, apart from a series of macroeconomic headwinds, currency fluctuation continues to be a major dampener. In fact, strengthening of the U.S. dollar against Euro and other emerging market currencies has dented the companyâs growth trajectory. Furthermore, higher capital expenditure on product development is expected to keep margins under pressure.Share Price & Estimate Revisions Lack LusterDENTSPLY's estimate revision trend looks unfavorable at the moment. For the third quarter, two analysts moved south, compared to no upward revision in the last two months. Notably, the current quarter estimates dropped 1.5% to 67 cents per share over the last 60 days.DENTSPLYâs share price movement has been unfavorable over the last three months. The company shed 11.7%, much higher than the industryâs decline of 4.4%.Â Â Zacks Rank & Key PicksDENTSPLY currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

588,IDXX,"On Oct 11, we issued an updated research report on Veeva Systems Inc. (VEEV  -  Free Report). We are upbeat about Veevaâs commercial cloud platform, which clinched multiple contracts around the world. The company has many core CRM projects on track with large pharma companies. Veeva currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Headquartered in Pleasanton, CA, Veeva offers cloud-based software applications and data solutions for the life sciences industry. The life sciences industry has been quite slow in adopting cloud-based software as compared to other industries.However, we believe that the industry is gradually realizing the benefits of cloud-based applications, particularly due to rising regulations and budgetary constraints. The cost-effectiveness of cloud-based applications over in-premise applications is attracting life science companies. Moreover, an uncertain regulatory environment has driven demand from software vendors that are well-acquainted with the industry trends.The companyâs industry-specific focus lends it a significant leverage in our view. This is aptly demonstrated by its strong sales growth aided by new business gains, better pricing and product innovation.The companyâs knowledge on different components of the life sciences industry is helping it to build targeted products. Notably, products like Veeva OpenData provide customer data to all healthcare professionals (HCP), healthcare organizations (HCO) and affiliations across the major life sciences markets.Veeva is optimistic about its product pipeline that includes an exclusive range of products on its flagship Vault and Commercial cloud platforms. These products include Vault CTMS, Vault PromoMats Dam, CRM Engage Meeting and CRM Engage Webinar.Â Â Share Price & Estimate RevisionVeevaâs share price movement continues to be robust.

593,IDXX,"CryoLife, Inc. (CRY  -  Free Report) recently entered into a definitive agreement to buy German-based JOTEC AG. JOTEC â a privately-held maker of technologically advanced endovascular stent grafts and cardiac and vascular surgical grafts focused on aortic repair. The company has been recording revenue CAGR of 17% over the last five years.Under the financial terms of the agreement, CryoLife will pay an aggregate of up to $225 million for the deal, with around $168.75 million in cash and $56.25 million in shares of CryoLifeâs common stock issued to JOTECâs shareholders. The buyout is slated to complete later in 2017, subject to customary closing conditions.Through this deal, CryoLife aims at expanding the existing portfolio with products focused on aortic surgery, thereby solidifying its footprint in the fast-growing endovascular surgical market.Per management, this deal will help CryoLife diversify its business by gaining access to the $2-billion global market for stent grafts used in endovascular and open repair of aortic diseases. The market is projected to value around $2.5 billion by 2021. Interestingly, CryoLife aims at delivering consistent, high single-digit revenue growth through this deal.The deal is also in line with the companyâs strategy to directly sell by eliminating distributors in Europe while creating cross-selling opportunities for the companyâs product portfolios. In the last reported quarter, CryoLife began the process of direct selling in Canada, Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg, expanding direct operations in Europe.At the same time, management expects the newly-added products to continue to post double-digit growth outside the United States for at least the next five years. Moreover, the deal is expected to prove accretive to the companyâs non-GAAP EPS at a CAGR of not less than 20% over the next five years, while contributing to gross and operating margin.CryoLife expects to gain access to the $1.2-billion U.S. stent graft market, which is projected to value roughly $1.5 billion by 2021 through the newly gained, highly competitive product portfolio and advanced research and development platform. Thus, the company expects this deal to drive growth through 2018 as well.CryoLife also provided a sneak peek into its preliminary third-quarter results. The company has recorded revenues of $44.0 million. This considers a negative impact of around $1 million from hurricanes, delay in receipt of re-certification of Ascending Aortic Prosthesis, reversal of around $1.1 million of recorded revenues on repurchase of some inventory from third-party distributors in order to sell directly.We believe unhealthy lifestyle, favorable demographics, rising expenditure on healthcare by government and technological developments will continue to drive growth in the aortic aneurysm market. This fact is further substantiated by a Research and Markets report published by Nasdaq. Per the report, the global aortic aneurysm market is estimated to witness a CAGR of 6.6% between 2017 and 2023. Thus, this acquisition deal is expected to boost the top line of CryoLife.Share Price PerformanceOver the last six months, CryoLife has been trading above the broader industry.

597,IDXX,"On Oct 3, we issued an updated research report on Latham, NY-based AngioDynamics Inc. (ANGO  -  Free Report). The company recently reported a dismal first quarter of fiscal 2018 wherein adjusted earnings and revenues missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate.AngioDynamics has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at the moment.The company rides on the marketâs solid response to Solero Microwave Tissue Ablation (MTA) system, especially within the Microwave Ablation space. The platform is intended to be used for the ablation of soft tissue during open procedures. A research report by Micro Market Monitor suggests that the Global Microwave Ablation is expected to reach a worth of $201 million by 2018.Despite ending the first quarter on a tepid note, the company reaffirmed its guidance for fiscal 2018. AngioDynamics expects adjusted earnings per share in the band of 64 cents to 68 cents. Revenues are projected in the range of $352 million to $359 million. Furthermore, free cash flow is expected to be more than $35 million.It is important to note that foreign exchange did not have any impact in the reported quarter. However, continued softness in the Vascular Access and Venous business affected revenues in the first quarter.Growth in the core Angiographic Catheter business is also likely to fortify the companyâs footprint in the global space. Angiographic business falls under the companyâs Peripheral Vascular (PV) segment. We believe that AngioVac is a key growth driver for the PV segment. Management expects the âThrombus Managementâ platform in the PV product line to lend competitive advantage and open up significant long-term opportunities.However, AngioDynamics ended the first quarter with an outstanding debt of $96.3 million. This is likely to impose certain operating and financial restrictions, impeding the companyâs core business initiatives.Coming to the stockâs price performance, AngioDynamics saw a negative return of almost 1.3% over the last year, significantly underperforming the S&P 500âs 16.4% gain over the same time frame.

598,IDXX,"Integra LifeSciences Holdings Corporation (IART  -  Free Report) has finally come up with the news of completing Codman Neurosurgery business acquisition from Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report). This development was expected at the heels of last monthâs major asset divestment initiative by the company. The whopping $1.045 billion purchase has been considered a major breakthrough for Integra as it will provide the company with global reach in Neurosurgery, thus connoting the core expertise within the companyâs Specialty Surgical Solutions.Integra expects to complete the said asset divestment soon that forms part of certain closing conditions toward the Codman acquisition. Notably, Integra has signed a definitive agreement to sell the companyâs certain neurosurgery assets to healthcare products and services provider, Natus Medical Incorporated (BABY  -  Free Report), for a total deal value of $47.5 million.The company has also decided to sell the global Camino ICP monitoring product line, including its San Diego manufacturing facility, to Natus Medical. Additionally, Natus will get hold of the U.S. rights related to Integraâs fixed pressure shunts as well as the U.S. rights to Codmanâs DURAFORM dural graft implant, standard EVD catheters and CSF collection systems.Earlier, while announcing the set of divestitures to Natus, Integra had discussed its imminent financial impact. Per the company, in 2016, approximately $50 million of revenues were earned from the neurosurgery product lines associated with these divestitures. Taking net of divestitures and the Codman acquisition into account, the company on a preliminary basis, estimated fourth-quarter 2017 revenue contribution of approximately $60-$65 million. For full-year 2018, Integra expects Codman Neurosurgery to contribute between $290 million and $300 million in revenue and net of divestitures.Overall, the Codman Neurosurgery business is anticipated to remain accretive toward Integraâs 2018 adjusted earnings per share and contribute at least 22 cents. However, for full-year 2017, Integra expects minimal contribution from Codman Neurosurgery to adjusted earnings per share.Integra LifeSciences Holdings Corporation Price and Consensus Integra LifeSciences Holdings Corporation Price and Consensus | Integra LifeSciences Holdings Corporation QuotePer Integra, Codman Neurosurgeryâs existing portfolio and new product pipeline in advanced hydrocephalus, neuro-critical care and electrosurgery are going to complement the acquirerâs leading products and pipeline in tissue ablation, dural repair and cranial stabilization. Post the closure of this buyout, the consolidated portfolio will offer complete solutions for neurosurgery and the scale to invest as well as bring in new technologies to the table for patients worldwide.Notably, per a report by Radiant Insights, the global neurosurgery market is projected to witness an estimated CAGR of around 10-12% during 2015-2019. Taking into consideration this huge growth prospect, we believe, Integraâs initiative to strengthen foothold in this particular niche area is well-timed.Overall, Integra has been consistently trading above the broader industry in the last six months. The stock has rallied 22.3% year to date, thus substantially outperforming the industryâs 13% gain during the period.Zacks Rank & Other Key PickIntegra currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

600,IDXX,"Ecolab Inc. (ECL  -  Free Report) recently announced plans to divest its Equipment Care segment to Audax Private Equity. Growing in upper single digits, the segment witnessed strong sales of $180 million in 2016 (almost 1.4% of net sales).The transaction is subject to regulatory clearance and is expected to close by the fourth quarter. Other terms of the agreement have been kept under wraps.It is important to note that Ecolabâs programs and services help in promoting safe food, maintaining clean environment, optimizing water and energy use and improving operational efficiencies for customers in the food, energy, healthcare, industrial and hospitality markets in more than 170 countries.Share Price FallsShares of Ecolab declined 0.3% to close at $132.55 following the news release. In fact, over the last year, Ecolab has been trading below the market at large. The stock has returned 13.2%, below the S&P 500âs return of 18.6%. The current level is also a bit lower than the broader industryâs return of 13.6% over the same time frame.In fact, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the full year dropped 1.5% to $4.73 per share in the last two months. As a result, Ecolab has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), signifying probabilities of underperformance in the near term.Â Â Equipment Care Segment at a GlanceThe Equipment Care segment has been offering commercial kitchen equipment maintenance for Ecolab over the last 90 years. Despite yielding stellar returns last year, in August, management at Ecolab announced that its equipment care business has been witnessing a quiet period lately, registering just 2% growth on a year-over-year basis in the last quarter. Adding to the woes, the segment ran short of manpower in the recent past.Apart from being a leading player in the Chemical-Specialty space, comprehensive and diversified offerings like equipment care have lent Ecolab a competitive edge in the global market.We believe the divestiture will enhance Ecolabâs strategic focus on core segments like Global Industrial, Global Institutional and Global Energy. However, it is difficult to gauge the impact of the divestiture on Ecolabâs full-year results, at least for now. In this regard, Ecolab had provided full year guidance of adjusted diluted earnings per share in the band of $4.70 to $4.90 earlier.Key PicksA few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are SONOVA HOLDING (SONVY  -  Free Report), IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.

604,IDXX,"Boston Scientific Corporation (BSX  -  Free Report) recently announced plans to acquire Campbell, CA-based privately-held company Apama Medical Inc. for a total value of around $300 million. This is in line with the companyâs strategy to gain traction in the Electrophysiology market, which is poised to reach a value of more than $9 billion in 2017 (as per data by Articles Factory).The deal is slated to close in the fourth quarter of 2017, subject to customary closing conditions.Per the acquisition agreement, subject to the attainment of certain clinical and regulatory targets, Boston Scientific is scheduled to pay a maximum of $125 million in contingent payments between 2018 and 2020 along with $175 million in cash on an immediate basis. However, the company does not expect this buyout to prove accretive to adjusted earnings in 2017 or even 2018.Apama Medical is involved in research and development of Apama Radiofrequency (RF) Balloon Catheter SystemÂ for the treatment of atrial fibrillation (AF). Per management, AF is a heart rhythm disorder which has affected roughly 33 million globally.Through this deal, Boston Scientific aims to expand its suite of arrhythmia solutions which fall under the Electrophysiology sub-segment of the company. The company also intends to integrate its RHYTHMIA HDx Mapping System with Apama RF balloon system in order to enhance the visualization of the heart during ablation processes.Although Apama RF balloon is expected to receive CE Mark approval in late-2018, the AF-FICIENT study results presented at the AF Symposium Annual Meeting in January have been favorable.Interestingly, Boston Scientificâs Electrophysiology revenues improved in the last reported quarter on higher uptake of the new RHYTHMIA HDx platform. Management continues to roll out the HDx platform in Europe and recently initiated the same in the United States and Japan.Overall, the company continues to expand the toolkit that supports RHYTHMIA HDx, providing ablation technologies that match the excellence of its Mapping System and adding tools that expand the reach and utility of RHYTHMIA HDx in different procedure types. In this context, the company plans to launch IntellaNav MiFi Open-Irrigated Therapeutic Catheter in Europe and the United States in the third quarter.Moreover, Boston Scientificâs strategy to gain traction in the Electrophysiology sub-segment seems to be aligned with data provided byÂ Allied Market Research.Â Â Per the report, the global Cardiac Monitoring and Cardiac Rhythm Management marketÂ is expected to see a CAGR of 7.6% from 2016 to 2022 to reach a value of $32,216 million.We believe that unhealthy lifestyle and a rise in ageing population will continue to result in high incidence of cardiovascular diseases.

606,IDXX,"Quest Diagnostics(DGX  -  Free Report) recently announced the completion of the buyout of outreach laboratory service operations of Hartford HealthCare hospitals â The William W. Backus Hospital and The Hospital of Central Connecticut. However, the financial terms of the transaction have been kept under wraps.Now on, the laboratory operations of the hospitals will be shifted to Quest Diagnosticsâ advanced full-service clinical laboratory in Marlborough, MA, along with rapid response laboratories inÂ Wallingford,Â Torrington,Â Stratford,Â HartfordÂ and Norwich based in Connecticut.Â The buyouts, which have been approved by the state of Connecticut's Office of Health Care Access, will give care providers direct access to Quest Diagnosticsâ broader menu of services along with a wider network of patient service centers.Per the company, this deal will strengthen its business relationship with Hartford HealthCare. In this context, Quest Diagnostics had acquired the outreach laboratory service business of Clinical Laboratory Partners, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Hartford HealthCare, in 2016. Â We are also highly optimistic about the companyâs focus on its two-point strategy. According to Quest Diagnostics, its planned divestiture of the Focus Diagnostics products business is part of its strategy to refocus on diagnostic information services.Â Additionally, several new collaborations with hospitals and integrated delivery networks have turned out to be major growth drivers. In this regard, we are looking forward to the companyâs deal with Walmart. Particularly, the company is positive about its recent agreement with PeaceHealth in the Pacific Northwest, which is expected to bolster growth in 2017. Also, management is upbeat about the latest acquisitions of Med Fusion and ClearPoint to advance in the diagnostics space. We are also encouraged by the companyâs plan to acquire the outreach laboratory servicesÂ business of Cape Cod Healthcare.Per the company, these tuck-in acquisitions fit well within the ambit of M&A guidelines. Quest Diagnosticsâ takeover plans are consistent with its goal of contributing 1-2% to revenues annually through accretive acquisitions. Thus, we believe this latest buyout will widen the customer base of this leading diagnostic services information provider.Share Price PerformanceQuest Diagnostics has been gaining investor confidence on consistently positive results.

613,IDXX,"Following the CE Mark approval earlier this month, Integra LifeSciences Holdings Corporation (IART  -  Free Report) recently announced the launch of meshed acellular dermal tissue matrix (ADM) â SurgiMend PRS Meshed â for both pre- and sub-pectoral breast reconstruction in Europe.The SurgiMend PRS Meshed solution allows patients to opt for just one single-stage implant breast reconstruction post-mastectomy, instead of multiple-stage surgery. This launch is expected to widen the companyâs portfolio of acellular dermal tissue matrix for plastic and reconstructive surgery, including breast reconstruction.Along with this announcement, the global medical technology company announced that this collagen matrix SurgiMend PRS Meshed featuring a 2: 1 meshing pattern, will be available in a 20 centimeters (cms) X 10 cms configuration that expands to roughly 18 cms X 22 cms when hydrated and fully expanded.Interestingly, the ADM product line falls under the companyâs Orthopedics and Tissue Technologies segment which contributed 43.3% of the companyâs total revenues in the last reported quarter. The latest launch is expected to further boost the top-line contribution from this segment.In May, the company launched SurgiMend MP â a collagen matrix for complex abdominal hernia repair â featuring a highly macroporous design that enables fluid drainage. Also, the company announced the European launch of Dermal Regeneration Template Single Layer ""Thin"" for dermal repair defects reconstruction in ""one-step"" procedure in the same month.Integra LifeSciencesâ efforts to grow in the plastic and reconstructive surgery market seem to be strategic as per Technavio data published in Business Wire. Per the report, the global plastic surgery products market is expected to reach a value of around $15 billion, at a CAGR of 9% between 2016 and 2020.Growing consciousness about appearance among women, increasing awareness and rising expenditure in healthcare and technological advancements are likely to drive demand for cosmetic surgeries over time. This fact is further substantiated by data provided by Global Market Insights, which projects that the global breast implants market is set to reach a worth of roughly $ 1,482.1 million at a CAGR of 4.1% in the 2016-2024 period.We believe the latest launch will help Integra LifeSciences cash in on the bountiful opportunities in this niche market.Share Price PerformanceIn the last six months, Integra LifeSciences has been consistently trading above the broader industry. To date, the stock has gained 21.9%, higher than the 13.5% gain of the broader industry.Â Â Zacks Rank & Other Key PicksIntegra LifeSciences currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

614,IDXX,"On Oct 3, we issued an updated research report on Chesterbrook, PA-based AmerisourceBergen Corporation (ABC  -  Free Report) â one of the worldâs largest pharmaceutical services companies. The company focuses on providing drug distribution and related services to reduce health care costs and improve patient outcome. The company currently has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).AmerisourceBergen had an unimpressive run on the bourse in the last three months, trading below the industry in terms of price performance. A glimpse at the price movement reveals that AmerisourceBergenâs shares have lost 13.0%, comparing unfavorably with the 3.7% gain of the industry it belongs to.The unfavorable performance was led by pricing pressure in the generic drug space and lackluster guidance for the full year. AmerisourceBergen expects fiscal 2017 revenue growth in the range of 5.5% to 6.5%, significantly lower than the previous range of 6.5% to 8% band. The company expects brand drug inflation in the range of 7% to 9%.AmerisourceBergen took over PharMEDium Healthcare Holdings for $2.58 billion back in 2015. We believe that the temporary slowdown in PharMEDium growth will mar AmerisourceBergen's bottom line in the coming quarters. Notably, the company aims to boost its investments to enhance PharMEDium's quality assurance (QA) and quality control (QC) systems in terms of product quality and patient safety. Although this lends the company a competitive advantage in the long haul, this might result in a bottom-line headwind for the business in fiscal 2017.Lackluster performance in the hepatitis C revenue segment is another concern. AmerisourceBergen witnessed a negative revenue impact from declining sales at the segment in the last reported second quarter. Revenues improved only 4% to $37.1 billion in the quarter, which might have been around 5.5% without the adverse impact of the hepatitis C segment.Cutthroat competition in the niche space is an additional concern. AmerisourceBergen operates in a highly competitive pharmaceutical distribution and related health care services market. The companyâs primary competitors are national generic and regional distributors.The generic industry is witnessing consolidation of customers and manufacturers, globalization and increasing quality along with regulatory challenges. The company also faces competition from manufacturers, chain drugstores, specialty distributors and packaging and health care technology companies.Key PicksA few better-ranked medical stocks are IDEXX Laboratories, Inc (IDXX  -  Free Report), Luminex Corporation (LMNX  -  Free Report) and Masimo Corporation (MASI  -  Free Report), each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of todayâs Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here.IDEXX Laboratories has a positive earnings surprise of 9.3% over the last four quarters.

615,IDXX,"On Oct 6, we issued an updated research report on Denver, CO-based DaVita HealthCare Partners Inc. (DVA  -  Free Report), a leading provider of dialysis services in the United States to patients suffering from chronic kidney failure, which is also known as end stage renal disease (ESRD).Over the past six months, shares of the company have been trading below the broader industry. The stock has lost 12.4% compared with the broader industryâs 5.4% declined.Â Acquiring dialysis centers and businesses that own and operate similar centers and other ancillary services has been DaVitaâs preferred business strategy for long. This strategy has boosted the companyâs top line to a large extent.Of the major acquisitions in the recent past, The Everett Clinic, a medical group within the DaVita Medical Group division, acquired Totem Lake Family Medicine which is a renowned medical group.Further, DaVita announced that HealthCare Partners has entered into a strategic partnership with Cigna, a global health insurance service company. Per the agreement, the duo will offer HMO (Health Maintenance Organization)Â  health plans and integrated health care options to employers in and around Los Angeles.Steady expansion in the overseas markets through strategic alliances and acquisition of dialysis centers has played a key role in boosting growth for DaVita. In the past few years, the company has strengthened its position in the emerging and developing markets of Columbia, Portugal, Malaysia, Taiwan, Saudi Arabia, China, India and Germany. This is expected to help DaVita deliver more efficient patient care.However, the company expects a hike in its dialysis and related lab services general and administrative expenses in the upcoming quarters. DaVitaâs plan to undertake initiatives to improve its information technology infrastructure is likely to result in higher costs. Investments to support regulatory compliance and legal matters as well as efforts to tap into new business opportunities will drive expenses.Zacks Rank & Key PicksDaVita HealthCare currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the medical sector are Orthofix International N.V. (OFIX  -  Free Report), Luminex Corporation (LMNX  -  Free Report) and IDEXX Laboratories, Inc (IDXX  -  Free Report).

616,IDXX,"Cardiovascular Systems, Inc.(CSII  -  Free Report) expects fiscal 2018 first-quarter revenues to be affected by the devastating Harvey and Irma hurricanes. Earlier, the company had estimated revenues in the range of $52.6-$53.6 million for the quarter.Â However, taking effects of the hurricanes into account, the company anticipates a drop in first-quarter 2018 revenues from the previously guided range.According to Cardiovascular Systems, more than 15% of the companyâs revenues are generated from the Houston and Florida.The hurricanes have dented procedure volumes in the greater Houston area and throughout Florida. Moreover, fiscal first quarter revenues are more heavily weighted in September because procedure volumes start to pick up from summer levels. Thus, the company is not confident about meeting the previously guided range for first-quarter revenues.Though management expects the short-term performance to be affected, the long-term prospects are likely to be untarnished.Â In the majority of the last year, Cardiovascular Systems has been trading above the broader industry. Currently, the stock has gained 18.5%, higher than the 10.3% gain of the broader industry. However, the stock lost 7.4% after the announcement on Sep 18, 2017.Estimate Revision TrendThe estimate revision trend has been unfavorable for the company. For the current quarter, no estimates moved north compared with one movement in the opposite direction over the last two months. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the full year has fallen from 2 cents to a loss of 7 cents per share over the same period.Zacks Rank & Key PicksCardiovascular Systemscarries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

617,IDXX,"On Sep 18, we issued an updated research report on leading manufacturer of proprietary life science and materials research systems, Bruker CorporationÂ (BRKR  -  Free Report).Over the last three months, this Billerica, MA-basedÂ company has gained 7.1% as compared with the industryâs 4%. The companyâs impressive second-quarter 2017 earnings and revenue growth has bolstered market confidence leading to a further rally in its share price.Of late, theÂ company has been witnessing growth in its Nano Surfaces business on restructuring and cost-reduction actions. The portfolio also got a boost from the acquisition of Hysitron nano indenting products at the beginning of 2017 along with improved results at the AXS business. Moreover, we are upbeat about thecompanyâs recent launch of D8 VENTURE BIOTOOLS for laboratory macromolecular crystallography which will be part of the AXS segment within Bruker Nano. Additionally, the company gained traction in the semiconductor metrology markets along with certain industrial and applied end-market segments.This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company has been consistently introducing products in its portfolio. The company recently unveiled the D8 DISCOVER Plus X-ray diffraction (XRD) system at the Japan Analytical Scientific Instruments Show (JASIS). We are also encouraged by the launch of EIGER2 R 500K â the latest generation of Hybrid Photon Counting (HPC) pixel detectors â by Bruker and DECTRIS. Notably, built by DECTRIS, the EIGER2 R 500K detector has been integrated into Brukerâs D8 ADVANCE and D8 DISCOVER instrument platforms to enhance several X-ray diffraction (XRD) applications.We are also impressed with Brukerâs latest product developmental activities under the Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy business. The companyâs line of launches includes the AVANCE NEO platform, a next-generation NMR console and S8 TIGER Series 2 spectrometer. Management also claims to have made technical and quality progress with its high-temperature superconducting (HTS) tapes. Management expects HTS to boost its ultra-high field 1.2 gigahertz NMR business in 2018 and beyond. We are also upbeat about the companyâs receipt of FDA approval for adding 144 new species to its MALDI Biotyper-CA system for efficient microbial identification. Notably, MALDI Biotyper is the companyâs latest revolutionary approach for the analysis of microorganisms.Of late, Bruker has been working on chalking out strategies to improve its financial performance. These initiatives include the divestiture of certain non-core businesses, outsourcing of various manufacturing activities and transferring or ceasing of operations at certain facilities. Meanwhile, the companyâs raised revenue guidance raises optimism.On the flip side, Bruker conducts 80% of its business in international markets. As a result, adverse currency fluctuations continue to result in losses for the company. Moreover, headwinds such as unfavorable economic conditions and intense competition continue to pose threats.Key PicksA few better-ranked medical stocks are Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (EW  -  Free Report), Amedisys, Inc.

618,IDXX,"Developer of robotic technology and products Mazor Robotics Ltd (MZOR  -  Free Report), recently announced that it expects to report third-quarter 2017 revenues of approximately $17.2 million compared with $8 million in the year-ago quarter. The bullishness comes from strength in Mazor X system sales and increased procedure volumes.Stock PerformanceLately, the price performance of the Israel-based company has been encouraging. In the last three months, the stock has returned 28.9%, outperforming the industryâs gain of roughly 3.0%. The stockâs current return was higher than the S&P 500âs return of 4.1% over the same time frame.Â Â Despite the bullish price trend, estimate revision for the stock has been quite disappointing. The full year saw two estimates moving south in the last two months, compared with no movement in the opposite direction. As a result, the estimate contracted to a loss of 86 cents per share from a loss of 88 cents during the aforementioned period.Factors Behind Mazor X StrengthDuring the third quarter, the company received purchase orders for 19 Mazor X systems in the United States. In addition, Mazor received purchase orders for three Renaissance systems for the Chinese market.Mazor X is a transformative guidance system for simplifying spine surgeries with advanced features and ""sophisticated integrative abilities."" Strong demand for Mazor X systems during the third quarter reached backlog to 17 since its introduction in the second half of 2016. The company is slated to report financial results for the third quarter ended Sep 30, in November.Bottom LineWe are hopeful about the encouraging global spine surgery market. A research report by Markets And Markets suggests that the niche markets are estimated to reach $17.27 billion by 2021, at a CAGR of 5.3%.In fact, the increasing utilization rate of Mazor X is quite compelling for the company. We believe that the commercialization cycle of the Mazor X platform is progressing per plans with a growing customer base.Zacks Rank & Other Key PicksCurrently, Mazor has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). A few other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are Abbott (ABT  -  Free Report), IDEXX Laboratories, Inc (IDXX  -  Free Report) and Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc (TMO  -  Free Report).

619,IDXX,"While the Wall Street is gearing up for the third-quarter releases, the Republicans have lost another battle pertaining to the repeal of Affordable Care Act (ACA), or Obamacare, with the recent Graham-Cassidy bill defeat.âSometimes by losing a battle you find a new way to win the war.â â President Trump.However, recent developments suggest that tables might turn again. The Presidentâs latest âExecutive Orderâ that aims to exempt certain Association health plans to buy health insurance from the core Obamacare schedule, can take the shape of a serious threat for the healthcare community at large. Also, Rep. Lindsey Grahamâs promise to revisit the Graham-Cassidy legislation deserves a mention here.Despite these issues, the MedTech industry has so far had a bullish run in 2017. Notwithstanding this, the third quarter is likely to take a hit from the policy debacle. In fact, the latest GOP defeat dampens probabilities of a new Republican healthcare reform with better tax paradigms, any time soon.Here we take a sneak peek into two other burning issues that are likely to impact the quarterly numbers in the MedTech fraternity.Tax Woes: At present, the point of focus at the Capitol Hill seems to be tax cuts. The MedTech community had been quite hopeful since the change in presidential power, as Trumpâs proposed policies have been in favor of the abolition of the infamous 2.3% medical device sales tax. Undoubtedly, abolition of these tax paradigms are far from being achieved.Added to this, a stronger dollar, pricing and shipping-related issues as well as core market challenges are likely to affect the quarterly numbers of MedTech majors this season.Hurricanes Deal a Blow: Various reports suggest that the unfortunate occurrences of the hurricanes at the end of the third quarter are likely to mar revenues and earnings of several MedTech companies, primarily in Florida, Texas and Puerto Rico. MedTech major Medtronic (MDT  -  Free Report) acknowledged the impact of the Hurricane Maria on its quarterly metrics. The company expects almost $250 million impact on revenues and earnings.Apart from the natural calamities, a rise in unemployment (though short lived) and decline in consumer income coupled with increasing aggregate spending are likely to deal a heavy blow to MedTech numbers.Stocks to Buy for Solid Returns in Q3We have taken the help of the Zacks Stock Screener to shortlist MedTech stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and are expected to yield solid results in the third quarter.

621,IDXX,"On Sep 15, we issued an updated research report on San Francisco, CA-based McKesson Corporation (MCK  -  Free Report), a health care services and information technology company. The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Over the past month, McKesson has been trading above the broader industry. Per the last trading price, the stock has gained 2.6%, higher than the broader marketâs gain of 2.3%. The company continues to witness strong growth in pharma and biotech backed by solid market fundamentals and planned growth strategy. The raised 2017 guidance is also encouraging.McKesson delivered disappointing results in the recently reported first-quarter fiscal 2018, wherein adjusted earnings and revenues missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The quarter saw strong performance by the Distribution Solutions segment. The segment is expected to remain consistent with its performance in fiscal 2018 despite weak pricing trends and customer consolidation.

In fact, bookings in the second quarter of 2017 were $1.636 billion (an all-time high), up 16% on a year-over-year basis.A secondary growth driver for Cerner is its Population Health (âPHâ) Management platform.

PetMed currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Over the last six months, PetMed has been trading above the broader industry. Per the last trading price, the company has gained a stupendous 75.5% when compared with 27.6% growth of the broader industry.In the fiscal first quarter, PetMed posted better-than-expected results, marking a solid start to fiscal 2018. We are encouraged by the significant increase in reorder sales and new order sales in the quarter and expect the same to continue throughout the year.PetMed is striving to implement several strategies to revitalize its top line. These include focusing on advertising efficiency to boost new order sales and shifting sales to higher margin items, while expanding product offerings. However, we are apprehensive about escalating advertising expenses incurred in the quarter.The company markets its products primarily under well-known brands of medication such as Frontline Plus, K9 Advantix, Advantage,Â Heartgard Plus, Sentinel and Interceptor, among others.On the flip side, PetMed operates in a highly competitive and fragmented pet medications market.

627,IDXX,"Investors keen on the consolidation of Abbott Labs (ABT  -  Free Report) with Alere may expect that much-awaited good news to arrive soon. Per Abbottâs latest update, with all the necessary regulatory clearances getting fulfilled for the closure, the company finally plans to complete the hugely contentious acquisition of Alere, Inc., on Oct 3, 2017.Notably, after a yearâs rollercoaster ride to overcome the regulatory hurdles, both Abbott and Alere had progressed with the merger process based on certain amended terms of the original agreement.Per the amended agreement clauses (announced earlier in April), Abbott has agreed to pay $51 per common share to acquire Alere, a reduction from the earlier deal of $56 per common share in cash upon the transactionâs conclusion. This results in an expected, new equity value of approximately $5.3 billion, lower than the originally estimated equity value of almost $5.8 billion.Our TakeAbbott has stated that with the successful wrap up of this transaction, its total diagnostics sales should be $7 billion. The company also anticipates to emerge a lead player in the $7 billion point-of-care diagnostic space within the broader $50 billion in-vitro diagnostics market with this takeover. The combined entity is expected to generate approximately $2.5 billion in point of care testing sales worldwide.The buyout would also enable the company to gain an access to new channels and geographies, including entries into fast growing outlets, such as doctorsâ offices, clinics, pharmacies and at-home testing. More to that, Alereâs complementary portfolio of diagnostic products, comprising tests for infections such as HIV, tuberculosis, malaria and dengue will be added to Abbottâs portfolio. Significantly, Alere develops simple, rapid tests, including Alere i â the molecular test for flu and strep â to deliver reports in less than 15 minutes.Hence, the shared business will offer several options of tests in a broad array, for instance, infectious disease, molecular, cardiometabolic and toxicology testings. Also, this union would definitely expand Abbott Labsâ platforms to include benchtop and rapid strep tests. Although Alere would hitherto generate over half its total sales from the United States alone, the company has a growing presence in key international markets with potential to strengthen Abbottâs footprint ahead in these territories.Price PerformanceOver the past three months, Abbottâs share price has outperformed the broader industry it belongs to.

Notably, Allscripts is the first major healthcare information technology player to come up with such a solution.Undoubtedly, Allscripts Real-Time Health System will boost consumer knowledge and satisfaction. Per management, the company will embed prescription pricing information into the work-flow system with the help of leading pharmacy benefit managers and technology partners in the nation.In this regard Management at Allscripts is hopeful about the companyâs partnerships with DrFirst, GoodRx and Surescripts to deliver real-time benefit and price information.Earlier this month, Allscripts announced that its dbMotion Solution platform has been selected by South Western Sydney PHN (SWSPHN) to deliver integrated care. Notably, dbMotion Solution is Allscriptsâ proprietary Community interoperability platform.

It will also help SWSPHN collaborate with internationally recognized dbMotion sites in the United States, Canada, the U.K. and Israel.Stock Performance Lacks LusterAllscripts has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The company has had a discouraging run on the bourse over the last one year. The stock represented a return of just 4.5%, comparing unfavorably with the S&P 500âs gain of 16.5%. Further, the current level is lower than the broader industryâs return of 9.6% over the same time frame.Notably, Allscripts expects a modest increase in operating expenses during the second half of 2017 to support business growth. The companyâs products have a long sales cycle which involves decision making at different managerial levels. This increases the companyâs operating expenses and might even result in cancellation of orders.Â Our TakeAllscriptsâ management is focused on various restructuring initiatives, research and development plans and launch of exclusive products. Management has also been trying to streamline operational efficiency and cater to client needs with the introduction of products.We believe favorable demographic trends, reinforced by a supportive regulatory environment, are expected to sustain growth in demand for the company.

A few of the companyâs other strategic purchases are Finesse Solutions and Alfa Aesar.Meanwhile, this Waltham, MA-based company plans to continue to strengthen its foothold in emerging markets, such as China and India, and to translate this success to other high-priority opportunities in regions such as South Korea, Russia and Brazil. In the second quarter of 2017, the company recorded solid contributions from China, India and the Middle East. We are also upbeat about the companyâs recent opening of a Center of Excellence for electron microscopy in Saudi Arabia.Additionally, Thermo Fisher has a strong cash balance that enables it to adopt attractive share repurchase programs and in turn provide solid returns to investors.On the flip side, Thermo Fisher derives majority of its revenues from the international market, which exposes it to fluctuations in foreign currency.

633,IDXX,"NuVasive, Inc. (NUVA  -  Free Report) successfully continues to make way through the companyâs strategy to strengthen footprint in the fast-growing spine market. Following last weekâs announcement of Vertera Spine buyout, the company is once again in news, courtesy the commercial launch of its LessRay software technology system.Â Per NuVasive, this LessRay system is based on a propriety software algorithm and hardware components. It particularly works to help address overexposure to radiation in hospital operating rooms (O.R.), mostly in the case of minimally invasive spine surgery (MIS).Per study results provided by the company, spine and orthopedic surgeons receive lifetime occupational radiation limit within the first 10 years of their career. Statistics reveal that cancer rates and contraction of cataracts associated with radiation exposure are nearly double compared with other surgery practices.NuVasive claims that LessRay systemâs proprietary image enhancement technology improves low-dose, low-radiation fluoroscopy images to derive similar diagnostic capabilities as those of conventional full-dose fluoroscopy. This will accordingly reduce radiation emission and exposure in the O.R. while retaining the high resolution of a full radiation dose shot.NuVasive considers this breakthrough an important milestone in healthcare facilities as it begins to sell capital equipment and brings in technology advancements to the hospital O.R. Apart from curbing radiation exposure, this LessRay system enhances imaging capability to improve spine surgery productivity and eventually, predictability.Taking into consideration the healthy pipeline of interests from customers, NuVasive expects a huge customer adoption rate following the launch of LessRay system.Notably, NuVasive is leaving no stone unturned to capture the rapidly-evolving spine market. During the recently-reported second quarter of 2017, the companyâs core U.S. spinal hardware business maintained the bullish trend by reporting 3% growth. The upside was driven by a strong consistent adoption of ReLine posterior fixation system within the companyâs iGA platform. The company also witnessed a steady uptake of its recently launched expandable interbody cages and base TI interfixated within the ALIF procedure.With the latest acquisition of Vertera Spine, NuVasive aims to market and distribute Vetera Spineâs FDA-approved COHERE Cervical and COALESCETM Lumbar Interbody fusion devices in the United States. This deal will also lend the company with a three-dimensional porous interbody technology across both polyetheretherketone (PEEK) and titanium materials.Over the past three months, NuVasive has underperformed the broader industry.Â The stock has sunk 26% in contrast to the 1.6% gain of the broader industry during the period.Â We expect the company to bounce back with the slew of latest developments within Spine space.Zacks Rank & Key PicksNuVasive currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

634,IDXX,"Genomic Health, Inc. (GHDX  -  Free Report)Â and Biocartis Group NV (BCART) signed an agreement to develop an in vitro diagnostic (IVD) version of the Oncotype DX Breast Recurrence Scoretest on Biocartis' proprietaryÂ Idylla platform. This can be performed locally by laboratory partners as well as hospitals globally. Biocartis is an innovative molecular diagnostics company providing next generation diagnostic solutions.According to Genomic Health, the Oncotype DX Breast Recurrence Score test evaluates the activity of 21 genes in a patient's breast tumor tissue. This provides customized treatment options based on the biology of the patientsâ individual disease. The company claims this to be the only proven test to predict chemotherapy benefit. Consequently, this is included in all major cancer guidelines worldwide. Further, the test is considered standard of care for early-stage breast cancer.Biocartis' Idylla platformÂ provides a unique solution that is unparalleled in the localization of complex molecular diagnostics. Based on the advanced features of the Idylla platform, Genomic Health expects local pathology labs to generate Oncotype DX Breast Recurrence Score results with minimal labor and efficient turnaround time. The company also looks forward to maintaining the high quality and clinical utility that physicians and patients expect from Oncotype DX.This agreement will provide Genomic Health rights to develop and commercialize Oncotype DX Breast Recurrence Score test on the Idylla platform. The development of the Oncotype DXÂ IVD test is expected to initiate in late 2017. Genomic Health is anticipated to pay aroundÂ $3.3 millionÂ to Biocartis in the third quarter of 2017. Rest of the payments will be made to Biocartis after achieving few commercial milestones.Excluding the transaction cost of the partnership, Genomic Health continues to anticipate earning profits in full year 2017. Per the agreement, the company will make royalty payments based on net sales of the IVD tests developed on the Biocartis Idylla platform, post commercialization.In September, Genomic Health announced that new data shows additional evidence of the unmatched value of the Oncotype DX Breast Recurrence Scoretest in predicting outcomes in early-stage breast cancer patients accurately.In July, majority of panelists from the St. Gallen International Breast Cancer Conference Expert Panel supported that Oncotype DX was the only test providing information that aided physicians in taking the decision to omit chemotherapy in patients with up to three positive nodes. The panel also published updated guidelines endorsing Oncotype DX for guiding chemotherapy treatment decisions in both node-negative and node-positive breast cancer patients.In June, five studies in breast cancer were presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (âASCOâ) Annual Meeting, including new analyses from the tie ups with the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results or SEER Registry program. The study focused on outcomes of more than 49,000 women who have received an Oncotype DX Breast Recurrence Score test. One of these analyses examines the risk of breast cancer-specific mortality across the full range of Recurrence Score results and is consistent with previous validation studies.According to a report by GBI Research, the global breast cancer therapeutics market is estimated to reach $17.2 billion by 2021, at a CAGR of 7.3%. Considering the huge potential of the market, we believe the latest agreement is a strategical fit.In the past year, Genomic Health has been trading above the broader industry.

635,IDXX,"AngioDynamics Inc. (ANGO  -  Free Report) reported adjusted earnings of 12 cents per share in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. Earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4 cents and decreased 29.4% year over year. Meanwhile, net sales fell almost 3.4% on a year-over-year basis to $85.4 million, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $86 million.It is important to note that foreign exchange did not have any impact in the reported quarter. However, continued softness in the Vascular Access and Venous business affected revenues in the first quarter.Internationally, AngioDynamics registered revenues of $16.5 million, up from $15.9 million in the year-ago quarter. International growth was strengthened by solid sales from the Oncology and Surgery business. However, the company registered $68.9 million revenues in the United States, down from $72.2 million on a year-over-year basis. The lackluster performance was led by softness in the venous business, which was more or less muted by growth in the oncology portfolio.AngioDynamics, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseÂ  AngioDynamics, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | AngioDynamics, Inc. QuoteSegment DetailsPeripheral Vascular (PV) business: Sales at this segment totaled $49.9 million in the reported quarter, lower than $52 million in the year-ago quarter.The quarter saw slow growth in the venous and core businesses, which was offset by stellar performance in fluid management and thrombus management product lines.Despite the disappointing performance in the PV segment, management expects the thrombus management platform to lend the company a competitive edge and open up significant long-term opportunities.We note that AngioDynamics is a leading player in the thrombolytic catheters space (catheter directed thrombolysis). The company boasts highly unique catheters like Uni-Fuse, SpeedLyser and Pulse Spray under the thrombus portfolio.Vascular Access (VA) business: Sales at this segment were $23.2 million, down from $25 million on a year-over-year basis. However, this was offset by solid growth at BioFlo Midlines and Dialysis.The BioFlo line of products at the segment is expected to be a key catalyst.Oncology/Surgery business: AngioDynamics witnessed sales of$12.3 million in the first quarter, up from $11.1 million on a year-over-year basis. The segment performed impressively on the recent launch of Solero Microwave Tissue Ablation System.Meanwhile, AngioDynamics announced market withdrawal of its flagship Acculis Microwave Tissue Ablation System in the last quarter.Margin DetailsAdjusted gross margin decreased 280 basis points (bps) to 48.3% in the quarter. The decline in gross margin was primarily because of voluntary market withdrawal of the Acculis Microwave Tissue Ablation System in the recent past. Solero's direct impact on gross margins was approximately 90 bps.Adjusted EBITDAS in the first quarter of fiscal 2018, excluding the items shown in the attached reconciliation table, was $10.6 million compared with $14.2 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2017.Financial ConditionAngioDynamics had a strong cash flow balance in the first quarter. Per management, the company generated $3 million in operating cash flow and $2.5 million in free cash flow.Additionally, AngioDynamics ended the quarter with $48.2 million as cash and cash equivalents and outstanding debt of $96.3 million.GuidanceAngioDynamics reaffirmed its guidance for fiscal 2018.For fiscal 2018, the company expects adjusted earnings per share in the band of 64 cents to 68 cents.The company projects fiscal 2018 revenues in the range of $352 million to $359 million.Furthermore, free cash flow is expected to be more than $35 million.Our TakeAngioDynamics reported a dismal first quarter of fiscal 2018 wherein adjusted earnings and revenues missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The company also reaffirmed its guidance for fiscal 2018. AngioDynamicis rides on the marketâs solid response to Solero, especially within the Microwave Ablation space. Growth in the core Angiographic Catheter business is also likely to fortify the companyâs footprint in the global space.On the flipside, AngioDynamics recalled the Acculis Microwave Tissue Ablation System under the Oncology and Surgery segment last quarter. The company also had a high outstanding debt level at the end of the first quarter. Higher debts impose certain operating and financial restrictions which might limit the execution of the companyâs core business strategies.Zacks Rank & Key PicksAngioDynamics has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

636,IDXX,"Since the change in political power in the United States, it has been quite a rough phase for MedTech. Things started getting worse after President Trump started proceeding with his plans to repeal Obamacare. After a series of futile attempts, the Republicans resorted to a âskinny repealâ of Obamacare which failed as well. Now, the Republicans are back with the latest Graham-Cassidy bill targeting the termination of Obamacare. While investors are busy gauging the extent of the impact of the latest Graham-Cassidy legislation on the Medical Device space, there have been a few encouraging developments in the sub industry.Meanwhile, the 18-company Zacks Outpatient Healthcare Industry, an integral part of the Medical Device space, currently has better prospects as is evident from its Zacks Industry RankÂ of #38. This places the sub industry in the top 15% of 256-plus Zacks industries. Our back-testing shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Thus, it will be prudent for investors to pick stocks from the fundamentally-strong sub industry at the moment. We have chosen Amedisys, Inc. (AMED  -  Free Report) and Chemed Corporation (CHE  -  Free Report) based on a favorable Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Amedisys with a market cap of $1.74 billion, is one of the leading providers of healthcare services in the United States. The company operates through three segments â Home Health, Hospice, and Personal Care.Meanwhile, Chemed , with a market cap of $3.05 billion, is another leading provider of hospice and palliative care services in the nation. The company operates through two segments â VITAS and Roto-Rooter.Let us now do a comparative analysis of these stocks before making the final call.Amedisys has a VGM Score of A as compared to Chemedâs C. Under the Zack Style Score system, V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum. The VGM Score is simply a weighted combination of these parameters and is a comprehensive tool that allows investors to filter through the standard scoring system and pick the winning stocks.Amedisys also has a favorable Price/Earnings to Growth (PEG) ratio of 1.25 as compared with Chemedâs 2.29. Amedisys also stands strong when compared to the broader industryâs 1.94.Amedisys Inc PEG Ratio (TTM)Â   Amedisys Inc PEG Ratio (TTM) | Amedisys Inc QuoteChemed Corp. PEG Ratio (TTM)Â  Chemed Corp. PEG Ratio (TTM) | Chemed Corp. QuoteWith an attractive three-to-five years projected earnings growth rate of 18.2%, Amedisys again scores higher than Chemedâs 10% and the industryâs 12.3%.Amedisys also boasts better leverage ratios when compared to Chemed and the broader industry. Amedisys has a favorable Debt/Equity ratio of 0.17 as compared to Chemedâs 0.25 and the industryâs 0.37. Again, Long-Term Debt/Capital ratio metric at 14.4 stands in favor of Amedisys when it comes to a comparison with Chemedâs 16.9 and 55.1 of the broader industry.Amedisysâ estimate revision trend for the current year has also been attractive when compared to Chemed. In the past 60 days, five estimates moved north, with no movement in the opposite direction for Amedisys. The magnitude of estimate revision for earnings increased around 5.7% to $2.21 over the same time frame. For Chemed, one estimate moved north, with no movement in the opposite direction over the past 60 days. The magnitude of estimate revision for earnings increased only 3.3% to $8.20 over the same time frame.Based on our detailed analysis, we can safely conclude that Amedisys makes a superior pick for your portfolio at the moment.Other Key PicksOther top-ranked medical stocks are Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (EW  -  Free Report) and IDEXX Laboratories, Inc (IDXX  -  Free Report).

637,IDXX,"On Oct 9, we issued an updated research report on Illumina, Inc. (ILMN  -  Free Report). The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Over the last three months, this San Diego, CA-based company providing tools and integrated systems for the analysis of genetic variation and function, has been trading above the broader industry. The stock has gained 17.4% in this period, higher than the broader industryâs 7.9% gain.Over the past few quarters, the company has delivered promising top-line performances primarily banking on strong product launches. The latest in the list includes the launch of VeriSeq NIPT Solution in Europe. Also overall strong uptake in NovaSeq is encouraging. Moreover, the rate of NIPT adoption is rising outside the United States.Â Â We are also upbeat about Illuminaâs partnership with Telegraph Hill Partners to set up an independent company Verogen, Inc. The independent company is expected to boost Illuminaâs next-generation sequencing (NGS) business in the forensic genomics market. Along with having global commercial rights to these products, Illumina will be the only provider of the MiSeq FGx Forensic Genomics System, including the MiSeq FGx sequencer, ForenSeq DNA Signature Prep Kit and the ForenSeq Universal Analysis Software.We are encouraged by the developments within the clinical markets where demand from customers undergoing oncology tests remains robust. Moreover, investors are awaiting response to the Extended RAS Panel which is slated for launch in the third quarter. In June, the company announced the receipt of FDA approval for the Extended RAS companion diagnostic kit (as the Class III PMA).We are also looking forward to GRAIL, Illuminaâs own-developed company, focused on the cancer screening market.On the flip side, weak margins due to the NovaSeq launch, higher array service revenues and product mix within sequencing consumables continue to raise concerns. Also, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) funding issue and a tough competitive landscape are a few challenges to deal with.Key PicksA few better-ranked stocks in the medical sector are Abbott (ABT  -  Free Report), IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.

646,IDXX,"DaVita Inc. (DVA  -  Free Report) subsidiary â DaVita Medical Group â recently announced the receipt of the Leadership in Energy & Environmental Design (LEED) Gold certification by the U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC). The award has been conferred on DaVitaâs CA-based facility, also known as Casa PacifiCA building.Notably, the LEED Gold certification is exclusively granted to buildings situated in sustainable sites with strong water, energy, atmosphere, materials and resource efficiencies. Additionally, these buildings should operate under a superior indoor environment and must show innovation in design and regional priority credits. Undoubtedly, DaVitaâs Casa PacifiCA building is a solid choice based on the aforementioned criteria.In an initiative to bolster DaVitaâs 2020 environmental goals, the companyâs operations are conducted in a healthy environment and DaVita is solely committed to improve health care in the United States without violating the basic environmental norms. In this regard, 75% of Casa PacifiCAâs construction waste was diverted from landfills.Shares Lack LusterDaVita has had an unfavorable run on the bourse in the last six months. The stock has lost almost 13.4%, much wider than the broader industryâs decline of just 4.5%. The current level also substantially underperforms the S&P 500âs gain of roughly 4.8%.

In the current quarter, two estimates moved north compared with two movements in the opposite direction over the last two months. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the ongoing quarter has inched up 1.1% to 94 cents per share during the same time frame. DaVita carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).For the full year, six estimates moved upward compared with two downward movements.

In fact, DaVitaâs Denver-based headquarters were awarded with the LEED Platinum Certification by the USGBC for operations and maintenance efficiencies only last year.Davitaâs significant growth in recent times was reflected on the back of strong patient services. Last quarter the company saw solid improvement in Kidney care. DaVita also made crucial efforts to control expenses. The companyâs strength basically lies in enhanced service offerings.

The companyâs four strategic business units (SBU) delivered better-than-expected performance on significant contributions from Biologics and Spine Fixation.Per management, the strength in the Biologics and Spine Fixation businesses is expected to continue on the back of improved performance by sales partners, expanded distributorship network and introduction of products.Moreover, Orthofix seems to be upbeat on the encouraging response received from the Spinal-Stim and Cervical-Stim bone growth therapy devices launched earlier in 2017.

650,IDXX,"The MedTech industry has been grappling with multiple issues since President Donald Trump started working toward removing Obamacare. After a series of futile attempts, Republicans settled for a âskinny repealâ, only to meet with failure again.The political scenario worsened after three Republicans voted in favor of the existing Healthcare Act. As a blessing in disguise, this has been able to delay the Cadillac tax until 2026. Also, the MedTech industry is hopeful that Trumpâs government will do away with the 2.3% medical device tax soon.Of late, Trump has been striving to implement some regulatory changes. Notably, Trump signed the FDA Reauthorization Act (FDARA) into law which extends through fiscal 2022 and revises FDA user fees for medical devices.

This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has a market cap of $2.47 billion.Allscripts Healthcare provides information technology (IT) solutions and services to healthcare organizations.Higher adoption of the companyâs EHR solutions, particularly the Sunrise EHR platform, will consistently drive the companyâs top line and help it to counter stiff competition in the long run.In an initiative to eradicate ambiguity while determining medicinal costs and discounts, Allscripts recently launched Allscripts Real-Time Health System, an exclusive work-flow solution to optimize the clinical and financial impact of medical prescriptions and enhance prescription price transparency.With the latest launch, Allscripts aims at providing clinicians and patients with complete information on medication price, cost of alternative therapies, and competitive prices of the prescribed therapy at different pharmacies.

The company is expected to maintain focus on exclusive technology that offers superior outcome and economic value to the U.S. healthcare system. The company currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Strong demand for the companyâs BioFlo platform continues to drive sales for AngioDynamics. AngioDynamicsâ expanding product portfolio, international market expansion and cost-saving initiatives represent considerable growth opportunities. The company designs, manufactures and sells a wide range of medical, surgical and diagnostic devices.The exclusive Endexo technology in BioFlo is expected to enhance the companyâs growth trajectory.

Currently, the company is expanding its dairy business in the markets of Australia, Brazil and Mexico. We believe that despite the turmoil in the economies of Russia, Greece, Brazil and China, Phibro has performed quite well and has the potential to maintain its performance.Â Â Meanwhile, Phibro endedÂ the fiscal fourth quarter on a solid note with both net sales and adjusted earnings beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Also, the year-over-year increase in both the counts is encouraging.Further, the company witnessed year-over-year improvement across all segments. We are also encouraged by the expansion in the gross and operating margin in the reported quarter. Moreover, on a full-year basis, adjusted earnings and net sales surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate as well with year-over-year increases in both. Meanwhile, the company has provided its fiscal 2018 guidance for net sales and adjusted earnings.On the flip side,Â Phibro operates in highly competitive industries. With respect to its major products, it faces threat from a substantial number of global and regional players. Phibroâs competitive position is principally based on product registrations, customer service and support, breadth of product line, product quality, manufacturing technology, facility location, and product prices.Furthermore, withdrawal of approval for Mecadox (carbadox) by the FDA continues is a concern. Additionally, Phibro conducts operations globally, which entails transactions in a variety of currencies.Â As a result, currency fluctuation is a major issue for the company.Zacks Rank & Key PicksPhibro carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

657,IDXX,"On Aug 29, we issued an updated research report on Radnor, PA-based VWR Corporation  which offers laboratory products, services and solutions. The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).We are eagerly waiting for the closing of VWRâs $6.4 billion acquisition by Avantor, a global supplier of ultra-high-purity materials for life sciences and advanced technology industries.Post-closing (expected in the fourth quarter of 2017), the consolidated entity should create a major consumables-focused solutions and services provider to high-growth life sciences and advanced technologies industries. The buyout will build on Avantorâs strengths, including its cGMP (current good manufacturing practice) processes, a significant exposure to the emerging markets and VWRâs vital position across both Americas as well as Europe.The combined company will therefore be serving a global customer base in all areas of activities from research through production, thus reflecting a unique advantage in a fast-growing marketplace.From shareholdersâ point of view, this potential merger with Avantor seems a beneficial move at the moment. The consolidation deal has been fixed at $33.25 per share in cash of VWR common stock, representing an enterprise value of approximately $6.4 billion. The purchase price represents an approximate 17% premium to the unaffected closing stock price as of May 2, 2017, the day before market speculations over a potential sale of VWR started.VWR Corporation Price and ConsensusÂ  VWR Corporation Price and Consensus | VWR Corporation QuoteNotably, the stock price has already inched closer to Avantorâs offer price while investors wait for the mergerâs closure. Hence, the short-term upside potential of VWR is limited now.Other Key PicksA few other top-ranked medical stocks are Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (EW  -  Free Report), Lantheus Holdings, Inc.

658,IDXX,"On Aug 29, we issued an updated research report on Pleasanton, CA-based The Cooper Companies (COO  -  Free Report). The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Shares of Cooper have outperformed the industry year to date. The shares of the company have increased 40.7%Â  compared with the industryâs gain of 14.0%.Additionally, the companyâs earnings estimates have moved north in the current year, reflecting analyst optimism. Over the past month, current and next earnings estimates have increased 10.2% and 6%, respectively. Moreover, Cooper reported earnings have beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters with an average surprise of 4.4%.The companyâs leading position in the markets of specialty lenses was also supported by highly exclusive products of Biofinity and Clariti. In fact, its flagship silicone hydrogel lenses are expected to deliver strong sales in the coming quarters. The company has also initiated the process of introducing MyDay lenses in the domestic market. It is already available in Europe and has gained significant traction within a short span of time. Clariti lenses also hold significant growth prospects for the company.The outlook for the contact lens industry is favorable. A fall in dropout rate of contact lens wearers and further market penetration, especially in developing nations, is expected with continuous improvisation in the technology. Growth in international markets is something that contact lens manufacturers are banking on. Furthermore, user preferences are shifting from low-feature commodity lenses to more expensive single-use and specialty lenses, such as lenses with aspherical optical properties or higher oxygen permeable lenses (silicone hydrogels).We believe that Cooper is well positioned to address this shift in customer preferences based on its expansive product portfolio. The company recently introduced Biofinity Energysâ contact lenses, which is targeted at group of users who frequently complain of discomfort arising from prolonged usage of smartphones, tablets, laptops, in-car displays and other devices. The company is a leader in the high-margin toric lens market. It offers multiple designs of toric lenses across a wide range of parameters, unlike some of its competitors, who offer the same lenses in limited designs. This is expected to further boost its top-line growth going forward.On the flip side, macroeconomic concerns in several international markets might spell trouble for the company. Additionally, the slowdown in the Chinese economy might continue to dent discretionary spending. Also given its significant international presence, Cooper remains highly vulnerable to fluctuations in exchange rates.Other Key PicksOther top-ranked medical stocks include IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.

659,IDXX,"Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (TMO  -  Free Report) recently completed the buyout of Patheon N.V. Notably, Patheon is a leading contract development and manufacturing organization (CDMO) serving the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors. With the closing of the deal, Patheon will be part of Thermo Fisher's Laboratory Products and Services segment. Thermo Fisher's initialÂ tender offer for Patheon expires after closing of the deal atÂ $35.00Â per share in cash.Patheon generated approximatelyÂ $1.9 billion revenues in fiscal 2016. Per Thermo Fisher, the collaboration should significantly strengthen its unique value proposition for Pharmaceutical and Biotech customers by adding highly complementary services.Â Thermo Fisher's revenues at the Laboratory Products and Services segment accounted for 35.9% of the total revenue and grew 4% in the second quarter. The company is making consistent efforts to drive revenue growth at this segment. Management expects to realize total synergies of approximately $120 million by year three following the close of the acquisition, consisting of approximately $90 million of cost synergies and $30 million of adjusted operating income benefit from revenue-related synergies.According to a report by Markets and Markets,the global laboratory equipment services market is estimated to reach $11.51 billion by 2021, at a CAGR of 10.0% during 2016-2021. Looking at the bountiful opportunities in this niche space, we believe this development is a strategic fit.We are upbeat about the other takeovers by Thermo Fisher in recent times. In this regard we note that Thermo Fisherâs $4.2-billion buyout of FEI Company, which closed late in 2016, has helped Thermo Fisher to access FEIâs industry leading high-performance electron microscopy platform used for protein study, facilitating life-science research.The companyâs latest takeover of Affymetrix also deserves a mention here. In genetic analysis, Affymetrixâs technologies should perfectly complement Thermo Fisherâs products in targeted clinical and applied markets.We also take into consideration the other strategic purchases by Thermo Fisher like that of Finesse Solutions, Alfa Aesar, Advanced Scientifics, One LambdaÂ and Doe & Ingalls.Over the past three months, Thermo Fisher has been trading above theÂ broader industry. Per the last trading price, the stock has gained 4.5%, better than the broader marketâs decline of 0.8% in this period.Zacks Rank & Key PicksThermo Fisher carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A few better-ranked medical stocks are Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (EW  -  Free Report), Lantheus Holdings, Inc. (LNTH  -  Free Report) and IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. (IDXX  -  Free Report).

660,IDXX,"On Sep 12, we issued an updated research report on leading molecular diagnostic company,Â Amedisys, Inc.Â (AMED  -  Free Report). The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Over the last six months, Amedisys has gained 3.1% against the industryâs 5.2% decline. The companyâs impressive results in second-quarter 2017 with both earnings and revenues significantly improving year over year have bolstered market confidence leading to a further rally in share price.We are encouraged by the companyâs long-term strategy to evolve from a traditional home health and hospice care company to a one focused on bringing home a continuum of care to serve patients better and diversify sources of payment and become less reliant on Medicare.Â Moreover, the company has been witnessing growth in the personal care segment on synergies from acquisitions. The company recently made a number of strategic acquisitions â the recent one being that of Intercity Home Carein Massachusetts which is slated for close on Oct 1.The home health industry is poised for substantial growth in the long term,Â driven by the positive demographic trend in the United States. The company is expected to continue to benefit from the aging demographics of the U.S. population and higher acuity patients in a home nursing environment.Â Notably, the company is on track to fortify its footprint in the market place. Recently, it announced the completion of National Readmission Prevention Collaborative (ââNRPCââ) certification program by clinical programs team which handles home healthcare programs.Additionally, the companyâs strong cash balance position bolsters our confidence in the stock.On the flip side, we expect synergies from the Tenet Healthcare acquisition may escalate costs and operating expenses weighing on the companyâs margins. Also, an intense competitive landscape and regulatory concerns continue to pose challenges in the home health and hospice industry.Other Key PicksA few other top-ranked medical stocks are Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (EW  -  Free Report), Lantheus Holdings, Inc.

661,IDXX,"On Sep 7, we issued an updated research report on Cincinnati, OH-based Chemed Corporation (CHE  -  Free Report). The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Over the last six months, Chemed has been trading above the broader industry. The stock has gained 7.1% as against the industryâs decline of 5.1%. Improvement in average net Medicare reimbursement rate and an increase in average daily census during the recently-reported second quarter were encouraging.The raised outlook for both Roto-Rooter segment and earnings per share is indicative of the companyâs anticipated improved operating results in the upcoming quarters, which in turn boosts investorsâ optimism on the stock.Notably, Chemedâs VITAS business had been in trouble over the past few quarters due to certain admission coding changes initiated by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS). However, management noted the recent admission trends to be positive and that should continue in the coming quarters as well.In terms of Roto-Rooter business, the company continues to display a robust performance on the strength of core plumbing and drain cleaning service segments. It also prompted a solid rise in water restoration. Management increased expectations to achieve Roto-Rooter full-year 2017 revenue growth of 12-13%, much higher than the earlier projected range of 3-4%. Revenue estimates are based on increased job pricing of approximately 2% and continued growth in water restoration services.However, headwinds like reimbursement-related issues, seasonality in business, a competitive landscape and dependence on government mandate pose challenges for Chemed.Â  Also, a tweaked guidance for Medicare Cap billing limitations is a matter of concern.Other Key PicksA few other top-ranked medical stocks are Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (EW  -  Free Report), Lantheus Holdings, Inc.

662,IDXX,"On Aug 28, we issued an updated research report on Burlington, NC-based Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings (LH  -  Free Report), popularly known as LabCorp. The company is a major player in healthcare diagnostics space, providing comprehensive clinical laboratory services and end-to-end drug development support.Last three months, LabCorp has been trading above the broader industry.Â The stock has surged 10.6% as against the industryâs 1.2% loss during this period. Despite the continued dull performance within the companyâs Covance drug development business, the market is upbeat about the Diagnostics business which has successfully demonstrated a solid show over the recent past.Although Covance Drug Developmentâs financial performance was down year over year in the recently reported second-quarter 2017, the company is currently on track to achieve its target of $100 million in cost synergies through the three-year period ending in 2017. It has also completed the remaining consolidation of central lab facilities in Europe and the United States.Notably, the companyâs strategic focus on womenâs health and reproductive genetics, besides the acquisition of Sequenom, a leader in non-invasive prenatal testing, has reenergized its larger genetic testing portfolio within Diagnostics. Also the market is looking forward to the long-standing strategic collaboration with 23andMe, which has already demonstrated an impressive growth trajectory, providing further strategic collaboration opportunities.On the flip side, an unfavorable foreign exchange remains a drag of late. The reduced guidance for 2017 also fails to indicate chances of any respite soon. There is also apprehension about a tough reimbursement scenario which the company is already facing to some degree.Zacks Rank & Key PicksLabCorp carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

664,IDXX,"On Aug 25, we issued an updated research report on Medtronic plcÂ (MDT  -  Free Report).Medtronic exited the fiscal first quarter on a mixed note, with earnings exceeding the Zacks Consensus Estimate and revenues missing the same. Over the last three months, Medtronic has underperformed the broader industry. The company has witnessed a decline in its share price since the release of quarterly results. Per the last share price movement, the company has lost 6.2%, as against the broader industryâs 0.8% gain over the last three months.Moreover, escalating costs and expenses are weighing on margins. Also, unfavorable foreign exchange continues to remain a drag.On a positive note, apart from displaying successful integration and achievement of synergy targets, Medtronicâs major business groups continue to contribute to top-line growth which highlighted sustainability across all segments and geographies. Recently, the company announced the receipt of CE Mark for Attain Stability Quad MRI SureScan Active-Fixation heart lead. We are also encouraged by the solid growth trend, continuing in the United States as well as the healthy global acceptance of its advanced therapies.Moreover, a consistent and gradually stabilizing movement in the global Cardiac Rhythm & Heart Failure (CRHF) market can be observed. This should improve further in the coming quarters.We are also looking forward to Medtronic to receive $6 billion in cash for the Patient Monitoring & Recovery (PMR) division divestment, which will strengthen the companyâs position to make further developmental investments..Meanwhile, post the Covidien acquisition, the consolidated company has so far successfully demonstrated strong segmental performance, reflecting successful integration and achievement of synergy targets.This apart, we note that despite facing severe macroeconomic pressure, Medtronic saw 12% growth in the emerging markets in the last reported quarter which contributed nearly 14% to the companyâs overall revenues. Despite strong growth, the figure was in line with the companyâs double-digit growth projections for the long term.The company is currently resorting to all possible means to boost growth. This includes penetrating the emerging markets, expansion of portfolio and restructuring of initiatives. These should benefit Medtronic over the long term. We are also encouraged by its foray into the rapidly growing transcatheter mitral valve replacement market through its $458-million acquisition of California-based medical device start-up Twelve, Inc.At present, Medtronic carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Key PicksA few better-ranked medical stocks are Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (EW  -  Free Report), IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.

PetMed currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Over the last six months, PetMed has been trading above the broader industry. Per the last trading price, the company has gained a stupendous 69.3% when compared to the 27.6% gain of the broader industry.PetMed posted better-than-expected results in the first quarter, marking a solid start to fiscal 2018. We are encouraged by the significant increase in reorder sales and new order sales in the quarter as well.We expect the companyâs impressive first-quarter performance to maintain the momentum. PetMed is striving to implement several strategies to revitalize its top line. These include focusing on advertising efficiency to boost new order sales and shifting sales to higher margin items, while also expanding product offerings. However, we are apprehensive about the escalating advertising expenses incurred in the quarter.The company markets its products primarily under well-known brands of medication such as Frontline Plus, K9 Advantix, Advantage,Â Heartgard Plus, Sentinel and Interceptor, among others.On the flip side, PetMed operates in a highly competitive and fragmented pet medications market.

669,IDXX,"Lately, the MedTech space has been facing the brunt of frequent regulatory changes. While the Trump administration is faced with a socio-economic upheaval, investors are apprehensive about its impact on stocks.Historic trends suggest that investor sentiments have always been partially inclined toward fancy brand names in a volatile economic backdrop. As a result, companies with a solid brand value and robust fundamentals generally enjoy a smooth sail even during political turbulence.One such bigwig from the MedTech space is Abbott Laboratories (ABT  -  Free Report), which has greatly evolved over the recent years. The company has pursued a slew of mergers and divestments, and has also seen solid growth in its Diabetics business. Among its strategic buyouts, the acquisitions of CFR Pharmaceuticals, Tendyne Holdings, and St. Jude Medical are worth mentioningAfter spinning off its proprietary pharmaceutical products division in 2013 to form AbbVie Inc. (ABBV  -  Free Report), Abbott has gained traction in the Established Pharmaceuticals Division. Since then, revenues have seen a CAGR of 7.6% over the last three years. Over this period, the company has more or less reported strong quarterly numbers, indicating fundamental strength.Shares Lack LusterHowever, the share price performance of Abbott has been disappointing over the same time frame. The company represents a meager return of just 19.2%, lower than the broader industryâs gain of 22.3% and the S&P 500âs return of 23.3% over the same time frame.Of the main issues plaguing Abbott, foreign exchange is a major headwind. The strengthening of the euro and some other developed market currencies have constantly hampered the companyâs performance in international markets. Abbott currently expects currency exchange to have a negative impact of around 1% on sales in 2017.Apart from this, the business environment continues to be challenging across the globe. Slow growth in the nutrition business in China and economic problems in Venezuela are expected to remain unresolved for some time, dampening the companyâs top-line growth.Bleak ProspectsWhile Abbott boasts solid fundamentals, the companyâs prospects are dull. We note that the company promises long-term earnings growth of just 10.7%, lower than the broader industryâs estimated growth rate of 13%. Furthermore, Abbottâs revenues have declined 10.7% in the last five years compared to the broader industryâs revenue growth of 6.1%.Secondly, Abbottâs historical cash-flow growth has been extremely low at -14.3%, comparing unfavorably with the broader industryâs positive growth of 5.7%. These unfavorable growth metrics are indicative of the fact that despite a solid brand value, Abbott might not prove to be a lucrative pick for the long haul.4 Growth Stocks in FocusThe long-term growth parameters are not in favor of Abbott, as it holds a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) now. So instead of opting for brand values, letâs take a look at the following four not-so-fancy MedTech stocks that are expected to gain over the long haul.

Nonetheless, the current return is relatively lower than the S&P 500âs addition of 14.5% over the same time frame.Also, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) companyâs focus on expanding into overseas markets, in particular, the emerging markets followed by new product launches and its acquisition-driven strategy are its significant growth catalysts.Our TakeBD has a diversified product portfolio, which reduces the risk of exposure to any one specific product. Additionally, a diverse revenue base and increased adoption of the companyâs new and existing products are expected to drive its top-line growth.Meanwhile, the latest development is likely to maintain the companyâs international footprint. Evidently, BD witnessed a 4.7% increase in revenues to $1.433 billion outside the United States on comparable currency-neutral basis in the last quarter.According to a report by Allied Market Research, the global sexually transmitted diseases testing market is anticipated to reach $167.4 billion by 2021, at a CAGR of 8.5%. Markedly, after considering the huge potential of the market, we believe the latest development to be a strategic fit.Stocks to Consider A few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector include Edwards Lifesciences Corp.

675,IDXX,"BostonÂ Scientific (BSX  -  Free Report) announced positive clinical trial data from the Multisensor Chronic Evaluation in Ambulatory Heart Failure Patients (MultiSENSE) study. This study (based on 900 patients) was conducted to examine the performance of the HeartLogic Heart Failure Diagnostic to predict impending heart failure (HF) decompensation.The study demonstrated that HeartLogic Diagnostic iincreases the ability to classify patients at high or low-risk of experiencing a future HF event. Presently, physicians recommend blood test to diagnose HF or determine disease severity. However, this method is less reliable as the assessment loses relevance when patientsâ conditions change. The MultiSENSE trial data showed that HeartLogic Diagnostic expanded the ability of a baseline blood test to identify patients at a high risk of a HF event.Notably, the HeartLogic Diagnostic is already CE Marked and FDA approved and will be available commercially later this year under the Rhythm Management segment.In the last reported second quarter, Rhythm Management was the second largest contributor to Boston Scientific's top line, which includes Cardiac Rhythm Management (CRM) and Electrophysiology. CRM reflected a 2% year-over-year increase in sales in the reported quarter.According to a report by GlobalData, the heart failure market is estimated to reach a value of $11.8 billion by 2025, at a CAGR of 13.7%. Considering the huge potential of the market, we believe the latest development is a strategic fit.Over the past year, Boston Scientific has been trading above the broader industry.Â The stock has risen 23.1% over this period, as against a 9.5% gain of the broader industry.Estimate Revision TrendThe estimate revision trend has been favorable for the company.

676,IDXX,"On Sep 5, 2017, we issued an updated research report on leading medical devices company, Boston Scientific Corporation (BSX  -  Free Report).Over the past three months, Boston Scientific has been trading below the broader industry on several issues. The stock has improved 2.3% compared with the broaderÂ industryâs 5.4% gain during the period.While adverse foreign exchange continues to pose challenges, we are concerned with the companyâs recall of one of its prime products, Lotus range of heart devices. It is important to note that last quarter, foreign exchange headwind affected the companyâs top line by $23 million and adjusted gross margin by 50 basis points. Also, a dull defibrillator sale within core Cardiac Rhythm Management (CRM) continues to remain a drag for overall growth. The woes of challenging economy and competitive landscape persistently burden the stock.Boston Scientific Corporation Price and ConsensusÂ  Boston Scientific Corporation Price and Consensus | Boston Scientific Corporation QuoteHowever, given the companyâs bullish second-quarter 2017 results and several recent developments, we find quite a few positive factors to rely on. The company is leaving no stone unturned to strengthen its core businesses and invest more in global markets.Among the recent upsides, worth mentioning is the companyâs acquisition of Symetis, in a bid to fortify its European structural heart business. We are also encouraged with the company securing multiple product approvals both in domestic and overseas markets. Notably, the company received an FDA approval for the RESONATE family of ICD and CRT-D systems.Additionally, the market holds optimism on the stock, following the companyâs recent release of an outline on sustained growth strategy, focusing on planned expansion in new markets and consolidating product lines across all business segments.

Notably, revenues in the segment jumped 19.4% in the first quarter, with overall organic growth of 9%. Growth was majorly fueled by strength in a number of existing product lines and recent acquisitions. Furthermore, increased testing for toxins buoyed sales at the segment.We also note that sales at the segment were driven by the 17% surge in sales of allergen tests for food such as gluten and peanuts, courtesy of the global food allergen regulatoryâs efforts.Animal Safety Segment:Â The animal safety segment recorded revenues of $48.5 million, reflecting an increase of 9.1% from the year-ago quarter. Growth at the segment was mainly driven by increased sales of the company's insect control product line along with rising sales of veterinary instruments, particularly in the needle and syringe product lines.On the flipside, Neogen witnessed a decline in sales of cleaners and disinfectants, thanks to the termination of a distribution agreement in the third quarter of fiscal 2017.Genomics Unit:Â The genomics business unit recorded a 29% increase on a year-over-year basis. Per management, growth in this business unit was fueled by expansion of the company's testing facilities in Scotland, development of new genomic testing products and the acquisition of Brazil-based Deoxi in early 2016.Neogen Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseÂ  Neogen Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Neogen Corporation QuoteMargin DetailsAdjusted gross margin contracted 20 basis points (bps) to 48.2% in the quarter, largely due to mixed impacts from the acquisitions of Quat-Chem and Rogama.Operating income was $16.4 million or 17.2% of sales in the first quarter, compared with $14.7 million or 17.6% a year ago.Our takeWe believe that Neogen is steadily progressing on the back of its four-pronged strategy.

679,IDXX,"Companies with favorable efficiency levels are poised to be on investorsâ radar irrespective of market conditions. This is because a company with a favorable efficiency level is expected to provide impressive returns as it is believed to be positively correlated with the companyâs price performance. Efficiency or the company's ability to transform its inputs into outputs is an important measure to determine its financial condition.Key Ratios to Identify EfficiencySometimes it becomes difficult to measure the efficiency level of a company. This is the reason why one must consider popular efficiency ratios while selecting stocks. These efficiency ratios are:Inventory Turnover: The ratio of 12-month cost of goods sold (COGS) to a 4-quarter average inventory is considered to be one of the most popular efficiency ratios. It indicates a companyâs ability to maintain a suitable inventory position. While a high value indicates that the company has a relatively low level of inventory compared to COGS, a low value indicates that the company is facing declining weak sales, which resulted in excess inventory.Â Receivables Turnover: Â This is the ratio of 12-month sales to four-quarter average receivables. It shows a companyâs potential to extend its credit and collect debt in terms of that credit. A high receivables turnover ratio or the âaccounts receivable turnover ratioâ or âdebtorâs turnover ratioâ is desirable as it signals that the company is capable of collecting its accounts receivables or that it has quality customers.Asset Utilization: This ratio indicates a companyâs capability to convert its assets into output and is thus a widely known measure of efficiency level. It is calculated by dividing total sales over the past 12 months by the last 4-quarter average of total assets. Like the above two ratios, high asset utilization may also indicate that a company is efficient.Operating Margin: This efficiency measure is the ratio of operating income over the past 12 months to sales over the same period. It measures a companyâs ability to control its operating expenses. Hence, a high value of the ratio may indicate that the company manages its operating expenses more efficiently than its peers.Screening ParametersIn addition to the above-mentioned ratios, we have added a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) to the screen with an objective to make this strategy more profitable.Inventory Turnover, Receivables Turnover, Asset Utilization and Operating Margin greater than industry average (Values of these ratios higher than industry averages may indicate that the efficiency level of the company is higher than its peers.)Â Â Â Â The use of these few criteria narrowed down the universe of over 7,906 stocks to only 16.Here are four stocks from the 16 that made it through the screen:Lululemon Athletica inc. (LULU  -  Free Report) is a designer, distributor and retailer of athletic apparel. The company operates through two segments: Company-operated stores and Direct to consumer.

680,IDXX,"On Aug 24, we issued an updated research report on Austin, TX-basedÂ Luminex CorpÂ (LMNX  -  Free Report) â a manufacturer and marketer of proprietary biological testing technologies with applications throughout the life sciences and diagnostics industry. The company currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Luminexâs second quarter saw strong top-line performance, solid cash flow and soaring profits. The companyâs Assay business is likely to be its key growth driver over the long term. Luminex reported earnings of 26 cents per share in the second quarter of 2017. Revenues in the quarter increased almost 19.2% year over year.Although the company reiterated its 2017 annual revenue guidance, it has projected third-quarter 2017 revenues in the range of $73 million and $75 million, down from the previously issued band of $74 million to $76 million. Luminex expects revenues at the segment to be impacted by funding challenges related to a multi-year bulk bead contract from a life science customer.The company also witnessed favorable tidings at the regulatory front in the second quarter. In this regard, the recent CE-IVD mark for the ARIES Norovirus Assay, the FDA approval of ARIES C. difficile Assay and the reimbursement approval of VERIGENE assay in Japan are noteworthy. Luminex is on the verge of completing its clinical study for Group A Strep and is close to submitting the same for FDA review.The company has a broad product portfolio that comprises the advanced xMAP, xTAG and MultiCode technology. Moreover, Luminex has collaborative agreements with several companies, which should help expand the use of its products/technology. In this regard, we note that Luminex had earlier announced the signing of a new supply and distribution agreement with Bio-Techne Corp. (TECH), through 2020.Â Luminex also entered a similar deal with Affymetrix (AFFX). Under the terms of the agreement, eBioscience, a business division of Affymetrix, will commercialize MAGPIX, Luminex 200 and FLEXMAP 3D multiplexed assay platforms in select countries of the Americas, Asia and Europe.On the flipside, reimbursement landscape and cutthroat competition continue to be major challenges. Also, the share price movement of Luminex has been unfavorable over the last one year. Notably, the stock lost 10.9%, as against the broader industryâs gain of roughly 3.8%. Further, Luminexâs stock looks a little overvalued at the moment. A comparative analysis of the companyâs P/E (TTM basis) multiple reflects a relatively gloomy picture that might be a cause of investor concern.Zacks Rank & Key PicksLuminex sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

681,IDXX,"On Aug 25, we issued an updated research report on Cincinnati, OH-based Chemed Corporation (CHE  -  Free Report). The company currently operates two wholly-owned subsidiaries â VITAS Healthcare and Roto-Rooter.Over the last six months, Chemed has been trading above the broader industry in terms of price. The stock has gained 5.6%, higher than the industryâs loss of 8.6%. This improvement in average net Medicare reimbursement rate and increase in average daily census during the recently reported second quarter were encouraging. The raised outlook for both Roto-Rooter segment and earnings per share is indicative of the company anticipating improved operating results in the upcoming quarters. This boosts investorsâ optimism on the stock.Notably, Chemedâs VITAS business had been in trouble over the past few quarters due to certain admission coding changes initiated by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS). However, management noted the recent admission trends to be positive and that should continue in the coming quarters as well.Chemed Corp. Price and Consensus Chemed Corp. Price and Consensus | Chemed Corp. QuoteDuring second-quarter 2017, VITAS performed well, both financially and operationally, surpassing the companyâs expectations. The business experienced 2.1% net revenue growth when compared to the prior-year quarter. VITAS also generated admissions growth of 0.81% in the quarter.In terms of Roto- Rooter business, it displayed a robust performance in core plumbing and drain cleaning service segments during second-quarter 2017, as well as prompted a solid rise in water restoration. Management increased expectations to achieve Roto-Rooter full-year 2017 revenue growth of 12-13%, higher than the earlier expected range of 3-4%. Revenue estimates are based on increased job pricing of approximately 2% and continued growth in water restoration services.However, headwinds like reimbursement related issues, seasonality in business, a competitive landscape and dependence on government mandate pose challenges for Chemed.Â  Also, a tweaked guidance for Medicare Cap billing limitations is a matter of concern.Zacks Rank & Key PicksChemed currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

683,IDXX,"With solid prospects, Lantheus Holdings, Inc.Â (LNTH  -  Free Report) is an attractive pick at present. The stock has rallied 26.1% over the last three months, ahead of the S&P 500âs 2.2% gain and also better than the broaderÂ industry's 4.9%.The stock has a market cap of $631.23 millionThis diagnostic medical imaging agents and product providerâs estimate revision trend for the current year has also been positive. In the past 30 days, three analysts moved north while there was no movement in the opposite direction. The magnitude of estimate revision increased to $1.10 per share from 95 cents over the same time frame. The company reported a stellar four-quarter positive average earnings surprise of 62.1%, with an earnings surprise of 75% in the last reported second quarter of 2017.Letâs find out whether the recent positive trend is a sustainable one.Headquartered in North Billerica, MA, Lantheus Holdings posted solid second-quarter 2017 results with year-over-year increase in earnings and revenues. Earnings per share increased around 75% year over year while revenues improved around 14% globally on the back of approximately 20% growth in DEFINITYÂ and around 6% growth in TechneLite sales, globally. Also, the raised revenue guidance for the full year indicates possibilities of continuation of this bullish trend.For full-year 2017, the worldwide revenue guidance has been raised to $318-$322 million from $313-$318 million. Worldwide revenues for the third quarter of 2017 are projected between $75 million and $78 million.The gross margin excluding the impact of the GE Healthcare payment was approximately 49%, reflecting an increase of 310 basis points over last year.

684,IDXX,"Henry Schein, Inc. (HSIC  -  Free Report) has recently teamed up with Integrated Medical Foundation (IMF) and LUGPA, an association of independent urology group practices, to raise awareness on prostate cancer. More specifically, Henry Scheinâs global corporate social responsibility program â Henry Schein Cares â will work on this matter.Per Henry Schein, it will support IMF and LUGPA with a series of communication efforts to increase awareness among practitioners and public about the importance of early detection of prostate cancer. According to them, it has been widely accepted how early detection of prostate cancer can greatly enhance a patientâs chances of recovering from the disease.We believe, the companyâs move is well-timed taking into consideration the frequency rate at which prostate cancer is growing. The National Cancer Institute estimates that approximately one in nine men will be diagnosed with the disease in their lifetime. Per the American Cancer Society, more than 160,000 men are expected to be diagnosed with prostate cancer and more than 26,000 men may succumb to the disease in 2017.Though Henry Schein is yet to make a foray into the world of cancer research, it has already come up with several awareness drives of late. Only last month, the company announced to offer its dental, animal health and medical customers an opportunity to join in the fight against cancer.The proposal will be open from from September through December. By purchasing a range of pink products, customers can support the companyâs Practice Pink program, an initiative designed to increase awareness and back the cure for breast cancer as well as other cancer therapies.Over the past three months, Henry Schein has underperformed the broader industry. The stock has lost 5.7% compared with the the broader industryâs 1.7% decline.Zacks Rank & Key PicksHenry Schein carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

685,IDXX,"After Trumpâs failed efforts to repeal and replace Obamacare, Trump introduced the âskinnyâ repeal that calls for doing away with parts of Affordable Care Act (ACA) or Obamacare like âindividual mandate,â âemployer mandateâ and âCadillac taxesâ.Last month, the Republicans lost the debate over skinny repeal. The United States witnessed a political dilemma after three Republicans voted in favor of the existing Healthcare Act. They probably decided to support the existing Healthcare Act based on data provided by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT). As per the report, with the abolition of Obamacare, another 17 million people will be uninsured in 2018, 27 million more in 2020 and the count is expected to increase to 32 million in 2026.The cancellation or withdrawal of the individual and employer mandate might have made health insurance and contracted health insurance coverage expensive. This will significantly dent demand for healthcare services, impacting the medical device industry as a whole.However, the MedTech industry is looking forward to the abolishment of the major healthcare taxes, including Cadillac tax and the 2.3% MedTech tax. Although the Republicans failed to pass the skinny repeal, it has been able to delay the Cadillac tax until 2026.Thanks to the postponement of the Cadillac tax, the medical device industry is hopeful that the 2.3% medical device tax would be eradicated soon.In such a mixed scenario, we feel investors should place their bets on large cap stocks that delivered positive average earnings surprises in the last reported four quarters and are witnessing upward revisions in earnings estimates.Stocks to PickWe have selected four medical device stocks with the help of the Zacks Stock Screener (hyperlink) to shortlist Medical Device stocks which are poised for impressive returns over the next five years.

686,IDXX,"Healthcare diagnostics company Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings (LH  -  Free Report) or LabCorp successfully continues to expand through acquisition strategy. Apart from huge buyouts like Covance, the company continues to add complementary capabilities through targeted tuck-in mergers.Latest on the list is the companyâs agreement to purchase the analytical testing services business of ChromaDex Corp. (CDXC). The transaction is expected to complete in early September. This newly acquired entity will become part of LabCorpâs Covance Food Solutions business.Notably, ChromaDex is a natural product company working on health, wellness and nutritional ingredients, creating science-based solutions for dietary supplement, food and beverage, skin care, sports nutrition and pharmaceutical products.Although both the companies havenât disclosed the dealâs financial terms through press release, per a report by American City Business Journals, the deal value has been fixed at $8.5 million. Per this report, âCovance will buy the analytical testing business for $7.5 million. Under the agreement, ChromaDex is also able to receive an earnout payment of up to $1 million, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.âIt is important to make a note of LabCorpâs $5.6 billion mega buyout of Covance by virtue of which, the company is full on force to expand a range of diagnostic offerings and create a new industry leader in both laboratory testing and CRO (contract research organization) spaces, slated to act as a leading provider of medical testing besides operating as a premier full-service drug development organization.Per the company, Covance Drug Development is the only CRO, providing full spectrum of drug development capabilities â from research to real-world evidence studies â creating commercial and scientific advantage for LabCorpâs partners.Apart from Covance, another recent significant buyout is Sequenom, a prominent player in the field of non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) for reproductive health. Sequenomâs NIPT and genetic testing capabilities has further added an impetus to LabCorpâs extensive womenâs health test menu. This inclusion has also expanded the companyâs geographic reach both domestically and internationally (particularly in the EU and Asia-Pacific region).In May, the company acquired Pathology Associates Medical Laboratories (PAML) from former owners Providence Health & Services (Providence) and Catholic Health Initiatives (CHI). PAML is one of the nationâs premier medical reference laboratories and a healthcare solutions company. All these acquisitions are consistent with the companyâs efforts to strengthen foothold in the personalized diagnostics testing market.Last three months, LabCorp has been trading above the broader industry. Over this period, the stock has gained 9.2% as against the industryâs 1.1% loss.Zacks Rank & Key PicksLabCorp currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

687,IDXX,"Kalamazoo, MI-based Stryker Corporation (SYK  -  Free Report), one of the largest medical device companies in the global orthopedic market, recently announced the voluntary product recall of the Oral Care lineup, which was offered by the companyâs Sage-Products unit.Added to the voluntary recall, Stryker has placed a temporary hold on certain cloth-based products. The decision followed complaints of minor irritation and allergic reactions from consumers. However, management expects to reinitiate product shipment by September and expects to begin full supply capacity by the end of the year.The share price of Stryker slipped 1.9% to close at $138.36 following the news release.What Led to the Recall?The recall pertains to a cross-contamination issue in the Oral-care solutions which were manufactured for Sage by a third-party supplier. Notably, these solutions were distributed in markets between July 2015 and August 2017.However, Stryker affirmed that it has closed its business with the third-party supplier. In fact, Sage has resumed production of the oral care solutions.Coming to the temporary hold decision of the cloth-based products, the FDA expressed concerns regarding the ongoing microbiological testing methods for all products under the Sage platform. Now the FDA has instructed Stryker products to be verified using a new âcompendial microbiological methodâ. Undoubtedly, the new method is more time consuming and complex than the one previously used at Sage.Notably, the FDA had warned Stryker about these issues in July.Product Recall Hurts GuidanceThe recall is likely to adversely impact the companyâs sales and operating income. For the full year, Stryker now expects organic sales growth at the low end of its previously issued guidance band of 6.5% to 7.0%. Added to this, the company announced that net earnings per diluted share are expected at the low end of the $6.45-$6.55 range.For the third quarter, Stryker estimates adjusted net earnings per diluted share at the low end of its previously issued $1.50-$1.55 band.Stryker has been grappling with supply issues in the spine business for long which may prove to be a major drawback in the quarters ahead. In fact, international growth of the companyâs Spine segment in the second quarter of 2017 was partially affected by these supply headwinds.Stock Performance at a GlanceStryker's share price movement over the past one year has been favorable. The company yielded a return of almost 22.1%, better than the broader industry's only 8%. Solid performances by the MedSurg and Neurotech segments in the last reported quarter hold promise. Strength in the international segments on strong momentum in Europe and China also buoys optimism.Zacks Rank & Key PicksStryker has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are Edwards Lifesciences Corp. (EW  -  Free Report), IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. (IDXX  -  Free Report) and Cogentix Medical, Inc. .

690,IDXX,"Of late, the healthcare sector has been on a bumpy ride. With the Obamacare saga dominating the headlines, the industry has been grappling with multiple issues. After failing to repeal and replace Obamacare, Trumpâs major âskinny repealâ also lost ground.As per a report by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT), the abolishment of Obamacare will result in 17 million more of uninsured people in 2018, another 27 million in 2020 and the count is expected to rise to 32 million in 2026. The Medtech sector is expected to witness a decline in customer base after the elimination of Obamacare, indicating weaker demand for expensive medical procedures and devices.However, if Obamacare stays, the dreadful 2.3% medical device tax imposed on the selling price is likely to take away a quarterâs profit of the Medtech players. This will also reduce capital-intensive research and development activities in the MedTech space.In addition, the Cadillac tax will make sustainability difficult for small players in the competitive MedTech industry.Hurricanes Worsen ScenarioTensions escalated as the devastating Hurricane Harvey and Irma impacted the economy. Data from the American Automobile Association, Inc. suggests that the national price of a gallon of gas hit $2.67 on Sep 8, up from $2.35 a month ago.Further, Bank of America estimates the loss of crops worth approximately $1.2 billion in Florida due to Irma, which will in turn lead to higher prices for groceries. Per statistics provided by a Labor Department official of the federal government, initial jobless claims had increased by 62,000, the highest since 2012. We believe rise in unemployment (though short lived) and decline in consumersâ income coupled with increasing aggregate spending are likely to deal a heavy blow to the MedTech industry.5 MedTech Growth Stocks in FocusThese stocks carry a strong Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and promise long-term expected growth of 15% or higher, comparing favorably with the broader industry.

Also, the companyâs long-term expected earnings growth rate of 20% is higher than the broader industryâs 18.3%.For the majority of the last three months, the companyâs share price has considerably outperformed the broader industry. The stock has rallied 10.9% over the last three months, beating the industryâs gain of just 3.7% over the same time frame.Factors Driving the StockGuidance Upbeat: Banking on the solid performance in the last quarter, Inogen raised its 2017 revenue and adjusted net income guidance. Moreover, the company narrowed its full-year adjusted EBITDA guidance.Inogen projects revenues in the range of $239 million to $243 million, higher than the previous range of $233 million to $239 million. This represents year-over-year growth of 17.8%-19.8%, up from the previous range of 14.9%-17.8%. Adjusted EBITDA is projected in the band of $48 million-$50 million, compared to $46 million-$50 million estimated earlier. This represents an increase of 10.6% to 15.2% as compared with the year-ago quarterâs 6%-15.2%. Inogen expects adjusted net income in the range of $25 million-$27 million, up from the previous band of $22 million-$24 million.Unique Direct-to-Customer Business Model: Notably, Inogen has a market cap of $1.99 billion. The companyâs direct-to-customer business model has lent it a leading position in the oxygen therapy market. The direct-to-consumer model gives companies an opportunity to build a unique brand relationship directly with customers. In an initiative to support growth in the direct-to-consumer line of business, the company had announced that it has secured an additional facility in the Cleveland, OH area.Solid Q2 Results: Inogen reported a stellar second quarter of 2017, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate for both the counts. Solid domestic and international business-to-business sales drove revenues. In fact, the company expects direct-to-consumer sales to be its fastest growing channel, followed by domestic business-to-business sales in the coming quarters, with solid focus on Europe.Bright Prospects in LTOT Space: Inogen develops, manufactures and markets portable oxygen concentrators (POC). The company recently announced the receipt of EC Certificate for the Inogen One G4 platform, which will be available for sale in select international countries. We believe an expanding Long-Term Oxygen Therapy (LTOT) market, advantages of POCs over traditional delivery model, direct-to-customer business model, underpenetrated international markets and expanding product portfolio are key growth catalysts.Favorable Estimate Revision Trend: Inogenâs estimate revision trend has been promising for the full year. In the last two months, three estimates moved north compared to no movement in the opposite direction. Full-year estimates rose almost 9% to $1.20 per share over the same time frame.For the current quarter, two estimates moved up, compared to one downward revision in the last two months. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter increased 3.7% to 28 cents per share over the same time frame.Inogen, Inc Price and ConsensusÂ  Inogen, Inc Price and Consensus | Inogen, Inc QuoteKey PicksA few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are Edwards Lifesciences Corp.

(ISRG  -  Free Report) â manufacturer of the da Vinci surgical system (an advanced robot-assisted surgical system) and related instruments and accessories. The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Among major positives, Intuitive Surgical has had an impressive run in the bourse of late. A glimpse at the recent price performance reveals a favorable return of 43.9% over the past year, comparing favorably with the industryâs increase of 4.1%. The company has a solid track characterized by consecutive earnings beat in the trailing four quarters.In recent times, Intuitive Surgical reported stellar performance mainly due to the growing adoption of the da Vinci system among physicians and overall growth in global procedures. The da Vinci surgical system enables minimally invasive surgery that helps avoid the trauma associated with open surgery. Performance was also aided by growing volumes, courtesy to general surgery, oncology, urology and gynecology procedures.Intuitive Surgical continuously introduces technologies for surgical systems. The company also plans to launch an upgrade â da Vinci X â to its flagship Vinci Xi technology. In this regard, management confirmed the submission of documents for CE Mark approval of Vinci X.

700,IDXX,"As a major breakthrough in its diabetics business, Abbott (ABT  -  Free Report) recently announced the receipt of national reimbursement for the FreeStyleÂ Libre glucose monitoring system in Japan.The development has widened this Illinois-based medical device majorâs customer base in diabetes management. Per management, with around 9.5 million population diagnosed with diabetes, Japan is considered a nation with the highest rate of people suffering with the condition.The company states thatÂ  the grant of reimbursement will also make FreeStyleÂ Libre system widely available to more than one million Japanese people diagnosed with both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes and on insulin therapy varying from ages six and above.Also, the reimbursement approval in Japan marks another milestone where Abbottâs FreeStyle Libre system stands partially or fully covered in 16 countries, including FranceÂ andÂ Germany. Notably, FreeStyle Libre system is presently under review by the FDA and awaits approval in the United States.Abbott has been moving steadily toward development in its diabetics segment. In July, the company partnered with Bigfoot Biomedical to solidify its footprint in the rapidly growing diabetes therapeutics market.Moreover, the company recently announced receipt of Health Canada License for FreeStyle Libre Flash Glucose Monitoring System. This will further stimulate growth in the Diabetes Care sales segment, which was up 18.7% in second-quarter 2017 on continued consumer acceptance of FreeStyle Libre internationally.We expect Freestyle Libre to further contribute to Abbottâs top line as along with the Canadian development, the French Health Ministry recently approved national reimbursement for the device.Per a report by Mordor Intelligence, the global market for diabetes care devices is projected to reach a value of $30.25 billion by 2021, atÂ  a CAGR of 5.93%.Considering the market potential and Abbottâs current developments in the diabetes care segment, the recent national reimbursement grant in Japan will accelerate the top line.We believe an ageing population, unhealthy lifestyle and rising awareness and expenditure in healthcare will continue to drive growth in the diabetes market. However, this market is dominated by many well established players, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) being the most prominent one.Â  In this space, Johnson & Johnson also has a tie-up with U.S.-based Animas Corporation to successfully develop and innovate insulin delivery systems.Moreover, Abbott has been gaining investor confidence on consistently positive results. Over the last three months, the companyâs share price has outperformed the broader industry. The stock has gained 7.9%, in contrast to the broader industryâs decline of 1.2%. The company has also outperformed the 0.8% fall of the S&P 500 market over the same time frame.Zacks Rank & Key PicksAbbott carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

701,IDXX,"The Cooper Companies Inc. (COO  -  Free Report) reported adjusted earnings of $2.64 in third-quarter fiscal 2017, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 6 cents and improving from $2.30 in the year-ago quarter. We believe that the upside was driven by robust revenue growth. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Revenues increased to $556 million from $515 million recorded in the prior-year quarter. The figure also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $552 million. Solid top-line performance was driven by innovative products like Biofinity and daily silicone hydrogel lenses.Revenue SegmentsThe Cooper Companies has two business segments â CooperVision (CVI) and CooperSurgical (CSI).CooperVision Segment: CVI revenues increased 8% at constant currency (cc) to $437.3 million on a year-over-year basis. Revenues continue to gain from the companyâs silicone hydrogel lenses led by solid prospects in the MyDay, Clariti and Biofinity platforms. Coming to the major catalysts within the CVI segment, robust performance by Toric (31.6% of CVI revenues), Multifocal (10.7% of CVI revenues), Single-use sphere lenses (26.5% of CVI revenues) and Non single-use sphere lenses (31.2%) propelled solid growth.Multifocal revenues rose 7% at cc to $46.8 million, while Toric revenues increased 11% at cc to $138.3 million on a year-over-year basis. Single-use sphere lenses sales climbed 14% at cc to $115.8 million, while sales of non single-use sphere lenses inched up 2% at cc to $136.4 million year over year.Geographically, CVI revenues increased 2% in the Americas, while revenues from the Asia Pacific and EMEA rose 13% year over year at cc.CooperSurgical Segment: CSI revenues jumped 4% at cc to $118.7 million on a year-over-year basis.Coming to the CSI segment, the fertility category witnessed a 6% rise (at cc) in sales in the reported quarter on a year-over-year basis, totaling $65.5 million. However, the office and surgical products category at the CSI segment inched up 1% at cc to $53.2 million.Cooper Companies, Inc. (The) Price and ConsensusÂ  Cooper Companies, Inc. (The) Price and Consensus | Cooper Companies, Inc. (The) QuoteMargin DetailsAdjusted gross margin in the reported quarter was 65% of revenues as compared with 64% registered in the year-ago quarter. The gross margin improvement was fueled by favorable product mix within the CooperVision segment, improved margins at CooperSurgical segment, and favorable foreign exchange.Adjusted operating margin, as a percentage of revenues, was 26% in the fiscal third quarter flat on a year-over-year basis.GuidanceFiscal 2017: For fiscal 2017, total revenue is expected in the band of $2,129â$2,142 million, up from the previously issued range of 2,110â$2,135 million.Revenues at the CVI segment are estimated between $1,670 and $1,680 million, up from the previously guided range of $1,645 million and $1,665 million, while CSI revenues are projected in the range of $459 - $462 million, a little lower from the previously guided range of $465â$470 million.Meanwhile, adjusted earnings are anticipated in the band of $9.66â$9.76, up from the previously provided range of $9.50â$9.65 per share.Fourth Quarter: The Cooper Companies expects revenues in the range of $552 million to $565 million. CVI revenues are expected between $435 million and $445 million, while CSI revenues are anticipated between $117 million and $120 million. The company expects adjusted earnings per share between $2.60 and $2.70.Our TakeThe Cooper Companies ended third-quarter fiscal 2017 on a solid note, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate on both lines. The company has always seen impressive results at its CooperVision business segment. The CooperSurgical segment also delivered strong sales in the third quarter, buoyed by robust Toric performance. The company provided strong guidance for fiscal 2017. However, the dampening outlook for the CooperSurgical segment indicates looming concerns. Furthermore, intensifying competition in the contact lens space will continue to increase pricing pressure for the company.We also note that The Cooper Companies has completed the acquisition of a small specialty contact lens company named Procornea earlier this month. This added a leading ortho-k technology to the companyâs lens portfolio. The acquisition marked the companyâs foray in the emerging myopia controlled markets.Considering the outstanding performance of the stock, we expect The Cooper Companies to scale higher in the coming quarters. In this regard, positive long-term growth of 10.8% holds promise.Key PicksA few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are Edwards Lifesciences Corp.

704,IDXX,"Abbott (ABT  -  Free Report) recently has initiated a U.S. pivotal clinical study to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of a modified version of its AMPLATZER device. This device is designed to correct a common congenital heart defect inÂ pre-term infants.Â The device is same as the larger sized AMPLATZER Duct Occluder II product. The clinical study will be conducted on 50 patients at up to 10 centers across the United States.According to Abbott, Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) is a life-threatening vascular pathway or duct in the heart that remains open due to the failure of the fetal duct to close after birth. In some cases, the PDA fails to close spontaneously in premature babies leading to difficulty in breathing and feeding.Pharmaceuticals can be used at times to close the duct but are less effective in pre-term infants. Current treatment options for pre-term infants who are not responsive to pharmaceuticals are limited to surgery. However, surgery is not always possible and leaving the duct open can lead to fatal outcomes for infants. Breaking the conventional treatment, Abbott is developing the AMPLATZER Duct Occluder II Additional Sizes (ADO II AS) device to provide physicians with a nonsurgical treatment option for addressing the PDA defect in newborns and pre-term infants.Â ADO II AS is already approved for use in Europe.If the study is successful, the U.S. trial results will support Abbott's application for FDA approval for pediatric use in the country.We note that Abbott has been consistently trying to expand its vascular business under the Medical Device segment that is on solid growth trajectory of late. In the last reported second quarter, the Medical Devices business sales spiked 89.2% on a reported basis.Also, the recent developments include the receipt of FDA approval for Full MagLev HeartMate 3Left Ventricular Assist SystemÂ (also known as an LVAD). The HeartMate 3 system enables physicians managing advanced heart failure patients in need of short-term hemodynamic support.Abbott also announced CE Mark and first use of the newÂ Confirm Rx Insertable Cardiac Monitor (ICM). This is the world's first smartphone-compatible ICM which helps physicians identify difficult-to-detect cardiac arrhythmias, including atrial fibrillation (AF).According to a report by Markets and Markets, the global pediatric interventional cardiology market is estimated to see a CAGR of 9% from 2013 to 2018. Looking at the bountiful opportunities in this niche space, we believe the companyâs latest development by is a strategical fit.Over the last three months, Abbott has been trading above the broader industry.

705,IDXX,"On Aug 21, we issued an updated research report on Denver, CO-based BioScrip, Inc. (BIOS  -  Free Report). The company is a leading Infusion Service provider and strives to deliver cost-effective programs to patients. The stock currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Over the past month, BioScrip has been trading above the broader industry. The stock has gained 3.7% in this period, as against the industryâs 9% loss. The market is upbeat about the companyâs announcement to continue to offer certain core product lines to UnitedHealthcare. This deal should be significantly accretive to BioScripâs top line.The companyâs progress for new multi-faceted CORE plan to improve financial position is also encouraging. The plan involves identifying and executing strategies to accelerate core revenue growth, favorable product mix, drive operational efficiency, improve revenue collection and increase employee effectiveness.Further, BioScrip had successfully completed the Home Solutionsâ integration earlier this year. The company expects core revenues as well as continued growth from this acquired asset to prove accretive, going forward.Notably, BioScrip has been recording persistent growth in its core Infusion Services business with strong presence as well as a competitive advantage. The company witnessed a consistent rise in this business, primarily on account of strong organic growth in chronic, nutrition and other therapies. It has been building a robust core Infusion platform through organic development and acquisitions.Management expects BioScripâs focus on the fast-growing core Infusion business to drive an increased profitability. The company is currently on track to achieve the previously announced $17 million in Home Solutions synergies and other incremental annualized cost-reductions of $23-$25 million by 2017-end.On the flip side, BioScripâs 2017 guidance is lackluster with the inclusion of an estimated negative impact of the Cures Act legislation. A large portion of the companyâs revenues used to come directly from Medicare, state Medicaid programs or other government payers. However, the new Cures Act bill does not reimburse any service payments for administration of certain drugs to patients via home infusion pharmacies.The healthcare industry is also highly competitive. BioScripâs competitors include large and well-established companies with higher financial, marketing and technological resources.Key PicksA few better-ranked medical stocks are IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.

Radixact represented majority of Accurayâs TomoTherapy order mix in the reported quarter, up 25% on a sequential basis from the third quarter.APAC and Japan witnessed stellar performances at the Radixact and TomoTherapy platforms. Radixact orders in Japan have been extremely positive to date.The Precision System: Accuray also announced its new precision treatment planning system recently. The system leverages on the companyâs flagship Radixact and CyberKnife system platforms. The company also plans to build on this technology with Precision 2.0 upgrade by fiscal 2018. This will provide significant improvements in treatment speed and overall throughput of the already existing CyberKnife system.IBMS Data Management System for TomoTherapy: Accuray also announced 510(k) clearance for the new IBMS data management system for TomoTherapy. It is a centralized database that shares and makes data accessible between multiple accurate systems adding flexibility and improving workflow efficiency in the radiation therapy department.Margin DetailsGross margin (as a percentage of net revenues) contracted 80 basis points (bps) in the fourth quarter to 36.4%. This was primarily due to reduced product gross margins. Product gross margins decreased due to unfavorable product and channel mix.Operating expenses in the fourth quarter were $40.4 million, almost flat with $40.3 million in the year-ago period.GuidanceAccuray issued guidance for fiscal 2018.The company projects full-year revenues in the band of $390 million to $400 million. This represents growth in the band of approximately 2% and 4% on a year-over-year basis. Furthermore, product revenues are expected to increase in the band of 5% to 10% year over year and service revenues are likely to remain flat with fiscal 2017.The company expects a 5% increase in gross orders in fiscal 2018. The product system backlog is expected in the band of $445 million to $460 million.Adjusted EBITDA for fiscal 2017 is anticipated in the range of $25 million to $30 million, up 23% to 47% year over year.Our TakeAccuray reported wider-than-expected loss in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, primarily due to lackluster performance in the service revenue segment. The company issued solid fiscal 2018 guidance. Of the recent developments, orders for the newly unveiled Radixact System, solid revenue performance in APAC and Japanese regulatory approval for Radixact are key positives in our view. However, unfavorable product mix, declining service revenues, sluggish macro economic conditions and pricing headwinds are major concerns. Notably, China and Europe saw sluggish revenues in the fourth quarter. Accurayâs significant international presence helps broaden its customer base. However, fluctuations in currency exchange rates, particularly with a strong dollar, will continue to adversely impact the companyâs backlog and top line in the coming quarters.Key PicksA few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are Edwards Lifesciences Corp.

708,IDXX,"Medtronic plc (MDT  -  Free Report), a leading global player in medical technology, services and solutions, has made another encouraging move with respect to its Cardiac Rhythm & Heart Failure (CRHF) business. The companyrecently announced the CE Mark approval for Attain Stability Quad MRI SureScan Active-Fixation heart lead.This is in line with the companyâs strategy to focus on research and development of high-end medical device products within its core business lines. Notably, the company is engaged in clinics trials for evaluating Attain Stability Quad MRI SureScan Active-Fixation heart lead in the United States, Canada and other regions.Medtronicâs latest offering features active-fixation technology that assists in precise lead placement and stability when paired with the companyâs quadripolar cardiac resynchronization therapy-defibrillators (CRT-D) and -pacemakers (CRT-P). The company also initiated a multicenter clinical study with a target to enroll roughly 471 patients across 56 sites in the United States, Canada, Europe, Hong Kong and Malaysia. This global study is aimed at evaluating the safety and efficacy of the lead in heart failure patients.Interestingly, Medtronicâs Cardiac & Vascular group (CVG) segment accounted for 35.9% to total revenues in first-quarter fiscal 2018. Moreover, the companyâs CRHF sub-segment was the highest contributor, making up for 52.3% of the total CVG revenues. This was largely backed by strong growth in Arrhythmia Management as well as the HeartWare International acquisition. Thus, the companyâs latest development will help boost performance in this segment.Medtronicâs strategy to gain traction in the CRHFsub-segment seems to be aligned with data provided by Allied Market Research. Â Per the report, the global Cardiac Monitoring and Cardiac Rhythm Management marketÂ is expected to see a CAGR of 7.6% from 2016 to 2022 to reach a value of $32,216 million.We believe the high incidence of cardiac diseases due to unhealthy lifestyle, penetration by the concerned companies in the untapped markets, technological advancements and increasing awareness among people will continue to drive the global acceptance of this technology. In the view of these encouraging factors, we believe that the companyâs European development for Attain Stability Quad MRI SureScan Active-Fixation heart lead is strategic and will broaden its customer base.However, over the last month, Medtronic has been underperforming the broader industry. The stock has declined 3.9% as compared to the industryâs 2.9% fall. It also underperformed the 0.9% decline of the S&P 500 over the same time frame. Nevertheless, we believe the latest CE Mark approval will boost investor confidence in the stock.Zacks Rank & Key PicksMedtronic currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A few better-ranked medical stocks are Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (EW  -  Free Report), Lantheus Holdings, Inc. (LNTH  -  Free Report) and IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. (IDXX  -  Free Report).

709,IDXX,"NxStage Medical, Inc. (NXTM  -  Free Report) recently announced the regulatory approval of its System One platform by the FDA for solo home hemodialysis treatment. The company has also announced that it will provide patient training for this new indication later this year and in 2018.System One has been a flagship platform of NxStage contributing significantly to the companyâs top line. The latest development in the System One platform is exclusively formulated for both new and existing System One patients to reduce transportation costs, re-hospitalization rates and provide dialysis care on site. In fact, solo home hemodialysis eradicates the need of a care partner during the treatment procedure. Notably, the company got the first and only home nocturnal hemodialysis clearance way back in 2014.Per management, globally, a number of patients failed to opt for home hemodialysis to date due to the absence of a care partner to help them during the process. The latest regulatory go-ahead is likely to lend NxStage a competitive edge and expand its patient base with solid access to the clinical benefits associated with home hemodialysis.NxStage Partners Dialyze Direct for On-Site DialysisThe latest regulatory progress closely follows another solid development in NxStageâs Dialysis platform. Earlier this month, the company announced that its subsidiary NxStage Kidney Care is partnering Dialyze Direct for supporting the needs of patients who need on-site skilled-nursing facilities (SNF) for dialysis treatment in Ohio. NxStage will now leverage on its System One platform and Dialyze Directâs unique model for treating geriatric SNF patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD).NxStage to Be AcquiredEarlier this month, German dialysis provider Fresenius Medical Care (FMS) signed an agreement to acquire all outstanding shares of NxStage for $30 a share. The transaction has been valued at $2 billion and is subject to close by 2018, on approval of NxStage stockholders and other customary conditions. We note that NxStage has been gaining prominence in the market of late with products like NxStage PureFlow SL Dialysis Preparation System, Nx2me Connected Health and NxStage System One.Market Trends Buoy OptimismData from Markets And Markets reveal that the global hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis market is expected to reach a worth of $83.89 billion by 2021, at a CAGR of 6.0%. NxStageâs continuous effort to bolster its Dialysis unit is likely to be benefitted by the bountiful prospects in the niche space. Furthermore, an increased rate of ESRD cases enhances probabilities of NxStage outperformance in the niche space in the near term.Share Price Moves UpOver the past one year, NxStage has added 22.4%, comparing favorably with the S&P 500âs 11.9% over the same time frame.

710,IDXX,"On Aug 28, we issued an updated research report on Pleasanton, CA-based Veeva Systems Inc. (VEEV  -  Free Report), a global provider of cloud software and data solutions for life sciences industry. The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Veeva had an impressive run on the bourse year to date, trading above the industry in terms of price performance. A glimpse at the price movement reveals that Veevaâs shares have gained 40.4%, comparing favorably with the industryâs 16.4% decline. The company has a solid track characterized by consecutive earnings beat for the four trailing quarters.The company has strengthened the recurring part of its revenue mix with significant growth in subscription revenues in recent times. Moreover, launches of the Veeva Vault and the Veeva Commercial Cloud platforms are encouraging. The company is also supported by considerable strength in its CRM platform.Veevaâs industry-specific focus gives it a significant leverage, in our view. This is aptly demonstrated by its strong sales growth aided by new business gains, better pricing and product innovation. The companyâs knowledge on different components of the life sciences industry is helping it to build targeted products. Notably, product like Veeva OpenData provides customer data to all healthcare professionals (HCP), healthcare organizations (HCO) and affiliations across life sciencesâ major markets.Looking ahead, Veeva is optimistic about its product pipeline that includes an exclusive range of products on its flagship Vault and Commercial cloud platforms. These products include Vault CTMS, Vault PromoMats Dam, CRM Engage Meeting and CRM Engage Webinar.A glimpse at the last reported fiscal second-quarter results reveals strong revenues and adjusted earnings. The top and the bottom line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Additionally, solid year-over-year subscription revenue growth has enhanced the recurring part of the companyâs revenue mix.However, on the flip side, unfavorable foreign currency is expected to hurt earnings in the near term. Also escalating costs and expenses are weighing on its margins. Last month, a comparative study of Veevaâs forward P/E (forward 12-month basis) multiple reflected that the stock has been quite overvalued.Key PicksA few better-ranked medical stocks are IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.

712,IDXX,"We are at the second half of the second-quarter earnings season and per our Earnings Preview, till Jul 28, around 286 S&P 500 members (68.8% of the Indexâs total market cap) have reported their quarterly numbers.Putting together these results, we can see that the pace of earnings and revenue growth is steadily accelerating from relative-to-pre-season expectations. The latest scorecard says that the total earnings for these members increased 11.3% year over year on 6.1% higher revenues. While the earnings beat ratio remains at 74.5%, revenue beat ratio stands at 69.2%. With 214 members yet to release their numbers, the total-second quarter earnings for the index are currently expected to be up 9.2% on 5% higher revenues from the year-ago period.Whatâs in Store for the Medical Space?Medical, one of the 16 broader Zacks sectors, is absolutely no exception to this trend improvement. So far, 58.2% of the members from this sector has released the quarterly earnings results with earnings and revenue beats standing at very impressive levels of 84.4% and 68.8%, respectively. With more and more companies lining up for their earnings announcement, the aggregate growth pace of this sector is expected to pick up further.Notably, there are some powerful long-term tailwinds of the medical device industry, including mergers & acquisitions (M&A), emerging market expansion, positive demographic trends and new product innovation. These have been a major driving force behind the sectorâs impressive performance over the past few quarters even amid severe socio-economic and political instabilities.Letâs analyse how the following two major Medical â Products companies are placed ahead of their announcement on Aug 1.IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. (IDXX  -  Free Report): We are upbeat about IDEXXâ innovation-based global strategy that is leading to CAG Diagnostics growth. In June, IDEXX announced the addition of rVetLink to its portfolio of technology applications. Notably, rVetLink is an advanced all-inclusive referral management solution designed for specialty care hospitals that simplifies the referral procedure between primary care and specialty care veterinarians. This apart, IDEXX continues to display solid growth with respect to international expansion. We believe, the outcome of these endeavors will be reflected in the companyâs second-quarter performance, whichis scheduled to release before the market opens.Our previous article showed that IDEXX was likely to beat on earnings this quarter. However, estimates changed thereafter and we are not certain of a beat this earnings season.This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here as the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 with an Earnings ESP of 0.00%, which makes surprise prediction difficult.Based on the Zacks methodology, a positive Zacks ESP serves as a leading indicator of a likely earnings surprise, while a bullish Zacks Rank increases the predictive power of the ESP. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before theyâre reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. QuoteÂ ResMed Inc. (RMD  -  Free Report): ResMedâs efforts to expand business internationally are encouraging. The companyâs revenue performance across all segments in the third quarter of fiscal 2017 was impressive. We expect the company to maintain a similar trend this quarter as well. However, in the last quarter, currency impacted ResMedâs combined EMEA and Asia-Pacific revenues by 3%. This is likely to dent results in the fiscal fourth quarter too.ResMed is scheduled to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Aug 1 after the market closes.Â The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 and has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. Hence, we are unable to conclude whether ResMed is likely to beat estimates this quarter.

713,IDXX,"Investors are always looking for stocks that are poised to beat at earnings season and IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. (IDXX  -  Free Report) may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because IDEXX Laboratoriesis seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earningsâwith the most up-to-date information possibleâis a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for IDXX in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at 85 cents per share for IDXX, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of 84 cents per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for IDXX, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +1.19% heading into earnings season.IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. QuoteWhy is this Important?A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market. Our recent 10 year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more Top Earnings ESP stocks here).Given that IDXX has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings.

714,IDXX,"The markets hate the unknown and unpredictable, and the simmering tension in the Korean peninsula is a bit of both. Investors and politicians across the world seem to be apprehensive about the global reaction to North Korea's sixth and also its biggest nuclear weapons test this Sunday.With the potential for conflict over North Koreaâs act in the forefront of everyoneâs minds, stock markets are on tenterhooks as well. In fact, according to some South Korean officials, North Korea appears to be setting up the test for another intercontinental ballistic missile.Back home, geopolitics and severe hurricanes rocked Wall Streetâs calm, as markets remained skittish in the aftermath of North Koreaâs nuclear test and a second potent hurricane â Irma â expected in the United States in as many weeks.Amid such a fickle environment that could rapidly escalate, it was no surprise that investors sought asset security as gold prices flared up and the U.S. Treasuries strengthened.However, we feel that in such a scenario, investors should look beyond gold and government securities. We have created a multi-faceted screen for you that will give investors stability and profit growth potential farther than the next quarter.Making Sense of ProfitsIt is common knowledge that Wall Street is obsessed with the bottom line. But are higher profits necessarily better? Are these really a true indicator of the staying power of a companyâs earnings?While dollar profits trump all other measures hands down for sheer shock value, these do not relate profits to the size of the company, its sales, resources or shareholder capital. The only profitability measure that reasonably works across industries is the ratio of return generated on the dollars invested in a business.The most popular among these ratios is Return on Equity (âROEâ), favored by both Wall Street analysts and investors alike. However, since the ROE measure receives the most attention from the investor community, executives focus heavily on this metric as well. Companies can exploit financial strategies (like increasing debt leverage and stock buybacks funded through built-up cash) to artificially maintain a healthy ROE for a while and conceal weakening operational profitability.So, letâs shift our focus to a different bottom-line metric which garners far less attention from executives and investors alike â Return on Invested Capital (âROIâ).The Lesser-Known ROI MetricEssentially, ROI shows how optimally management has been directing the capital under its control into profitable investments. It paints a clear picture of how efficiently a company is employing its capital and whether its competitive positioning is allowing it to produce good returns from that capital.Also, we will focus on large caps, which are big, established companies in the stock market, and have a comparatively softer risk profile. By virtue of their dominant market position, global footprint and relatively consistent cash-flow stream, these companies tend to be more reliable investments â which is called for in the current geopolitical environment. Also, ROI is particularly relevant for assessing companies that have a large amount of capital.Our ScreenNonetheless, it might be quite difficult for investors to single out such companies, as we need companies which have generated strong ROIs over a sufficiently long period of time, in order to determine a robust trend.So, we have created a three-faceted screen to shortlist such companies for you. Only those companies which have generated ROIs in excess of 15% on average over the last five years can get past our screen. Their current ROI (over the trailing 12 months) also needs to be at least 15%.In addition, to ensure that we hone in on stable companies, which have an established history of generating profits, our screen allows only those companies which have a market capitalization north of $10 billion.Needless to say, these companies must have a solid Zacks Rank too. A favorable Zacks Rank shows positive analyst interest and brighter prospects for the company.These stocks have proven their mettle consistently during challenging times and look set to outperform peers effortlessly through efficient usage of assets.

715,IDXX,"The healthcare space has been in a sticky situation with incongruous incidents hitting it back to back since the Republicans took hold of the Senate and the House. President Donald Trumpâs promise to come up with a superior healthcare plan that will fully repeal and replace Barack Obamaâs signature Affordable Care Act (ACA), is still hanging in the balance.On Jul 25, the first day of the ongoing debate session, Trump had a taste of success as the latest Republican healthcare bill (with extensive amendment to the original Obamacare) won by a very narrow margin of 51-50. However, investors were not much optimistic about this development.Promises and Likely Consequences of Latest Health BillTrumpâs latest bill primarily promises improved insurance coverage from the existing law with significantly lower American premiums. However, according to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and the staff of the Joint Committee on Taxationâs (JCT) cost estimate released on Jul 19, if the ACA or Obamacareâs full-repeal bill is finally signed, the number of uninsured people would increase by 17 million in 2018, from the present uninsured number.This will further intensify to 27 million uninsured in 2020 after the elimination of the ACAâs expansion of the eligibility for Medicaid and the elimination of subsidies for insurance purchased through marketplaces established by the ACA. The number of uninsured will then increase to 32 million in 2026.MedTech InsightWhile twists and turns unfold at the Capitol Hill, markets watchers will keep a tab on the influence that each dramatic move will have the spaces closely related. Here, we ponder over medical device stocks that stand to gain or lose on the political gridlock. Supporters of the Republican alternative argue that if the proposed amendment is implemented, more people would be covered as a portion of the cost would be borne by the government. Needless to mention, this may lead to the broadening of customer base for MedTech companies that would have otherwise suffered.Notably, the medical device industry was happy with the original Trump action plan which promised cancellation of major healthcare taxes including the two key taxes of Obamacare â theÂ  unpopular Cadillac tax (40% excise tax on high-cost healthcare plans) and the controversial 2.3% MedTech tax. If the full-repeal plan gets voted out, the fraternity worries whether the final plan will still include the MedTech tax repeal in its agenda.Q2 Earnings Sneak PeekMost of the MedTech majors are lined up to report their earnings results over the next week. But in the present eco-political hullabaloo, we lack visibility whether this corner will be able to continue its bullish run in the second-quarter earnings season. Our latest Earnings Trends also fails to paint any bright picture for the broader Medical space which is expected to register year-over-year earnings growth of a mere 1.1% on revenue growth of 4%. This compares unfavorably with the prior quarterâs reported earnings growth of 5.6% on revenue growth of 5.7%.Making the Right ChoiceGiven the numerous stocks in the medical sector that almost always muddle oneâs stock-picking ability, the Zacks methodology could offer some relief. One can narrow down the choices by focusing on medical device stocks (a specialized chunk under the medical sector) that have the desirable combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank â Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold).Earnings ESP is our proprietary methodology for identifying stocks that have high chances of surprising with their next earnings announcement. It shows the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before theyâre reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Our research shows that for stocks with this combination, the chance of a positive earnings surprise is as high as 70%.Going by this criterion, we present four medical device stocks that are poised to beat estimates this quarter.IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.

(IDXX  -  Free Report) is a developer, manufacturer and distributer of products and services primarily for the companion animal veterinary, livestock and poultry, water testing and dairy markets. IDEXX achieved strong organic growth in the U.S. and international regions in the last reported first quarter of 2017, driven by strong global gains in Companion Animal Group (CAG) Diagnostics recurring revenues, double-digit organic revenue gains across consumable, reference lab and rapid assay revenues, as well as continued expansion of the premium instrument installed base. The company expects this bullish trend to continue in the upcoming release as well.IDEXX is scheduled to report its second-quarter 2017 numbers on Aug 1.

716,IDXX,"Hologic Inc. (HOLX  -  Free Report) is slated to report third-quarter fiscal 2017 financial results on Aug 2, after the closing bell.Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 8.7%. Notably, Hologicâs earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all of the past four quarters, with an average beat of 5.79%.Letâs see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayHologic witnessed a lackluster performance at its Diagnostics segment in the last reported quarter on poor Cytology and perinatal sales. Particularly, longer cervical cancer screening guidelines intervals are playing spoilsport here. With the issue still to factor into the companyâs performance, we expect this segment to continue to perform dull in the upcoming quarter.We are also worried about the fact that Hologicâs blood screening divestiture is expected to impede the companyâs growth momentum in the days ahead. We expect this to get reflected through the companyâs financial performance in the yet-to-be-reported quarter itself.Hologic had to face several challenges owing to unfavorable foreign currency impact that has been affecting the companyâs overall performance over the past few quarters. In 2017, foreign exchange headwind is expected to result in reduction of over $20 million.Escalating operating expenses and intense competition, particularly in the tomosynthesis market, continue to be concerns for Hologic. For quite some time now, the company witnessed several challenges such as restricted capital spending environment, economic uncertainties in Europe, slower sales cycles and increasing pricing pressure. We expect these problems to linger in the upcoming quarters as well.The company should get significant synergy benefits in the third quarter from the integration of Cynosure, Inc., a medical aesthetics systems and technologies company, which Hologic acquired in Mar 2017. Â To mention, the U.S. FDA has recently granted an expanded clearance for Cynosureâs non-invasive body contouring product, Sculpture, to treat the back and inner and outer thighs.Coming to product launches, in the third quarter, the company received European CE mark for its new Panther Fusion system and Panther Fusion assays for flu and respiratory testing. Also, the company announced the U.S. FDA approval of itsGenius 3D Mammography exam. These along with several other product launches should also boost the upcoming quarterly results.Overall, for third-quarter fiscal 2017, Hologic expects revenues of $790â$805 million (as compared to the prior guidance of $675â$685 million). The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter revenues is $798.9 million, within the companyâs expectations.Adjusted EPS is projected at 48 centsâ50 cents (beyond the high end of the previous 48 centsâ46 cents range). The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter adjusted EPS is pegged at 49 cents, within the companyâs guidance.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Hologic is likely to beat estimates this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Â Hologic has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. That is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 49 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before theyâre reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank:Â Hologic has a Zacks Rank #4. Note that we caution against all Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some companies you may want to consider, as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to come up with an earnings beat this quarter:Dextera Surgical Inc.  has an Earnings ESP of +9.09% and a Zacks Rank #2.Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (TMO  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.44% and a Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of todayâs Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.

717,IDXX,"Phibro Animal Health CorporationÂ (PAHC  -  Free Report) reported adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of 39 cents in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, up 21.9% year over year. Adjusted EPS also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 35 cents. According to the company, the year-over-year improvement was primarily driven by a higher gross profit ratio, reduced interest expense and a lower effective income tax rate.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Including one-time items, the company reported EPS of 38 cents, in line with the year-ago quarter.Full-year adjusted earnings came in at $1.51, an increase of 5.6% from year-ago period. Also, the figure surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.45.Â Net SalesIn the reported quarter, Phibroâs net sales were $194.8 million, up 2.9% year over year.

Also, revenues beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $761.52 million.Phibro Animal Health Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseÂ  Phibro Animal Health Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Phibro Animal Health Corporation QuoteSales by SegmentsNet sales at the Animal Health segment increased 2% to $128.6 million in the reported quarter on the back of volume increases in the nutritional specialty and vaccine product groups within the segment. While nutritional specialty products grew 14%, sales from vaccines increased 8%, principally on volume growth of products for poultry and swine industries.However, sales at Medicated feed additives (MFAs) and Other fell 3% primarily due to volume declines.Domestic net sales of MFAs and Other declined $7.4 million due to reduced volumes of medically important antimicrobials. International net sales increased by $5.2 million, driven by growth in the Asia-Pacific region, which is partially offset by declines in Brazil due to economic conditions.Net sales at the Mineral Nutrition segment increased 5% to $52.8 million on increased volumes and higher average selling prices resulting from underlying raw material commodity price increase. Â Net sales at the Performance Products segment increased 6% to $13.4 million. This was driven by higher volumes of copper-based products and personal care ingredients and increased average selling prices of copper-based products. However, the increase was partially offset by lower average selling prices of personal care ingredients.Operational UpdatePhibroâs fiscal fourth-quarter gross profit increased 5.9% year over year to $63.1 million. The gross margin expanded 89 basis points (bps) to 32.4%.Selling, general and administrative expenses rose 0.3% to $39.6 million.

The current Zacks Consensus Estimate of $777.1 million falls within the guided range.Phibro provided its adjusted EPS guidance in the range of $1.55â$1.61. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.55 is at the lower end of the company's guided range.Our TakePhibro endedÂ the fiscal fourth quarter on a solid note with both net sales and adjusted earnings beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Also, the year-over-year increase on both the fronts is encouraging. Further, the company witnessed year-over-year improvement across all segments. We are also encouraged by the expansion in the gross and operating margin in the reported quarter.Moreover, on a full-year basis, adjusted earnings and net sales have surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate as well with year-over-year increases in both.The company has provided its fiscal 2018 guidance for both net sales and adjusted earnings.Zacks Rank & Peer PerformancePhibro currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

718,IDXX,"On Aug 22, we issued an updated research report on Waltham, MA-based PerkinElmer, Inc. (PKI  -  Free Report). The company provides scientific instruments, consumables, and services to pharmaceutical, biomedical, environmental testing, chemical, and general industrial markets worldwide. The company currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).PerkinElmerâs expanding product portfolio is helping the company win market share worldwide. Within a short span of time, its new products have gained significant traction among consumers. We believe the products will continue to boost the companyâs market share in areas like diagnostics, research and environment.Moreover, PerkinElmer is well positioned to benefit from investments in the area of cancer immunotherapy as well as the rising trend of outsourcing instrument maintenance and scientific services over the long term.Acquisitions and strategic partnerships have been key catalysts for PerkinElmer over the years. Earlier this year, the company announced plans to acquire EUROIMMUN Medical Laboratory Diagnostics AG for approximately $1.3 billion in cash. The deal is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2017.The acquisition of EUROIMMUN Medical Laboratory Diagnostics will expand PerkinElmerâs reach in the autoimmune and allergy diagnostic markets. The acquisition will also reinforce the companyâs capabilities pertaining to new infectious diseases in the Chinese market. Per management, the acquisition is expected to add about 28 cents to 30 cents to 2018 adjusted earnings.PerkinElmer continues to acquire a large number of companies. While this improves revenue opportunities, it adds to integration risks. The frequent acquisitions can also negatively impact its balance sheet in the form of a high level of goodwill and intangible assets. Frequent acquisitions are also a distraction for management and impacts organic growth.Stock Performance at a GlancePerkinElmerâs share price movement in the past one year has been unsatisfactory. The company represented a return of almost 16%, a bit lower than the broader industry's return of almost 22.1%. The company has been witnessing weakness in academic markets outside the United States. Furthermore, lackluster performance in Europe impacted the companyâs third-party logistics in the second quarter.The estimate revision trend has been favorable for PerkinElmer over the last two months. For the current quarter, five estimates moved north compared to one movement in the opposite direction, while for the full year eight estimates moved north over the same time frame.This has had a significant impact on the magnitude of the estimates as the current quarter estimates increased 2.8%, while full-year estimates inched 1% up over the same time frame.Key PicksA few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are Edwards Lifesciences Corp. (EW  -  Free Report), IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. (IDXX  -  Free Report) and Cogentix Medical, Inc. . Notably, Edwards Lifesciences sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), while IDEXX Laboratories and Cogentix Medical have a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of todayâs Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Edwards Lifesciences delivered an average earnings beat of 10.8% over the trailing four quarters. The company has a long-term expected earnings growth rate of 15.2%.Cogentix Medical registered a positive earnings surprise of 200% in the last reported quarter. The stock represented a stellar return of 100.9% over the last one year.IDEXX Laboratories delivered an average earnings beat of 9.3% over the trailing four quarters.

719,IDXX,"St. Louis, MO-based pharmacy benefit manager Express Scripts Holding Company (ESRX  -  Free Report) recently announced results from a new diabetes study, Diabetes Dilemma: U.S. Trends in Diabetes Medication Use. Per the study, people following their oral diabetes medications experienced significantly fewer emergency room visits and inpatient hospitalizations. Further, the report revealed that they spent nearly $500 less on total healthcare costs compared to nonadherent patients.With strong criticism being voiced against high prices of specialty drugs, the focus is on better management of healthcare costs as consumers are becoming increasingly proactive about healthcare decisions. Through the study, Express Scripts emphasizes on the need for necessary patient spending for medications. This we feel would lead to experiencing an average increase in diabetes drug spend in 2017.In this regard, we remind investors that the companyâs SafeGuard suite of pharmacy solutions was designed to better manage specialty spending, thereby establishing a higher standard for patient outcome. The portfolio also includes the Hepatitis Cure Value Program, the Cholesterol Care Value Program, the Oncology Care Value Program and the Express Scripts Inflation Protection Program.Over the past three months, the company has underperformed the broader industry. The stock has gained only 1.7%, compared with 2.9% rise of the industry it belongs to.Going forward, we are highly upbeat about the companyâs core pharmacy-benefits management and long-term outlook. This includes the ongoing volatile healthcare market trends, inflation, patent expiration, lower industry utilization growth and other headwinds.Furthermore, we expect Express Scripts to continue to benefit from increased generic utilization, shift toward mail orders, strong specialty growth and an aging population. Branded drugs are becoming increasingly expensive due to double-digit brand inflation, constant rise in the price of specialty drugs and an overwhelming regulatory burden that is actually paving the way for manifold prospects for generics.However, Express Scripts recently announced that its biggest customer, the leading health insurer, Anthem Inc. (ANTM  -  Free Report), is not likely to extend its pharmacy-benefits management agreement, which is slated for expiration by the end of 2019. In 2016, Anthem sued Express Scripts for overcharging its drugs and operational failures. Per management, Anthem refused to participate in further discussions on pricing concessions and probable adjustments for the agreement. Meanwhile, in the second quarter of 2017, Anthem generated revenues worth $52.6 million compared with $106.6 million in the second quarter of 2016.Zacks Rank & Key PicksNotably, Express Scripts currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A few better-ranked medical stocks are IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. (IDXX  -  Free Report) and Lantheus Holdings, Inc. (LNTH  -  Free Report). Lantheus Holdings and IDEXX Laboratories carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

720,IDXX,"Growth investors generally have high risk tolerance and are continuously on the lookout for above-average growth stocks that are expected to outperform the broader industry with respect to revenues, earnings or cash flow.However, this apparently simple growth investment technique has some drawbacks and lack of proper understanding of the strategy may often lead to short listing of growth stocks that are a misfit to the portfolio. Since growth investors seek capital gains, they tend to remain exposed to high risks.In a bull market, it has been popularly said that a stock keeps scaling new highs until some event works against it. However, the timing of the pullback is hard to gauge.Insight into Zacks MethodologyOur latestÂ style score systemÂ has made the task quite simple. It helps us choose stocks that have a solid performance record and might therefore prove to be a great choice for investors.Our Growth Style Score highlights all evaluation metrics and represents them as one score that cautions investors regarding âgrowth trapsâ and helps them find stocks that have high growth potential.Meanwhile, stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) reflects an upward trend in the stockâs earnings estimates. Our research shows that stocks with a Growth Style Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential.Based on this, we have identified a candidate IDEXX Laboratories (IDXX  -  Free Report), with a Zacks Rank #2 and a Growth Score of A, which may prove to be a solid growth pick.Whatâs Working in Favor of IDEXX Laboratories?IDEXX Laboratories has a favorable VGM Score of B. Under the Zack Style Score system, V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum. The VGM Score is simply a weighted combination of these parameters and is a comprehensive tool that allows investors to filter through the standard scoring system and pick the winning stocks.The company also has a favorable historical earnings per share (EPS) growth rate of 33.92% when compared to the broader industryâs 14.69. Historical EPS growth rate considers the average annual (trailing 12 months) EPS growth rate over the last 3-5 years of actual earnings.The stock has an attractive projected EPS growth rate when compared to the broader industry. Projected earnings growth rate is an important informative tool that assesses the companyâs growth potential by gauging the estimated growth rate for a year. Technically, it considers the consensus estimate for the current fiscal year (F1) divided by the EPS for the last completed fiscal year (F0) (actual if reported, the consensus if not). Thus, IDEXX Laboratories has an estimated earnings growth rate of 26.9%, beating the industryâs 18.5%.Our next parameter is the cash flow growth of the company. Cash flow can be described as the net cash moving in and out of the company. IDEXX Laboratories proves to be a great growth pick as its current cash flow growth rate stands at 14.5% as compared to 5.2% of the industry. Thus, the companyâs strong cash balance bolsters our confidence in the stock.IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. Free Cash Flow (TTM) IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. Free Cash Flow (TTM) | IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. QuoteIDEXX Laboratories also stands strong when it comes to sales in relation to assets, profits and projected growth. The company has a favorable Net Margin (Net Income/ Sales) of 14.1%, far better than the broader industryâs decline of 25.1%. The Sales to Assets ratio of 1.14 supports the company as a solid growth stock in comparison to the industryâs 0.57. Moreover, the projected sales growth rate of 10.1% surpasses the broader industryâs 7.6%In this regard, we take note that IDEXX Laboratoriesâ companion animal market fundamentals are solid with tremendous global runway for growth. Managementâs unique innovation-based, multi-modality global strategy, enabled by enhanced commercial capability, accelerated recurring CAG Diagnostics revenue growth.This apart, IDEXX continues to display solid growth with respect to international expansion. The company has been significantly benefitting from the companion animal market of emerging nations, demonstrating the bountiful opportunities.Other Growth Stocks to Consider Other growth picks in the medical sector that are worth mentioning are Lantheus Holdings, Inc. (LNTH  -  Free Report), Amedisys, Inc. (AMED  -  Free Report) and Masimo Corp. (MASI  -  Free Report).Lantheus carries a Zacks Rank #2 and a Growth Score of A.

Note that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 or 3 (Hold) have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings estimates.Conversely, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.The combination of IDEXXâs Zacks Rank #2 and +1.19% ESP makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.Whatâs Driving the Better-Than-Expected Earnings?IDEXX achieved strong organic growth in the U.S. and international regions in the last reported first quarter of 2017, driven by strong global gains in Companion Animal Group (CAG) Diagnostics recurring revenues, including double-digit organic revenue gains across consumable, reference lab and rapid assay revenues, as well as continued expansion of IDEXX's premium instrument installed base. The company expects this bullish trend to continue in the upcoming quarters as well.Overall, IDEXX raised its 2017 revenue outlook by $15 million to the range of $1,925--$1,950 million, reflecting organic revenue growth expectations between 9.5% and 11%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 revenues is pegged at $1.92 billion, within the guided range.IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseÂ  IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. QuoteOn the bottom-line front, the company raised its EPS guidance to $2.95--$3.11 per share from the earlier range of $2.85â$3.01, supported by continued operating margin expansion aligned with its long-term goals. The updated outlook represents EPS growth of 21%--27% on a reported basis. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for EPS is pegged at $3.05, which is within the guided range.We are upbeat about the companyâs innovation-based global strategy that is leading to CAG Diagnostics growth. InÂ June, IDEXX announced the addition of rVetLink to its portfolio of technology applications. Notably, rVetLink is an advanced all-inclusive referral management solution designed for specialty care hospitals that simplifies the referral procedure between primary care and specialty care veterinarians.This apart, IDEXX continues to display solid growth with respect to international expansion. The company has been significantly benefitting from the companion animal market of emerging nations demonstrating the bountiful opportunities. Further, managementâs consistent share buybacks reflect its strong free cash flow reserve. We believe, the outcome of these endeavors will be reflected in the second-quarter performance.On the flip side, foreign currency fluctuation is a major headwind for the company. Another concern is the companyâs high reliance on third-party distributors. The purchasing dynamics of distributors have a significant impact on the companyâs sales of instrument consumables and rapid assay products. Also, the company is exposed to higher operating expenses pertaining to increased head count along with higher investments targeted toward growth acceleration in geographical expansion in the U.S. and internationally, and portfolio expansion.Also, the competitive landscape in the domestic and overseas markets weighs on IDEXXâs performance. This struggle to gain market share might also prove to be a drag on second-quarter 2017 results.Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are some other companies you may consider as our model shows that they also have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in the upcoming quarter:Becton, Dickinson and Company (BDX  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.41% and a Zacks Rank #2.Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.(TMO  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.44% and a Zacks Rank #2. You can seeÂ the complete list of todayâs Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Stryker Corporation (SYK  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.66% and a Zacks Rank #2.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.See This Ticker Free >>

HealthEquity stated that the profitability of HSA in this business model increases as balances grow.The growth in Custodial revenues was supported by higher average daily cash AUM. The strong year-over-year growth in Interchange revenues was driven by increased card spending and more favorable interchange terms (higher spend volume).As of Jul 31, 2017, total number of HSA members â for which the company serves as a non-bank custodian â increased 26% year over year to 2.9 million.

726,IDXX,"Medtronic plc (MDT  -  Free Report) reported financial results for first-quarter fiscal 2018. Adjusted earnings per share (EPS) in the reported quarter came in at $1.12, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.7% and up 8.7% year over year.Â Adjustments in the quarter primarily included certain impact of restructuring charges, intangible asset amortization and acquisition-related items. After adjusting unfavorable foreign exchange impact of 2 cents, adjusted EPS came in at $1.14, up 11% year over year.Without these adjustments, the company reported net income of 74 cents per share, up 12.1% year over year.Total RevenueWorldwide revenues in the reported quarter grossed $7.39 billion, up 4% on a constant exchange rate or CER basis (up 3% on a reported basis). The top line missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.45 billion. Foreign currency fluctuation affected Medtronicâs fiscal first quarter revenues by $33 million.In the quarter under review, U.S. sales (55% of total revenue) increased 1% year over year to $4.04 billion. Non-U.S. developed market revenues totaled $2.31 billion (31% of total revenue), reflecting a 5% increase at CER (up 4% as reported). Emerging markets (14% of total revenue) amounted to $1.04 billion, up 12% at CER (up 11% as reported).Medtronic PLC Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Medtronic PLC Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Medtronic PLC QuoteSegment DetailsThe company currently generates revenues from four major groups, viz. Cardiac & Vascular Group (CVG), Minimally Invasive Therapies Group (MITG), Restorative Therapies Group (RTG) and Diabetes Group.CVG comprises Cardiac Rhythm & Heart Failure (CRHF), Coronary & Structural Heart (CSH) and Aortic & Peripheral Vascular divisions (APV). MITG includes both the Surgical Solutions and the Patient Monitoring & Recovery (PMR) divisions. RTG includes the Spine, Brain Therapies, Specialty Therapies and Pain Therapies segments, while the Diabetes Group incorporates the Intensive Insulin Management (IIM), Non-Intensive Diabetes Therapies (NDT), and Diabetes Service & Solutions (DSS) divisions.Revenues at CVG improved 6% at CER (or up 5% as reported) to $2.65 billion, driven by strong, balanced growth across all three divisions.CRHF sales were $1.39 billion with 5% year over year at CER (up 4% as reported). This came on the back of growth in Arrhythmia Management led by high-teens growth in atrial fibrillation Solutions at CER, amplified penetration of the Micra transcatheter pacing system, strong uptake of the TYRX absorbable antibacterial envelope and continued worldwide customer demand for the Reveal LINQ insertable cardiac monitor. This apart, the HeartWare International acquisition drove growth in the Heart Failure division.CSH revenues were up 8% at CER (7% as reported) to $817 million on the back of high 30s constant currency growth in transcatheter aortic valves as a result of strong customer uptake of the CoreValve Evolut PRO platform in the United States and continued demand for the CoreValve Evolut R 34mm valve in the United States as well as Europe.APV revenues registered 5% growth at CER (up 4% as reported) to $439 million, driven by the continued adoption of the Endurant IIs aortic stent graft and remarkable strength of the Heli-FX EndoAnchor System. Peripheral was driven by low-double digit growth in both atherectomy and drug-coated balloons.In MITG, worldwide sales reached $2.49 billion, marking a 3% year-over-year increase at CER (same as reported) on mid-single digit growth in Surgical Solutions and low-single digit growth in PMR.In RTG, worldwide revenues of $1.81 billion were up 2% year over year at CER (same as reported) on high-single digit growth in Brain Therapies, mid-single digit growth in Specialty Therapies and low-single digit growth in Spine, thus mitigating a decline in Pain Therapies. However, revenues from the Diabetes group decreased 1% at CER (same as reported) to $449 million.MarginsGross margin during the reported quarter contracted 20 basis points (bps) to 68.2% despite a 2.8% increase in gross profit to $5.04 billion. Adjusted operating margin remained flat year over year at 26.3%. This was owing to a 1.4% decline in research and development expenses (to $548 million) which was offset by a 2.3% rise in selling, general and administrative expenses (to $2.49 billion). Other expenses in the reported quarter were $66 million as compared with $39 million in the year-ago period.GuidanceMedtronic reiterated its fiscal 2018 constant-currency revenue and EPS guidance. The company still expects full-year revenue growth in the range of 4-5% at CER. However, the company revised its foreign currency fluctuation estimation, which is now projected to have a positive $380-$480 million impact in the fiscal year compared to an expected positive impact of $75-$175 million stated previously. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues remains at $30.72 billion for fiscal 2018.Fiscal 2018 adjusted earnings per share growth is still expected in the range of 9-10% at CER. Currency translation is now expected to have an adverse impact of 3 cents to a positive impact of 1 cent compared with the earlier expectation of negative impact of approximately 5-10 cents. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2018 earnings is pegged at $4.89.Moreover for the second quarter of fiscal 2018, Medtronic expects currency translation to have a favorable impact of $25-$75 million on revenues. Currency translation is expected to have a favorable impact of 0-2 cents on second-quarter earnings per share.Our TakeMedtronicâs exited the fiscal fourth-quarter on a mixed note with earnings ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate and the reported revenues failing to meet the estimates. While the company demonstrated improved segmental performances at CER, escalating costs and expenses continue to weigh on bottom line. Unfavorable currency translation acted as a dampener to the companyâs quarterly performance. However, the fiscal guidance represents chances of respite.On a positive note, three major business groups contributed to solid top-line growth at CER, which highlighted sustainability across groups and regions, in addition to displaying successful integration and achievement of synergy targets. We are also encouraged by the solid growth trend, successfully continuing in the U.S. as well as the healthy global acceptance of its advanced therapies. Apart from product innovation, the company is currently focusing on geographical diversification of its businesses.Zacks Rank & Peer PerformancesMedtronics currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

727,IDXX,"On Aug 14, we issued an updated research report on San Francisco, CA-based McKesson Corporation (MCK  -  Free Report), a health care services and information technology company.Â  McKesson posted disappointing results in first-quarter fiscal 2018, wherein adjusted earnings and revenues missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The company currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The quarter saw strong performance by the Distribution Solutions segment. The segment is expected to keep up its performance in fiscal 2018 despite weak pricing trends and customer consolidation. To boost growth, the company recently acquired CoverMyMeds for approximately $1.1 billion.Coming to guidance, the Distribution Solutions business revenue growth is expected to witness robust growth on a year-over-year basis. The upside is expected to be driven by market growth and acquisitions.McKesson expects GAAP earnings per diluted share of $7.10-$9.00 for the fiscal ending Mar 31, 2018. Adjusted earnings for the same period are expected in the range of $11.80-$12.50 per diluted share.On the flipside, pricing pressure in the independent retail pharmacy channel is a headwind. McKesson entered fiscal 2018 with an assumption of branded inflation in the mid-single digits and its first quarter slightly surpassed expectations.McKesson has been witnessing increased price competition in the independent retail pharmacy channel, which eventually resulted in reduced volumes. The company continues to see a competitive market for selling generic pharmaceuticals in the U.S. However, McKesson expects to overcome the independent pharmacy sell-side pricing impact by the end of second-quarter fiscal 2018.Furthermore, cutthroat competition in the niche markets, currency headwinds and reimbursement issues remain challenges.Stock Performance and Estimate Revision TrendOver the last three months, McKesson has been trading above the broader industry. The company has gained 5.1%, comparing favorably with the broader industryâs return of just 4%. The current level is also higher than the S&P 500âs return of only 4.6% over the same time frame.The estimate revision trend for McKesson has been unfavorable at the moment. For the current quarter, six analysts moved south compared to no movement in the opposite direction over the last two months. As a result, magnitude of full-year estimates fell 4.8% to $2.76 over the same time frame.Key PicksA few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (EW  -  Free Report), Masimo Corporation (MASI  -  Free Report) and IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.

729,IDXX,"In an initiative to enhance clinical development in Japan, PAREXEL International Corporation , a global biopharmaceutical services company and provider of clinical research and logistics has formed an alliance with Osaka International Cancer Institute to bolster patient enrollment for clinical trials in oncology and hematology.Per management, Osaka will leverage on PAREXELâs biopharmaceutical expertise to provide a wide range of potential treatment options to cancer patients. We believe solid advancement of clinical trials with scientific expertise in the oncology segment will fortify PAREXELâs foothold in the niche markets (both oncology and biopharmaceutical). In this regard, oncology is the largest and the fastest growing therapeutic area for PAREXEL. In fact, the segment grew 31% on an average over the past four years.However, we believe initiatives like these will help PAREXEL drive its top and bottom line. A solid long-term expected earnings growth rate of 13% holds promise in this regard. Furthermore, the biopharmaceutical services market is healthy and PAREXEL enjoys a competitive edge in the space.Solid Prospects in Asia PacificPAREXELâs growth story in the Asia Pacific has been compelling. In Japan, the company has a leading position among biopharmaceutical companies and is well positioned to advantage from an outsourcing market that is relatively underpenetrated. PAREXEL has operations in Tokyo, Kobe and Osaka in Japan.After reporting third-quarter fiscal 2017, PARAXELâs business across Asia has more than doubled over the last two years, at a CAGR of almost 50%. Apart from Japan, the company sees solid prospects in China â the world's second-largest pharmaceutical market witnessing double-digit growth.Shares Shine BrightPAREXEL has had an impressive run on the bourse over the last three months. The company has gained 10%, comparing favorably with the broader industryâs addition of 1.9%. The stock has also outperformed the S&P 500âs return of 1% over the same time frame.The estimate revision trend for the current quarter and full year has been stable in the last two months. Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter and full year stood at 94 cents and $3.23, respectively, over the same time frame.PAREXEL has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Bottom LineApart from fortifying hold in the oncology space, PAREXEL is focused on expediting activities in areas like protocol design, study start-up, trial execution, regulatory submission and product commercialization. The company provides a broad range of clinical research, consulting, medical communications and technology solutions and services to pharmaceutical, biotechnology and medical deviceindustries worldwide.In fact, the global market trends seem favorable at the moment. The biopharmaceuticals market is anticipated to reach a worth of $278 billion by 2020 at a CAGR of 9.4%, per Persistence Market Research. We expect PAREXEL to gain significant traction in the biopharmaceutical and related ancillary markets, courtesy of the favorable trend and the latest partnership.Key PicksA few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are Edwards Lifesciences Corp.

730,IDXX,"On Aug 21, we issued an updated research report on North Kansas City, MO-based Cerner Corporation (CERN  -  Free Report) â a leading global provider of healthcare information technology solutions (HCIT). The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).We believe that Cerner has solid growth opportunities in the revenue cycle management (RCM) suite of solutions. In fact, the segment has been a strong contributor in recent times with RevWorks services delivering a solid performance. In fact, bookings in the second quarter of 2017 were $1.636 billion (an all-time high), up 16% on a year-over-year basis.A secondary growth driver for Cerner is its Population Health (PH) Management platform. Notably, the company clinched a high number of large contracts for the PH platform in the last reported quarter.Cerner offers exposure to worldwide healthcare automation. Its international operations provide a more diversified revenue stream. In the past, the company had won contracts in the U.K. as well as the Middle East. Furthermore, Cerner constantly pursues complementary business acquisitions that enable it to expand its solutions, device offerings and services.On the flipside, the company operates in the HCIT space which is intensely competitive and fast evolving, subjecting it to rapid technological changes.Share Price & Estimate RevisionCerner had an impressive run on the bourse over the last six months, trading above the industry in terms of price performance. A glimpse at the price movement reveals that Cernerâs shares have gained 17.2%, comparing favorably with the 14.1% rise of the industry it belongs to.On the flip side, the estimate revision trend for the current year remains unfavorable with eight estimates moving south over the last two months, compared with only two movement in the opposite direction. The companyâs current estimate slipped 0.4% over the past two months.Key PicksA few better-ranked medical stocks are IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. (IDXX  -  Free Report), Lantheus Holdings, Inc.

731,IDXX,"On Aug 21, we issued an updated research report on Irvine, CA-based Quality Systems Inc. (QSII  -  Free Report), a leading developer and marketer of healthcare information systems. The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Quality Systems had an unimpressive run on the bourse over the last one month, trading below the industry in terms of price performance. A glimpse at the price movement reveals that Quality Systemsâ shares have lost 9.6%, comparing unfavorably with the industryâs 3.0% decline.Quality Systems posted a stellar first quarter of fiscal 2018, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate for both the counts. However, the quarter witnessed lower professional service sales, which fell almost 13.4% year over year. This was primarily because of tough comparisons with the year-earlier quarter and an unimpressive performance by the new software platform in recent quarters.We are particularly upbeat about the solid performance by the companyâs total software, hardware and related segments. However, growth at the segment was partially offset by lower software license and hardware sales.Among other concerns, a sluggish global economy, intensifying competition and a strict regulatory environment are primary headwinds. Although a recurring revenue stream is a positive for Quality Systems, it mostly comes from lower margin Electronic data interchange (EDI) and Revenue Cycle Management (RCM) services.Quality Systems continues to acquire businesses that improve its revenue opportunities and aggravate integration risks. The companyâs frequent acquisitions can impact its balance sheet as well as overall organic growth. This may limit Quality Systemsâ expansion plans and worsen its risk profile.On a positive note, Quality Systems continues to focus on growing its presence in the RCM, population health and interoperability solution markets, which is expected to drive dividends in the coming quarters.Key PicksA few better-ranked medical stocks are IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. (IDXX  -  Free Report), Lantheus Holdings, Inc. (LNTH  -  Free Report) and Align Technology, Inc. (ALGN  -  Free Report).

732,IDXX,"California-based Align Technology, Inc. (ALGN  -  Free Report) recently signed a distribution agreement with Patterson Dental, a business unit of Patterson Companies, Inc. (PDCO  -  Free Report).Per the non-exclusive agreement, effective September 2017, Align Technologyâs iTero Element intraoral scanning system will be available as part of Patterson Dentalâs CAD/CAM portfolio in the United States and Canada. Thus, we believe Align Technologyâslatest deal will boost the iTero scanner customer base to a considerable extent.We are also optimistic about the companyâs expanding work flow options for its leading iTero scanners. In this context, Align Technology recently launched a software upgrade to its iTero Element intraoral scanner that is capable of comparing patient scans over time with the latest TimeLapse technology.Also, Align Technology collaborated with exocad GmbH in March, whereby the integrated portfolio will result in high-tech workflow solution for efficient scanning, designing and manufacturing of in-house dental prosthesis. In February, the company announced the addition of digital workflow for Nobel Biocare implants to its iTero intraoral scanner portfolio.Interestingly, revenues from Scanner and Service improved a substantial 36.7% in the last reported second quarter 2017. Moreover, the company saw increased adoption of iTero scanners for Invisalign case submissions instead of PVS impressions, especially in North America, thereby driving Invisalign utilization. In line with the latest developments in the iTero scanner space, Align Technologyâs latest deal buoys optimism.Per a report by MedGadget, the global market for 3D Dental Scanners is projected to see a CAGR of 10.2% over the 2017-2021 period.Considering the market potential and Align Technologyâs current developments in the scanners and services space, this collaboration seems to be a strategic one.We believe an unhealthy lifestyle and rising awareness and expenditure in healthcare will continue to drive growth in the 3D Dental scanners market. However, this market is dominated by many well established players, with DENTSPLY SIRONA being a prominent one.Align Technology has been gaining investor confidence on consistent positive results. Over the past three months, the companyâs share price has outperformed the broader industry. The stock has gained 22.3%, as against the broader industryâs 0.9% fall. The company has also outperformed the 1.3% gain of the S&P 500 market over the same time frame.Â Zacks Rank & Key PicksAlign Technology currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

733,IDXX,"Chemed Corporation (CHE  -  Free Report), a leading manufacturer of products and services primarily for the companion animal veterinary, has gained 5.1% over the last six months, thus beating the S&P 500âs 2.9% gain. The stock has a market cap of $3 billion. The companyâs five-year expected growth rate is also impressive at 10%.The company further represented a return of almost 42.2%, substantially higher than the industryâs 5.1% gain over the last year. With solid prospects, this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock is an attractive pick at the moment.The companyâs estimate revision trend for the current year has also been positive. In the past 60 days, one estimate moved north, with no movement in the opposite direction. The magnitude of estimate revision for earnings per share rose around 2.9% to $8.17 over the same time frame.Letâs find out whether the recent positive trend is a sustainable one.Chemedâs second-quarter 2017 performance was quite promising with the bottom line significantly improving on a year-over-year basis. This stellar performance was driven by the companyâs increase in the average net Medicare reimbursement rate and average daily census.Keeping this momentum up, encouraging revenue growth and raised guidance for 2017 further indicate the companyâs brighter prospects. The promising outlook for both Roto-Rooter segment and bottom line also supports the companyâs estimation of improved operating results in the upcoming quarters. In fact, the view raise was backed by the companyâs expectation of significant gains from its Roto-Rooter business.Chemedâs VITAS business was in trouble over the past few quarters due to certain admission coding changes initiated by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS). However, management recently noted that the recent admission trends have been positive which should continue in the coming quarters. During second-quarter 2017, VITAS performed well, both financially and operationally, thereby surpassing the companyâs estimates.Additionally, the companyâs strong cash balance enables it to carry out share repurchase programs and in turn, provides solid returns to investors.Other Key PicksOther top-ranked medical stocks are IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.

734,IDXX,"On Aug 21, we issued an updated research report on Elmsford, NY-based BioScrip, Inc. (BIOS  -  Free Report). The company is a leading Infusion Service provider and strives to deliver cost-effective programs to patients. The stock currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Over the past month, BioScrip has been trading above the broader industry. The stock has gained 3.7% in this period, as against the industryâs 9% loss. The market is upbeat about the companyâs announcement to continue to offer certain core product lines to UnitedHealthcare. This deal should be significantly accretive to BioScripâs top line.The companyâs progress for new multi-faceted CORE plan to improve financial position is also encouraging. The plan involves identifying and executing strategies to accelerate core revenue growth, favorable product mix, drive operational efficiency, improve revenue collection and increase employee effectiveness.Further, BioScrip had successfully completed the Home Solutionsâ integration earlier this year. The company expects core revenues as well as continued growth from this acquired asset to prove accretive, going forward.Notably, BioScrip has been recording persistent growth in its core Infusion Services business with strong presence as well as a competitive advantage. The company witnessed a consistent rise in this business, primarily on account of strong organic growth in chronic, nutrition and other therapies. It has been building a robust core Infusion platform through organic development and acquisitions.Management expects BioScripâs focus on the fast-growing core Infusion business to drive an increased profitability. The company is currently on track to achieve the previously announced $17 million in Home Solutions synergies and other incremental annualized cost-reductions of $23-$25 million by 2017-end.On the flip side, BioScripâs 2017 guidance is lackluster with the inclusion of an estimated negative impact of the Cures Act legislation. A large portion of the companyâs revenues used to come directly from Medicare, state Medicaid programs or other government payers. However, the new Cures Act bill does not reimburse any service payments for administration of certain drugs to patients via home infusion pharmacies.The healthcare industry is also highly competitive.

735,IDXX,"On Aug 14, we issued an updated research report on Warsaw, IN-based Zimmer Biomet Holdings Inc. (ZBH  -  Free Report), a leading musculoskeletal healthcare company. It designs and distributes orthopedic reconstructive products, spine, bone healing, thoracic products, dental implants and related surgical products.Over the last three months, Zimmer Biomet was trading below the industry on factors like macroeconomic uncertainties, pricing pressure and unfavorable currency fluctuations. The stock has till now lost 4.5% compared against the industryâs 4% gain.With the company delivering a dull second-quarter result, we expect this downside to continue in the upcoming period. Per management, the company is still fighting headwinds such as slump in knee business, shortage in supply of some products, thus leading to inability to recapture the lost customers across the United States and gain new ones. Also, the trimmed 2017 guidance adds to our concerns indicating slim chances of recovery ahead.The market also seems to be apprehensive about the departure of Zimmer Biometâs decade-old CEO David C. Dvorak. Notably, during his 10-year tenure, Zimmer Biomet has transformed into a global leader in musculoskeletal healthcare. Through a combination of organic growth and strategic acquisitions, the companyâs revenue has doubled in this phase and it has introduced a broad portfolio of technologies, solutions and personalized services.Only time will tell if the stepping down of Drovak leaves an adverse impact on the companyâs business. Currently, we remain on the sidelines until further visibility is obtained on this matter.On a positive note, we look forward to the ongoing synergy from the LDR Holding acquisition, which should broaden and complement the companyâs musculoskeletal offering. This is in line with the strategy to grow through inorganic means by focusing on mega mergers.Management is also striving to develop a strong spine portfolio in order to cash in on the opportunities. The companyâs spine offerings such as Mobi-C Cervical Disc prosthesis and Vitality Spinal Fixation System showed a considerable progress in performance.Zimmer Biomet has been of late working to strengthen its foothold in the emerging markets providing long-term opportunities. The companyâs strategic investments in these regions over several quarters with a view to enhance operational and sales performance are yielding results.Zacks Rank & Key PicksZimmer Biomet currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Some of the better-ranked medical stocks are IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.

736,IDXX,"Shares of Pennsylvania-based BioTelemetry Inc. (BEAT  -  Free Report) rallied to a new 52-week high of $37.50 on Aug 15, closing a tad lower at $36.55. This represents a strong year-to-date return of approximately 63.5%, better than the S&P 500âs 10.3% over the same time frame.BioTelemetry provides cardiac monitoring services and cardiac monitoring device manufacturing. The stock sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).For the majority of the last three months, the companyâs share price has considerably outperformed the broader industry. The stock has rallied 30.5% over the last three months, outshining the industryâs return of just 3.6% over the same time frame.Notably, BioTelemetry has a market cap of $1.2 billion. Taking the stable performance of the stock into consideration, we expect BioTelemetry to scale higher in the coming quarters. The companyâs long-term growth of 28.4% also holds promise in this regard.Growth CatalystsQ2 Results Solid: BioTelemetry exited second quarter on a strong note with earnings exceeding the Zacks Consensus Estimate and revenues meeting the same. Revenues increased 10.3% year over year to $58.1 million, primarily driven by a $1-million increase in Healthcare revenues owing to rising MCOT patients. Notably, this marked the 20th consecutive quarter of year-over-year revenue growth. The company also registered growth across all segments. We are encouraged to note that the company is putting efforts in product innovation through research and development. However, a decline in gross margin is a matter of concern.LifeWatch Acquisition: In July, BioTelemetry announced the acquisition of LifeWatch AG in a deal valued at about $280 million. With this buyout, BioTelemetry enhanced its position in the wireless medicine space, expanding its product profile and customer base in the cardiac monitoring and diagnostic services space.Management expects the acquisition to yield significant synergies over the next 12â18 months. Both the companies make products which are utilized for remotely monitoring cardiac care patients.Guidance Strong: The raised full-year 2017 revenue guidance is encouraging. Post the acquisition of LifeWatch, BioTelemetry currently expects full-year 2017 revenue in the range of $285 million to $290 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for full-year 2017 revenues is pegged at $286.05 million.The company expects $82 million to $84 million of revenues in the third quarter and $89 million to $92 million in the fourth quarter. The company also expects one-time expense related to the acquisition of approximately $15 million which is further expected to be reflected in third-quarter results.Estimate Revision Trend: The estimate revision trend for BioTelemetry is favorable at the moment. For the full year, two analysts moved north compared to no movement in the opposite direction over the last two months. As a result, full-year estimates jumped 22.7% to $1.08 over the same time frame.For the current quarter, one analyst moved north, compared to no movement in the opposite direction in the last two months.

The company has witnessed significant growth through infectious disease testing, prescription drug monitoring and wellness business. It is currently refocusing on core diagnostic information services business and disciplined capital deployment. Finally, the raised 2017 guidance indicates chances of continuation of this bullish trend. In addition, alliance with hospitals and integrated delivery networks are other growth drivers. The company is particularly positive about its PeaceHealth acquisition in the Pacific Northwest which is expected to bolster growth in the rest of 2017.We are also encouraged by the launch of QHerit byÂ Quest Diagnostics in July. The QHerit Pan-Ethnic Expanded Carrier Screen is a panel of tests for the 22 heritable diseases mentioned under new screening guidelines issued in March 2017 by the American College of Gynecology (ACOG). Further, the company has completed its previously announced acquisition of laboratory businesses â Med Fusion and Clear Point.In late 2016, Quest Diagnostics came up with an upgraded long-term growth outlook (beyond 2017) based on its new and extended two-point strategy to generate shareholdersâ value, accelerate growth and drive operational excellence.However, we are concerned about the tough organic volume scenario. Also, in the last three months, a comparative study of Quest Diagnosticâs forward P/E (F12M basis) multiple reflects that the stock is quite overvalued. A tough competitive landscape and reimbursement headwinds are other concerns.Key PicksSome better-ranked medical stocks are Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (EW  -  Free Report), Lantheus Holdings, Inc.

739,IDXX,"Hologic, Inc. (HOLX  -  Free Report) has moved a step forward within its core Breast Health business with another new product added to its kitty. The company has announced to have commercially launched the Brevera breast biopsy system with CorLumina imaging technology in the United States.Per the company, this real-time breast biopsy and verification system enhances workflow and patient experience, streamlining the entire biopsy process. Notably, the Brevera system claims to be worldâs first and only breast biopsy solution, combining tissue acquisition, real-time imaging, sample verification and advanced post-biopsy handling into one integrated system. Designed for 2D and 3D breast biopsy, this technical method increases biopsy accuracy with real-time imaging, thus helping to perform fast and efficient procedures in a cost saving manner.Per Hologic, this new advancement is a major breakthrough by the radiologists, who were hitherto conducting stereotactic breast biopsy procedures to diagnose breast cancer. This conventional practice is time-consuming as well as uncomfortable for patients. Whereas with the Brevera system, image tissue samples can be obtained right in the procedure room within a few seconds only. Good news is that this highly sophisticated technology will potentially save up to 10 minutes per patient, cutting the procedure time almost by 25%.Hologic also claims the Brevera systemâs proprietary CorLumina imaging technology to help improve workflow across multiple departments within a health system. It also features PACS integration for advanced image sharing and transfer of patient records.Significantly, within its breast health segment, Hologic has reshaped its R&D strategy toward continuous innovation around its leadership position in 3D mammography. Besides the latest Brevera routine, there is Affirm prone biopsy system.Management is hopeful that Brevera will begin to boost growth in 2017 and add more meaningful contribution in 2018. Also in June, Hologic had announced that the FDA labeled its Genius 3D Mammography exam as better than the standard 2D mammography for routine breast cancer screening of women with dense breasts.While Hologic is pretty confident about the strong adoption of its Brevera breast biopsy system in the market, we look forward to the companyâs consistent efforts to flourish in the field of womenâs health. In this regard, it is important to mention about the immense growth opportunities the healthcare market holds at present.Per the data provided by Markets and Markets, the breast imaging market is expected to reach $4.14 billion by 2021 at a CAGR of 8.5% from 2016. However, more searches reveal the global breast biopsy market to advance at a CAGR of 10.70% during the period 2017-2021 (per Research and Markets data, published in Business Wire).Over the last three months, the companyâs share price has underperformed the broader industry.

742,IDXX,"Headquartered in Sunnyvale, CA, Accuray Inc. (ARAY  -  Free Report) recently announced that the Boise-based Summit Cancer Center has initiated cancer treatment with its Radixact Treatment Delivery System. Notably, the Radixact system leverages on the companyâs flagship TomoTherapy platform.Radixact system provides complex treatments such as craniospinal and total marrow irradiation. Added to these functionalities, Summit Cancer Center has the capability to perform stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) and stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) while sparing normal tissues and maintaining optimal treatment efficacy.The Radixact System has been designed to deliver image-guided intensity-modulated radiation therapy, an extremely precise form of radiation therapy. The platform gained Japanese regulatory approval (Shonin approval) in the last quarter and is expected to start formal treatments from the fourth quarter.In this regard, a glimpse at the preliminary fourth-quarter results reveals that Accuray expects approximately $86 million of gross product orders. Solid growth in gross orders is buoyed by the full commercial launch of the Radixact system and continued strong demand for the companyâs flagship CyberKnife system.Stock Price & Estimate Revision TrendAccuray has had an unimpressive run on the bourse over the last one year. The company has lost 23.7%, way wider than the broader industryâs rally of almost 2.4%. Moreover, the current level compares unfavorably with the S&P 500âs 11% gain.Furthermore, the estimate revision for the stock has been unfavorable. The full-year estimates deteriorated 3 cents to a loss of 28 cents per share. Owing to the bearish analyst sentiments, Accuray carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), which signifies underperformance in the near term.Our TakeAccurayâs top-line growth is highly dependent on CyberKnife and TomoTherapy systems sales. However, both systems involve significant capital spending, which many healthcare providers are reluctant to spend, primarily due to the sluggish macro-economic conditions. This might mar revenues over the long haul.However, the company has been gaining ground on a series of positive tidings on the regulatory front recently. Of the notable ones, Accuray received 510(k) clearance from the FDA for its iDMS Data Management System in July.Key PicksA few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are Edwards Lifesciences Corp.

743,IDXX,"Palo Alto, CA-based manufacturer of medical devices and software, Varian Medical Systems, Inc. (VAR  -  Free Report), announced that it has signed a distribution agreement with Toledo, OH-based Bionix Radiation Therapy. Per the agreement, Varian Medical would distribute Bionixâs propreitory brachytherapy applicators. Varian will market the Bionix Esophageal Applicator (E-App) and the Anorectal Applicator (AR-1) in North America.Of the above two applicators, E-App is a disposable brachytherapy applicator. It is designed specifically for the treatment of cancers. The E-App features five independently operable balloons that maintain the central position of the source catheter in both straight and curved anatomy. This allows for closer proximity of the target to the source while maintaining distance from healthy tissue.The second applicator, AR-1 is a disposable brachytherapy applicator. It is designed specifically for the treatment of anal and rectal cancers. The dual balloon design of the AR-1 allows exophytic tumors to press closer to the source catheter. This creates the ability to deliver a very high dose to the tumor, while sparing healthy tissue.Future TrendWe note that the global radiotherapy market is expected to reach a worth of $7,544.8 million by 2020, at a CAGR of 6.2%. Taking the bountiful prospects in the global niche space into consideration, the latest development should boost investorâs confidence.Share Price PerformanceA promising portfolio combined with robust initiatives has been favoring this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company, which has delivered positive earnings surprise in 12 of the last 14 quarters. We note that shares of Varian Medical have declined 0.2% over the past three months against the broader industry, which grew 0.5% in the same time frame.Our TakeVarian Medical operates in a technology-driven environment where success depends on innovation and frequent product updates. The company has been successful on the R&D front as evident from year-over-year expansion in its top line. The company has approximately $1 billion revenue opportunity from its various Oncology and Imaging Component products over the next five years.Apart from enjoying a dominant market share in conventional radiotherapy, we believe that proton therapy holds significant promise for Varian Medical. This is because ProBeam Compact proton therapy system is superior to other external beam radiotherapies in precisely locating cancerous tumors and cause lesser side-effects to surrounding tissues. Proton therapy system uses the same interface used by the company in its TrueBeam platform.Finally, the companyâs strong overseas presence is expected to enable it to leverage this opportunity in emerging markets. In line with growing demand for cancer treatment in overseas markets, Varian Medicalâs sales, in Europe, Africa and particularly Asia, are growing at a faster rate than in the domestic market.Do Medical Stocks Interest You?

744,IDXX,"On Sep 1, we issued an updated research report on GNC Holdings, Inc.Â (GNC  -  Free Report), a leading global specialty retailer of products for health and wellness, including vitamins, minerals, herbal supplement, sports nutrition and diet. The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Over the past year, GNC Holdings has been underperforming the broader industry. The company has lost 60%, as compared with the 13.1% decline of the broader industry over this period. Weak margins and significant decline in revenues on a year-over-year basis raise concern. Tough competition, changing consumer preferences along with Federal Trade Commission (FTC) regulations continue to pose challenges.Moreover, this Pittsburgh, PA-based company exited the second quarter of 2017 on a disappointing note with revenues missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Although earnings exceeded the consensus estimate, the year-over-year decline on both the fronts was dampening. The decline can be attributed to lower sales in the companyâs U.S. & Canada and manufacturing/wholesale segments.On a positive note, during the second quarter, management witnessed positive response for its New GNC Plan under which the company had startedÂ incorporating transformational changes in its operations. Also, management is currently working on product pricing and innovation. Moreover, new consumer enrollment under the myGNC Rewards Program and launch of GNC storefront on Amazon buoy optimism.GNC Holdings is developing products and formulas to address unmet customer needs and is also expanding customer brands like Beyond Raw, Mega Men, Womenâs Ultra Mega and GNC Probiotics.Also, the companyâs prospects in the international business and strong cash position are encouraging. Management expects to continue capitalizing on international revenue opportunities through the addition of franchise stores in existing markets, expansion into new high-growth markets and growth of product distribution in both existing and new markets.During the second quarter of 2017, the companyâs international business drove a 1.3% increase in revenues and 14.3% rise in operating income.Â Apart from the strong e-commerce business in China, the company witnessed improvement in trends in Mexico, South Korea and Hong Kong.Meanwhile, the nutritional supplements industry is characterized by rapid and frequent changes in demand for products and new product introductions. This apart, GNC Holdingsâ international competitors include large pharmacy chains, major supermarket chains and other big U.S.-based companies with global operations.Management fears that in the face of stiff competition, the company may fail to function effectively and its attempts to do so may require price reduction, which in turn may hurt margins.Key PicksA few better-ranked medical stocks are Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (EW  -  Free Report), Lantheus Holdings, Inc.

745,IDXX,"The second half of 2017 has already started, but for the 63-million citizens who voted for President Donald Trump at Capitol Hill have yet to witness the abolishment of Obamacare or a Mexican wall. The dollar has been under strong selling pressure this year amid ongoing uncertainty over the economic agenda of Trump and mounting speculation on whether the Fed will implement a third-rate hike this year.Given such volatile economic conditions, investors will feel intimidated with regard to the investment scenario. In fact, increased volatility on the back of a significant increase in the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) indicate bearish market prospects. Apart from domestic events, issues like the escalating North Korea-Japan tension and terror attacks in Spain also resulted in markets being subdued.What Now for MedtechAt present the focal point at the Capitol Hill seems to be tax cuts. But we feel itâs only a hogwash to unite the GOP under one banner after a divisive summer for the apocalyptic battle for Obamacare repeal. Amid such political conundrum, market watchers will keep a tab on the Medical space. The fraternity worries whether the final âTrump-care planâ will still include the MedTech tax repeal in its agenda.Meanwhile, the old template of the plan, which promised to eradicate the infamous 2.3% medical device tax and the Cadillac tax (40% excise tax on high-cost healthcare plans) was not a bad deal. Amid such uproar, the question that emerges is how medical product players stand to gain or lose.While selection of the right stocks can be quite an ardent task, a little care and precision can make the job easy. Given the current lack of clarity, let us concentrate on some powerful long-term tailwinds of the medical device industry including mergers & acquisitions (M&A), emerging market expansion, positive demographic trends and new product innovation. These have been a driving force behind the sectorâs impressive performance amid severe socio-economic and political instability.The wide gamut of Medical Device comes here to the rescue. Within the Zacks Industry classification, Medical Device is broadly grouped into the Medical sector (one of 16 Zacks sectors) and further sub-divided into important areas like Medical - Instruments, Medical - Products and Medical - Dental Supplies.Screening CriteriaIn this article, we have picked a winner from each of the aforementioned areas that have traded higher than the S&P 500 index through the past year. Also, based on their strong fundamentals, strategic implementation, planned execution and certain positive catalysts, they carry a huge upside potential and a high probability of outperforming the S&P 500 market index in the coming days. Zacks has designed the Style Score System to compare each parameter of a stock with the peer group for an analysis of whether the stock is attractive from the value perspective.These stocks currently flaunt a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and a VGM Score of âAâ or âB.â Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three metrics. Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners. Their market capitalization all are in multi-billions, testifying to their strong liquidity.The 2017 estimate revision trend is significantly positive and earnings growth expectation is above the S&P 500. Finally, the industryâs lower-than-market positioning calls for more upside in the second half of 2017.Top PicksMedical - Dental SuppliesThe Dental Supplies industry is currently ranked at #110. It has significantly climbed from last weekâs rank #196. The industry has outperformed the S&P 500 by registering a gain of 0.33% over the past month. The index on the other hand has shed 0.81%.

748,IDXX,"On Sep 11, we issued an updated research report onÂ IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. (IDXX  -  Free Report), a leading molecular diagnostic company. The stock currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).It is encouraging to note that IDEXXÂ continues to demonstrate solid global growth on potent international expansion. International revenues in the last-reported second quarter of 2017 grew in high single digits, driven by an 11% organic rise in CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues and 12.3% gains in Water business. This indicated continued consumable revenue gains supported by a strong Catalyst instrument customer base and average testing utilization.IDEXX derives the lionâs share of revenues from its Companion Animal Group segment (CAG). In the second quarter, CAG organic revenues rose low double digits on a year-over-year basis, supported by CAG Diagnostics recurring organic as well as CAG instrument revenue growth. We believe managementâs innovation-based global strategy is leading to growth in CAG Diagnostics.Also, IDEXX recently announced the addition of rVetLink to its portfolio of technological applications. Notably, rVetLink is an advanced all-inclusive referral management solution designed for specialty care hospitals that simplifies the referral procedure between primary care and specialty care veterinarians.Additionally, the company has a strong cash balance that enables it to carry out share repurchase programs and in turn provide solid returns to investors.On the flipside, over the last six months, IDEXX has been trading below the broader industry with respect to share price movement. The stock has rallied 5.1% over this period in comparison to 11.7% gain of the broader industry. IDEXXâs high dependence on third-party distributors and intense competition continue to pose threats. Moreover, with growing international expansion, the company's Companion Animal Diagnostics business is likely to suffer from adverse currency fluctuations. A competitive landscape in the overseas market weighs on the company as well.Â Other Key PicksA few other top-ranked medical stocks are Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (EW  -  Free Report), Lantheus Holdings, Inc. (LNTH  -  Free Report) and Amedisys, Inc. (AMED  -  Free Report). Edwards Lifesciences sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), while Lantheus Holdings and Amedisys carry a Zacks Rank #2.

The system is exclusively designed to limit radiation exposure, reorganize workflow and assist implant placement.Excelsius GPS system works with three different imaging modalities. Excelsius GPS integrates Globus Medical implants and instruments and is compatible with pre-operative CT, intra-operative CT and fluoroscopic imaging modalities.Globus Medical is gearing up for a worldwide launch, including logistics, supply chain, manufacturing and support of the Excelsius GPS system. In fact, this technology has encouraged Globus Medical to increase investments in R&D, technology acquisition and distribution channels.Share Performance & Estimate Revision TrendOver the last one month, Globus Medical has been trading below the broader industry. The company has lost 6.3%, much wider than the broader industryâs decline of 2.8%. The current level also compares unfavorably with the S&P 500âs decline of only 0.4% over the same time frame.The estimate revision trend for Globus Medical has been unfavorable of late. For the current quarter, two analysts moved south compared to one movement in the opposite direction over the last two months.

750,IDXX,"On Aug 18, we issued an updated research report on Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (WBA  -  Free Report), the Illinois-based leading pharmacy-led, health and wellbeing enterprise. The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Walgreens has outperformed its industry with respect to share price movement in the last month. The stock has gained 1.7%, ahead of the industryâs 1% rise during the period.Â Walgreensâ shelving of the $17 billion Rite Aid (RAD  -  Free Report) acquisition deal came as a huge setback to the companyâs investors. The buyout deal had once promised a strong platform for developing the companyâs brand presence as well as its overall future business growth. However, delving into the dealâs latest Â details, we believe there is still much to hope for.The new agreement would enable Walgreens to purchase nearly half of the Rite Aid business at a deal value, almost one-third of the original price. More specifically, the acquirer will take over nearly 2,186 stores, three distribution centers and a related inventory from Rite Aid for $5.175 billion in cash. Notably, the latter ran about 4,523 stores across 31 states and the District of Columbia as of Jun 3, 2017.This apart, the contractâs financial outcome is pretty attractive. Post the new transactionâs initial closing, Walgreens expects it to be modestly accretive to its adjusted diluted net earnings per share in the first full year. Synergies from this new takeover are expected in excess of $400 million, to be entirely realized within three to four years of its initial closing.Per Walgreens, this modified merger contract will also extend its growth strategy and offer additional operational plus financial benefits. It will help the company expand and optimize its retail pharmacy network in the key U.S. markets, including the Northeast. This partial consolidation with Rite Aid will help Walgreens gain a competitive edge.Besides, the companyâs new strategic pharmacy tie-ups and several recent programs including skin product launch and vaccination are encouraging. Earlier this year, the company partnered with communication service provider WPP to operate and develop multiple marketing and communications channels for its retail and wholesale businesses as well as its health and beauty product brands.Walgreens Boots also inked a multi-year partnership agreement with global express delivery service provider FedEx Corporation. The alliance is aimed at offering convenient access to FedEx drop-off and pickup services at several Walgreens Boots locations across the United States.In the last few years, a slowdown in generic introduction, increased reimbursement pressure and generic drug cost inflation have been hampering the companyâs margin significantly. Also, Walgreens Boots faces obstacles like increased competition and tough industry conditions. Even though the company continues to gain a decent market share from other traditional drug store retailers, major mass merchants namely Target and Wal-Mart are on track to expand their pharmacy businesses.Risks from other channels such as supermarkets and mail order operations also pose a threat. In addition, industry conditions remain challenging as insurers slash reimbursement rates and raise prescription co-payments. Plus, currency fluctuations, weak macroeconomic environment and delay of Walgreens Bootsâ long impending buyout of Rite Aid emerge as other headwinds.Key PicksSome of the better-ranked medical stocks are Align Technology, Inc. (ALGN  -  Free Report) and IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. (IDXX  -  Free Report). While Align Technology sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), IDEXX Laboratories carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can seeÂ the complete list of todayâs Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.IDEXX Laboratories has a long-term expected earnings growth rate of 19.8%. The stock has gained around 6.8% over the last six months.Lantheus Holdings has a long-term expected earnings growth rate of 12.5%. The stock has surged 70.4% over the last six months.Align Technology has a long-term expected earnings growth rate of 26.6%. The stock has rallied roughly 22.3% over the last three months.4 Surprising Tech Stocks to Keep an Eye onTech stocks have been a major force behind the marketâs record highs, but picking the best ones to buy can be tough.
