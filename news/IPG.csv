2,IPG,"If you're trying to build your earnings season watch list by looking for stocks setting up in a base ahead of their next earnings report, here's one that fits the bill: IBD 50 member Cognex (CGNX). It's expected to report on Feb. 15 and is currently about 15% under a 73.09 entry. The base is a third-stage consolidation, which is less likely than an earlier-stage base to generate a big new run.

5,IPG,"Futures for the S&P 500 index edged higher Tuesday morning. Several highly rated stocks cleared buy points on Monday as the major averages continued to rise in every trading session of 2018: Nvidia (NVDA), Universal Display (OLED), Arista Networks (ANET), IPG Photonics (IPGP) and Entergis (ENTG).X All five stocks have Composite Ratings of 95 or better: Nvidia and Entergis have 97 Composite Ratings, Universal Display a 98 CR while Arista Networks and IPG Photonics have a best-possible 99. All-time stock winners often have a CR of at least 95 near the start of their runs.But another crucial factor is the Relative Strength line, which tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index. You want to see a stock's RS line lead or at least confirm a breakout. Such breakouts are more likely to succeed because they highlight the true market leaders.But this is hard to find in the current steady, strong uptrend, when even top stocks become laggards when they pause for even short, proper bases. The upshot is that about the only way in the current environment for a stock's RS line to confirm a breakout is if the breakout surges beyond the buy point and the old high.S&P 500 index futures rose a fraction vs. fair value. Nasdaq 100 futures climbed 0.1%. Dow futures advanced 0.15%.IPG Photonics shot up 6.8% to 258.77, barely within range of the 248.33 buy point of a cup without handle base in volume that was 69% above normal. The fiber laser maker's RS line almost hit a new high on a daily chart, and did hit a new high on the weekly chart.Arista Networks, the other 99 Composite Rating stock, almost achieved this. The stock popped 6% to 251.03, hitting a new high in strong volume. As today's The Big Picture points out, Arista looked like a cup-with-handle base with a 241.60 entry, but was one week short of seven-week minimum. So it's classified as a cup-without-handle, with a 245.75 entry.That has implications for the RS line. Arista's RS line is now above where it was at the top of the psuedo-handle, but still has some ways to go to hit a new all-time high.Nvidia climbed  3.1% to 222 in solid volume on several CES-related autonomous driving deals, but did not blast past a 218.77 buy point. As a result, the RS line is still modestly below its old highs.Universal Display shot up 8.7% in more than double normal volume, rebounding from its 10-week moving average to 194.85, pushing it above a 192.85 entry, by about 1%. Like Nvidia, Universal Display's RS line was a little below its old high.The chip-equipment maker's stock rose 2% to 33.40, slightly past a 33.15 flat base. That wasn't enough for the RS line to confirm the move, which came on volume that was only 3% above normal.Investors should focus on breakouts with volume that's at least 40%-50% above normal.YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:This Chip Leader Broke Out As 4 Other Top Techs Hover Near BuysFive 2017 Stock Winners Have Carved Bases For New RunsArtificial Intelligence Software To Grow Nearly 30 Times By 2025These 3 Electric Vehicle Plays Are LIT: Action PlanThese Top China Stocks Rocket Into 2018 With Bases And BreakoutsThe Basics: How To Analyze A Stock's Cup With Handle

6,IPG,"""Avoiding behavioral risk"" is more than a Wall Street slogan to Vladimir ""Val"" de Vassal. It is a tactic he has raised to an art form as he aims to remove subjectivity from his hunt for top-performing growth stocks for two Glenmede mutual funds of which he's lead manager. Fueled in recent quarters by leading growth stocks like Apple (AAPL), Adobe Systems (ADBE) and Mastercard (MA), $4 billion Large Cap Growth (GTLLX) and $2.9 billion Large Cap Core (GTLOX) both outperformed the S&P 500 in calendar 2017 as well as over the three, five and 10 years ended Dec. 31.Only 10% of U.S. diversified stock funds with at least $100 million in assets racked up that four-way feat, which makes them winners of the 2018 IBD Best Mutual Funds Award.De Vassal and his team — including managers Paul Sullivan and Alex Attanasiu — have become adept at avoiding behavioral risk in their investment process. Instead, they focus on more than 80 objective yardsticks to measure each growth stock's worthiness. They wear blinders to block out less-meaningful information that can be distractions from data that mark growth stocks poised to advance. Emotions are a major part of behavioral risk, de Vassal says.De Vassal, age 58, talked with IBD about his strategy from his office in Philadelphia.Best Mutual Funds Monthly Performance ReportIBD: How do your growth-oriented mutual funds differ from rival growth funds?De Vassal: First, both funds use a similar process. The difference is the benchmark. For Core, it is the Russell 1000 Index. For Large Cap Growth, it is the Russell Growth. We control industry and sector exposures against those benchmarks.Our strategies are a blend of quantitative discipline based on underlying fundamental insights.IBD: How do you avoid letting emotions interfere with your hunt for growth stocks?De Vassal: We've built a library of factors, over 80, across the two strategies. In any sector, there are about 15 to 25 factors that we use to differentiate stocks. They're a combination of such things as valuation metrics, fundamental metrics and estimate revisions from sell-side analysts. We include some technical indicators as well.IBD: Give me examples of subjective metrics that you avoid.De Vassal: Subjective metrics that we do not use include the popularity of a company — its brand name — and nonquantifiable intangibles such as future products and profits that are not reflected in sell-side analyst earnings or revenue estimates. ... We want to remove behavioral risks that may have adverse effects on portfolio performance.IBD: Limiting downside risk plays a big role in your approach, right?De Vassal: We aim to win by avoiding negative earnings surprises and at the same time tilting more toward stocks that are more likely to have positive surprises.IBD: Basically, the difference between these two funds is that one focuses exclusively on growth stocks while Core Fund can own various types of stocks?De Vassal: In simplest terms, yes. And that means Large Cap Growth has much heavier concentration in technology stocks, for example.IBD: These funds are 2018 IBD Best Mutual Funds Award winners. What does it take to outperform so consistently?De Vassal: We have a very disciplined process. And both portfolios are well diversified. Performance isn't driven by being lucky or unlucky in one or two names. And we try to avoid losers, not just identify winners. We try to improve every year. This year we added two new stock selection factors. One is supply-chain data. The other is ESG (environomental, social and governance) momentum. We've been managing for some form of ESG strategy for over 15 years. We've found ESG momentum works better in some sectors, like consumer staples, consumer discretionary and technology, than in others.IBD: Do you see the iPhone as the key to Apple's future? Or do you see additional services like the App Store, Apple Music and Apple Pay, playing a bigger role?De Vassal: We look at fundamental metrics like return on invested capital. We look at valuation. We look at cash flow per employee. We look at sell-side analysts' earnings estimates, revenue estimates, cash flow estimates. We ask ourselves whether new products and services are causing analysts to increase their estimates. (A sell-side analyst works for an outside firm, not the fund.)We don't have a fundamental analyst kicking the tires on Apple. We look at what's happened in the past. Which (outside) analysts have been the most accurate, looking back nine quarters? Then we look at what they have to say.IBD: Avoiding emotion in your decisions is a key part of your search for growth stocks. What's an example of that?De Vassal: Growth Fund started its stake in Adobe Systems in October. The stock was attractively valued. Later that month they gave (positive) guidance and the stock shot up. We sold in November with a gain over 18%. When a stock moves, we're out because it's no longer attractive.IBD: Mastercard earnings per share growth has accelerated for three quarters. What's your view going forward?De Vassal: We bought it in June 2016. It's done well. It's a holding. We're comfortable with it. But it's not a position we would add to.IBD: You've got Visa (V) as well. Do you like it better?De Vassal: At this point, Visa looks a little more attractive. Mastercard outperformed over the past 12 months, so its valuation is up. Visa's is better. Visa is still a buy for us.IBD: IPG Photonics (IPGP) is another newcomer to Growth Fund. Do you still like it?De Vassal: We started this in August 2017. The valuation was reasonable. Cash flow yield was around 2.4%. Not that strong. But fundamentals were good. Revisions were fairly positive. Price momentum was fairly good. We think revisions are more likely to have positive surprises than negative surprises.IBD: You more than doubled your share count in TD Ameritrade (AMTD) recently. Why?De Vassal: It was September 2017 when we doubled. Its dividend yield was reasonable, and so were its profitability metrics. Analysts were raising their earnings and revenue estimates. It got good (share) price momentum. We've done well with it.IBD: Brick and mortar retailers aren't very popular these days. But you've got discounter Ross Stores (ROST). Why?De Vassal: We still consider it a buy. We've been underweight in consumer discretionary. But we're getting more neutral. Part of the reason is rebalancing the portfolio in industry groups. Looking at Ross' metrics, it's got a healthy combination of valuation, fundamentals and sell-side earnings revisions.IBD: Citrix Systems (CTXS) is in Core Fund. What's driving the speed up in its quarterly EPS growth?De Vassal: It has good profitability metrics. And we've seen more analysts covering the stock, which could lead to increased investors interest.IBD: What's driving the uptrend in CBRE Group (CBRE), which provides property management, loan servicing and origination services?De Vassal: This is one of the best ranked REITs based on our proprietary stock-ranking screens. In terms of metrics, we look at EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) and we look at the consistency of its risk-adjusted growth. Analysts are raising their estimates consistently.IBD: You've trimmed your exposure to Nvidia (NVDA). Does that mean you don't like it as much anymore?De Vassal: We cap a stock's maximum weighting at 2% of Core Fund and 3% of Growth. In contrast, benchmarks are too top heavy. They have too much exposure to the top names.We initially pursued Nvidia in Core in May 2016. The stock had an attractive valuation and improving fundamentals and estimate revisions. Its share price gained a lot, and it bumped our 2% limit so we had to trim it. It has continued up. It's no longer cheap, and it's not a position we would add to.IBD: What has driven the uptrend by F5 Networks (FFIV), which makes data center computing gear?De Vassal: Its valuation isn't cheap, but it's reasonable. Its fundamentals have been strong. Its return on invested capital and cash flow per employee have been favorable vs. its peers. It's got increased coverage from sell-side analysts. So there's a stronger likelihood for positive earnings surprises than some of its peers have.YOU MAY ALSO LIKE:Growth Stocks In Tech And Health Care: Fund Managers Like Their OutlookSee Which Stock The Best Mutual Funds Have Been BuyingU.S. Treasuries Led Bond Funds Higher As 10-Year Yield Tumbled To 2.8%You Need This Much Retirement Savings At Your Age And IncomeFour Ways You Can Cut Spending In Retirement — With Little Lifestyle Sacrifice

Generic drugmakers rallied 2.5% as a group, while ethical drug stocks bounded up 2.4%, drugstores were up 1.7%, managed care up 1.6%, and wholesale drug supply up 1.4%.Meanwhile, the major equity indexes played small ball throughout most of Friday's session.

The S&P 500 lifted 2.4%.  Apple (AAPL) also posted a second straight weekly gain.The iPhone giant halted a nine-session winning streak, but still closed the bullish week up more than 2% at 188.59.

Up three straight sessions, the stock is now extended 14% past a 49.85 correct buy point within a seven-month cuplike base.In that base, Supernus formed a roughly two-week downward slanting handle in lighter trade. This handle on the base represents the final shakeout of weak holders before this week's huge breakout.

14,IPG,"Many of the same exchange traded funds that performed best last year continue leading the broader market so far this year. But will that continue?XProspects on Wall Street for the new year likely depend largely on the effect of the tax overhaul and potentially higher interest rates. About three rate hikes both this year and next year are ""appropriate,"" Cleveland Federal Reserve Bank President Loretta Mester said Thursday. That's a slightly faster pace than some Fed officials prefer.Speaking of the Fed, unless Senate Democrats agree to a temporary bridge measure, a government shutdown was poised to go into effect at midnight Friday.List Of Top Performing ETFsARK Invest CEO Catherine Wood On Bitcoin, Tech StocksTop ETF Picks For 2018The U.S. tax overhaul will likely boost the U.S. economy, which is already running at full capacity, says Richard Turnill, BlackRock's Global Chief Investment Strategist. Lower taxes and capital spending incentives could lead to more consumer and business spending.""The overhaul of the U.S. tax code includes supply-side reforms and injects significant near-term demand stimulus into a U.S. economy running at near-full employment,"" he noted in a recent commentary. ""A faster-growing U.S. may accelerate global growth, and result in rising inflation, higher Treasury yields and steeper yield curves.""Overall, he sees strong earnings momentum at home as we head into 2018. He likes financial, technology and dividend-growing stocks.Let's take a look at how last year's winners are doing. Note that since we're only a few weeks into the new year, the ETFs were ranked by 2017 performance, instead of the year to date. So the year-to-date returns are more telling, for now.Last year's U.S. diversified stock winners continued to outperform the past month. The top ETF, iShares Edge MSCI USA Momentum Factor (MTUM), returned 6.3% YTD. Innovator IBD 50 (FFTY), which came in second in 2017, was close behind with a 6% gain.A pair of ARK Invest funds, ARK Innovation (ARKK) and ARK Web x.0 (ARKW) topped the sector funds category last year with gains of 87.3% each, according to Morningstar Direct. They've also continued to outperform the broader market. As of Jan. 17, ARKK and ARKW posted YTD returns of 7.2% and 6.1%, respectively, vs. the S&P 500's 4.9%.They were the first ETFs with significant exposure to Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC), which made their top 10 holdings last year. The investment trust, which has suffered some steep declines this year, is no longer among the funds' biggest names. ARKK's top five include Tesla (TSLA), Stratasys (SSYS)and Juno Therapeutics (JUNO). ARKW's top 10 holdings include Amazon (AMZN), Twitter (TWTR) and Nvidia (NVDA).Global X Robotics & Artificial Intelligence (BOTZ), which placed sixth last year, boasts the biggest YTD return of 12.3% through Jan. 16. The $2.2 billion fund, which tracks the INDXX Global Robotics & Artificial Intelligence Thematic Index, targets companies involved with industrial robotics and automation, nonindustrial robots and autonomous vehicles.Japan accounted for over 51% of BOTZ's assets in the Greater Asia region, while North America made up 28% and Greater Europe, about 16%. BOTZ's biggest holdings were Japan's Yaskawa Electric, Fanuc and Keyence, as well as U.S. graphics chip designer and AI player Nvidia, and Intuitive Surgical (ISRG), which makes the da Vinci surgical robot.Another robotics-focused ETF, Robo Global Robotics & Automation (ROBO), has returned 8.7% this year. The $2.3 billion fund has greater exposure to North America, at nearly 43%. Greater Asia represented 36% (27% from Japan) and Greater Europe made up the rest. Its top holdings include Roomba maker IRobot (IRBT), laser company IPG Photonics (IPGP), Yaskawa and Fanuc.Over in the foreign stock arena, KraneShares CSI China Internet (KWEB) saw the biggest YTD gain, 8.8%. It scored the second-best performance in the category last year with a 69.7% return. Last year's No. 3 fund, EMQQ Emerging Markets Internet & Ecommerce (EMQQ), is close behind with a 7.1% gain this year.RELATED:Alternative ETFs Can Help Hedge Your Portfolio Against Market RiskMoney Manager Plays Offense And Defense, Favors These 3 Sectors

16,IPG,"Futures for the S&P 500 index rose slightly early Monday morning. Several top-rated stocks that were notable winners in 2017 are moving toward fresh buy points. Wal-Mart Stores (WMT), Tencent Holdings (TCEHY), UnitedHealth Group (UNH), IPG Photonics (IPGP) and Arista Networks (ANET) are five stocks that have formed bases recently and are approaching entries.XWal-Mart Stores and UnitedHealth are both Dow industrial components, each doubling the S&P 500's performance in 2017.  The latter three all more than doubled last year. Tencent Holdings is one of a slew of top-rated Chinese stocks near buy points. Laser maker IPG Photonics is on IBD's Rising Profit Estimates list while Arista Networks is an IBD 50 member.S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures rose less than 0.1% vs. fair value. Dow futures were up 0.2%.Wal-Mart Stores has been trading in a narrow range since hitting 100.13 on Nov. 17, a day after gapping up 11% on third-quarter earnings. Shares have trended up slightly for the past four weeks, rising as high as 100.38 on Friday, just exceeding a 100.23 flat-base buy point, before settling to close at 100.13.As Wal-Mart has consolidated, the Relative Strength line has drifted lower, reflecting the S&P 500 index's modest outperformance over that time. But the RS line did rise modestly for most of last year, as booming online sales and other steps convinced investors that Wal-Mart would be a survivor in the age of Amazon (AMZN) and even pose real challenges to the e-commerce giant.Wal-Mart rose 43% in 2017 vs. the S&P 500's 19% advance.Ideally, Wal-Mart would blast past its buy point in heavy volume, pushing the RS line to confirm the breakout and signal institutional support.Tencent Holdings is a Chinese messaging and online gaming giant, operating the uber-app WeChat. Tencent is the archrival of Alibaba (BABA) and owns a stake in JD.com (JD) and several other notable Chinese companies, as well as Tesla (TSLA).Tencent shares shot up 114% last year. Not surprisingly, the RS line climbing steadily during the year, reaching a recent peak on Nov. 21, when Tencent hit a record 56.05.  Shares fell sharply to the 50-day line but found support and quickly rebounded.Tencent rose 7.6% last week, far outpacing the S&P 500 and Nasdaq, closing at 55.87 and finishing a 6-week cup base.UnitedHealth has just carved out a short flat base with a 231.87 buy point. Shares rose 3.75% last week to 228.73, setting a record close on Friday.The stock's RS line gradually rose from late February to the end of November. UnitedHealth's RS line is moving closer to that old high.IPG Photonics has just completed a cup-base pattern going back the minimum six weeks, giving it a 248.33 buy point. IPG Photonics tumbled from record highs in late November and early December. Shares then began to rebound, but for the rest of 2017 held below the still-rising 50-day line. IPG retook its 50-day line on Tuesday and then kept rising, surging 13% for the week to 242.34.IPG Photonics' RS line advanced in 2017, especially from July to late November. IPG shares leapt 117%Arista Networks was a huge 2017 winners, sprinting 143%.The stock is now in a cup-with-handle base with a 241.60 buy point. Handles offer a chance to shake out weak holders before the stock blasts out of a base. But the handle largely formed as the rest of the market had big gains, pushing the RS line lower last week despite a fractional stock gain. Ideally, the RS line should confirm at least a short-term high, like a handle, on a breakout. That might be challenging for Arista, unless it advances while the market pauses.Arista Networks closed Friday at 236.77.YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:These 5 Top Techs Are Near Buys — Now Study The ChartsAdobe, PayPal Lead 5 Stocks Near Buy Points With Rising Earnings EstimatesThe Top 16 China Stocks Surge, In A Fast-Moving Start To 2018Bitcoin, Blockchain And Private Industry: You Ain't Seen Nothing YetDepartment Stores, Malls In 2018: Amazon Will Let You Live — For Now

18,IPG,"First Trust Technology AlphaDEX (FXL) got rich in 2017 as technology shares enjoyed sustained demand. A hot start this year for the sector has investors hoping for more.X The exchange traded fund surged nearly 36% last year, a fairly typical return for a domestic tech-based ETF. Shares climbed for 11 straight weeks last autumn, an unusual run that reflected the superb strength in chips and other tech stocks.In the first week of this year, the ETF topped a 63.72 buy point from a flat base and remains in buy range. But can the ETF stretch its gains? Its five-week consolidation sets the stage for a possible new advance. Of course, the longer a stock or ETF rallies, the lower the chance that gains will be prolific.The sector's outlook remains positive, which gives the fund some potential fuel. Fourth-quarter earnings are expected to be strong.The S&P Information Technology sector is expected to report the third-highest earnings growth of all 11 S&P sectors in Q4, a 15.9% increase, according to FactSet Senior Earnings Analyst John Butters. ""One factor driving the increase is the unusually high number of companies in this sector issuing positive revenue guidance."" Overall, 27 tech companies have issued positive revenue guidance for Q4, well above the five-year average of 16 for the sector.First Trust Technology AlphaDEX is mainly concentrated in semiconductors (about 28% of the portfolio) and software (24%). Nearly 80 stocks are in the fund, with a median market cap of $15.6 billion as of year-end. The portfolio's price-to-earnings ratio is nearly 24, reflecting the rich valuations in the sector.The ETF tracks the StrataQuant Technology Index, which uses a lot of number crunching to ranks stocks in the Russell 1000 on growth factors such as price appreciation over various periods, sales growth, cash flow to price and other data. Weightings of each stock range from 0.4% to 2.75%.Some of the ETF's top performing stocks are the same brands that helped make 2017 a huge year for the tech sector.IPG Photonics (IPGP), the maker of medical and industrial lasers, more than doubled from a breakout in April at 124.37. From a breakout in February, Universal Display (OLED) about tripled. The company makes sharper display technology for smartphones and other devices.Arista Networks (ANET) has tripled from a breakout in November 2016. Nvidia (NVDA) — which has expanded from video chips to self-driving cars and other areas — has climbed about 85% from its breakout to new highs in May.Over the long term, the ETF has been a productive investment. As of year-end it has produced average annual returns of nearly 20% the past five years and about 10% the past 10 years, according to the First Trust website.The IBD ETF Leaders index shows the performance of a model portfolio of exchange traded funds that are leading the overall market.

Novanta now trading 3% below the 60.40 buy point from a fourth-stage cup without handle that it cleared earlier.X Keep in mind that jumping into a stock right as it gets ready to report means you likely won't have enough time to build a profit cushion before the release.

25,IPG,"Major indexes continued to stage a healthy rebound, breakouts gained more steam, and a key Bitcoin-driven ETF showed more signs that a longer-term correction in the alternative digital currency may be in the works.X Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC), which staged a tremendous price run of more than 1,500% in 2017, plunged as much as 18.3% intraday before shaving a majority of those losses.Yet shares in the Bitcoin-tracking exchange-traded note still dropped more than 7% to 1,607 and severely undercut the critical 50-day moving average for the first time since peaking at 3,522 in December. Bitcoin Investment had broken out on Nov. 22 from a large, deep cup with handle at 958.10 and gained more than 250% before topping. Concerns of South Korea mulling a move to ban cryptocurrency trading are apparently still weighing on traders.At 2:45 p.m. ET, the Nasdaq composite, the leading major index in 2017 with a 28.2% gain, rose nearly 1.1%, while the S&P 500 practically matched that advance. The Dow Jones industrial average spurted 1.1% higher, helped by gains of 1 point or more in at least 12 of the 30 components.Longtime Dow Jones industrial component IBM (IBM) staged a bullish gap up as shares rose more than 2% to 168.59 in volume running double its 50-day average. The stock has also risen past a 162.61 buy point in a first-stage saucer with handle.This base is part of a long bottoming base process. The buy zone goes up to 170.74.Optimism is rising among analysts that Big Blue will finally break its multiyear slump in revenues. Q4 profit, meanwhile, is expected to inch up 3% to $5.16 a share, which would be the biggest increase in four quarters.IBM drums up a terrible Composite Rating of 42 on a scale of 1 to 99 in IBD Stock Checkup, but low Composite and other scores are typical for companies that have been lagging for years but are aiming at a real turnaround. On the positive side, a B- Accumulation/Distribution Rating points to net buying among fund managers in IBM over the past 13 weeks.Buying only those stocks that show an Accumulation Rating of C+ or higher generally increases the odds of making money when buying a stock at the proper entry point.The Dow Jones industrial average rallied 25.1% in 2017.The Dow transports edged up 0.3%; the Russell 2000 was up almost 0.6%. Volume is running mildly lower on both exchanges following a distribution day, or session of unusually intense institutional selling, on both the Nasdaq and the S&P 500.Top-ranking stocks as seen in IBD's key stockpicking screens mostly thrived, with several hailing from the semiconductor and related sectors. Electronics-Semiconductor Equipment ranks first among 197 industry groups tracked by IBD with a 3.5% lift. Homebuilding, computer networking, leisure products and oil drilling stocks also led the upside with gains of 2% each.Universal Display (OLED), No. 1 in the IBD 50, moved out of buy range as shares rolled nearly 3% higher to 204 in volume running more than 25% above normal levels.The expert in organic light emitting diodes for a range of electronic devices broke out past a 192.85 entry in a six-week cup without handle on Jan. 8 and has acted well since then. The 5% buy zone goes up to 202.49.Universal Display has sported four quarters in a row of excellent top and bottom-line growth. The Ewing, N.J., firm earned 28 cents a share in the third quarter vs. a 3-cent loss a year earlier. That followed EPS increases of 41%, 450% and 115%.No wonder, then, that Universal Display gets a top-notch 99 Earnings Per Share Rating from IBD, which means that the company's profit growth over the past three to five years and in recent quarters is superior to 99% of all companies in IBD's database.The Street expects earnings in Q4 to rise 53% to 84 cents a share on a 33% jump in revenue to $99.3 million. In Q1 of this year, Universal Display is seen growing earnings 41% to 31 cents a share and revenue up 20% to $66.9 million.Universal Display is ranked No. 1 in the IBD 50 and has a relatively small float of 41 million shares out of 47 million shares outstanding. A small float is bullish for growth stock investors, as it helps constrain supply of shares, one of tenets of IBD's CAN SLIM seven-point selection system for outstanding stocks. Plus, it takes fresh demand from only a few institutional investors, including hedge funds, pensions, banks and sovereign wealth funds, amid a limited supply of shares readily available for sale, to send a stock into breakout mode and into new highs.Universal Display is now a mid-cap stock with a value of $9.6 billion. Mutual funds and hedge funds owning shares in the stock have climbed from a combined 344 funds at the end of 2016 to 416 at the end of last year.Laser maker Coherent (COHR) (breakout at 320.83), scientific instruments maker IPG Photonics (IPGP) (cleared a cup at 248.33), semiconductor lithography systems expert ASML (ASML) (186.47 buy point in a solid flat base) have also broken out and shown positive action.Lam Research (LRCX), a huge winner since 2015, is building a base. Watch to see if shares can remain above the key 50-day moving average. If it does, it would boost the chances that the wafer cleaning and etching systems supplier can continue to flesh out the right side of a potential new base.Lam had cleared a 170.10 entry in a good flat base on Sept. 11 and rallied 29% before correcting in price. One of IBD's key sell rules is to take at least partial gains when a stock breaks out and advances at least 20% to 25% from the proper entry.Going back to Bitcoin Investment Trust, IBD noted in a prior Stock Market Today column how a definitive cross below the 10-day moving average offers a good exit point for short-term traders. Bitcoin Investment Trust violated its 10-day line on Dec. 20, just two days after it posted a closing peak of 3,463.Given the climax-run-style move that it made in mid-December, following strong gains earlier in the year, it's sensible to expect that it will take weeks, if not months, for the ETF to set up another proper buy point.Bitcoin, itself, took years to digest strong gains after it broke out in October 2013 and ran up from a breakout near 120 to a peak of 1,087 just two months later, an 800% gain in just two months. It took more than three years of basing before Bitcoin eclipsed that high.(Follow Saito-Chung on Twitter at @IBD_DChung for additional commentary on breakouts, growth stocks, and other financial markets.)RELATED:How To Trade Stocks: Do You Know This Critical Chart-Reading Skill?How To Invest With Success: The Latest In Investor's CornerStocks Near A Buy ZoneWhen To Sell Stocks: What Does A Climax Run Look Like?How To Find Excellent Growth Stocks: Start With A Simple Routine

Meanwhile, quarterly revenue growth was accelerating from 38% to 46% to 48%.According to Stifel Nicolaus, China demand trends remain robust for high-power fiber lasers, which should continue to benefit IPG Photonics. The analyst firm believes that IPG has a unique competitive position based on automation.

GE shares met resistance at the 50-day moving average, which may worsen an already steep downtrend.The small-cap Russell 2000 rose 0.2%.Volume was lower on the NYSE and higher on the Nasdaq, according to early figures. Winners led losers by a 7-to-5 ratio on the NYSE and were even on the Nasdaq.Despite the sleepy market, more than two dozen stocks broke out past buy points in today's market. Among the most notable:Weight Watchers (WTW) leapt past the 52.17 buy point of a cup with handle in heavy volume. After a potent rally from a breakout last February, shares of the weight-loss company had been rangebound since mid-August. Monday's breakout increases the chances for a new advance.The stock surged after Sunday night's Golden Globes entertainment awards, where a speech by Oprah Winfrey got a lot of media attention and rekindled rumors she may run for president.

Sales growth ranged from 13% to 19% and has been trending higher.IPG Photonics (IPGP) surged past the 248.33 buy point of  a cup without handle in heavy trading.

43,IPG,"Tesla (TSLA) helped push the Nasdaq composite into higher ground after a fantastic start to the new year last week. Meanwhile, a top Bitcoin play cut initial losses and continues to begin what may eventually become a new base pattern.XTesla scored its biggest single-session gain in months, rising 19.22, or more than 6%, to 335.80 in volume running more than 50% higher than normal. The rebound was strong enough to hoist the electric vehicle innovator back above two important technical levels: the 50- day moving average (near 317) and the still-rising long-term 200-day moving average (currently at 332).At 3:45 p.m. ET, the Nasdaq composite gained roughly 0.3% while the S&P 500 was up less than 0.2%. Last week the Nasdaq powered 3.4% higher for the week, its biggest weekly gain since a 3.8% surge during the week of the pivotal U.S. elections in November 2016.The Dow Jones industrial average inched barely higher. Volume is running virtually unchanged vs. the same time on Friday on both exchanges.The S&P SmallCap 600 kept apace, rising nearly 0.2%.Despite a strong gain for Tesla, it should not be bought now if you are following IBD's system for selecting and buying stocks 100%. The simple reason: It has yet to truly break out. The stock needs more time and work to fashion the right side of an emerging new base.Other stocks that broke out today include trucking play Forward Air (FWRD) (cup with handle showing a 58.90 buy point), sleep disorders treatment specialist ResMed (RMD) (flat base, 87.91 entry), fiber optics gear expert IPG Photonics (IPGP) (six-week cup, 248.33) and longtime Sector Leader Arista Networks (ANET) (245.75 in an odd shaped cup).Forward Air is part of the leading Transport-Truck group, which has been in the top 20 among 197 IBD industry groups for months in terms of six-month relative price performance. A strong leading stock market leader tends to be part of a top-performing industry group or sector.The Greenville, Tenn., firm has grown profits at a slow yet steady pace after a tiny dip in 2013. Earnings fell 5% in the fourth quarter of 2016, then grew 9%, 12% and 14% the next three quarters. The Street sees earnings lifting 7% to 62 cents a share for a full-year gain of 12% to $2.32 a share.2018 profit is seen rising another 13% to $2.62 a share.The Dow transportation average is leading the major indexes on Monday, rolling ahead 0.6%.Tesla has certainly grown into a big cap within the Automakers industry group. Yet with a market cap of $56 billion, it still isn't one of the largest companies on the Nasdaq. You can see the tickers of the 30-some largest companies by market value at the top of the Nasdaq chart on the large ""General Market Indicators"" page, accessible via the Market Trend section of Investors.com, or via The Big Picture.Tesla surged from its initial breakout near 40 in the first week of April 2013 as the company proved it can turn a profit. The stock galloped more than 625% to a high of 291.42 by September 2014, then jumped out of a new base on base pattern at 287.49 during the week ended April 7 last year.That breakout, essentially from a first-stage base given how long the stock took to digest its first huge advance, produced a solid return of 34.6% before Tesla peaked at 386.99 in June. Since then, the stock has been in basing mode.In September, Tesla attempted a new breakout past 370.10 in a somewhat wide and loose cup with handle. Wide and loose action is a clear flaw. You want to see controlled, relatively tight action as a stock declines significantly, bottoms out, then builds the right side of a new base.Given that in November, Tesla dropped below the low of 303.12 in the prior cup with handle, one could argue that the company is now forming a new first-stage base. Early-stage bases tend to have higher rates of success than late-stage ones.The company is forecast to loss $3 a share in the fourth quarter as it invests heavily in production capacity for the Model 3 entry level all-electric sedan and other new products.According to IBD Stock Checkup, the Palo Alto, Calif., firm gets an awful 36 Composite Rating on a scale of 1 to 99, but that mostly has to do with a tamped down EPS Rating of 22, caused by net losses in 11 of the past 12 quarters. However, the bright spot in Tesla's proprietary ratings can be found in its Accumulation/Distribution Rating, which is a positive B- on a grade scale of A (heavy institutional buying on net) to E (huge selling).The Accumulation/Distribution Rating tracks price-and-volume action over the past 13 weeks and serves as a good indicator when deciding which stocks to buy. In general, prefer those stocks with an Accumulation Grade of C+ or higher. Sometimes, a terrific winner will break out with a lowly Accumulation grade, caused by a few instances of sharp declines in steep turnover. In such situations, look closely at the daily chart of the stock; it may have bounced off the lows during a big sell-off, and that can be bullish.Also, the Stock Checkup shows the up/down volume ratio, which tracks price and volume over the past 50 sessions. If this ratio is 0.9 or higher, that can offset a poor Accumulation rating.Elsewhere in the stock market today, Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC), a huge winner in the fourth quarter of 2017, shaved losses to 5% at 2,220 in bone-dry turnover.The ETF is still in early basing mode. As noted in a prior Stock Market Today column, the Bitcoin play will need more time to build a new base and stage a breakout in the way that it did on Nov. 22, when it hauled out of a deep cup with handle at 985.10.RELATED:IBD's The Big Picture: What The Current Rally Says About This Bull RunStock Market Today: When To Buy This Hot Bitcoin ETFDo You Know How To Spot The Next Major Market Top?

One reason tech leaders — including FANG stocks Facebook (FB), Amazon.com (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) — are getting hit is that fund managers are raising cash to buy financials, says BMO Capital Markets.From a macroeconomic perspective, JPMorgan says that higher bond yields are another factor in a market rotation out of growth stocks such as technology and into financials.There's also the nitty-gritty of tax reform. The Senate's version, passed late Friday, would cut the U.S. corporate rate from 35% to 20%; limit interest deductibility to 30% of EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization); and lower the tax on repatriated overseas cash to 14% from the current full 35%.It also will allow the immediate expensing of capital spending over the next five years, which was helping telecom and cable companies on Monday. Comcast (CMCSA) surged 4.9% to close at 40.32, AT&T (T) was up 2.1% to finish at 37.27, and Verizon Communications (VZ) gained 0.9% to end the day at 51.72.The trouble for tech companies, though, is that they hold the most cash overseas, and the Senate's proposed 14% tax rate on such earnings is higher than expected. President Trump had proposed a one-time tax of 10% on offshore earnings, while the House has proposed an 8.5% rate.Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Google, Cisco Systems (CSCO) and Oracle (ORCL) are among companies with the most overseas cash.IBD'S TAKE: Read IBD's The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.While tech companies may bring back some cash if Congress passes tax reform, the legislation disallows some accounting measures by multinational companies. Another concern for tech companies is what happens with the research-and-development tax credits many companies use.Many biotech, pharma and manufacturing companies benefit from a research-and-development credit under which firms recoup some of the costs for spending on innovation, according to the Wall Street Journal. This is often for the wages of scientists and engineers.The GOP tax plan could hurt the R&D tax credit in lieu of retaining the corporate alternative minimum tax, a provision that was initially expected to go by the wayside in the plan. Companies worked over the weekend to change congressional opinion on the tax ahead of the late-hour Senate vote.Amazon was down 2.4% to close at 1,133.95 on the stock market today, Netflix fell 1.5% to finish at 184.04, Facebook slid 2.1 to end at 171.47, and Google dropped 1.3% to 1,011.87. Apple was up a fraction to 169.80.Among stocks in the IBD 50, IPG Photonics (IPGP) plunged by more than 10% to 200.80, Cognex (CGNX) dropped 8.6% to 63.31, and PayPal (PYPL) fell 8.6% to 70.97. Adobe Systems (ADBE) stumbled by 6.2% to finish at 168.44, Nvidia (NVDA) fell 5.6% to close at 186.66, and Alibaba Holdings (BABA) lost 2.9% to 169.58.The Nasdaq dropped 1.1% to close at 6,775.37.RELATED:Bitcoin Futures Trading To Start Even Sooner; These Brokers Are ReadyBank Stocks Rise As Senators Add These Last-Minute Perks To Tax BillThese 3 Dow Stocks Have Entered Buy ZonesHow The Senate And House Tax Bills Would Affect You
"
72,IPG,"Wall Street saw some rotation out of outperforming technology stocks and some money going into other sectors, particularly finance and banking. Transportation and select retail stocks also gained ground.XThe Dow Jones industrial average paced the upside among major indexes, up around 0.4% as nine of the 30 Dow Jones industrial components rallied 1 point or more. American Express (AXP), Goldman Sachs (GS), Home Depot (HD) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) led the Dow's upside amid a gentle uptick in long-term interest rates.The yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond moved up to 2.38%, a two-week high.The broad-based advance offset a 4.51-point drop by fellow Dow 30 stock Apple (AAPL).The iPhone, iPad and digital services giant is still up from a breakout at 160.97 in a cup-with-handle base. The stock is now back in buy range, but it's preferable to see if Apple can dust itself off after Wednesday's steep fall and rally before considering a new buy.At 3:45 p.m. ET, the S&P 500 was off less than 0.1%. The Nasdaq composite fell 1.4% but remains close to its all-time high of 6914.Among the leading industry groups, department store chain, auto parts retailing, airline transport, hospital, home furnishings and medical services stocks all rallied hard, up 2% or more. (See the day-to-day performance of all 197 industry groups tracked by IBD by going to Data Tables in ""Stock Lists"" at Investors.com.)The Bitcoin-tracking Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC) ETF suffered a negative reversal, rising to as high as 1,823.99 before sliding nearly 4% to 1,414. Volume is running nearly quadruple the normal pace.Despite the drop, Bitcoin Investment Trust is still sharply extended from last week's breakout past a 985.10 buy point in an unusually deep cup with handle.Meanwhile, a bunch of names in the IBD 50, which through Tuesday's close was up more than 39% since Jan. 1 vs. a 17.3% lift for the S&P 500, sold off hard. Many of  the 50 top-rated companies saw losses of 5% or more, including YY Inc. (YY), IPG Photonics (IPGP) and Ichor (ICHR). Yet among these three, only IPG Photonics has issued an IBD-style sell signal.IPG lost as much as 8.7% to a session low of 220.47 before shaving some of those losses. Watch to see how the industrial laser maker closes; the biggest single-session point loss in heavy turnover since the breakout is one key defense-type sell signal.However, as seen in a daily chart, the midcap still holds a decent air pocket above the rising 50-day moving average. So holders with large gains can of course lock in some profits, but they can also see if the stock generates a new high-quality base, which could potentially set up a new breakout.While IPG is showing the type of action that may signal a change in character and good reason to lighten one's exposure, it's still unclear whether the general rally in tech stocks is done or simply taking a well-needed pause.The chip sector certainly got pounded on Wednesday. The Philadelphia semiconductor index at one point fell more than 4%. Applied Materials (AMAT) and Lam Research (LRCX), both part of the IBD Big Cap 20, got pummeled as well.As seen in their daily charts, both of these large-cap leaders in semiconductor equipment have now undercut their respective 50-day moving averages. That alone is not a sell signal, however, as great stocks can recover and eventually move back above the key medium-term support line.In these situations, it's good to examine the weekly action and watch how a leading stock ends on Friday. If stocks such as Applied and Lam can bounce off their weekly lows and finish high in the range, it's a telltale clue that institutional appetite for growth stocks is still healthy.The 50-day moving average for Lam is currently near 197.85; the 50-day line is painted in red on an IBD daily chart. The 10-week moving average, found only on a weekly chart, is also painted in red.Another reason to keep holding tech stocks: Earnings are strong and revenue is likely to keep increasing in the current quarter. Plus, some observers are noting stable economic growth in the EU despite controversy over Brexit and problems for Germany to create a new coalition government. In the U.S., GDP growth is accelerating.A third reason: IBD's current outlook for the market, for now, remains ""Confirmed uptrend."" In recent days, the distribution-day count on the Nasdaq has declined, meaning that pronounced institutional selling has abated.Wednesday's sell-off, however, is a sign of heavy profit-taking amid concern over the fate of the tax-reform package proposed by Congress, which could get a final vote in the Senate later this week. Also, the Federal Reserve's Beige Book, released in the afternoon, pointed out that ""price pressures have strengthened."" This could give the U.S. central bank more conviction to raise the cost of money sooner than later.A quarter-point hike in the fed funds rate to a target range of 1.25%-1.5% is all but assured when the Fed meets on Dec. 12-13.RELATED:Broad Sell-Off Hits Tech, Investors Rotate To Banks, Value StocksBitcoin Crashes Below $10,000 After Spike Above $11,000Do You Know How To Employ This Key Defense-Type Sell Signal?Can You Spot Major Market Tops?

You can also use an options strategy to limit your potential downside.Looking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch? Start HereThe company posted 214% earnings growth in its most recent report, while sales growth came in at 112%.

81,IPG,"With the S&P 500 index, Nasdaq composite and Dow industrials suffering their worst weekly losses in two years, it's not surprising that top-rated growth stocks retreated. Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX), Apple (AAPL) supplier Qorvo (QRVO), Atlassian (TEAM), IPG Photonics (IPGP), Paylocity (PCTY) and Cypress Semiconductor (CY) all broke out recently, but in the past week or so have slipped modestly below buy points.X These stocks are worth keeping on watch lists, in case they retake their buy points, preferably with robust price gains and in strong volume. Keep in mind that the market uptrend is under pressure. Investors should be cautious about new purchases, quick to cut losses and may want to consider taking some profits in winning stocks.But with futures selling off hard once again, it's likely that many of these stock futures will come under further pressure at the open.Vertex Pharmaceuticals cleared a 167.95 buy point in late January, closing above that level on Jan. 26, but in below-average volume. Shares of the biotech dipped just below the entry. They retook the buy point on Feb. 1 with a 3.7% jump in strong volume. That followed strong earnings and Vertex choosing two cystic fibrosis treatments for late-stage testing. But the stock fell 3.9% to 166.24 in Friday's market sell-off.Vertex fell 1.1% to 164.45 in morning trade on the stock market today.Vertex's relative strength line, which tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index, has been lagging. (The RS line is the blue line in the charts below.) The lagging RS line reflects the stock's sideways action during its seven-month shallow consolidation, while the S&P 500 and the broader market rallied strongly.Vertex is a member of Leaderboard, IBD's premium service offering annotated charts of a handful of stocks, mostly growth names in or near buy zones.Chipmaker Qorvo gets an estimated 34% of its revenue from Apple. That may rise further thanks to a big new contract win for the Apple iPhone announced last week.Qorvo's stock had been trending lower since early November and its RS line had fallen to a 52-week low as of late last month. But Qorvo shot up 16% on Thursday to 83.34 on the Apple iPhone wind, vaulting above an 81.30 cup-without-handle base buy point. That capped a 26% rally over five sessions.On Friday, shares retreated 3.1% to 80.77, after Apple itself plunged 4.3% on weak iPhone sales and guiding low on current-quarter revenue. Other Apple chipmakers also sold off.Qorvo shares were down 0.1% in morning trade while Apple rose modestly from a 200-day test.Qorvo's RS line is well off the highs of its recent consolidation and late May's peak, but did shoot up last week with the stock and jump above a short-term high.IBD'S TAKE: While some recent breakouts are struggling, others have weathered the recent market retreat. Facebook leads five top stocks holding in buy zones.Atlassian, which makes collaboration software for businesses, cleared a 53.55 buy point on Jan. 16, closing above that level on Jan. 17 and rising as high as 55.91 on Jan. 18, with all three sessions in strong volume. After the Jan. 18 closing bell, Atlassian gave weak earnings guidance after topping fiscal second-quarter estimates.Shares fell 4.55% to 53.07 on Jan. 19, back below the entry. Since then shares have been hovering just above below the buy point. On Friday, shares fell 1% to 52.72 in light volume.Atlassian shares fell 2.3% to 51.53 in morning trade Monday.The RS line is lagging, but not much. A strong retaking of the buy point could not only claim a short-term high but also approach the November peaks.IPG Photonics shot up 6.8% to 258.84 on Jan. 8, part of a 21% surge to start 2018 as it ran up the right side of a short cup-without-handle base. That pushed the stock to the near the top of the 5% buy zone from the 248.33 entry. The fiber laser maker's RS line almost hit a new high on a daily chart, and did hit a new high on the weekly chart.IPG's shares then moved sideways, moving slightly extended from the buy point. Then shares began pulling back on Jan. 24, but in light volume and closing within buy range through Thursday. On Friday, the stock slid 2.1% to 246.75, back below the entry, but on volume that was 51% below normal.IPG shares lost 2% Monday morning.The RS line is now lagging, as the stock has drifted lower over several weeks while the market fared better.Paylocity is a cloud-based provider of payroll and human resources software, mostly for small- to mid-sized businesses.The stock cleared a 50.62 cup-with-handle buy point on Jan. 29, but in volume that was only 17% above normal. The RS line cleared a short-term high, but was still near the bottom of its consolidation. Shares kept rising until reversing lower on Thursday. On Friday, shares slid 1.7% to 50.60 in volume that was 26% above normal.Palocity dipped 0.3% to 50.43 intraday.Paylocity is in strong field. Paycom (PAYC) has fallen back into a buy zone ahead of earnings Tuesday night. Workday (WDAY), which targets larger enterprises, is one of the five leading stocks cited in the IBD'S TAKE above that is still in a buy zone.Cypress Semi closed above a 17.52 buy point on Jan. 20, but in light volume and with a lagging RS line. Two sessions later, the stock fell back below the entry. Cypress moved back into the buy zone on Jan. 29, again in light trade, but then pulled just below the entry once again.Cypress reported stronger-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings and sales late Thursday and gave bullish Q1 guidance. Shares fell just 1 cent to 17.15 on Friday. But Cypress lost 3.1% Monday morning.A strong retaking of the buy point likely would push the RS line above a short-term high.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Stocks Fall Broadly; Is A True Correction Near?Did You See The Big Flaws In These IBD 50 Stocks' Charts?Anatomy Of A Chart: Breaking Down The Buy And Sell Zones

82,IPG,"Stocks seesawed to a mixed finish Tuesday. Blue chips rose, but the broader indexes took a step back.The Nasdaq ended off its session low, but still lost 0.7% and snapped a four-day win streak. The S&P 500 fell 0.4% to end a five-day run.Helped by a surge in DuPont (DD), the Dow Jones industrial average squeezed out a 0.1% gain. DuPont jumped nearly 8% in reaction to late Monday's news of CEO Ellen Kullman stepping down.

122,IPG,"JPMorgan Mid Cap Growth Fund (HLGEX) has heated up this year thanks to leading-stock holdings like electronic parts maker Amphenol (APH), electronic payments processor Global Payments (GPN) and hotels-resorts-timeshares operator Hilton Worldwide (HLT). Their gains year to date range from 22% for Amphenol to 36% for Global.XAnd to help keep the good times rolling, the $3.2 billion fund is betting on top new buys as of its latest disclosure such as IPG Photonics (IPGP), a maker of fiber-optic lasers for industrial and medical applications; Linux operating system distributor Red Hat (RHT); and semiconductor test-equipment maker Teradyne (TER).Year-to-date gains by those newcomers ranged from 45% by Teradyne to 87% for IPG. On Tuesday, Red Hat gapped up 4% the day after reporting a 40% jump in adjusted fiscal second-quarter earnings per share, which topped analysts' expectations. It also raised its guidance for revenue and profit for the full year.The company's software runs computer servers in corporate data centers. Red Hat's cloud-computing revenue is mainly from customers using software-as-a-service.IBD'S TAKE: Red Hat is the No. 1 ranked stock in IBD's Computer Software-Desktop industry group.

That's one of several premium IBD features you can take for a test drive for free through Oct. 8. Other popular premium offerings include exclusive stock lists and The Big Picture, a daily update of what's driving the market.For the fund, all of that good news translated into a 21.64% gain this year going into Thursday. That outperformed 87% of the fund's midcap growth peers tracked by Morningstar Direct and easily topped the S&P 500's 13.66% return.The fund produced a three-year average annual gain of 9.13% vs. the big-cap bogey's 10.43% pace and the fund peer group's 8.59%.One reason the three-year tempo lags year-to-date gain is the three-year average includes the fund's paltry 2016 gain of 0.19%, which lagged 91% of its direct rivals.That makes this year, so far, the poster child for the fund's approach, which aims for capital growth through midcap- stocks with above-average growth. As the fund's latest fact sheet puts it, the fund's managers seek companies that are industry leaders, with business models that hold up in a variety of markets and whose executives know how to steer their charges to outsized growth.Timothy Parton just notched his 13th anniversary at the helm of the fund. Felise Agranoff has been a manager for about a year and nine months.Take a closer look at some of the fund's leading stocks. Portfolio newcomer Teradyne has IBD's next-to-highest-possible Composite Rating of 98. Scored on a scale of 1 to 99, stocks poised to move higher often have a Comp Rating of 95 or higher.The maker of automated test equipment for the chip industry also has an A SMR Rating, which means it is in the top 20% of stocks in terms of sales growth, profit margins and return-on-equity ratios, based on IBD's proprietary formula.The chip-testing systems firm serves the automobile, computing and game markets.In addition, Teradyne is in IBD's 85-85 index. The index tracks stocks whose EPS and Relative Strength Ratings are 85 or greater, and whose prices are above $15, are within 15% of their 52-week high and whose average daily trading volume is 10,000 shares or more.In July, the company's second-quarter report showed earnings per share up 64%. The 31% jump in revenue was the biggest jump in at least 19 quarters. Teradyne said results in the first half of the year were driven by strength in mobility, automotive, analog, microcontroller and memory end markets.Bright Horizons (BFAM) is another top new buy. Earnings per share growth has accelerated, having climbed 14%, 19%, 20% and 21% the past four quarters. The firm provides child care, early education and other services.It sports a 95 Comp Rating and an A SMR Rating.The rise in Q2 revenue and EPS growth was driven by both new full-service child-care centers and improved results from existing ones, the company said. Price increases averaged 3% to 4%. In addition, sales of backup dependent care and educational advisory services expanded.Fortive (FTV), a newcomer to the portfolio, makes equipment for testing and measurement, many for field instruments. EPS rose 13% and 11% the past two quarters, up from 1% the prior stanza.A spinoff from Danaher (DHR), Fortive was held by 1,388 mutual funds as of June 30. That was up from 1,305 funds as of Sept. 30, 2016. Funds' collective stakes rose to 148.3 million shares, up from 135.1 million shares.RELATED:Looking For Winning Stocks?

That followed a failed takeover bid by Kraft Heinz (KHC), which was the ""seminal"" moment in the first quarter, according to WPP Chief Executive Officer Martin Sorrell.""That sent a shockwave through the industry,"" Sorrell said by phone. ""It obviously had an effect in terms of people spending, particularly in the packaged goods sector.""WPP, which also works for brands such as Ford (F) and Marks & Spencer, had already seen its shares fall 12% this year through Tuesday amid a difficult economic climate and pressure on its businesses in North America. It's now down more than 20% year-to-date in London. Its biggest rivals, including Interpublic Group (IPG), Publicis Groupe and Omnicom (OMC), are each down more than 8% this year.Publicis dropped 2.9% in Paris, while IPG and Omnicom were down more than 4% in U.S. trading. Shares of European television companies including TF1, ProSiebenSat.1 Mediaand ITVc declined as well.In March, WPP had its biggest drop since the financial crisis when WPP gave its initial forecast for 2% growth, the slowest pace since 2009.In the second quarter, WPP's like-for-like net sales fell 0.5% with July declining 2.6%, and North America and Western Continental Europe were the poorest performing regions.""Some of the weakness was expected, however this is still an incremental disappointment,"" Tamsin Garrity, an analyst at Jefferies Group, said in a research note.WPP said that it didn't experience any significant loss in revenue from clients or of data from a cyberattack it suffered in June. The attack took down WPP's website and caused disruptions across businesses including the creative agency Ogilvy and Mather, a person familiar with the matter said at the time.The attack cost WPP about $10 million, $5 million of which was covered by insurance, Sorrell said. The company will spend about $10 million to $15 million annually on increased protection against future attacks, he said.

155,IPG,"While much has been written about information technology companies investing in artificial intelligence, Loup Ventures managing partner Doug Clinton notes that many non-tech companies are capitalizing on AI technology as well.Clinton has put together a portfolio of 17 publicly traded non-tech companies that are making investments in AI to improve their businesses. In a recent blog post, Clinton notes that he assembled the portfolio as a ""fun exercise"" and a way to draw attention to the sweeping nature of AI advancements. Loup Ventures is an early-stage venture capital firm.Clinton selected the companies from a range of industries including health care, retail, logistics, professional services, finance, transportation, energy, construction and food/agriculture.""In 10 years, every company will have to be an artificial intelligence company or they won't be competitive,"" Clinton said.Among the companies included is IBD 50 stock Idexx Laboratories (IDXX). Idexx makes products for the animal health-care sector. On its last earnings call, the company said that its latest diagnostic products are using machine learning so the instruments always have the ability to learn and train on new data. One such product that leverages AI is its SediVue Dx analyzer, Clinton said.The other companies on the Loup Ventures list are: Accenture (ACN), Avis Budget Group (CAR), Boeing (BA), Caterpillar (CAT), Deere (DE), Domino's Pizza (DPZ), FedEx (FDX) and GlaxoSmithKline (GSK).There's also Halliburton (HAL), Interpublic Group (IPG), Macy's (M), Monsanto (MON), Nasdaq (NDAQ), Northern Trust (NTRS), Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD) and Under Armour (UA).IBD'S TAKE: Cloud-computing leaders Amazon.com, Microsoft and Google, along with internet giants, have the inside track in monetizing artificial intelligence technology, Mizuho Securities said in a report earlier this month.Among those venturing into the space, Clinton says:RELATED:Are Drone Deliveries And Robotic Gofers Ready To Serve You?Where Are The Early Investing Hot Spots In Artificial Intelligence?Shale Producer Eyes Drilling With Artificial IntelligenceIBM Rated Buy On 'Upside Potential,' Artificial Intelligence Move

156,IPG,"Stocks continue to catch their breath on Monday after posting big gains last week, but Apple (AAPL) made a statement in the stock market today — that the institutional crowd is not yet ready to cash in their large year-to-date gains.X While the Dow Jones industrial average inched barely higher and the Nasdaq composite was fractionally lower with less than half an hour to go, Apple rose more than 0.3% to 149.55, climbing back above the 50-day moving average for the first time since a two-day, 5.3% slide on June 9-12. Shares on Monday got as high as 150.90.The seventh up day in a row for the iPhone and iPad maker suggests that Apple is not only trying to keep its uptrend intact but also may try to form a genuine new base.Apple (72 EPS Rating, 84 RS in Stock Checkup) initially cleared a 118.12 proper entry in a cup-with-handle pattern on Jan. 6-9 and rallied more than 32% before cooling off. The company is into its third quarter of rebounding from a three-quarter slump in both the top and bottom lines.IBD's TAKE: A savvy investor can get an edge in finding new entry points in turnaround stocks and strong companies at the end of a severe market correction by looking for the bottoming base pattern. Check out the one that Apple formed in the spring of 2009 before going on its big stretch run of gains.An aggressive shareholder could opt to buy shares of Apple if it can continue to rally back above the 50- or 10-week moving average with authority, preferably in rising volume. (The 50-day average turnover of Apple is 28.1 million shares.) A more clear-cut entry would be if the stock breaks out to new highs.The S&P 500 was virtually flat, as gains in steel, metal ores, retail, gold and generic drug firms offset declines in the automaker, airfreight, specialty retail, logistics, railroad and movie fields of the market. The Russell 2000 outperformed, up 0.3%.Bob Doll, chief equity strategist at Nuveen Asset Management, notes that low inflation, a U.S. monetary policy that ""should remain equity-market friendly,"" and a global monetary policy that is beginning to normalize all pose as positive factors for equities in the second half of 2017.""We think these trends can continue, but also believe investment selectivity is growing more important,"" Doll wrote in a weekly investment commentary.Indeed, the IBD Mutual Fund index, which tracks some of the best active fund managers on Wall Street, is up 15.8% since Jan. 1, pounding the S&P 500's 9.8% gain so far. See the index and its components by going to the latest IBD Big Picture and clicking on the General Market Indicators page via a link at the bottom of the daily article.Apple is slated to report fiscal Q3 results on Aug. 1 after the close. The Street sees sales rising 6% to $44.92 billion, which would mark the biggest year-over-year increase in seven quarters. Earnings are expected to lift 11% to $1.57 a share.Apple is part of IBD's Telecom sector. As seen in IBD Weekly, Electronics, Chips, Leisure and Building dominate the 33 sector rankings within IBD's stock research tables for mid- to long-term performance. A strong sector helps a high-quality stock succeed in its breakouts.D.R. Horton (DHI) (breakout from a long saucer with handle at 34.64), Home Depot (HD) (saucer-with-handle breakout at 137.42), Nvidia (NVDA) and IPG Photonics (IPGP) are just some of the stocks from these four sectors that are showing unusual strength lately.Nvidia, the top chip-technology player in the video gaming markets, is No. 5 in the IBD 50 and has made big strides in the fields of deep learning, artificial intelligence, data center and self-driving cars. The big-cap tech is now extended after surging off its 10-week moving average near 140 three weeks ago. The stock is also up 35% after bolting out of a 13-week base in heavy turnover in the week ended May 12.Among top-performing new issues, Ichor (ICHR) worked on a fourth straight up day, rising nearly 3% to 22.27. While volume is running sharply below average, the semiconductor equipment firm hoisted itself back above the key 50-day moving average. A new base may be forming, with the correction in the base currently at 35% from head to toe.That 35% correction is typically the maximum amount of decline you'd like to see in a cup-with-handle or double-bottom base, two of the seven principal chart patterns that the biggest stock market winners produce before breaking out to new highs and unleashing strong price runs.Ichor broke the $100 million-revenue barrier on a quarterly basis during the third quarter of 2016, when sales jumped 40% to $105.7 million. Since then, revenue leapt 104% and 103% in the next two quarters while earnings made triple- to quadruple-digit increases.The Street sees Q2 profit exploding 329% higher to 60 cents a share, boosted in part by a 7% decline in the year-ago quarter.RELATED:How Much Will Q2 Earnings Rise For The Top Growth Firms?How To Learn Top Buy And Sell Rules For Growth InvestingThe Latest Names In Stock SpotlightSelling Stocks Like A Pro: What Is A True Cut Of The 50-Day Moving Average?

157,IPG,"The country's top-performing stock funds the past three months continued to add a variety of stocks to their portfolios, including techs, telecom, banks, leisure and some retail stocks. Many of these top-rated stocks had strong run-ups, but dipped in June.Managers of leading funds were snatching up tech stocks, such as Nvidia (NVDA), IPG Photonics (IPGP), Paycom Software (PAYC) and Medidata Solutions (MDSO). Chinese tech giants Alibaba (BABA), YY (YY) and NetEase (NTES) were also favored by top-notch funds. A small handful of telecom issues being added include Applied Optoelectronics (AAOI) and Lumentum Holdings (LITE).Leading funds continued to ease into select retailers, such as Stamps.com (STMP), Ollie's Bargain Outlet (OLLI), Domino's Pizza (DPZ). IPO Floor & Decor Holdings (FND) shot up to a high of 47 on Jun. 21, but has refunded some of its gains to trade at 39, a gain of 87% from its IPO price as of Thursday.Big banks are in the driver's seat once again. The group started rallying again as all 34 of the nation's biggest banks passed the Fed's annual stress test.IBD found 23 top-notch funds buying Bank of America (BAC), investing an estimated $450 million.

The warrant was purchased for $5 billion preferred stocks in 2011. Having Warren Buffett as a major shareholder will likely boost investor confidence in the money center bank.Like most banks and financial stocks, BofA soared after the presidential election amid expectations of pro-growth policies and interest rate hikes. After hitting a 52-week high of 25.90 on March 2, the stock has consolidated, etching a cup-shaped base. It's currently building the right side of the base with no handle just yet, but nearing its pivot of 25.90.Morgan Stanley (MS) was another money center bank on top funds' shopping list. It's trading near a 46.08 buy point of handle.The nation's leading funds have been taking profit from a handful of retail restaurants, such as Panera Bread (PNRA), Dave & Buster's (PLAY) and Wingstop (WING).

161,IPG,"The major indexes rebounded off early-morning lows despite a bullish report in smaller jobless claims last week, yet stocks still traded moderately in the red Thursday. Given the market's strong gains in recent weeks, it would not be a surprise to see the averages finish lower for the week.However, the market continues to show elements of strength as well. The Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 major averages are all still well above their rising 50-day moving averages. Watch to see if the Dow Jones industrial average can hold above its 50-day line.The Dow Jones industrial average at 1 p.m. ET shaved its loss further down to just 0.2%. The 30-member blue chip index hit as low as 20,798, just 11 points above its 50-day line.The Nasdaq composite whittled its initial large decline of nearly 0.9% to less than 0.5% while the S&P 500 was off 0.4%. The NYSE composite, down 0.5%, is also facing a fresh test of support at the 50-day moving average. Snap (SNAP), meanwhile, suffered its worst single-day decline since going public March 2 at 17 a share. The stock dropped more than 18% to 18.76 and skidded to as low as 17.59. The stock would now need to rally more than 56% just to match its all-time high of 29.44.The 18% drop represented a $5.4 billion hair cut in market value for Snap, which has 1.157 billion shares outstanding, including Class A, B and C shares.Investors were clearly disappointed by the much bigger than expected net loss of $2.31 a share for the Snapchat social networking site operator, vs. a net loss of 14 cents in the year-ago quarter. Research and development costs ballooned to $805.8 million vs. $28.1 million. A lot of that likely had to do with high stock-based compensation expense, which totaled almost $2 billion for the quarter.Another concern: Snap showed a $155 million drop in operating cash flow. But the company does have $1.43 billion in cash and $1.82 billion in marketable securities, which usually tend to be highly liquid bonds. Elsewhere in the market, Essent Group (ESNT) continued its rebound, rising nearly 2% to 37.30 in light trade. The mortgage insurance firm retook a 36.91 buy point in a shallow double-bottom base.Coherent (COHR), a specialist in industrial-use lasers, also defied the market's decline, rising more than 1.4% to 254.37 in heavy turnover.Other top-rated growth stocks to keep watching for potential entry points include IPG Photonics (IPGP) and Grubhub (GRUB), formerly on IBD Sector Leaders. Grubhub, which enables restaurants to attract more customers by being on the company's popular food service app, edged slightly up to 45.03, extended 6% past a 42.35 buy point in a long double-bottom base.Grubhub, currently No. 26 in the IBD 50, was featured as early as mid-January in IBD's Sector Leaders column, which noted that the software firm's 22% decline from head to toe in a new base was well within the appropriate range for a good cup base or double bottom.IPG gained nearly 1% to 136.73 and volume is running slightly ahead of its normal pace. The stock, which gapped up sharply on May 2 on a strong Q1 report (adjusted earnings up 50%, revenue up 38%), is for now well extended past a 124.37 flat-base entry.Meanwhile, certain retailing stocks got pummeled, reaffirming the problems that some brick and mortar store chains continue to have amid big gains in e-commerce.Macy's (M), which had joined the Leaderboard Short Sales list on March 6 when it crossed back below its 50-day moving average near 31.72, got slammed on Thursday with a 14% drop to 24.99. Volume has already shot well beyond 29 million shares vs. its 50-day average of 5.7 million. The department store chain, which already has plans to close 100 locations, reported a 40% drop in earnings to 24 cents a share, missing views by 31%, as revenue dipped 8% to $5.34 billion.That marked the ninth straight quarter of falling revenue.Luxury furnishings firm RH (RH) and Nordstrom (JWN) also fell hard in the stock market today, losing 8% and 7%, respectively. Unlike Macy's, however, both stocks continue to tread on the north side of their 50-day moving averages.RH, formerly known as Restoration Hardware, has generally been acting well since it cleared a first-stage deep bottoming base pattern with a 39.38 buy point on March 29 in triple average turnover.RELATED:Where Is The Market Headed?

Although U.S. stocks gains were solid, they didn't match the fervor of European indexes. The London FTSE 100 rallied 2.1%, the German DAX 3.4% and the Paris CAC 40 4.1% as investors applauded the French election results, which left a pro-EU candidate in good shape to win the presidency. The iShares MSCI Eurozone (EZY) ETF jumped 4.7% to the highest level since August 2015.On the main exchanges, volume was tracking higher on the Nasdaq and lower on the NYSE.  Winners led losers by 3-to-1 on the Nasdaq and better than 13-to-5 on the NYSE.Banking, travel and some cyclical industry groups led the market. Regional banks, whose shine had been fading for weeks, were among the better-performing stocks in today's market. Western Alliance (WAL), Zions Bancorp (ZION) and Citizens Financial Group (CFG) were up in heavy trading and back to the 50-day line or getting closer to it as they rebound.But it was the technology sector that stood out in terms of chart action, as several names broke out past buy points.Dell Technologies (DVMT) leapt past the 65.88 buy point in more than double its usual volume as shares rose 2.5% to 66.02. The computer hardware company is a member of Leaderboard.IPG Photonics (IPGP) moved above the 124.37 buy point of a flat base. Shares jumped 3.5% to 124.78. Volume was merely average, which invites suspicions about the otherwise bullish move. Earnings for the maker of specialized lasers are due May 2 before the open.A pair of IBD 50 stocks also broke out.Macom Technology Solutions (MTSI) rose past the 52.32 buy point of a cup-with-handle base in heavy trading. Shares soared 4% to 53.78. The maker of semiconductor technologies for optical, wireless and satellite networks tried to breakout out initially last week, but got turned back. Earnings are due Tuesday after the close.Synopsys (SNPS) broke out past the 73.18 buy point of a flat base. Shares rose 1% to 73.63. But volume was about half the usual pace, which made the breakout suspect. The stock has been rising from support at the 50-day moving average.RELATED:Breakout Watch: Top Financial Stock Jumps Back Into Buy Zone

173,IPG,"Fiber-optic laser maker IPG Photonics (IPGP) jumped to a record high Wednesday after the company late Tuesday posted Q4 earnings and gave Q1 guidance that beat analyst expectations, with the company citing strong growth in China, Europe, Russia and Japan.IPG stock was up 4% to end regular trading at 121.75 on the stock market today, peaking earlier at 124.27. Shares are now past the 20%-gain level where investors should have locked in at least some profit from the stock's Dec. 8 breakout from a cup-with-handle base at a buy point of 99.08.The Oxford, Mass.-based company, which also has strong roots in Russia and Germany, in its earnings release said its book-to-bill ratio, which measures new orders booked to old orders billed, was more than 1, indicating growth.The company has preannounced its expectations of a Q4 beat. Late Tuesday, it said earnings per share rose 22% from the year-earlier quarter to $1.39, with sales up 25% to $280.1 million, both metrics ahead of Wall Street estimates. Last year marked its first year with more than $1 billion in revenue.IBD'S TAKE: IPG Photonics is not the only stock hitting a new high Wednesday. For the good look at topping stocks ranked by Composite Rating, investors can keep tabs of IBD's New Highs list.For Q1, the top maker of fiber lasers expects EPS of $1.10 to $1.25 on sales of $245 million to $260 million, the EPS midpoint in line with estimates and sales ahead of views.Needham & Co. analyst James Ricchiuti called the Q4 report ""stellar"" in a research note in which he hiked his price target on IPG stock to 130 from 120, maintaining his buy rating. Benchmark hiked its PT to 125 from 116, while Dougherty & Co. boosted its rating to buy from neutral.IPG says fiber lasers continue to gain market share vs. other lasers such as crystal, solid-state and gas; use less energy; require very little service and are easy to use. They are used in a wide range of industrial applications for cutting, welding and more.In his research report, Ricchiuti said Asia Pacific and China led the way in Q4.""Asia Pacific (53% of Q4 revs) increased 32% (year over year) to $147.9M,"" he wrote. ""Sales in China rose 43% to $98M, reflecting strong demand in automotive and for cutting applications from nearly all of IPGP's major (original equipment manufacturers).""RELATED:Why The Needham Aggressive Growth Fund Likes IPG

174,IPG,"Stock funds seemed only slightly less frenetic than President Trump setting policy in his first 100 days, as the average domestic stock fund rose 1.83% in January, padding gains of 1.46% in December and 10.81% in 2016.World equity funds did even better in January, advancing 3.86%, according to Lipper Inc.Taxable bond funds rose 0.76%, while municipal bond funds rose 0.46%.The S&P 500 rose 1.90% last month.Not all of the young year's gains are attributable to the new president and new Congress, say stock fund managers and strategists.""Regardless of who was elected, the economy was already improving,"" said Kimberly Scott, lead manager of $2.4 billion Ivy Mid Cap Growth (WMGAX) and co-manager of $288 million Ivy Mid Cap Income Opportunities (IVOAX) funds. ""The trajectory of corporate profits had already turned up. The outlook for corporate profits for the end of 2017 into 2018 was already quite strong. The policy changes concerning taxes, repatriation of overseas corporate cash (and) unwinding some onerous regulations that President Trump talked about could boost corporate profits more. But the economy was already getting stronger.""And mutual fund professionals expect the uptrend to continue this year.""The market could go in two very different ways,"" said Omar Aguilar, Charles Schwab Investment Management's chief investment officer of equities. ""On the one hand, there is a very powerful combination of factors that could translate into record levels for equities.""On the other hand, the market could go south. ""The attempt at reforms (of taxes, corporate cash repatriation and regulatory burdens) could increase the federal budget deficit,"" Aguilar said. ""There is a potential for trade wars. Emerging markets are still landing. A strong U.S. currency could hurt exports. Those headwinds could backfire into our economy and markets.""On balance, Aguilar is guardedly bullish. ""On a net basis we will see the market trend up,"" he said. ""But it will be volatile.""Scott is favoring stocks in sectors that typically benefit at the outset of a rally. ""Many think we're in the midcycle of a recovery,"" she said. ""But we had a significant corporate-profits recession. So to me this feels like an early-stage economic recovery, and that's when you want to shift more asset weight into technology, financials, energy and industry.""Consumer discretionary is usually part of that early-stage recovery party. But this time brick-and-mortar retailers are battling digital retailers. Brick-and-mortar retailers are being forced to spend on their own websites and low-cost delivery services, Scott says, which will continue to sap their earnings.Large-cap growth mutual funds' 4.10% gain on average in January led all U.S. diversified stock fund categories.Yet investors were still jittery enough at times to drive precious-metals funds, a defensive category, up 14.94% last month, higher than any other sector. That beat basic-materials funds, which gained 7.31%.Latin American funds paced foreign stock fund categories by tacking on 7.67%.Taxable bonds were led by flexible-income funds 1.61% gain. Treasury funds inched up 0.36%.Trailing precious metals and several other sector fund categories, tech funds notched a 5.13% January gain. IPG Photonics (IPGP) is a technology name that John Barr, manager of $60 million Needham Aggressive Growth (NEAGX) — whose 9.32% average annual gain over the past 10 years topped 96% of its small-cap growth rivals tracked by Morningstar Inc. — likes in a market poised to continue higher but with volatility. The company makes fiber-optic lasers, which can be used for cutting and welding in industrial applications. As costs fall, laser systems become increasingly attractive, especially in welding, Barr says. ""Big automotive makers are quite interested in using this for welding,"" he said.Revenue grew 19% and 17% in the two most recent years. Earnings grew an average of 18% annually from 2014 to 2016. ""It has a long runway ahead, with great returns and great management,"" Barr said.PDF Solutions (PDFS) is another tech name Barr likes. The firm produces software that's the core of electrical testing of newly made semiconductors. It has the potential for taking share from more conventional optical testing systems, Barr says.Two major chipmakers signed on as customers in 2016. PDF's service is delivered on a subscription basis. ""So it has high margins and could double company earnings"" in the near term, Barr said, especially if it wins customers in China as the Middle Kingdom builds out its own semiconductor manufacturing industry between now and 2020.Ivy's Scott likes MercadoLibre (MELI), an Argentina-based online retailer that offers an electronic payment service. ""It's still in an earlier phase of development than Amazon (AMZN) is here,"" said Scott. ""There is no reason to think that demand for online buying and payment will not be as attractive to Latin Americans as it is in the U.S. and Asia.""Video-game publisher Electronic Arts (EA) is another of Scott's favorites. The video-game publisher benefits from a console-upgrade cycle and the shift to digital game downloads, which carry higher profit margins, as IBD has reported. Scott says now, ""I continue to like the tremendous changes in the products and innovation there. They make games that consumers love. And the way that these products are developed and distributed digitally is such a profit enhancer. We think that story continues.""Among financial services stocks, Scott likes regional banks such as First Republic (FRC) and Signature Bank (SBNY), which should benefit from rising rates and from a reduction in their regulatory burden. Trump targeted the Dodd-Frank Act for review on Friday.IBD'S TAKE: Midsize regional banks have gotten a boost from congressional moves to raise the threshold of the Dodd-Frank Act's systemic risk designation. The existing rule applies to banks with at least $50 billion in assets, subjecting them to costly regulations. As IBD recently reported, Congress is looking at raising that to $250 billion.Scott also likes MarketAxess Holdings (MKTX), an electronic bond-trading exchange that claims cheaper transaction costs than traditional investment-bank bond trades, easier odd-lot trading and specialization in corporate credit. ""There are others trying to do this, but none has gained the traction that MarketAxess has,"" she said.Amid the rally in energy stocks, Stephen DeNichilo, co-manager of $2.9 billion Federated Kaufmann Large Cap (KLCAX), likes small-cap Independence Contract Drilling (ICD). The company offers customers of energy exploration and production very sophisticated drilling rigs. ""They're on the leading edge of what E&P companies want,"" DeNichilo said. ""They have only 12 working rigs, so essentially they are fully utilized. They have leverage to the U.S. shale-pad drilling rally. They have a clean balance sheet. They are trading below their $10-a-share replacement value. And they could be a takeout candidate.""In addition to trading below 10, earnings per share growth has declined at triple-digit paces the past four quarters.Among industrials, DeNichilo likes Dycom Industries (DY). ""We like long-term investment themes,"" DeNichilo said. ""Dycom is the largest specialty contractor for fiber-(optic cable). They're the only national specialty contractor that puts fiber into the ground at a time when AT&T (T), CenturyLink (CTL), Charter (CHTR), Verizon (VZ) and other (telecoms) are about to ramp up.""That cycle will be sparked, DeNichilo says, by AT&T embarking on a massive plan to lay fiber so the telecom giant can offer customers high-speed internet service. ""Their plan is to bring 1-gigabit speed to (at least) 12 million customers by 2019,"" DeNichilo said. The industry has seen that when dramatically higher speeds are offered at the same or comparable cost, customers switch providers. ""Competitors will have to follow,"" he said. ""This will be a big cycle for Dycom. Also, fiber investments could be part of any large infrastructure (upgrade) plan by the government.""At the average U.S. broadband speed of about 18 megabits, downloading a two-hour movie takes more than 10 minutes. It takes eight seconds via 1-Gig fiber, according to fastmetrics.com. And AT&T's speed upgrade can be achieved solely through street-side fiber, and will not require any in-home rewiring or cable replacement, DeNichilo says.Dycom's earnings grew an average of 74% annually over the past three years. ""Despite earnings growth way above the market, they are trading below the market multiple,"" DeNichilo said.DeNichilo also likes Martin Marietta Materials (MLM). As the U.S. economy heats up, demand for construction aggregates will grow. ""Even without Trump's Mexican wall, nonresidential construction — which is the bulk of aggregate consumption — is still below its 55-year normal level,"" he said. ""This company has essentially doubled earnings per share over the past three years, so its outlook is fantastic whether there is a (federal government) infrastructure plan or not.""Ivy's Scott likes water-heater-maker A.O. Smith (AOS). ""There isn't a lot of cyclicality in their business,"" Scott said. ""Homeowners have to replace their heaters every 10 to 12 years. And they have a growing business in China for water heaters and water-purification systems. It's a nice growth engine for Smith.""Smith's average annual earnings growth rate was 24% from 2014 through 2016. ""They're a consistent grower and reliable payer of dividends,"" Scott added. The company's dividend yield is 1.1%. ""We're not a dividend fund, but it's nice to have on top of everything.""RELATED: Where Fund Bigwigs Expect To See Stock Gains In 20172017 Personal Finance Action Plan & 2016 Stock Market ReviewClick Here To See A List Of New Buys Of Top Mutual FundsClick Here To See A List Of Latest Sells Of Top Mutual Funds

179,IPG,"British statesman Winston Churchill never watched YouTube, nor was he a financial analyst. But Churchill’s quote that Russia “is a riddle, wrapped in a mystery, inside an enigma” fits YouTube, the video website owned by Alphabet’s (GOOGL) Google.Ad-supported YouTube is a revenue juggernaut. Some analysts estimate sales will swell 30% to 40% in 2016, to about $9 billion.But is YouTube profitable? Google has never said. Nor does it disclose viewership data or other financial metrics beyond a few broad statements.“There’s substantial uncertainty, particularly over the profit levels at YouTube, whether it’s break-even or if they're doing modest operating margins,"" RBC Capital analyst Mark Mahaney told IBD. “They have a lot of content royalty costs, massive bandwidth costs, storage costs, processing costs.""My guess is that with YouTube’s scale, they’re reasonably profitable, like double-digit margins, but there’s no way of knowing,” Mahaney said. He thinks investors crave a “clean look” at YouTube’s financials.Bank of America Merrill Lynch last year valued YouTube at $70 billion or more. That would be more than 40 times the $1.65 billion that Google paid for YouTube in 2006. BofA predicted YouTube's revenue will hit $13 billion in 2017.Its 1-billion-plus users and massive video library buoy Wall Street analysts' faith. They could place YouTube in a sweet spot to capture TV advertising dollars, as they shift to online video from broadcast networks and cable.But YouTube faces unprecedented challenges, as online video's burgeoning growth emboldens mighty competitors. Think Amazon.com (AMZN), Facebook (FB) and Netflix (NFLX), among others.Broadcasters snipe at the quality of YouTube's videos, aiming to hold on to TV advertising. Competing in subscription-based services vs. the likes of Netflix and Hulu would take big content investments. Not knowing YouTube's costs, margins or growth history will make it hard to gauge how it's meeting the challenges -- and the potential for a blow to its value to Alphabet, whose overall market capitalization approaches $500 billion. Alphabet stock closed Friday at 747.60, up 1.5%.Costs already are rising. YouTube pays partners that generate traffic for YouTube. A popular site for music videos, YouTube is also renewing its agreements with major record labels. The Recording Industry Association of America in March charged that YouTube pays much lower royalties than Apple (AAPL) Music and Spotify.Observers speculate Google has sought streaming rights to on-demand TV shows and movies to bolster YouTube Red, its new subscription service. Some media reports suggest Google could go a step further and buy rights to live TV channels, making it a more direct foe of pay TV providers such as Comcast (CMCSA), AT&T (T) and Verizon Communications (VZ). Google is usually mentioned when broadcasting rights to major sports are up for grabs.So far, though, this has all proved to be mostly idle speculation. Analysts say Google has not been bidding aggressively to win streaming rights. It's not clear whether YouTube, long the top video site overall in unique visitors, aims to be the No. 1 aggregator of all video, says Joel Espelien, an analyst at the Diffusion Group, a video-focused research firm.""YouTube's DNA is in free video with ads, and that's difficult to change,"" Espelien said. ""But also they don't want to be thought of as the cat video guys. They want the YouTube brand in a mass-market context. So they experiment buying rights.""But subscription VOD/premium video is different (than free). It's hit-driven. There's no HBO without 'Game of Thrones.' I'm not sure YouTube can monetize rights. There are questions over recouping content investments. If YouTube bought (live) NFL rights, they could lose their shirt.""It is, however, getting more aggressive with original content. YouTube plans to release 15 to 20 original series and movies this year. But its originals are not big-budget shows like Netflix’s “House of Cards.” YouTube’s originals are mostly spun off from a roster of young stars who have found an audience with their free videos on YouTube.YouTube has focused on developing online personalities such as video game player PewDiePie, music video specialist Smosh and style guru Michelle Phan. Driving much of the traffic to YouTube, analysts say, are multichannel networks such as Fullscreen, Maker Studios, SonyBMG and Whistle Sports. Google has bought stakes in multichannel networks such as Vevo and Machinima, analysts say, to ensure their content stays on its website.“One day YouTube will be as large as -- if not larger than -- most, if not all, legacy media companies,” Bernstein Research analyst Carlos Kirjner said in a research report. “It is playing a central role in the secular shift of brand advertising budgets to the Internet. Yet, we know ridiculously little about YouTube.”All the estimates by research firms and analysts, says Kirjner, are ""based more on belief and anecdotes than on truly representative data. What's more -- beyond anecdotes either shared by Google or collected through discussions with ad buyers, creators and multichannel network operators -- we know very little about what is available on YouTube, what people watch and how much it gets watched.""The lack of transparency is unlikely to change, says Espelien. While Wall Street craves granular data, it's not in Google's interest to say much, he says. Content providers and advertisers get ""little snippets"" of information from YouTube, but not most of the data YouTube collects.""There's information asymmetry,"" Espelien said. ""It's an advantage for them. Wall Street tries to model businesses and make forecasts, but that doesn't mesh with tech companies trying to preserve an edge.""Google's broad message? YouTube is doing well. As Google CEO Sundar Pichai put it on Alphabet's Q1 earnings conference call: “YouTube still has incredible momentum, and we continue to invest heavily here.""The company does say YouTube has over 1 billion active monthly users, who watch hundreds of millions of hours of video each day, and that 80% of viewership is outside the U.S.Google also hasn’t said how many subscribers it's attracted to its ad-free, $10-per-month YouTube Red service. Google has launched a new 99-cent, three-month offer for YouTube Red -- possibly a sign it's not gaining traction.At an advertising gala in May, Google said YouTube now reaches more 18- to 49-year-olds on mobile devices than any network, including broadcast or cable. But it hasn't disclosed anything about what content they’re watching.What is certain is that Facebook and Amazon -- which offers its video streaming as one service in its Amazon Prime customer-loyalty package -- are taking aim at YouTube, as are Snapchat and Twitter (TWTR).Facebook and Twitter, via its Periscope service, are beefing up their live streaming, as YouTube does the same. YouTube in April began supporting 360-degree live streaming on its service.In early May, Amazon announced a new service initially designed for ""professional video producers."" Launch partners include media firm Conde Nast, the ""How Stuff Works"" website and Samuel Goldwyn Films. Amazon Video Direct could compete for the young creative talent attracted to YouTube. As does YouTube, Amazon offers revenue-sharing and royalties for content that attracts a certain level of traffic. YouTube has doled out bonuses to keep its top creative stars from defecting to Facebook or others. And holding on to popular multichannel networks such as Machinima, says Espelien, remains key. For now, YouTube's biggest threat is Facebook, says Mahaney. Facebook has hinted at creating a dedicated video service that would get prominent play on its social networking website. But even Facebook and Amazon can't easily match YouTube's scale, Mahaney says.""It's a long-term build for Amazon,"" Mahaney said. ""YouTube already has a billion people who go to it on a monthly basis. It's hard to see anyone matching them.""Facebook has users, too, but it's not purely entertainment, like YouTube.""Moreover, YouTube is best-positioned among rivals to tap into TV advertising budgets, some analysts say. That's because Google has worked to provide improved audience measurement tools.“Google is increasingly speaking a common language with TV advertisers on metrics that should drive increased share shift from TV to YouTube,” said Nomura analyst Anthony DiClemente in a research report.Interpublic Group (IPG), the huge global ad firm, in April said it would shift $250 million in TV spending to YouTube. Toyota (TM) will increase its ad spending by 400% in 2016, YouTube says.In early May, YouTube said it would launch a new product that lets big brands automatically buy ads for the site's hottest viral videos.The new offering is an offshoot from Google Preferred, which enables agencies to reserve spots among YouTube's most popular channels. YouTube ad rates are higher for Preferred than its usual rates, says Espelien.""Along with Hulu, Preferred has the best pitch to TV buyers of any pure-play digital platform,"" said Daniel Salmon, analyst at BMO Capital Markets. Hulu is a joint venture of Walt Disney (DIS), 21st Century Fox (FOXA) and Comcast.

181,IPG,"Bucket list escapades have a practical purpose. How getting out there prepares young executives for professional careers:Hit the road. Akinbola Richardson wanted life experience, and he got it. The 22-year-old Howard University grad spent last summer on an eclectic quest, thanks to an unconventional internship -- called unternship -- offered by communications agency Golin.The program had Richardson traveling the country completing various feats of his choosing -- from helping build houses for the homeless in New Orleans to snorkeling with turtles in Hawaii.“It literally changed my life,” Richardson told IBD. “It made me into a better person in a hundred thousand different ways.”Sit quiet. A particularly difficult stint was 10 days of silent contemplation at a retreat near Fresno, Calif. Richardson had to give up all devices, books and even notebooks for the entire stay.“I was so scared. I started creating things to think about,” Richardson said.After two days, he settled into the meditative state.“It teaches you where pressure and stress come from,” Richardson said. Now when his mind gets overloaded, “I know how to empty it.”Listen intently. At an Amish community in Ohio, Richardson learned focus. “The way they listen to you is different,” he said. “They give their whole selves to you.”Gain strength. Other high points: running a Tough Mudder race in Washington, D.C., participating in an American Indian sweat lodge ceremony in Georgia and befriending homeless people in Oregon.“Every single place I went, there was some fear,” Richardson said. “It allowed me to grow into a more fearless person.”Richardson was responsible for every decision on the three-month adventure.“You’re out there on your own,” he said. “It gave me maturity and self-confidence.”Expand horizons. After completing the unternship, Richardson stepped into his role as creative/videographer at Golin.“I wasn’t always this bold,” Richardson said. “In college, I was playing it small.”New experiences strengthened his mettle. “That inner self is what gets you to the next level,” he said.Raise consciousness. Ginger Porter, managing director at Golin, saw this change in Richardson: “He’s now a more road-challenged warrior.”Porter designed the unternship after noticing a hiring disconnect at Golin, which is a division of Interpublic (IPG).Fred Cook, Golin’s CEO, didn’t a have typical chief’s background. His previous jobs included pool hustler, Norwegian tanker cabin boy, Italian leather salesman, chauffeur for drunks and hotel doorman.Porter told her boss: “I’m concerned that I would never have hired you. I might be missing out on the next Fred Cook.”Her team designed the unternship to unearth talented and daring candidates who are eager for life experience.Get inspired. Richardson’s dispatches from the road spurred companywide interest in opportunities for growth.“He’s inspired us all to think more boldly and ask: 'How can I do that in my daily life?' ” said Porter.In 2016, Golin is expanding the unternship program to its China, United Kingdom and Bucharest offices.Boost them. Essential skills like listening, collaborating, problem solving, communicating clearly and showing up on time are hard to come by among young execs, according to a survey by management consultant Talent Q.Eight of 10 hiring managers say that they can’t find enough candidates with those abilities.Another survey by CareerBuilder reveals that 77% of 2,000 employers believe soft skills are as important as technical talent.

206,IPG,"More companies are giving website visitors a solution to password fatigue. Businesses are letting people access their websites by using the logins from their Facebook (FB), Twitter (TWTR) or other sites — a kind of universal sign-in mechanism for websites and apps that employs a one-click login icon linked to the user's social media account.
"
207,IPG,"Facebook, Twitter and other social media sites often then share what personal information they know about the user with the websites and mobile apps the person goes on to visit. In turn, brands and companies analyze and add to that information in order to present users with more relevant advertisements and otherwise customize the user's experience while on the site.
"
208,IPG,"Nearly 90% of U.S. Internet users said they used a social login to access at least one website or app this year, up from 53% in 2012, according to a July survey by Gigya, a California-based company that develops technology to help businesses streamline e-registrations on their websites.
"
209,IPG,"Gigya also found that 2-in-3 respondents said they ""always"" or ""often"" used social logins to sign in if they have that option, up from 35% in 2012.
"
210,IPG,"The use of social logins is most prevalent for sites devoted to music, retail, entertainment, gaming and media.
"
211,IPG,"Social networking leader Facebook as well as Google (GOOGL), through its social network Google+, are seeing the most social login use.
"
212,IPG,"Facebook captured 66% of social login usage in Q2, Gigya said, followed by Google's 20%.
"
213,IPG,"They dominated the rest of the pack.
"
214,IPG,"Next is microblog Twitter, which held a 6% share of the social login provider pie, with 4% for Web portal Yahoo (YHOO) and 2% for professional social networking site LinkedIn (LNKD).
"
215,IPG,"Besides removing the hassle of having to remember multiple usernames and passwords, social logins pave the way for brands to present people with better targeted ads or otherwise personalize the user's experience.
"
216,IPG,"For example, once logged in through a social site, ""if you start watching a show on the desktop browser and pause it and then you pull out your phone while you're on the (subway), you can (easily) pick up that show right where you left off. On multiple devices, having that same user logged in allows you to integrate the interactions,"" said Jamie Beckland, vice president of marketing for Janrain, a provider of social login technology.
"
217,IPG,"Getting details about potential customers is the major allure for businesses.
"
218,IPG,"""The social login allows you to capture over 200 points of data — all rich, profiled data — like whether or not a person is married, where they got their degree, what their likes and interests are"" and other information the user has already provided to the social site, said David Scott, Gigya's former chief marketing officer.
"
219,IPG,"Companies plug that information into marketing-automation and analysis software and come up with more relevant ads based on those interests. That helps them boost their revenue, either through the user's direct purchases on the site or through higher visitor and engagement rates that can command bigger ad prices.
"
220,IPG,"""If you get someone to register and sign in, and you get some data on that individual, that tends to be more valuable,"" said Gigya CEO Patrick Salyer. ""You can target not just generic consumers, but males or females, certain demographics, certain interests.""
"
221,IPG,"Moreover, social login users tend to be more engaged than someone who logs in with a traditional user name and password, says Janrain's Beckland.
"
222,IPG,"One client found ""that people who use social logins are five times more likely to leave a comment or a review or engage with the site in some way,"" Beckland said, illustrating that when people choose to use a social login, ""they feel close to the brand.""
"
223,IPG,"The rise of mobile is pushing social login adoption, Beckland says, since the single-click icon is easier to navigate with a smartphone than having to type information on the device's small screen.
"
224,IPG,"But who gets to peek at user data remains a ticklish issue that prompted Facebook to offer its users more privacy options.
"
225,IPG,"In March, Facebook fully rolled out an anonymous-login feature that lets users choose which apps and websites they prefer to sign into without sharing their identities. The websites and apps are blocked from collecting those users' personal data, so the benefit to users is getting a streamlined login experience apparently without being recognized for ad targeting.

237,IPG,"Yahoo (YHOO) will start letting advertisers use outside vendors to verify that real humans rather than robots are viewing their ads, taking aim at an issue that continues to irk advertisers as more advertising goes digital.Yahoo on Wednesday announced it's partnering with several third-party measurement firms that provide ""independent viewability and fraud measurement.""Dennis Buchheim, Yahoo vice president of product management, said in a statement that the Web portal has been working to ""increase trust between advertisers and publishers,"" and its new alliance with independent measurement companies will ""give our customers the confidence they deserve when running campaigns on our inventory and across the Web.""Advertisers are willing to pay higher rates in exchange for robust Web traffic counts. But bots — Internet robot programs — are being used to artificially increase website and ad views, as well as to steal user data.Also, more companies are adopting programmatic advertising, or ads bought and sold by machines, to boost efficiency.

347,IPG,"International stocks, in the broadest sense, are sometimes based in the U.S.But some U.S.-based companies get most of their revenue outside the country.Let's look at three IBD 50 stocks and one blue chip that fit that description.IPG Photonics (IPGP) makes fiber lasers for industrial uses. The company is based in Massachusetts, but last year about 82% of revenue came from outside North America.Annual earnings grew 842% in 2010 and 113% in 2011. Revenue jumped 61% and 59%, respectively, in those periods.IPG made several acquisitions in 2010-11, but they weren't the growth drivers. The drivers were new products and a growing market acceptance of fiber lasers, along with a rebound from a depressed world economy in 2009.The Street expects 19% EPS growth this year on a 19% revenue pop. Q4 results are expected to be reported in early February.IPG is slightly extended from a 61.61 buy point in a double-bottom base.Western Digital (WDC), a California-based hard drive maker, derives about 77% of revenue from outside the Americas.

388,IPG,"While known as a staple in chipmaking, lasers also are used to manufacture everything from razor blades to jet engines, and companies such as IPG Photonics  (IPGP) and Newport (NEWP) see the list of applications growing.
"
389,IPG,"Smaller sizes and lower costs have made lasers easier to incorporate in precision tools, replacing older technologies in factories and research labs.
"
390,IPG,"""You can do things with a laser that you just can't do with a mechanical blade,"" said Newport CEO Bob Phillippy.
"
391,IPG,"Lasers aren't just for cutting and welding. They're also used in scientific instruments, like those that generate images of cell membranes and what lies underneath them.
"
392,IPG,"Military To Civilian
"
393,IPG,"The military has long used lasers in targeting and surveillance, areas that could expand into some civilian uses, Phillippy says.
"
394,IPG,"Laser makers IPG Photonics, Newport, Coherent (COHR) and Rofin-Sinar (RSTI) have been logging double- and triple-digit profit and sales growth in recent quarters, helped by a rebounding manufacturing sector and federal stimulus spending.
"
395,IPG,"Fiber-based lasers and their lower operating costs also have been replacing gas-based lasers as users upgrade, says Mark Miller, an analyst with Noble Financial. Shares of IPG, which is especially known for its fiber-based lasers, have doubled this year. Coherent, Rofin-Sinar and Newport also make fiber-based lasers.
"
396,IPG,"Other factors helping laser makers include a revival among their chipmaker customers and the shifting of production to China, which boosts profit margins, Miller says.
"
397,IPG,"The end of stimulus spending and the cyclical nature of chipmaking are challenges, but laser makers are aided by having a diverse set of products and customers, he says.
"
398,IPG,"""It limits their exposure,"" Miller said.
"
399,IPG,"Some trends favor laser makers.
"
400,IPG,"For example, carmakers are adopting use of lasers to produce lighter, more fuel-efficient cars.
"
401,IPG,"Bill Shiner, IPG's vice president of industrial sales, says the car industry was slow to embrace fiber-based lasers, but IPG's laser sales to carmakers have taken off the past few years as the auto field began to recover and consumers started demanding better gas mileage.
"
402,IPG,"IPG's fiber-based lasers are good at penetrating the high-strength steel that car companies prefer for their lighter weight, Shiner says. Also, making car batteries, including those for hybrid and electric vehicles, is easier using laser welding.
"
403,IPG,"Laser prices have fallen, so more plants can afford to retool and upgrade for high-volume, high-precision manufacturing.
"
404,IPG,"Newer lasers are more powerful, use less energy and need less maintenance than older versions, Shiner says. Even diamond-based cutters, an alternative to lasers, wear out.
"
405,IPG,"""Finally, it's cost-justifiable,"" he said. ""It's just made things much more doable.""
"
406,IPG,"In new, fuel-efficient jet engines, lasers are used to drill millions of tiny holes in surfaces to keep the components cool, Shiner says.
"
407,IPG,"The wind-energy sector is looking to lasers to improve the corrosion resistance of turbines, which can be covered with another metal in a process called laser cladding, he says.
"
408,IPG,"Conventional energy companies like oil and gas drillers are also turning to laser cladding to refurbish their drill bits and pipes.
"
409,IPG,"Solar Picture Also Bright
"
410,IPG,"Solar energy has been shining on lasers as well, though Noble's Miller says the alternative energy industry is still a relatively small share of manufacturers' business.
"
411,IPG,"Lasers are needed in manufacturing thin-film solar cells because mechanical systems can't quickly and accurately etch tiny lines and holes in the film, said Phillippy. A mechanical tool can't make a hole a millionth of a meter wide.
"
412,IPG,"Even if the solar module market doesn't pan out, due to cuts in government subsidies or other factors, laser makers like Newport will be OK, Phillippy said.
"
413,IPG,"He sees more uses in scientific research, including gene sequencing and diagnostics. Utilization of lasers to correct vision impairment and to carve custom dental and medical implants also will grow, he says.
"
414,IPG,"Military technology like night-vision optics could find its way in commercial applications like car safety features and security cameras, he says.
"
415,IPG,"Advances in technology that have made lasers easier to use, smaller, more efficient and less costly will continue, Phillippy says, expanding the range of potential applications.

416,IPG,"""You don't have to make just one bet,"" he said.While known as a staple in chipmaking, lasers also are used to manufacture everything from razor blades to jet engines, and companies such as IPG Photonics  (IPGP) and Newport (NEWP) see the list of applications growing.Smaller sizes and lower costs have made lasers easier to incorporate in precision tools, replacing older technologies in factories and research labs.""You can do things with a laser that you just can't do with a mechanical blade,"" said Newport CEO Bob Phillippy.Lasers aren't just for cutting and welding. They're also used in scientific instruments, like those that generate images of cell membranes and what lies underneath them.Military To CivilianThe military has long used lasers in targeting and surveillance, areas that could expand into some civilian uses, Phillippy says.Laser makers IPG Photonics, Newport, Coherent (COHR) and Rofin-Sinar (RSTI) have been logging double- and triple-digit profit and sales growth in recent quarters, helped by a rebounding manufacturing sector and federal stimulus spending.Fiber-based lasers and their lower operating costs also have been replacing gas-based lasers as users upgrade, says Mark Miller, an analyst with Noble Financial. Shares of IPG, which is especially known for its fiber-based lasers, have doubled this year. Coherent, Rofin-Sinar and Newport also make fiber-based lasers.Other factors helping laser makers include a revival among their chipmaker customers and the shifting of production to China, which boosts profit margins, Miller says.The end of stimulus spending and the cyclical nature of chipmaking are challenges, but laser makers are aided by having a diverse set of products and customers, he says.""It limits their exposure,"" Miller said.Some trends favor laser makers.For example, carmakers are adopting use of lasers to produce lighter, more fuel-efficient cars.Bill Shiner, IPG's vice president of industrial sales, says the car industry was slow to embrace fiber-based lasers, but IPG's laser sales to carmakers have taken off the past few years as the auto field began to recover and consumers started demanding better gas mileage.IPG's fiber-based lasers are good at penetrating the high-strength steel that car companies prefer for their lighter weight, Shiner says. Also, making car batteries, including those for hybrid and electric vehicles, is easier using laser welding.Laser prices have fallen, so more plants can afford to retool and upgrade for high-volume, high-precision manufacturing.Newer lasers are more powerful, use less energy and need less maintenance than older versions, Shiner says. Even diamond-based cutters, an alternative to lasers, wear out.""Finally, it's cost-justifiable,"" he said. ""It's just made things much more doable.""In new, fuel-efficient jet engines, lasers are used to drill millions of tiny holes in surfaces to keep the components cool, Shiner says.The wind-energy sector is looking to lasers to improve the corrosion resistance of turbines, which can be covered with another metal in a process called laser cladding, he says.Conventional energy companies like oil and gas drillers are also turning to laser cladding to refurbish their drill bits and pipes.Solar Picture Also BrightSolar energy has been shining on lasers as well, though Noble's Miller says the alternative energy industry is still a relatively small share of manufacturers' business.Lasers are needed in manufacturing thin-film solar cells because mechanical systems can't quickly and accurately etch tiny lines and holes in the film, said Phillippy. A mechanical tool can't make a hole a millionth of a meter wide.Even if the solar module market doesn't pan out, due to cuts in government subsidies or other factors, laser makers like Newport will be OK, Phillippy said.He sees more uses in scientific research, including gene sequencing and diagnostics. Utilization of lasers to correct vision impairment and to carve custom dental and medical implants also will grow, he says.Military technology like night-vision optics could find its way in commercial applications like car safety features and security cameras, he says.Advances in technology that have made lasers easier to use, smaller, more efficient and less costly will continue, Phillippy says, expanding the range of potential applications.""You don't have to make just one bet,"" he said.

417,IPG,"Shares of Acxiom Corporation (ACXM  -  Free Report) have climbed about 15.3% in yesterday’s trading session, outperforming the market.In the year-to-date period, its shares have gained 43.1%, while the industry recorded growth of just 16.4%.Before we discuss how investors and analysts have reacted of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent fundamentals and trends in order to get a better understanding of the important drivers.Growth DriversAcxiom recently inked a deal with Interpublic Group (IPG  -  Free Report) to divest its Acxiom Marketing Solutions segment (“AMS”) for $2.3 billion in cash. Post sell-off, the company will change its brand name to LiveRamp and start trading under the new ticker “RAMP”.Acxiom has been devising methods to maximize the output of its AMS segment. The deal marks an expanded relationship between IPG and LiveRamp. The company now aims to focus on its ""LiveRamp"" segment which is registering impressive growth and gaining traction.The company had acquired LiveRamp for approximately $310 million in 2014. We feel the recent divestiture will further enhance the company’s ability to curb operating expenses and generate solid bottom-line growth along with greater financial flexibility.In the fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 results, revenues in the Marketing Services segment (accounted for 40.4% of total revenues) rose 5.3% year over year to $99 million, while LiveRamp revenues surged 32% year over year. This impressive growth trend bodes well for Acxiom. We believe reinforcing focus on LiveRamp segment holds promise in the longer haul.Upward Estimate RevisionsIn the last 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Axciom's current year witnessed upward revisions. For the current year, the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $1.03 per share, up from earnings of $1.02 per share earlier.Style Scores Look GreatAxciomcurrently sports an A grade for Growth and B grade for Momentum, lifting its overall VGM score to B.ValuationOn the valuation front too, the stock looks attractive. The company currently trades at a forward P/E multiple of 38.5x, significantly lower than the industry average of 64.8x. The ratio, which is obtained by dividing a stock’s current market price with its historical or estimated earnings, measures how much an investor needs to shell out per dollar of earnings. Consequently, lower the P/E of a stock, the better for investors.To ConcludeNotably, the stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). The company outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, delivering a positive average earnings surprise of 27.7%. Additionally, the stock has long-term earnings per share growth rate of 10%.In our opinion, the stock deserves a place in investor’s portfolio and we are expecting an impressive return from the stock in the next few months.Some better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector include NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report) and NetApp, Inc. (NTAP  -  Free Report), both sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.NVIDIA and NetApp have a long-term expected EPS growth rate of 10.3% and 13.8%, respectively.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6%, and +67.1%.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 19X over. Maybe even more remarkable is the fact that we're willing to share their latest stocks with you without cost or obligation.See Them Free>>

418,IPG,"The Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc. (IPG  -  Free Report) yesterday announced that it has inked a deal to purchase the Acxiom Marketing Solutions (AMS) business from Arkansas-based database marketing company — Acxiom Corporation (ACXM  -  Free Report). AMS is engaged in delivering data-related and analytical services.The deal has already received approval from the board of directors of both the companies. Subject to Acxiom shareholders’ approval and other customary regulatory approvals, the buyout is expected to close by the end of 2018.Deal Details and ExpectationsThe buyout will involve integration of AMS' expertise in data management with Interpublic’s media, creative, marketing services and analytics capabilities, global scale as well as consumer insights.The transaction is set at $2.3 billion in cash or $2.0 billion in net after considering an acquisition-related benefit from the tax step-up. The value of the deal is equivalent to 11.5 times of AMS’ expected 2018 EBITDA (inclusive of the tax step-up benefit).The acquisition is expected to be accretive to Interpublic’s adjusted earnings per share (EPS) in the year, after the deal closes. AMS will account for almost 8% of the combined entity`s revenues. Meanwhile, Acxiom expects to receive nearly $1.7 billion of net cash proceeds (assuming full payout of taxes and fees) from the sale. Acxiom plans to use the proceeds of the sale to invest in strategic growth opportunities, acquisitions, clearing off existing debt and rewarding shareholders through buybacks and cash tender initiation.On completion, Dennis Self and Rick Erwin will continue to serve as the co-presidents of AMS. The proposed deal does not include the takeover of LiveRamp business of Acxiom, which was acquired in 2014 for around $310 million.A glimpse at Interpublic’s price trend reveals that the stock has had an impressive run on the bourse on a year-to-date basis. The company’s shares have returned 14.2%, against the industry’s fall of 5.6%. IAN Segment Likely to Benefit Post deal closure, AMS will be aligned with IPG Mediabrands and operate as a stand-alone division.  Since IPG Mediabrands operates under Interpublic’s Integrated Agency Networks (IAN) segment, the deal is expected to boost the IAN segment. Revenues from the IAN segment contributed the largest chunk (around 84%) to Interpublic’s first-quarter 2018 net revenues. Revenues in this segment improved 6.5% year over year to $1.48 billion.Given strong demand for data-integrated and analytical services, we believe that Interpublic’s decision to acquire AMS is a prudent business move. Enhanced and innovative data-led offerings should strengthen the company’s market position and create more growth opportunities that will boost the top and the bottom line.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderCurrently, Interpublic is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.A few better-ranked stocks in the broader Business Services sector include Automatic Data Processing, Inc (ADP  -  Free Report) and The Dun & Bradstreet Corporation (DNB  -  Free Report). Both the stocks carry a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).The long-term expected EPS (three to five years) growth rate for Automatic Data Processing and Dun & Bradstreet Corporation are 11.3% and 6%, respectively.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

419,IPG,"A prudent investment decision involves buying stocks that have solid prospects and selling those that carry risks. At times, it is rational to hold certain stocks that have enough potential but are weighed down by tough market conditions.Here we focus on The Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc. (IPG  -  Free Report), which has an expected earnings growth rate of 24.1% for 2018. The company’s long-term earnings growth rate is projected at 7.4%.So far this year, shares of the company have gained 17.6% against the industry’s decline of 4.2%. We believe the stock has the potential to exceed expectations moving ahead. The reasons behind our optimism include Interpublic’s diversified business model and geographic reach, strong cash generation ability and consistent shareholder-friendly initiatives.Let’s discuss them in detail.Distinctive Competitive AdvantageInterpublic’s digital capabilities, diversified business model and geographic reach offer a distinctive competitive advantage over its peers. In the coming quarters, it is expected to achieve targeted levels based on diversification across emerging regions and collaboration/integration across agencies through technological improvement. The company also continues to look for strategic investments/acquisitions to expand in high-growth regions and key world markets.Flexibility to Pursue Growth Interpublic has a healthy balance sheet, courtesy of management’s strategic moves. In 2017, the company generated cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $791 million. It recorded $881.8 million of cash from operating activities in 2017 compared with $512.8 million in 2016 and $688.5 million in 2015.This significant amount of cash provides Interpublic with the flexibility to act on strategies for growth. Moreover, the company’s strong cash flow generating abilities make it a value buy for investors.Shareholder-Friendly InitiativesInterpublic’s consistent efforts to return value to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases are encouraging. The company paid dividends of $280.3 million, $238.4 million and $195.5 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Also, it repurchased shares worth $300.1 million, $303.3 million and $285.2 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015 each.On Feb 14, 2018, Interpublic’s board of directors announced a 17% dividend hike, raising the quarterly cash dividend to 21 cents per share. The company approved another $300 million share repurchase plan, while using $55 million to repurchase 2.4 million shares in the first quarter of 2018.Such moves reflect the company’s commitment to create value for shareholders and also underline its confidence in business. Apart from instilling investors’ confidence in the stock, these shareholder-friendly initiatives are expected to drive earnings per share.Zacks Rank & Key PicksInterpublic carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Some better-ranked stocks in the broader Business Services sector include The Dun & Bradstreet Corp. (DNB  -  Free Report), BG Staffing, Inc. (BGSF  -  Free Report) and FLEETCOR Technologies, Inc.

422,IPG,"This week was an eventful one with some of the major developments having a positive or negative impact on the global stock market. Below we discuss some of the biggest events that dominated the headlines and influenced the market:Trump-Kim DealThe historic summit between President Donald Trump and North Korea leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore has created history, possibly ending bitterness that lasted for 68 years. This is especially true as Trump and Kim signed an agreement, which offers undisclosed American “security guarantees” in exchange for a commitment from North Korea to “work toward complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.” Although this is a positive step, lack of details on the denuclearization process and talks of follow-up negotiation have disappointed Wall Street.  Peace talks have pushed the defense stocks down after the summit. Major defense players -- Raytheon RTN, Lockheed Martin (LMT  -  Free Report), Northrop Grumman (NOC  -  Free Report), Boeing (BA  -  Free Report) and General Dynamics (GD  -  Free Report) -- saw rough trading on the day following the announcement of denuclearization. Of these, NOC has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) while BA and RTN have a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.AT&T-Time Warner ApprovalU.S. District Court Judge Richard Leon approved AT&T’s (T  -  Free Report) $85.4 billion purchase of Time Warner  without any condition. The long-awaited decision has paved the way for a merger frenzy, which will change the landscape of the media industry. This is especially true, as Comcast (CMCSA  -  Free Report) has made a $65 billion or $35 per share bid to acquire the film production and studio assets of Twenty-First Century Fox FOXA. The move resulted in a bidding war with The Walt Disney Company (DIS  -  Free Report), which had struck a deal in November to acquire the same assets for $52.4 billion in an all-stock deal. Each of the stocks carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) while FOX downgraded to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).  Hawkish FedAs expected, the Fed has raised interest rates for the second time this year by 25 bps to 1.75-2%. This also marks the seventh rate hike since December 2015. The central bank signaled a hawkish outlook with two more lift-offs that would translate into four total increases in 2018. The decision has led to a spike in yields. The two-year Treasury yields, which are most sensitive to shifting expectations of Fed policy, rose faster than that of 10-year and 30-year yields, narrowing the spread between the short-term and long-term yields. In fact, the yields curve flattened to the levels last seen in August 2007.Generally, a rising rate scenario is highly profitable for banks, as they seek to borrow money at short-term rates and lend at long-term rates, thereby expanding net margins and bolstering banks’ profits. But this is not the case now as short-term rates are creeping higher and long-term rates are moving up slowly, leading to a decline in net margins. Still, Northern Trust Corporation (NTRS  -  Free Report) having a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and a Momentum Score of A seems an excellent pick as its earnings are expected to grow 33.13% year over year this year.Dovish ECBThe European Central Bank (ECB), currently buying €30 billion in monthly asset program, plans to reduce its asset purchases to €15 billion from October to December and then finally end the massive program. Additionally, the bank has pledged to keep interest rates at record lows at least through the summer of 2019 pointing to a dovish outlook. The move led to strong gains for European stocks, which are poised for the best week in more than three months, while euro fell sharply.A decline in euro will actually benefit exporters and the manufacturing industry, resulting in soaring stock prices. As a result, some of the top-ranked European ADRs are poised to outperform in the coming months. Statoil ASA EQNR with a market cap of $89.2 billion and SAP SE SAP with a market cap of $148 billion have a Zacks Rank #1 and 2, respectively.World Cup Buying FrenzyThe 2018 FIFA World Cup has kicked off in Russia with the high expectation of driving growth across zones, especially in industrial spaces such as media, advertising, restaurants, hotels and airlines. Some of the top-ranked (#1 or 2) stocks in these spaces include Twitter (TWTR  -  Free Report), Marriot Vacations Worldwide Corporation VAC, BJ's Restaurants, Inc. BJRI, Interpublic Group of Companies (IPG  -  Free Report), and SkyWest Inc. (SKYW  -  Free Report)  that could offer immense upside potential from the month-long event.Trump TariffTrump has approved of a plan to impose significant import tariffs on Chinese goods and is expected to announce today the first round of list for goods targeted for tariff. The move if enacted could lead to retaliation from China. Beijing earlier revealed a list of $50 billion in U.S. products that would face retaliatory tariffs, including beef and soybeans. As a result, meat producers like Tyson Foods Inc. TSN and Hormel Foods Corporation HRL could take a hit. Both stocks have a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

423,IPG,"A month has gone by since the last earnings report for The Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc. (IPG  -  Free Report). Shares have lost about 5.5% in that time frame.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is IPG due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Interpublic Misses Q1 Earnings & Revenue EstimatesThe Interpublic Group of Companies reported weak first-quarter 2018 results with revenues and earnings lagging the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Interpublic reported first-quarter 2018 GAAP loss of $14.1 million or loss of 4 cents per share against earnings of $24.7 million or 6 cents in the year-earlier quarter. Excluding non-recurring items, earnings of 3 cents missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1 cent.Interpublic’s first-quarter 2018 net revenues of $1,774 million also missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,793.1 million. However, the figure increased 5.9% year over year. The year-over-year growth was driven by favorable foreign currency movement of 3% and organic growth of 3.6%. There was a negative impact of 0.7% from net divestures.First-quarter 2018 total revenues were $2,169.1 million, up 5.1% from the year-ago quarter.Interpublic witnessed organic growth of 4.3% in the United States and 2.6% in international markets.Operating ResultsOperating income in first-quarter 2018 increased 11.8% year over year to $38.8 million. Operating margin on net revenue was 2.2% compared with 2.1% in the year-ago quarter. Operating margin on total revenue was 1.8% compared with 1.7% in the year-ago quarter. Operating expenses increased 5% from the year-ago quarter to $2,130.3 million.Balance Sheet Interpublic exited first-quarter 2018 with cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $597.4 million compared with $778.1 million in the year-ago quarter. As of Mar 31, 2018, total debt was $2.09 billion compared with $1.37 billion at the end of 2017.Share Repurchase Program and Dividend During the first quarter of 2018, the company repurchased 2.4 million shares at an aggregate cost of $54.9 million and an average price of $22.59 per share, including fees.During the reported quarter, the company also declared and paid a cash dividend of 21 cents per share, aggregating $80.8 million.2018 OutlookInterpublic reaffirmed its target for 2018. The company expects organic revenue growth of 2% to 3% and operating margin expansion of 60 to 70 basis points from its restated 2017 results.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed an upward trend in fresh estimates. There have been four revisions higher for the current quarter. In the past month, the consensus estimate has shifted by 15.8% due to these changes.Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc. (The) Price and Consensus Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc. (The) Price and Consensus | Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc. (The) QuoteVGM ScoresAt this time, IPG has a poor Growth Score of F, however its Momentum is doing a lot better with an A. However, the stock was allocated a grade of C on the value side, putting it in the middle 20% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of D. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.Our style scores indicate that the stock is more suitable for momentum investors than value investors.OutlookEstimates have been trending upward for the stock and the magnitude of these revisions looks promising. It comes with little surprise IPG has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). We expect an above average return from the stock in the next few months.

424,IPG,"Investors often overlook sales growth while picking stocks, as a company’s stock price is generally sensitive to its earnings momentum. However, earnings are quite vulnerable in the sense that books can be easily cooked and inflated. That’s why sales must always be taken into consideration while making any investment decision.Sales growth is actually an important indicator of a company's health and ability to sustain its business. It provides investors an insight into product demand and pricing power. The main advantage is that the sales figure is generally not manipulated and is less volatile than earnings.Without some top-line growth, the bottom-line improvement may not be sustainable in the long term. While a company can show earnings strength by reducing expenses, a sustainable bottom-line recovery usually requires sales growth.Focusing solely on sales growth is not enough though. A healthy sales growth rate is certainly a positive indicator for picking good stocks but it does not ensure profits. Therefore, taking into consideration a company’s cash position along with its sales number can prove to be a more dependable strategy.Substantial cash on hand and a steady cash flow give a company more flexibility with respect to business decisions and potential investments. Cash also enables a company to endure market downturns. Most importantly, a sufficient cash position indicates that revenues are being channelized in the right direction.Selecting the Winning StocksIn order to shortlist stocks that have witnessed impressive sales growth along with a high cash balance, we have selected 5-Year Historical Sales Growth (%) greater than X-Industry and Cash Flow more than $500 million as our main screening parameters.But sales growth and cash strength are not the absolute criteria for selecting stocks. So, we added certain other factors to arrive at a winning strategy.Price-to-Sales (P/S) Ratio less than X-Industry: This metric determines the value placed on each dollar of a company’s revenues. The lower the ratio, the better it is for picking a stock since the investor is paying less for each unit of sales.% Change F1 Sales Estimate Revisions (four weeks) greater than X-Industry: Better-than-industry estimate revision has often been seen to trigger an increase in stock price.Operating Margin (average last five years) greater than 5%: Operating margin measures how much every dollar of a company's sales translates into profits. A high ratio indicates that the company has good cost control and sales are increasing faster than costs, an optimal situation for the company.Return on Equity (ROE) greater than 5%: This metric will ensure that sales growth is translated into profits and the company is not hoarding cash. A high ROE means the company is spending wisely and is in all likelihood profitable.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.

425,IPG,"A prudent investment decision involves buying stocks that have solid prospects and selling those that carry risks. At times, it is rational to hold certain stocks that have enough potential but are weighed down by tough market conditions.Here we focus on The Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc. (IPG  -  Free Report), which has an expected earnings growth rate of 24.1% for 2018. The company’s long-term earnings growth rate is projected at 7.4%.So far this year, shares of the company have gained 15.7% against the industry’s decline of 3.4%. We believe the stock has the potential to exceed expectations moving ahead. The reasons behind our optimism include Interpublic’s diversified business model and geographic reach, strong cash generation ability and consistent shareholder-friendly initiatives. Let’s discuss them in detail.Distinctive Competitive AdvantageInterpublic’s digital capabilities, diversified business model and geographic reach offer a distinctive competitive advantage over its peers. In the coming quarters, it is expected to achieve targeted levels based on diversification across emerging regions and collaboration/integration across agencies through technological improvement. The company also continues to look for strategic investments/acquisitions to expand in high-growth regions and key world markets.Flexibility to Pursue Growth Interpublic has a healthy balance sheet, courtesy of management’s strategic moves. In 2017, the company generated cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $791 million. It recorded $881.8 million of cash from operating activities in 2017 compared with $512.8 million in 2016 and $688.5 million in 2015.This significant amount of cash provides Interpublic with the flexibility to act on strategies for growth. Moreover, the company’s strong cash flow generating abilities make it a value buy for investors.Shareholder-Friendly InitiativesInterpublic’s consistent efforts to return value to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases are encouraging. The company paid dividends of $280.3 million, $238.4 million and $195.5 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Also, it repurchased shares worth $300.1 million, $303.3 million and $285.2 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015 each.On Feb 14, 2018, Interpublic’s board of directors announced a 17% dividend hike, raising the quarterly cash dividend to 21 cents per share. The company approved another $300 million share repurchase plan, while using $55 million to repurchase 2.4 million shares in the first quarter of 2018.Such moves reflect the company’s commitment to create value for shareholders and also underline its confidence in business. Apart from instilling investors’ confidence in the stock, these shareholder-friendly initiatives are expected to drive earnings per share.Zacks Rank & Key PicksInterpublic carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Some better-ranked stocks in the broader Business Services sector include The Dun & Bradstreet Corp. (DNB  -  Free Report), BG Staffing, Inc. (BGSF  -  Free Report) and FLEETCOR Technologies, Inc.

426,IPG,"Sales growth is an important metric for any company, as it is a vital part of growth projections and influences strategic decision-making. By monitoring this key metric over multiple time periods, one can clearly understand a company’s growth trend.Sales growth is essential to justify the fixed and variable expenses incurred to run a business. Low revenues lead to unprofitability of business and disappointing financial results. Stagnant companies may generate near-term profit but can’t rev up enough growth to attract new investors.Also, in a growing economy, lack of sales growth most likely denotes that the company is not gaining market share over its competitors. In simple terms, some sustained sales growth is necessary to support the bottom line.Focusing solely on sales growth is not enough though. A healthy sales growth rate is certainly a positive indicator for picking good stocks, but it does not ensure profits. Hence, taking into consideration a company’s cash position along with its sales number can prove to be a more dependable strategy.Substantial cash on hand and a steady cash flow give a company more flexibility with respect to business decisions and potential investments. Cash also enables a company to endure market downturns. Most importantly, a sufficient cash position indicates that revenues are being channelized in the right direction.Selecting the Winning StocksIn order to shortlist stocks that have witnessed impressive sales growth along with a high cash balance, we have selected 5-Year Historical Sales Growth (%) greater than X-Industry and Cash Flow more than $500 million as our main screening parameters.But sales growth and cash strength are not the absolute criteria for selecting stocks. So, we added certain other factors to arrive at a winning strategy.Price-to-Sales (P/S) Ratio less than X-Industry: This metric determines the value placed on each dollar of a company’s revenues. The lower the ratio, the better it is for picking a stock since the investor is paying less for each unit of sales.% Change F1 Sales Estimate Revisions (four weeks) greater than X-Industry: Better-than-industry estimate revision has often been seen to trigger an increase in stock price.Operating Margin (average last five years) greater than 5%: Operating margin measures how much every dollar of a company's sales translates into profits. A high ratio indicates that the company has good cost control and sales are increasing faster than costs, an optimal situation for it.Return on Equity (ROE) greater than 5%: This metric will ensure that sales growth is translated into profits and the company is not hoarding cash. A high ROE means the company is spending wisely and is in all likelihood profitable.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Here are five of the 13 stocks that qualified the screening:Based in Kenosha, WI, Snap-on Incorporated (SNA  -  Free Report) manufactures and markets tools, equipment, diagnostics, and repairs information and systems solutions. Expected sales growth rate for the current year is 4% and the stock carries a Zacks Rank #2.Polaris Industries Inc. (PII  -  Free Report) designs, engineers, manufactures, and markets power sports vehicles. This Medina, MN-based company’s expected sales growth rate for 2018 is 9.4% and it carries a Zacks Rank #2.The Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc.

Its current-year expected sales growth rate is 7.3% and the stock carries a Zacks Rank #2.Headquartered in Palo Alto, CA, VMware, Inc.

427,IPG,"A prudent investment decision involves buying well-performing stocks at the right time while selling those that are at risk. A rise in share price and strong fundamentals signal a stock’s bullish run.The Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc. (IPG  -  Free Report) is a marketing and advertising services provider that has performed extremely well lately and has the potential to sustain the momentum in the near term. Consequently, if you haven’t taken advantage of the share price appreciation yet, it’s time you add the stock to your portfolio.What Makes Interpublic an Attractive Pick? An Outperformer: A glimpse of the company’s price trend reveals that the stock has had an impressive run on the bourse in the past six months. Shares of Interpublic have returned a massive 26.9%, which compares favorably with the industry’s gain of 7.1%. Solid Zacks Rank: Interpublic currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 offer the best investment opportunities for investors. Thus, the company appears to be a compelling investment proposition at the moment.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Northward Estimate Revisions: The direction of estimate revisions serves as an important pointer when it comes to the price of a stock. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Interpublic’s current-quarter earnings increased 13.5% to 42 cents per share. Estimates for 2018 increased 2.9% to $1.75 per share. For 2019, earnings have moved up 2.2% to $1.86 per share.Strong Growth Prospects: The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 earnings indicates year-over-year growth of 24.1%. Moreover, earnings are expected to register 6.6% growth in 2019. The stock has long-term expected earnings per share growth rate of 6.7%.Growth FactorsStrong Business Model Interpublic’s digital capabilities, diversified business model and geographic reach offer a distinctive competitive advantage. The company is expected to achieve targeted levels in the coming quarters based on diversification across emerging regions and collaboration/integration across agencies through technological improvement. Moreover, the company continues to look for strategic investments/acquisitions to expand in high-growth regions and key world markets.Further, Interpublic looks strong on the back of higher organic revenue growth. In 2017, organic revenue growth of 1.8% was aided by growth across its major geographic regions, which was primarily a result of growth with existing clients. In the United States, organic growth was driven by its media and advertising disciplines. Internationally, organic increase can be attributed to strong growth within its media discipline, with remarkable contributions from Continental Europe and Other region, primarily Canada. In the first quarter, organic growth in the United States was 4.3% and 2.6% in international markets.Notably, in first-quarter 2018, organic growth resulted in a 3.6% increase in net revenues. It marked an improvement from 3.3% organic growth in fourth-quarter 2017. Further, the company expects organic growth to positively impact revenues by 2-3% in 2018.Encouraging Balance SheetInterpublic has a strong balance sheet driven by the management’s prudent moves.

The company generated $881.8 million of cash from operating activities in 2017 compared with $512.8 million in 2016 and $688.5 million in 2015. The significant amount of cash provides it the flexibility to pursue any growth strategy. The company’s strong cash flow generating abilities make it a value buy for investors.Shareholder-Friendly MovesWe are impressed by Interpublic’s consistent efforts to return value to shareholders in the form of dividend and share repurchases. Interpublic paid dividends of $280.3 million, $238.4 million and $195.5 million,, respectively in 2017, 2016 and 2015. The company repurchased shares amounting to $300.1 million, $303.3 million and $285.2 million, in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.On Feb 14, 2018, the company’s board of directors announced a 17% dividend hike, raising the quarterly cash dividend to 21 cents per share. The company also approved another $300 million share repurchase plan, while using $55 million to repurchase 2.4 million shares in the first quarter of 2018. The company still has 400 million left on its outstanding repurchase authorization.Such moves indicate the company’s commitment to create value for shareholders and underline its confidence in its business. These shareholder-friendly initiatives not only instill investors’ confidence but also positively impact earnings per share.Other Stocks to ConsiderSome other top-ranked stocks in the broader Business Services sector include The Dun & Bradstreet Corporation (DNB  -  Free Report), Automatic Data Processing (ADP  -  Free Report), and Broadridge Financial Solutions Inc.

Based in Sao Paulo, Brazil, Cappuccino is a digital marketing and technology agency. The financial terms of the deal have been kept under wraps.The deal, effective immediately, will see integration of Weber Shandwick's public relations and integrated marketing capabilities with Cappuccino's specialization in digital content, technology production and strategic planning. It is expected to boost Weber Shandwick’s creativity and digital strategy.Cappuccino offers an extensive range of digital offerings in the form of content creation, social media, mobile, paid distribution, SEO and design and development. Further, Cappuccino has already conducted digital campaigns for several top local and multinational organizations in Brazil, with clients like Ajinomoto, Arcor, Boeringher Ingelheim and Citi.With broader exposure to the Brazilian market, the buyout of Cappuccino should help Weber Shandwick strengthen its foothold across Latin America. Of late, Weber Shandwick has been busy in expanding its operations in Latin America to meet the growing demand from domestic and multinational companies in the region. It already has owned and operated offices in Brazil, Colombia and Mexico and affiliates in Argentina, Chile and Peru.

432,IPG,"Similar to wise buying decisions, exiting certain underperformers at the right time helps maximize portfolio returns. Selling off losers can be difficult, but if both the share price and estimates are falling, it could be time to get rid of the security before more losses hit your portfolio.One such stock that you may want to consider dropping is Clear Channel Outdoor Holdings, Inc. (CCO  -  Free Report), which has witnessed a significant price decline in the past four weeks, and it has seen negative earnings estimate revisions for the current quarter and the current year. A Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) further confirms weakness in CCO.A key reason for this move has been the negative trend in earnings estimate revisions. For the full year, we have seen one estimate move down in the past 30 days, compared with no upward revisions. This trend has caused the consensus estimate to trend lower, going from a loss of 16 cents a share a month ago to its current level of a loss of 25 cents.Also, for the current quarter, Clear Channel Outdoor has seen one downward estimate revision versus no revisions in the opposite direction, dragging the consensus estimate down to a loss of 19 cents a share from a loss of 15 cents over the past 30 days.   The stock also has seen some pretty dismal trading lately, as the share price has dropped 10.1% in the past month.Clear Channel Outdoor Holdings, Inc.

438,IPG,"The Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc. (IPG  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 27, before the opening bell.While we expect the company to witness solid sales on the back of higher organic growth, favorable foreign currency movements and extensive global presence, seasonality in business is likely to hurt the bottom line.We observe that shares of Interpublic have rallied 19.7% over the past six months, significantly outperforming the S&P 500’s gain of 4.6%. The industry to which it belongs, declined 1.6% in the same time frame. Organic Growth & Favorable Currency to Drive RevenuesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues for the to-be-reported quarter stands at $1,815 million, reflecting year-over-year growth of 3.5%. The top line is expected to benefit from higher organic growth and favorable foreign currency movements.Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc. (The) Revenue (TTM)  Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc. (The) Revenue (TTM) | Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc. (The) QuoteFurther, strategic investments and acquisitions to expand in key global markets augur well.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues from United States is pegged at $1,128 million, reflecting year-over-year growth of 1.4%.In fourth-quarter 2017, segment revenues climbed 2.2% year over year to $1,286 million.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues from international markets is pegged at $681 million, reflecting year-over-year growth of 6.1%.

There was a negative impact of 1.1% from net divestures.Bottom Line to Decline Year Over YearThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings per share is pegged at 4 cents, indicating year-over-year decline of 20%. The company’s earnings are likely to be negatively impacted by seasonality in business that results from clients’ fluctuating annual media spending budgets and changing media spending patterns. A significant impact of this seasonality is observed in the first quarter. This will however be partially offset by the benefits from the tax reform.In fourth-quarter 2017, adjusted earnings rose 5.3% from the year-ago quarter to 79 cents per share. The company witnessed a tax benefit (as a result of lower tax) of $31 million in fourth-quarter 2017.Our Model Doesn’t Suggest a BeatPlease note that according to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive Earnings ESP.

Lower tax rate, resulting from Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, significantly benefited the company’s earnings in the reported quarter.Total revenues of $537 surpassed the consensus mark by 6.1% and were up 18% (17% on a constant-currency basis). The improvement was driven by strong double-digit growth in each of the operating segments — U.S. Information Services (USIS), International and Consumer Interactive — positive contribution from acquisitions of DataLink services, FactorTrust and eBureau  as well as contribution from incremental credit monitoring business from a competitor.Shares barely moved in the afterhours trading, following the earnings release.

Notably, the reported earnings exceeded the midpoint of the first-quarter guidance range by 8 cents.The bottom line was driven by improvement in operating metrics and favorable foreign currency movements.

It has amassed assets over $427.47 M, making it one of the average sized ETFs attempting to match the Large Cap Value segment of the US equity market.Why Large Cap ValueCompanies that find themselves in the large cap category typically have a market capitalization above $10 billion. Considered a more stable option, large cap companies boast more predictable cash flows and are less volatile than their mid and small cap counterparts.Carrying lower than average price-to-earnings and price-to-book ratios, value stocks also have lower than average sales and earnings growth rates. When you look at long-term performance, value stocks have outperformed growth stocks in nearly all markets. But in strong bull markets, growth stocks are more likely to be winners.CostsExpense ratios are an important factor in the return of an ETF and in the long term, cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive counterparts, other things remaining the same.Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.07%, making it one of the least expensive products in the space.It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 3.99%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsETFs offer a diversified exposure and thus minimize single stock risk but it is still important to delve into a fund's holdings before investing.

(FE  -  Free Report) and Interpublic Group Of Companies Inc. (IPG  -  Free Report).The top 10 holdings account for about 13.91% of total assets under management.Performance and RiskSPYD seeks to match the performance of the S&P 500 High Dividend Index before fees and expenses. The S&P 500 High Dividend Index is designed to measure the performance of the top 80 dividend-paying securities listed on the S&P 500 Index, based on dividend yield.The ETF has lost about -1.93% so far this year and was up about 7.73% in the last one year (as of 04/19/2018).

444,IPG,"Sales growth is an important metric for any company, as it is a vital part of growth projections and instrumental in strategic decision-making. It provides an insight into product demand and pricing power. By monitoring this key metric over multiple time periods, one can easily understand a company’s growth trend.Sales growth is important to justify the fixed and variable expenses incurred to operate a business. Low revenues lead to an unprofitable business and disappointing financial performance. Stagnant companies may generate near-term profit but can’t rev up enough growth to attract new investors.Also, in a growing economy, lack of sales growth most likely denotes that the company is not gaining market share over its competitors. In simple terms, some sustained sales growth is essential to support the bottom line.Focusing solely on sales growth is not enough though. A healthy sales growth rate is certainly a positive indicator for picking good stocks, but it does not ensure profits. So, taking into consideration a company’s cash position along with its sales number can prove to be a more dependable strategy.Substantial cash on hand and a steady cash flow give a company more flexibility with respect to business decisions and potential investments. Cash also enables a company to endure market downturns. Most importantly, a sufficient cash position indicates that revenues are being channelized in the right direction.Picking the Winning StocksIn order to shortlist stocks that have witnessed impressive sales growth along with a high cash balance, we have selected 5-Year Historical Sales Growth (%) greater than X-Industry and Cash Flow greater than $500 million as our main screening parameters.But sales growth and cash strength are not the absolute criteria for selecting stocks. So, we added certain other factors to arrive at a winning strategy.Price-to-Sales (P/S) Ratio less than X-Industry: This metric determines the value placed on each dollar of a company’s revenues. The lower the ratio, the better it is for picking a stock since the investor is paying less for each unit of sales.% Change F1 Sales Estimate Revisions (4 Weeks) greater than X-Industry: Better-than-industry estimate revision has often been seen to trigger an increase in stock price.Operating Margin (Average Last 5 years) greater than 5%: Operating margin measures how much every dollar of a company's sales translates into profits. A high ratio indicates that the company has good cost control and sales are increasing faster than costs, an optimal situation for the company.Return on Equity (ROE) greater than 5%: This metric will ensure that sales growth is translated into profits and the company is not hoarding cash. A high ROE means the company is spending wisely and is in all likelihood profitable.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.

446,IPG,"The Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc. (IPG  -  Free Report) reported third-quarter 2017 GAAP earnings of $146.2 million or 37 cents per share, up from $128.6 million or 32 cents in the year-earlier quarter. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to a fall in operating expenses.Adjusted earnings remained constant year over year at 31 cents per share, but missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 33 cents.Quarter in DetailRevenues for the reported quarter were $1,902.6 million, down 1% from the prior-year period.

It currently expects organic growth in the range of 1-2%, with a 40 basis points improvement in operating margins.Our TakeInterpublic is poised to grow on the back of its strong digital capabilities, diversified business model and extensive geographic presence. The company is anticipated to achieve targeted levels in the upcoming quarters based on diversification across emerging regions along with collaboration and integration across agencies through technological improvement. Moreover, strategic investments and acquisitions to expand in key global markets augur well .However, the fact remains that the company forms part of the communications industry, which is highly competitive in nature. Agencies and media services compete with other agencies and creative or media services providers to maintain existing client relationships and to win new clients. These are likely to pose challenges to its prospects.Interpublic currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks worth considering in the same space include The Brink's Company  (BCO  -  Free Report), Envestnet, Inc (ENV  -  Free Report) and Gartner, Inc.

The company is anticipated to achieve targeted levels in the upcoming quarters based on diversification across emerging regions along with collaboration and integration across agencies through technological improvement. Moreover, strategic investments and acquisitions to expand in key global markets augur well for the company.Going ahead, the company plans to focus on de-leveraging and improving its balance sheet as well asreducing effective cost of debt. The Group’s best-in-industry talent and tools are anticipatedto offer optimal and affordable solutions, thus rendering an edge over its peers.  The company’s efforts in reducing costs, continuous margin improvement, stronger balance sheet and better capital structure is anticipatedtoaidbottom-line growth in the to-be reported quarter.Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues from the International markets in the to-be-reported quarter currently remains high at $762 million compared with second-quarter revenues of $724 million. Moreover, revenues from Constituency Management Group segment are also anticipated to be high with an estimate of $428 million compared with reported revenues of $347 million in the prior quarter.Despite these positives, the fact remains that the company forms part of the communications industry, which is highly competitive in nature. Agencies and media services compete with other agencies and creative or media services providers to maintain existing client relationships and to win new clients. These are likely to pose challenges toits prospects.Furthermore, constrained marketing budgets from big clients are anticipatedto slow down organic growth and lead to account loss for Interpublic, which may hamper its financial position going forward.

453,IPG,"The Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc. (IPG  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 results before the opening bell on Jul 25. Notably, over the trailing four quarters, the company reported an average positive surprise of 43.59%, beating estimates thrice.New York-based Interpublic is one of the world’s leading providers of marketing and advertising services. It forms an integral part of the communication industry and is highly competitive in nature. Headwinds in the currency market have left investors a little edgy about what the quarter holds for them.Factors to ConsiderInterpublic’s digital capabilities, diversified business model and geographic reach offer a distinctive competitive advantage. The company is expected to achieve targeted levels in the coming quarters based on diversification across emerging regions and collaboration and integration across agencies through technological improvement. Moreover, it continues to look for strategic investments and acquisitions to expand in high-growth regions and key world markets.Moving ahead, the company plans to focus on de-leveraging and improving its balance sheet and reducing effective cost of debt. The Group’s best-in-industry talent and tools are expected to offer optimal and affordable solutions, thus providing an edge over its peers.  The company’s efforts to reduce costs, improve margin, create stronger balance sheet and better capital structure aid in increasing returns and profitability.During the quarter, the company announced that it had elevated five senior leaders into new roles to deliver more integrated client services across the firm's North America markets. This transformation in the company’s management will help it function more efficiently across North America. In turn, this will help the company augment its revenue turnover using the expertise of its management.However, the company forms part of the communications industry, which is highly competitive in nature. Agencies and media services compete with other agencies and creative or media services providers to maintain existing client relationships and to win new clients. Also, keeping in view the service-oriented nature of the whole industry, it becomes imperative for the company to increase the count of talented employees as well as retain the existing ones. These are likely to pose challenges to the company’s prospects.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Interpublic will beat earnings this time. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP:Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is 0.00%.
