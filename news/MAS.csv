5,MAS,"As the current bull market approaches its ninth year and signs of sector rotation and a possible top emerge, now is a good time to see who joins Apple (AAPL), Intel (INTC) and Bank of America (BAC) on IBD's latest list of new buys by top-performing mutual funds.X Over the last three months, these leading fund managers have continued to pick up shares in semiconductor-related stocks like Intel and Texas Instruments (TXN), building sector names like leading homebuilder Pulte Group (PHM) and construction products manufacturer Masco (MAS), as well as several industrial machinery companies, including Parker-Hannifin (PH) and Illinois Tool Works (ITW).With tensions around North Korea's nuclear missile program rising, it's not surprising that these funds have also been investing in defense contractors, including Aerojet Rocketdyne (AJRD) and Heico (HEI).Apple, Intel and BofA topped the list in terms of money invested. Seventy-four funds invested an estimated total of $2.3 billion in Intel, while 97 funds scooped up nearly $2 billion of Apple shares. Eighty-nine funds put $1.3 billion into Bank of America.Apple broke out on Oct. 27, but after a short rise has eased back to form a new flat base showing a possible 176.34 entry. Intel has pulled back after making a solid gain from an early October breakout. The chip giant is now testing support at its 10-week line and appears to be setting up a new base with a possible 47.40 buy point.BofA remains extended after clearing a 25.45  entry on Sept. 27. The financial titan is currently 13% above the buy point.Several stocks on this month's list are in or near a potential buy zone, but keep in mind that recent selling pressure in the major indexes and pullbacks by several leading stocks means the current uptrend could be starting to roll over into a correction.

The pattern is part of a long, first-stage base-on-base formation.Fellow defense contractor Aerojet Rocketdyne is also working on a base, but is trading below its 10-week moving average with a lagging RS line.Regional bank stock Synovus Financial (SNV) jumped past a 47.77 entry on Nov. 28, but has now pulled back to test that buy point once again.Three stocks on the list currently pay a dividend yielding at least 2% on an annualized basis: Texas Instruments (2.5%), Intel (2.5%), New Mexico-based electricity utility PNM Resources (PNM) (2.4%) and Dover (DOV) (2%).For a look at how to generate income with stocks and mutual funds without taking on undue risk, see IBD's new special report on income investing.JPMorgan Chase (JPM) topped the list of new sells, with 94 net sellers (163 funds selling minus 69 buying).

12,MAS,"The market fell Monday, but the major U.S. indexes had sharply pared their losses by the close.Today's ETF picks moved in opposite directions, yet both could offer fresh opportunities to buy shares soon. Keep in mind the market uptrend is under pressure, which means all purchases are riskier.SPDR S&P Homebuilders (XHB) added 0.6% to extend its win streak to four and mark its highest close since August 2015. Shares cleared a 38.51 buy point of a flat base Tuesday, which formed adjacent to a prior flat base, and is still in buy range. Before that, the ETF advanced more than 8% from a December breakout.The fund, launched in January 2006, has attracted about $1.1 billion in assets. It tracks the S&P Homebuilders Select Industry Index, which is made up of housing-related stocks that trade on the major U.S. exchanges. Top 10 holdings in XHB as of June 9 included cabinet and plumbing products maker Masco (MAS), home improvement giant  (Home) (HD) and homebuilders D.R. Horton (DHI) and Toll Bros.

But the day's action was bullish when you consider shares had fallen as much as 2.2% intraday. XLK found support at its 50-day moving average and reversed higher from there in heavy volume.Such a rebound off the 50-day or 10-week line can set up an opportunity to add shares, particularly if they continue to make a strong bounce. The December 1998-launched ETF ended Monday 2% above the 50-day line. A confirmed market uptrend would make for a more ideal environment for a rebound, however. It gapped higher Tuesday, rising 0.6%.The $17.1 billion fund, which tracks the S&P Information Technology Select Sector Index, owns Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Facebook (FB) and Alphabet (GOOGL) among its top 10 holdings.

18,MAS,"The U.S. economy is picking up steam, yet the Federal Reserve is reluctant to put the brakes on its ultra-liquid monetary policy. How do these factors influence an investor's stock-picking strategy?Actually, not that much. Although second-quarter GDP growth (at 3.7%) is encouraging, and Wall Street economists see GDP strengthening in Q3 and Q4 this year, investors should focus on companies that are widely expected to post solid double-digit earnings increases not only in the current full year but in the next fiscal year.Today's Your Weekly Review offers a decent supply of choices to that end. Let's boil the list down further by focusing only on those stocks that are trading, say, only 5% below their 52-week peaks or less. That's far better than the maximum 15% level below the 52-week high as demanded by the screen.Nike (NKE) is building a base that is approaching six weeks in length. It's just 1% off its all-time high of 117.72. The shoe and athletic apparel and equipment maker is part of the No. 1 Apparel sector, as ranked in IBD's stock research tables.

22,MAS,"Now that its $650 million merger with cabinet manufacturer Norcraft is a done deal, Fortune Brands Home & Security (FBHS) is looking for new acquisitions to build out its house of home products.It's big in cabinets, doors, faucets and security locks and safes.What's next on the company's to-do list?""We completed all the cabinet acquisitions we need; we're very well positioned there,"" Chief Financial Officer Lee Wyatt told IBD.Fortune Brands sells more than a dozen cabinet brands for kitchens and baths to thousands of small dealers as well as home center chains such as Home Depot (HD) and Lowe's (LOW). But its top faucet in North America, Moen, could use some company, Wyatt says.""The top 10% (in faucets) is luxury, the bottom 15% is private label. And 75% is everything in the middle, where Moen plays,"" he said.If Fortune Brands were, for instance, to add luxury faucets to its lineup, it could leverage its U.S. distribution channel and add a new brand to more than 1,000 of its Moen stores in China.""We're in talks with many potential targets,"" Wyatt said. ""Hopefully plumbing will be our next acquisition.""Fortune Brands is a lot of things, but one common theme is its acquisitive streak.A $1.1 Billion Spending SpreeSince it spun off from its consumer-brands namesake in 2011, leaving the Jim Beam liquor business with its former parent, now known as Beam Suntory, Fortune has spent $1.1 billion on acquisitions. It also spent $500 million on share buybacks and $200 million on dividends over that time.Robert Wetenhall, an analyst with RBC Capital Markets, calls Fortune Brands a ""best in class"" home-products company, with brands that have leading market positions in all its four major categories: cabinets, plumbing, doors and personal security products.Beside Moen, it enjoys the leading share with MasterBrand cabinets, Therma-Tru entry doors and Master Lock padlocks.Moen has a 30% share of the faucet market in the U.S., followed by Masco (MAS), the maker of Delta faucets, with a share in the low 20% area, Wyatt says. Kohler is No. 3. In the more fragmented cabinet market, Fortune has a 20%-25% share, with Masco No. 2 and American Woodmark (AMWD) No. 3, Wyatt says.""In the cabinet industry, more than 50% of the market share comes from small local manufacturers,"" he said. ""We have multiple trade brands in cabinets, but brands are not as important as they are in plumbing. Many consumers don't recognize the (cabinet) brands.""Our real customer in the cabinet space is the kitchen designer who works in a dealer or home center,"" he continued. ""We don't advertise the brands as such. Roughly 6,000 small kitchen and bath dealers drive over 50% of the demand for cabinets. Home centers are the next biggest, about one-third of industry demand.""On the other hand, faucets and security products are marketed and advertised directly to consumers.Windows Out, Doors InFortune Brands said one reason it sold Simonton Windows last September was to focus ""more sharply"" on its Therma-Tru entry doors.Fortune Brands is well positioned to ride the ongoing recovery in new-home construction and home repairs and remodeling. Most of its business is in the U.S., but it also sells products in Canada, China (chiefly with Moen) and Europe (mainly with Master Lock).Residential building in China has slowed, but Wyatt says Moen stores have ""stayed strong"" as units in newly developed multifamily complexes are sold. Units aren't usually finished with plumbing fixtures.""As they sell out units, buyers come to our (Moen) stores. They could be coming to us for several years as units are sold.""In the U.S., Fortune Brands expects the U.S. housing market to return to a typical ""steady"" pace of 1.5 million home starts annually by 2018, including single- and multifamily units. That would be up from just 600,000 in 2011 and about 1.1 million this year.But an even bigger part of the market that Fortune Brands sells into is repair and remodeling, which accounts for about two-thirds of revenue. The company sees that market, which had been lagging in recent years, growing by 5% this year and then moving to a normal rate of 5% to 6% annual growth.""We've got a little more room to grow (in repair and remodeling),"" Wyatt said.Management expects U.S. home-product sales overall to see faster growth in the second half of the year than the first half, for full-year growth of 6% to 8%. But they expect the company to outperform the overall market. With Norcraft factored in, the company now sees 2015 net sales growth of 13% to 15%.In its Q2 report on July 22, Fortune Brands raised full-year earnings guidance on the low end, to $2.03-$2.10 from $2-$2.10 previously, including an expected 4-5 cents from Norcraft. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters forecast earnings of $2.06, for an 18% year-over-year gain, and 22% next year. Revenue this year is seen by analysts rising 15% to $4.6 billion.Norcraft Spikes SalesThomson Reuters noted Q2 earnings of 59 cents beat consensus by 2 cents. The company reported second-quarter revenue up 13% to $1.17 billion. Cabinet sales jumped 18% to $550.9 million. Excluding the impact from Norcraft, which closed May 12, sales grew 8%.Norcraft increased Fortune Brand's presence in the dealer channel where, as analyst Kenneth Zener of KeyBanc Capital Markets noted, there is ""higher-end buyer demand.""Plumbing sales rose less, 5% to $358 million, but those products come with higher margins than cabinets.Growth in door sales slowed from a year-ago, but margin on earnings before interest and taxes improved to 12.9% from 8.8% last year.Security sales jumped 28% to $138.6 million, driven by the acquisition of Sentry Safe last year.Top Ratings Among MidcapsDespite Fortune Brands' share-price gains since its Q2 report, RBC Capital Markets says the company ""remains our best idea"" for midcap investors who combine tenets of growth and value investing.Barclays is ""overweight"" on the name due mainly to ""a strong management team and a portfolio of industry leading brands."" KeyBanc Capital is also ""overweight."" JPMorgan is neutral.Fortune Brands is highly scored by IBD, with a Composite Rating of 96 out of a best-possible 99. Masco, which broke out on July 28 after a strong earnings report, has a Composite Rating of 96.Acuity Brands (AYI), a lighting supplier, has a 99 rating.

"
31,MAS,"Investors will find out how housing-related stocks Caesarstone Sdot-Yam (CSTE) and Mohawk Industries (MHK) fared in the second quarter when they report results in coming days.If analysts are right, the results will be a mixed bag.Caesarstone, an Israeli quartz surface maker, is expected to end its recent streak of double-digit profit growth when it reports the quarter's results on Wednesday before the market opens. But sales growth is expected to accelerate from the prior quarter as the high rated maker of counter tops, vanities and other quartz surfaces benefits from the ongoing housing recovery and uptick in remodeling spending.High rated Mohawk, a global flooring manufacturer, is seen posting its 14th straight quarter of double-digit earnings growth when it reports results for the second quarter on Thursday. But the growth rate is seen slowing from the prior quarter. Sales growth is expected to be about the same as the prior quarter.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect Caesarstone's earnings to rise 7% to 62 cents a share. That would mark the smallest quarterly gain since the fourth quarter of 2011. But sales are expected to pick up the pace from the prior quarter, rising 15.6% to $134.22 million. That would be higher than the 14% increase in the prior quarter.Mohawk Industries is expected to see earnings rise 19% to $2.63 a share. That would be slower than the 38% increase it posted in the prior quarter. It would mark the company's smallest quarterly gain since the fourth quarter of 2011. Sales are seen rising 4.3% to $2.136 billion. That would follow a 4% gain in the prior quarter.Business at both Caesarstone and Mohawk is tied to remodeling and residential construction trend.In June, housing starts soared 26.6% in June from a year ago, while building permits, which signals future activity, surged 30%, according to the Commerce Dept.Mohawk and Caesarstone are a part of IBD's Building-Construction Products/Miscellaneous industry group. Caesarstone has a Composite Rating of 98 out of a possible 99, while Mohawk has a Composite Rating of 96. The group also includes highly rated Acuity Brands (AYI) and Masco (MAS).

32,MAS,"Powered by rising home sales and prices, and lots of pent-up demand, the pace of remodeling spending is positioned to pick up. Industry experts expect remodeling spending to see a nice uptick this year amid strengthening housing market fundamentals, though they vary on just how much.
"
33,MAS,"A recent flurry of good news on key housing indicators bodes well for remodeling:In June, existing home sales rose 3.2% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.49 million from May, according to the National Association of Realtors. Sales are now at their highest level since February 2007 and are up 9.6% from a year earlier.The median existing home price for all housing types in June was $236,400, up 6.5% from a year earlier and above the peak median sales price of $230,400 set in July 2006, says the NAR.Suppliers Stand OutA rise in remodeling spending should aid high-rated companies such as giant home improvement retailer Home Depot (HD), top home improvement and building products makerMasco (MAS), and global flooring company Mohawk Industries (MHK). These companies stand to benefit from increased spending on home spruce-ups like new flooring and renovations such as kitchen redos, the type of projects that may have been deferred in the past.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect Masco, Home Depot and Mohawk to see double digit year-over-year profit growth in 2015, 2016 and 2017. They expect Israeli quartz surface maker Caesarstone Sdot-Yam (CSTE) to see double-digit profit growth in 2016 and 2017.""We think by the end of the year remodeling spending nationally will reach an all-time high,"" Kermit Baker, senior research fellow at Harvard's Joint Center For Housing Studies, told IBD. ""It looks like it's almost fully recovered from the (housing) downturn, where new construction is still well below where it was before the downturn.""Broadly, we're expecting to see mid-to-low single-digit growth in remodeling this year and then it will begin to accelerate at the end of the year moving into 2016 for the next year or two,"" said Baker, who directs the Remodeling Futures Program at Harvard's housing center.Total home improvement and repair spending peaked at just under $325 billion in 2007, he says. The Joint Center estimates it will rise 2.5% in 2015 from a year earlier to $325 billion. Baker projects spending growth will probably get to the long-term trend of 5% until there's another downturn.Home-Price Gains Are PivotalThe single most important trend driving the Joint Center's forecast is recovering home prices, he says.""Seeing home prices recover is crucial to consumers having the confidence to undertake a remodeling,"" he said.Another driver, he adds, is the fact that homeowners who had deferred some projects during the downturn from 2008 to 2011 are now ""attacking the list of projects they put off.""Such projects include bath and kitchen remodels and room additions. Baker says these types of projects have seen the ""strongest recovery"" from the downturn and should continue to do so as the market continues to grow.The Joint Center's key metric for tracking the growth of improvement spending specifically on owner-occupied properties is the Leading Indicator of Remodeling Activity (LIRA).The LIRA provides a short-term outlook of national homeowner improvement spending, estimating the annual rate of change in spending for the current quarter and prior three quarters. In Q3 that four-quarter moving total is forecast to reach $151.1 billion.The LIRA projects annual home-improvement spending growth of 2.8% in 2015 accelerating to 4% by the first quarter of 2016, says Joint Center research analyst Abbe Will.""Major drivers of this anticipated growth are the recent pick-up in home sales activity, sustained growth in retail sales of home improvement products and ongoing gains in house prices across much of the country,"" Will said.The biggest ""trigger"" for remodeling spending, says Baker, is the sale of a home, particularly an older one.Ken Fears, director of housing, finance and regional economics for the NAR, says there's a ""strong correlation"" between home sales and remodeling.""With an increase in home sales volumes, you're likely to see an increase in remodeling because people will have a source of funds from the sale to tap into to do the remodeling,"" he said.He expects remodeling trends to ""track the general trend"" for existing home sales.The NAR forecasts existing home sales will rise 6.6% this year, followed by a 4.1% gain in 2016.A Different ViewThe National Association of Home Builders calculates remodeling spending differently from how the Joint Center does it.NAHB senior economist Michael Neal says residential remodeling spending on owner-occupied properties fell by 24.3% from a year earlier in 2014 after it was hurt by harsh weather in the year's first half and kept falling in the second half.""However, because of the severity of the fall, the level of private residential improvement spending in 2015 will be below its level in 2014, by about 12%,"" Neal told IBD.""But beginning with the fourth quarter of 2015, private residential improvements spending will exceed its year-ago level, and year-over-year growth will continue into 2016 and 2017, by 13.2% and 3.1% respectively.""Piper Jaffray analyst Peter Keith says he expects to see a ""continued uptick"" in spending on larger-ticker home remodel projects such as kitchen and bath remodels.""I think we will see very strong same-store sales growth from the home improvement retailers,"" he told IBD.Keith notes that comments from both Home Depot and Lowe's Cos. (LOW) management indicate that sales volumes in certain categories such as lumber and concrete ""that are often utilized in larger-ticket projects are still well off their total previous highs in 2006 or 2007.""Large Projects Get UnderwayMorningstar analyst James Krapfel, who covers companies such as Masco and Mohawk, concurs that the mix of remodel and repair spending has ""shifted to more expensive projects, like full kitchen remodels, that tend to carry higher margins for the companies.""Daren Blomquist, vice president at property data tracker RealtyTrac, says due to rising home prices more people have equity in their homes than in the past. RealtyTrac research shows that people who have a mortgage and are ""equity rich,"" with at least 50% equity in their homes, have grown to 10.9 million this year, or about 20% of all homeowners with a mortgage, up from 9.9 million last year.""That puts more people in a good position to take out a HELOC (Home Equity Line of Credit) and use (the funds) to remodel their homes,"" he told IBD. ""In the second half of 2014 and the first half of 2015, we saw a jump in HELOCs as more people regained their equity and felt comfortable enough to leverage that equity.""Current low interest rates may well prompt homeowners to take out some form of financing sooner rather than later, says Andres Carbacho-Burgos, associate director at Moody's Analytics.""Interest rates are so low now on whichever form of financing you look at, people may think if they're going to improve their homes and have to borrow to do so for large projects, now is the time,"" he said. ""They may think 'if I wait two to three years to borrow to pay for this I may have to pay higher rates.'""

45,MAS,"Apple (AAPL) chip suppliers Cirrus Logic (CRUS) and Qorvo (QRVO) sold off on Thursday after giving disappointing March quarter guidance. Meanwhile, graphics chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) received a price target hike from one investment bank.Audio chipmaker Cirrus Logic saw its shares tumble 14% to close at 55 on the stock market today. The stock had jumped 6% to 63.96 on Wednesday after key customer Apple reported better-than-expected December quarter results. Intraday Wednesday it hit an all-time high of 64.16.But late Wednesday Cirrus gave a March quarter outlook that was below views.Austin, Texas-based Cirrus earned $1.87 a share excluding items, up 128% year over year, on sales of $523 million, up 50%, in its fiscal third quarter ended Dec. 24. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters were expecting $1.63 a share ex items on sales of $496 million. Cirrus got a boost from better-than-expected Apple iPhone sales last quarter, analysts said.IBD'S TAKE: The IBD 50 list of top-performing growth stocks includes 10 chip industry stocks. Among them are Nvidia, Advanced Energy Industries and Applied Materials.For the March quarter, its fiscal Q4, Cirrus expects sales to rise 38% to $320 million, based on the midpoint of its guidance. Analysts were modeling sales of $333 million.Cirrus Logic's weak Q4 outlook was due to several factors including production delays for Samsung's Galaxy S8 smartphone, Susquehanna Financial Group analyst Christopher Rolland said in a report. Also, some chips for headphone accessories likely were pulled into fiscal Q3, he said.Rolland rates Cirrus stock as positive with a price target of 67.Cirrus listed several headwinds to growth in fiscal 2018, Pacific Crest Securities analyst John Vinh said in a report. They include lower content in the upcoming Galaxy S8, slower-than-expected adoption of digital headsets in Android smartphones and slower adoption of active noise canceling technology, which isn't expected in Apple's iPhone 8, he said. Cirrus management also raised uncertainty regarding the iPhone 8 cycle, he said.Vinh rates Cirrus stock as sector weight.""While significant uncertainty remains around new product opportunities including active noise canceling and Android, Cirrus appears to be indicating that voice biometrics is the next 'big thing,'"" Vinh said. ""Cirrus expects to tape out its first chips in the next few months and will begin sampling in mid-fiscal 2018, but is not expected to contribute revenue until fiscal 2019.""Greensboro, N.C.-based Qorvo saw its stock dip 1.9% to close at 63.35 Thursday.The radio-frequency chipmaker late Wednesday said it earned $1.35 a share ex items, up 31%, on sales of $826 million, up 33%. Analysts were looking for Qorvo to earn $1.26 a share ex items on sales of $821 million.But its fiscal Q4 guidance was a letdown. Qorvo forecast earnings per share of 80 cents, down 23%, on sales of $630 million, up 4%, based on the midpoint of its guidance. Analysts were modeling for $1.04 a share on sales of $717 million.""In the March quarter, we're forecasting a greater than historical sequential decline as two of our leading customers in China and a tier-one customer in Korea delay flagship smartphone launches,"" Qorvo said in a statement.The China customers are Oppo and Vivo and the Korean customer is Samsung, Pacific Crest's Vinh said.Still, Qorvo's report was good enough for the stock to get price-target increases from Cowen, Mizuho and Needham.On the other hand, BMO Capital Markets downgraded Qorvo to market perform from outperform.""No confidence, no conviction, no mas,"" BMO analyst Ambrish Srivastava said in a research note.

The Dow Jones industrial average did a little better, down 0.2% as components Procter & Gamble (PG) and Merck (MRK) rose following earnings reports.Volume was running higher on the Nasdaq and NYSE.The building products industry and other home-improvement stocks were rattled in a combination of weak earnings reports and a poor outlook from a major appliance maker. Air conditioning and heating, construction products, wood products, paints and appliances were industry groups down 2% to 6%.Masco (MAS) plunged nearly 10% in heavy trading, falling below the long-term 200-day moving average. The stock had been forming a base-on-base pattern, but is now seriously damaged. Masco missed third-quarter profit expectations, and sales growth of 2% continued a trend of flat or low single-digit gains dating back to 2015. Masco — which makes doors, windows, plumbing fixtures and other construction products — is exiting its lower-margin cabinet business.BMC Stock Holdings (BMCH) fell 5% in rapid trade.

It's been below the 50-day line since Sept. 9.Whirlpool (WHR) gapped down to a loss of more than 11% in the highest volume since at least April 26, where there was a similar earnings-related sell-off. The appliance manufacturer missed profit and sales estimates and it cut its full-year earnings outlook. Whirlpool expects to earn $14 to $14.25 a share in 2016, down from an earlier forecast of as high as $14.75. The company cited soft demand in the U.S. and the U.K. and the weakening of the British pound.General Motors skidded 4% in heavy volume. The stock dipped below its 50-day moving average but shares remained in a long sideways pattern. The automaker beat profit and sales expectations and it forecast full-year earnings at the high end of $5.50-$6; that's above analysts' consensus of $5.85. But GM warned it may miss its 2016 European profit target due to Brexit. It also saw a softening in the U.S. auto market.Waters (WAT) gapped down to a loss of nearly 12% in huge volume after it reported Q3 profit that met the consensus estimate. The maker of products for drug development reported adjusted earnings of $1.57 a share, up 11%, on sales of $526.8 million, a 5% increase. Waters had been a leading stock, mounting a 15% gain from a 140.80 buy point.

55,MAS,"Money manager Vladimir “Val” de Vassal holds the same kind of leading stocks that you probably try to buy. But can you say your portfolio has outperformed 98% of your peers?De Vassal of Glenmede Investment Management aims to remove messy emotion from his buy and sell decisions. That adds to his performance in the long run, he says.Through May 31, he and his colleagues, including co-manager Paul Sullivan, have steered $2.3 billion Glenmede Large Cap Growth Fund (GTLLX) to average annual gains that topped all but 2% of their large-cap growth rivals tracked by Morningstar Inc. over the past three and five years.Since de Vassal took the reins in early 2004, the mutual fund has scored a 9.16% average annual gain, while the S&P 500 averaged 7.26%.The fund’s star performance over both the long and short term make it an IBD Best Mutual Funds 2016 Awards winner, shining in three categories — U.S. equity funds, growth funds and large caps.Click Here To See A List Of Mutual Fund Six-Month LeadersIn an interview with IBD from his Philadelphia office, De Vassal, 56, shared some of his investing secrets. Here’s what he had to say about the techniques that allow his investing team to beat the S&P time and again:IBD: You have a quantitative investment approach. What does that mean, and how do you mix in fundamental research with that?De Vassal: I look at our process as a quantitative discipline based on fundamental insights. I worked with fundamental managers for 20 years. They were value-oriented, growth-oriented, small-cap, large-cap, even international. Basically, one of my responsibilities was objectively assessing their criteria in selecting stocks in their particular sectors or universe, and assessing what worked and what didn't.And I've tried to remove the emotion and subjectivity out of the process.So we've built a library of the factors that worked and that didn't. They're different for different sectors. If you talk with a tech analyst versus a utility analyst, they talk about very different metrics as to why a company is effective or not.So we've built models that are unique for each sector. Some factors may be similar, but when we look at stocks, we look at them relative to their peers in the sector in terms of their attractiveness. This is a continual process every year.We add each year of data to our analysis. And we'll test new ideas.We have dialogue with our internal portfolio managers and analysts. We also have dialogue with some leading Street research firms like Empirical (Research Partners), Bernstein, JPMorgan (JPM) and Citi (C).IBD: What type of market does your approach work best in?De Vassal: Our process works when valuations and earnings matter. We look to create a portfolio that is cheap with high cash flow versus its benchmark, but has strong consistent profitability. And the stocks we own are likely to have positive earnings and revenue surprises, and fewer negative earnings and revenue surprises, than the benchmark.Where the strategy can struggle is when investors are distracted by macro issues. In the financial crisis in the Great Recession, earnings didn't matter. Investors fled equities, and they didn't care at what price.In that situation, when investors are not focused on specific company fundamentals but are driven by macro and behavioral issues, our models have less efficacy.IBD: What about more recently?De Vassal: Other periods when the strategy underperforms would be risk rallies, like 2009, and we've had a pretty strong risk rally starting in March this year, when a lot of the riskiest names are outperforming, in the last couple of months.But in this risk rally, there's been a lot of price dislocation when you look across stocks within sectors, a lot of gap between high- and low-priced stocks measured on, say, price-to-book.So this year's risk rally is a good environment for active equity managers because there seems to be a large arbitrage opportunity between cheap and expensive stocks that maybe can be taken advantage of. Those create opportunities for future price appreciation.IBD: So you like the current market?De Vassal: Our indicators still suggest we're in a positive growth environment for the U.S. economy. We had two weak quarters in Q4 and Q1. But our models suggest we should expect a rebound. Most economists expect 2% to 3% annualized growth in GDP for this quarter and the next couple of quarters.Click Here To See A List Of Mutual Fund Category PerformanceWe favor more cyclical sectors right now, like technology and consumer discretionary. We're underweight in interest-rate sensitive sectors like utilities and REITs.IBD: Let's talk about how you put your strategy to work. How does Edwards Lifesciences (EW) fit in? All of my questions are as of your latest disclosure.De Vassal: We owned it as of Jan. 31. It had good return on equity, over 20%. More sell-side analysts were raising than lowering estimates for the year and next year. The valuation was not cheap. But the fact that more analysts are raising estimates and that it has strong profitability and momentum -- historically, strong earnings growth offsets a rich valuation. And that's why we included this stock.IBD: What other holdings were you attracted to for similar reasons?De Vassal: Other names we bought in January were Oracle (ORCL), Masco (MAS), Schwab (SCHW). Again, they were attractive based on our criteria, a combination of earnings growth and analysts' estimates.One stock we sold in January was H&R Block (HRB). It was in the bottom quintile of its sector. Fortunately -- it's down 40% since we sold it.If there's something hitting one of our downside screens, we force it out of the portfolio. No questions asked.It takes time for fundamental analysts and portfolio managers to fall in love with a stock. But once they put it into a portfolio, it's hard for them to let go. We try to remove that emotion out of the process. In the long term, that adds to our performance.IBD: How does your approach differ from a fundamentals-only fund manager's?De Vassal: We look for stock that is cheap and has positive growth metrics and (whose coverage) analysts are raising estimates. We just look at what criteria work best in differentiating stocks in a sector. If it's a health care company, we don't look at what's in their pipeline, for example. Our stock ranking model for health care emphasizes high free cash flow yield, low relative price-to-book, strong reinvestment rate and positive earnings and revenue estimate revisions.IBD: Facebook (FB) has three quarters of accelerating earnings-per-share growth. How do you look at this holding?De Vassal: It's attractive in our models. Its valuation is not cheap. But its fundamentals and growth story are positive. So is the fact that analysts are raising estimates.There have been periods when we sold Facebook because it was getting too rich. Last year, the FANG stocks (Facebook, Amazon (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX) and Google, which is now Alphabet (GOOGL)) were just flying. But their valuations got too rich, and we wouldn't hold on. But at this point, Facebook would still be considered a buy in our models.IBD: You opened a stake in Lowe's (LOW) just last year. What was your thesis?
"
56,MAS,"De Vassal: We started our stake in June 2015. It ranked in the top third of our stock-ranking models. It had positive (revenue and earnings) estimate revisions from sell-side analysts. Valuation was not too extreme. The price-earnings ratio on this year's earnings was under 20.Our stock-ranking models are based on 12-month periods. We look to turn over about 1/12th of the portfolio each month to maintain attractiveness. Every month we look to refresh and harvest losses to offset short-term gains in particular.IBD: Cadence Design's (CDNS) earnings-per-share growth has accelerated for two quarters. What's your quant view?De Vassal: It has had very positive earnings revisions. When we ran this in January, every analyst raised estimates for this company. Its P-E is not that expensive. It was 17.7 in January. It has done well and is now a little over 20.IBD: Thinly traded Mettler Toledo (MTD) is in an uptrend, but its EPS growth is slowing slightly. What's your view?De Vassal: It is still attractively ranked in our model. Estimate revisions are more neutral. But we showed positive for looking forward on analysts' estimates. It has very strong profitability, very high ROE. January ROE was over 40%. Some was contingent on book value. It's decelerating, but historically their growth has been over 10%. Looking forward, this still looks like double-digit growth, even if low double digits.IBD: You've been boosting your stake in Accenture (ACN). Why?De Vassal: It has a very attractive rank in the tech sector for us. Analysts at the margins are raising their estimates. It has high ROE and a good track record of dividend growth.IBD: What makes you different from other quant-oriented fund managers?De Vassal: The difference is in four principles.First, we believe in active management, and that stocks get mispriced. One issue with benchmark indices is that if a stock is overpriced, effectively it is overweighted. To address that, we ignore weights of individual stocks. We want to avoid the idiosyncratic risk of overexposure to a single name. If everything else is equal between a midcap and a mega-cap name, why wouldn't you invest in both instead of overweighting one just because it has a larger weight in the benchmark?Second, we treat each sector differently. I don't believe one model should be used for all stocks. Stocks in different sectors have different attributes and business models.Third, downside risk screens, including quality of earnings; avoiding companies with poor stock quality, debt and/or high idiosyncratic risk.Fourth, we differentiate stocks that are more likely to have positive versus negative surprises based on sell-side analyst behavior, company fundamentals and technical data.IBD: The idea behind your quantitative approach is that it homes in on the factors that identify stocks which outperform and it enables you to avoid being sidetracked by subjective factors that are, basically, irrelevant to outperformance, right?De Vassal: Yes, we build extensive back tests going back 20 years-plus, that identify which combinations of criteria would create a portfolio of stocks that outperform the average stock in the sector on a rolling 12-month basis, and which would be in the top 20%, the most attractive stocks.IBD: What about risk?De Vassal: We're looking for the most consistent excess return over rolling 12-month periods. So we're looking for the highest return per unit of shortfall risk. And shortfall risk would be any (stock) that didn't outperform the average stock by at least 200 basis points.We want to have upside, but we don't want to have much downside performance relative to the average stock.IBD: Some managers portray themselves as people who eat and sleep fund management, doing nothing else. But you've got at least one interesting hobby. Tell me about it, please.De Vassal: Well, one of my hobbies is genealogy. My last name is French. It's an old French name. We have a family tree going back more than 1,000 years. Apparently family members did a thousand-year reunion in 1987. We learned about it after the fact.We have a lot of documentation, interesting history. Our family went from France to the Ukraine in the early 1800s. We actually, this past Saturday, we saw relatives that we didn't know about. One, she was my third cousin. We got in touch through a Frenchman who was doing genealogical research on my family, and we ended up connecting for the first time.

164,MAS,"Midterms: Considering how it's a fiasco or scandal every other week or so in the Obama administration, this year's congressional elections should be a total blow-out for Republicans. They won't be, and that is inexcusable.As of late last week, the Real Clear Politics assessment of U.S. Senate contests forecast that Democrats had 46 sure seats, Republicans had 45, and nine were toss-ups.Given Democrats' abysmal performance in public office, how can they be hanging on as well as they are? Even a cursory look at recent events and policies shows how poorly the Democrats have governed. Under their party's president, the Middle East is on fire in a manner unseen since the 1970s, with innocent Americans and Britons being beheaded by the Islamic State in slick videos designed to taunt the U.S. public; the post-Cold War Russian bear has been reawakened by obvious U.S. global weakness. ObamaCare, is now fully exposed as based on lies and has been wracked from its inception by mismanagement, bad design and incompetence. The economic ""recovery"" — over five years after the end of the recession — is the worst ever; global firms are sitting on perhaps more than $7 trillion, which under policies enhancing economic freedom could be generating tens of millions of new jobs.If Republicans can't win big under these conditions, they might as well fold up their infamous ""big tent.""Why could this be the most glaring under-performance since Roberto Duran told Sugar Ray Leonard ""No Mas!"" and gave up in the eighth round 35 years ago?A recent New York Times analysis suggests ""Democrats have an edge on the air with ads"" in almost all races, ""and a significant advantage on the ground contacting voters in some of the year's most crucial contests.""New York Post columnist John Podhoretz last week warned that the GOP may not gain control of the U.S. Senate on Election Day because ""Democrats are vastly superior when it comes to the mechanics of American politics, and have been for nearly a decade,"" especially in bringing out ""so-called 'unenthusiastic voters' — people who would, if pressed, pull the lever for the guy but who were unmotivated to do so.""But Podhoretz also put his finger on a bigger factor: ""This year Republicans decided this wouldn't be an issue-based election, in part because the party itself isn't sure where it stands collectively on a variety of issues — and in part because, having recruited a first-class team of candidates, it was thought they would do better making a case for themselves state by state.""Banker Mike McFadden in Minnesota, Rep. Cory Gardner in Colorado, and physician Rep. Bill Cassidy in Louisiana are among a number of good candidates.But that is not enough.As we have warned about previous congressional elections, Republicans must take their winning ideas national to win — and then govern with a mandate.As ex-Obama press secretary Jay Carney told CNN last week, Democrat candidates' ""goal has to be — in this cycle — to run local and state races"" rather than ""have their races be nationalized.""Carney warned Democrats, ""We haven't seen a national wave yet; there's still time for that to happen.""The latest IBD/TIPP Poll finds only 43% believing the GOP is ""better suited to handle the problems the country faces today,"" not too far above the 40% who favor Dems, plus 14% who are not sure.This indicates there is work to do.Republicans must stand heartily behind the solutions that have brought them to power in the past: fortitude and realism in facing our enemies abroad; a low-tax economic climate that lets entrepreneurs succeed; reducing costly regulations on job-generating businesses; and support for the rule of law over anything-goes radicalism.They still have time, but the hour is late.

168,MAS,"Spending: House Speaker John Boehner relented on the debt ceiling Tuesday, providing only a handful of Republican votes to assure passage. Granted, Democrats now own the issue, but couldn't he have fought a little?What is the message the GOP should be sending voters ahead of the midterm elections?Is it ""Democrats are spending anything they want""? Or, ""We are letting Democrats spend anything they want""?In agreeing to a ""clean"" debt-ceiling rise, House Republican leaders want it to be the former, but they're risking being seen as spineless. And Boehner may once again be asking for a speakership challenge.No one is denying that they do not have the votes to place conditions on raising the debt ceiling. But at least they could have refrained from lying down and playing dead right after hearing the words ""on your mark.""U.S. gold medalist snowboarder Shaun White may not have won a medal this week in Sochi, but he didn't look at the daunting half-pipe course before him and refuse to try.When, in late September 1981, the debt limit was first pushed past $1 trillion, the Democrats' hype-heavy fiscal watchdog Sen. William Proxmire staged an all-night 16-hour filibuster against it.Now it will hit an almost incomprehensible $17.3 trillion, with seven of the 14 previous debt-limit increases since 2001 coming under President Obama and $5.7 trillion of that debt added under Obama.Funny enough, back in March 2006 then-Sen. Obama opposed a debt-ceiling hike under George W. Bush, declaring that ""raising America's debt limit is a sign of leadership failure. It is a sign that the U.S. government can't pay its own bills."" He and his fellow Senate Democrats then proceeded to vote against raising the debt limit.But the House Republican leadership has changed its tune, too. Last fall they made the case on their website to use the debt-limit bill to attack spending, noting that ""Of the 53 debt-limit increases since 1978, 27 debt-limit increases have been accompanied by additional legislative action"" and that a Bloomberg poll showed 61% of the public believe ""it is right to require spending cuts when the debt ceiling is raised even if it risks default.""Now they cry ""No Mas!"" before the opening bell even sounds. Even if they couldn't win, they at least could have fought — and told the public what they (supposedly) stand for.

175,MAS,"Islamofascism: With an eye toward the 2016 election, the radical Muslim Brotherhood has built the framework for a political party in America that seeks to turn Muslims into an Islamist voting bloc.'Muslim voters have the potential to be swing voters in 2016,"" said Nihad Awad in launching the benign-sounding U.S. Council of Muslim Organizations, whose membership reads like a Who's Who of Brotherhood front groups.""We are aiming to bring more participation from the Muslim community.""USCMO also aims to elect Islamists in Washington, with the ultimate objective of ""institutionalizing policies"" favorable to Islamists — that is, Shariah law.This development bears careful monitoring in light of the U.S. Brotherhood's recently exposed goal to wage a ""civilization jihad"" against America that explicitly calls for infiltrating the U.S. political system and ""destroying (it) from within.""The subversive plan was spelled out in hundreds of pages of founding archives that the FBI confiscated from a Brotherhood leader's home in the Washington suburbs after 9/11.Translated from Arabic, the secret documents listed a number of Brotherhood front organizations — some of which just happen to make up the newly formed USCMO.Front and center is the Washington-based Council on American-Islamic Relations, the catalyst behind this Trojan horse jihadist political party.CAIR is linked in federal criminal court documents to the terrorist group Hamas, the Brotherhood's Palestinian branch. CAIR's chief Awad, who announced the USCMO at the National Press Club, is so radioactive, the FBI refuses to do outreach with him and his so-called Muslim-rights group until it can ""resolve whether there continues to be a connection between its executives and Hamas.""Equally troubling is the Muslim American Society, another founding member of the USCMO. MAS was formed as ""the overt arm of the Muslim Brotherhood in the United States,"" a 2007 Justice Department court filing states. A 2011 MAS press release praised Osama bin Laden as ""a visionary who believed in an Islamic state in Afghanistan.""The list of bad actors doesn't end there. The chairman of America's new Islamist party is none other than Oussama Jammal, who once headed the notorious Bridgeview Mosque in Chicago.One of that mosque's leaders was arrested and jailed for funneling millions to Hamas. And one of its most honored guests was bin Laden's spiritual mentor, the late Palestinian cleric Abdullah Azzam. Some of Azzam's relatives are Bridgeview members.""The walls were covered with Hamas posters and recruiting literature showing masked gunmen brandishing automatic weapons. . . . You could see daggers plunged into Jewish hearts wrapped up in American flags,"" said Steve Emerson, describing the mosque in his book ""American Jihad."" ""They even had a library filled with terrorist videos.""As Bridgeview's president, Jammal blasted the FBI for arresting terrorist members and even expressed doubts that al-Qaida was responsible for 9/11.Not to worry. As head of the USCMO, he'll see to it that the council places ""premium"" importance ""on defining the common good based on the Quran and the model of the prophet (Muhammad), and coordinating institutions to implement that common good in American society.""Jammal and his equally checkered Brothers have a 30-point ""policy platform"" for ""promoting Islam's core universal principles to benefit American society"" — none of which includes combating radicalism within the Muslim community.Can any Muslim join USCMO? Nope. First you must fill out a four-page application and pass Brotherhood inspection. Then you have to cough up $1,000 a year — $3,500 if you want a voting membership.Islamic reformer Zuhdi Jasser says he won't be accepted. That's because, as he astutely observes, America's first Muslim political party is made up ""of the inner core of American Islamist organizations"" trying to ""deceive Americans as an innocent 'Muslim coalition.'""

"

"
205,MAS,"CEO Diversifies
"
206,MAS,"Schwab gives MasTec Chief Executive Jose Mas much of the credit for diversifying the company and reducing its dependence on the telecom industry.
"
207,MAS,"When Mas took over as CEO in 2007, almost 80% of the company's revenue was telecommunications driven.
"
208,MAS,"""But by 2010 the company's business was split roughly evenly between telecommunications and utilities,"" Schwab noted.
"
209,MAS,"Much of MasTec's current growth comes from the natural gas industry. That end market contributed $574 million in revenue last year, up from $43 million in 2010.
"
210,MAS,"The natural gas sector should continue to provide growth opportunities well into the future.
"
211,MAS,"""We expect strong growth to continue as natural gas becomes a greater source of energy for the U.S.,"" Schwab noted. ""The increased emphasis on shale gas exploration creates an attractive market opportunity. Shale deposits have led to new industrial users and requires new gathering systems, mid-stream pipelines, and long-haul pipelines.""
"
212,MAS,"MasTec also should see growth from alternative energy sources, such as ethanol and solar, watchers say.

""Also, there are a few solar projects in the same situation, being awarded but awaiting financing.""
"
214,MAS,"Meanwhile, MasTec expects an additional boost from a couple of recent acquisitions: EC Source, an electric transmission company, and Fabcor, a Canadian pipeline company.

228,MAS,"In investing, as well as in life, going above and beyond is often the key to success.As earnings season approaches, investors should be on the lookout for companies that have previously posted earnings well above analysts' expectations.IBD's Estimate Beaters Screen Of The Day ranks companies based on how much their actual EPS exceeds projections in the prior quarter.Here are the top five leading stocks on the screen:Guidewire Software (GWRE), a provider of core systems for property and casualty insurers, tops the list. The company posted a 40% gain in EPS, beating estimates by 950%. Guidewire's strong showing ignited demand for its shares, sending them surging 17% to 36.75 on Feb. 27 on 10 times average daily trading volume. The stock has largely drifted sideways in price since then.Santarus (SNTS) has two diabetes drugs, an acid-reflux treatment and a cholesterol drug on the market. Despite the small lineup, it has posted big EPS gains. Last quarter, Santarus' profit jumped 167% as its results trounced analysts' estimates by 700%. Shares hit a record high of 18.27 Friday and have risen 61% since the start of the year.In January, the biotech received FDA approval for its drug Uceris to treat ulcerative colitis, a form of inflammatory bowel disease. Santarus expects the drug will produce $300 million in annual sales.Masco (MAS), which is No. 3 on the list, makes cabinets, plumbing and other products for construction and has been on the uptick as housing recovered over the past year and homebuilders rise. Masco beat estimates by 500% last quarter, fueling a 12% jump in its stock price in one day. But on Monday, its shares tumbled 7% to 18.65 as the overall market posted heavy losses and following a report by the National Association of Home Builders that saw homebuilder confidence decline for the third straight month.Exterran Holdings (EXH), at No. 4, provides natgas compression equipment and services. The company's earnings beat forecasts by 350% last quarter as natural gas production in the U.S ramped up. But shares fell 6% on Monday, punching below the 50-day line and many analysts worry the boom could be over as gas prices rise but still remain near decades lows.Forestar Group (FOR), which develops real estate for homes and residential buildings, rounds out the top five. The company beat expectations by 222% as EPS rose 71% last quarter. Shares have risen 19% since the start of the year but dipped below the 50-day line Monday on the negative homebuilder sentiment report.Related: 5 Top Stocks With Rising Earnings Estimates3D Systems Tops 5 Most-Liquid Small-Cap Leaders5 Medical Stocks With Bolting Relative Strength

230,MAS,"Earnings growth for U.S. stocks overall has slowed in recent quarters, as companies turn to cost-cutting to compensate for sluggish sales growth to squeeze out every last penny of EPS.But not every company is struggling.IBD's Estimate Beaters Screen Of The Day focuses on top stocks that beat analysts' calls by the widest margins in their most recent quarters. The elite in that group are expected to show strong earnings growth in their next reports as well, both key criteria for successful investing.Here are the top five by current-quarter expectations:Santarus (SNTS), which makes drugs for cardiovascular and gastrointestinal disorders, should land a 1,300% bump in first-quarter EPS, thanks in part to recent regulatory approval for one drug and a court ruling upholding patent protection on another.Shares climbed 3.2% on the stock market Monday and were near an all-time high.Evercore Partners (EVR), the boutique investment banking and advisory firm founded by former deputy Treasury Secretary Roger Altman, is expected to grow EPS by 440% in its first quarter, in part on a resurgent global IPO market and increasing merger and acquisition deals.Its shares slipped 2.4% Monday, after two straight weeks of declines.Homebuilder Meritage Homes (MTH) has low interest rates and rising rents helping push customers to its doors. But it also benefits from easy comparisons a year ago when it was still struggling to divest itself of unprofitable operations in Las Vegas. Analysts expect earnings to grow 247% from last year's small loss, to a healthy profit.The builder's shares were down 2.5% Monday, declining in step with other major builders Monday. But Meritage and other builders have been mostly climbing this year.Masco (MAS) has benefited from the same forces lifting Meritage. The maker of cabinets, faucets and just about everything else for a home — including the kitchen sink — is expected to post a 180% bump in first-quarter earnings per share.Shares were down 1.8% Monday, but have also climbed along with builders this year.The oil and gas industry support firm Exterran Holdings (EXH) on Monday completed the sale of natural gas compression assets to sister firm Exterran Partners (EXLP). Still, analysts have pegged the company for a solid 107% growth on its first-quarter report card.Shares slipped 4.5% for the day, but were trading near multiyear highs.Related stories:Six IBD 50 Stocks Seen Accelerating Earnings GrowthIBD 50 Analysis: Several Components Up 40%-50% In Q1Ryland, Sturm Ruger Among 5 Top Small-Cap Leaders

295,MAS,"Merry Crony-mas! It's time to pass out the goodies. While President Obama's lips champion the middle class, his administration's old hands are preparing to lavish rewards on the creme de la campaign creme: his wealthiest political donors.Several media outlets reported this week that the White House is considering fashion doyenne Anna Wintour for a possible appointment as U.S. ambassador to Great Britain or France.The rumored short list also includes Obama campaign finance chairman Matthew Barzun and investment banker Marc Lasry. The three share one common, er, ""qualification"": Each raked in more than $500,000 for Team Obama 2012.As previously reported in this column, Wintour held multiple million-dollar fundraisers for Obama in Hollywood, New York, London and Paris — raking in the fourth highest amount for the Man of the (Glamorous) People. Wintour's $40,000-per-plate dinners attracted Hollywood's biggest leftist celebs.She went further than just passing around the fashion plate, though. Before Election Day, the fashion world buzzed over the British-born Vogue editor's behind-the-scenes campaign to intimidate designers into spurning GOP women. Such Chicago-style diplomacy will fit in perfectly with the brass-knuckle-wielder-in-chief.If Wintour snags the plum British ambassadorship as rumored, she will succeed another top Obama bundler known as ""the vacuum cleaner."" Chicago lawyer and banking mogul Louis Susman (who worked for Salomon Bros. and retired as a Citigroup vice chairman in February 2009) had no diplomatic experience. But he vacayed and sashayed with the Kennedys and the Kerrys in Hyannis Port and Nantucket, siphoned up a total of $240 million for Democrats over the past several decades, and bundled upward of $500,000 for Team Obama.Ambassadorships have long been used as patronage rewards for deep-pocketed donors, of course. Clinton did it. The Bushes did it. And Hopey McChangey immediately followed suit.In his first term, Obama awarded ambassadorships to California bundler John Roos, who was dispatched to Japan; California bundler and campaign finance co-chairman Charles Rivkin, who took up the ambassadorial post in France; law partner and bundler Laurie Fulton, who was sent to Denmark; and Boston moneyman Alan Solomont, who won the appointment to Spain.Moreover, a recent investigation by the Government Accountability Institute found that more than half of the most politically active 50 campaign bundlers for Obama won appointments to a presidential council, committee, board or other White House post.Shameless defenders of Obama's business as usual are now floating the sexism card to defend Wintour's possible appointment. ""The snark directed at the idea of Anna Wintour as ambassador to the U.K. seems to be 99% sexism. The bundler-to-embassy route isn't new,"" sniffed lefty writer Matthew Yglesias.Silly ""progressive."" It would be sexist not to heap deserved scorn onto the naked back-scratching at play here.""It is no coincidence that the best bundlers are often granted the greatest access, and access is power in Washington,"" a vocal critic of the practice once said. ""Special interests,"" the critic thundered, have ""turned our government into a game only they can afford to play.""Who said it? Candidate Barack ""Do as I say"" Obama, circa 2007-08.Forget the ""forward"" rhetoric. Cut the populist crap. Retro access peddling never goes out of style in Washington: To the victor's elitist bundlers go the spoils.

304,MAS,"Lennar Corporation (LEN  -  Free Report) is slated to report results for second-quarter fiscal 2018 (ended May 31) before the opening bell on Jun 26.In the last reported quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 20.7%. This Miami-based homebuilder surpassed expectations in three of the trailing four quarters, with the average being 7.1%.Notably, Lennar’s diversified line of home offerings for first-time, move-up and active adult homebuyers, and positive housing market fundamentals prove favorable for this leading homebuilder in the United States.Factors at PlayAlthough higher prices, mortgage rates and supply shortages are taking a toll on the housing industry of late, Lennar has been reporting solid top-line numbers and the trend is expected to continue in the soon-to-be-reported quarter as well, owing to strong demand for homes, favorable job market and impressive economic conditions.According to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, the company’s Homebuilding segment revenues (comprising almost 89.3% of total revenues) of $4.7 billion are likely to increase from $2.9 billion in the year-ago period and $2.7 billion recorded in the prior reported quarter. This improvement is expected to be driven by higher average selling prices and the delivery of a significant portion of the backlog. The company’s new order trend (in units) also remained solid, growing 30% in the last reported quarter and 11% in fiscal 2017.The Financial Services segment is also performing well in tandem with its homebuilding operations and innovation of new products such as recently announced creative student-loan program. The company expects the segment’s second-quarter profit to be between $45 million and $48 million for the to-be-reported quarter. Meanwhile, the consensus estimate for the segment’s revenues is pegged at $288 million, reflecting 68.4% sequential growth.While Lennar’s Homebuilding and Financial Services divisions are the primary drivers of near-term revenues and earnings, its ancillary businesses like Rialto and Multi-Family provide diversification as well as complementary long-term growth opportunities.On the flip side, Lennar, like other renowned homebuilding companies, has been under considerable pressure owing to rising land and labor costs that are threatening margins. While labor shortages are resulting in higher wages, land prices are increasing due to limited availability.Lennar’s gross margin on home sales expanded 50 basis points (bps) in the fiscal first quarter but decreased 90 bps year over year in fiscal 2017. The decline was primarily due to an increase in construction and land costs per home. For the second quarter, the company expects gross margin to be in the 21.0-21.6% range compared with 21.1% in the year-ago period. Gross margins are expected to be impacted by 750-800 bps in the second quarter related to the CalAtlantic acquisition.Overall, Lennar’s diligent efforts to improve operating efficiency via digital-marketing efforts, dynamic pricing tool and other technology initiatives are expected to offset the headwinds, thereby driving growth for this homebuilder. In this regard, the company is working hard to improve its SG&A expenses via operating leverage and investments in technology. As a percentage of revenues from home sales, SG&A expenses contracted 60 bps to 9.7% in the fiscal first quarter, due to improved operating leverage as a result of an increase in home deliveries. However, the impact of purchase accounting related to CalAtlantic acquisition is expected to hurt margins and thereby the bottom line of the company.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter earnings is pegged at 45 cents, reflecting a decrease of 50.6% year over year. That said, the same for revenues is pegged at $5.23 billion, implying 60.4% growth.Lennar Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Lennar Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Lennar Corporation QuoteWhat Does the Zacks Model Unveil?Lennar does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — to increase the odds of an earnings beat.

305,MAS,"A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Masco Corporation (MAS  -  Free Report). Shares have added about 2.3% in that time frame.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is MAS due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.First-Quarter 2018 ResultsMasco's first-quarter 2018 adjusted earnings missed analysts’ expectation and revenues surpassed the same. Growth in the quarter was driven by strong performance in the Plumbing, Decorative Architectural and North American windows business.Earnings & RevenuesFirst-quarter 2018 adjusted earnings per share of 45 cents missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 49 cents by 8.2%. Adjusted earnings increased 13% year over year.Net sales of $1.92 billion beat analysts’ expectation of $1.86 billion by about 3.2%. Sales also grew 8% year over year on the back of strong sales from Plumbing, Decorative Architectural and North American windows business.MarginsAdjusted gross profit grew 3% to $625 million, while adjusted gross margin improved 150 bps to 32.6%.Adjusted operating profit fell 3.5% to $250 million. Adjusted operating margin contracted 160 bps to 13%.As a percentage of net sales, selling, general and administrative expenses were 19.5%, less than 19.6% reported in the prior-year quarter.Segmental AnalysisPlumbing Products: The segment recorded revenues of $971 million, reflecting an increase of 11%. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, revenues increased 6% on growth in North America.Adjusted operating margin of 16.9% declined 170 bps year over year.Decorative Architectural Products: Segmental revenues of $545 million were up 10%, courtesy of the acquisition of Kichler, growth from Behr’s pro initiative and Liberty’s builders’ hardware business.Adjusted operating margin fell 180 bps to 16.3%.Cabinets and Related Products: Segmental revenues of $217 million declined 6% year over year, thanks to the divestiture of Moores and lower sales to U.S. builders.Adjusted operating margin was 2.8% in the quarter, compared with 7.8% reported in the year-ago quarter.Windows and Other Specialty Products: Segmental revenues totaled $187 million, up 4% year over year led by strength in the North American windows business.Operating margin was 2.1% in the quarter compared with 4.5% a year ago.FinancialsMasco ended the quarter with cash and cash investments of $370 million, as of Mar 31, 2018, compared with $1.2 billion as of Dec 31, 2017.Guidance ReiteratedFor 2018, the company continues to expect adjusted earnings per share of $2.48 to $2.63.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?It turns out, fresh estimates have trended downward during the past month. There have been two revisions higher for the current quarter compared to seven lower.Masco Corporation Price and Consensus Masco Corporation Price and Consensus | Masco Corporation QuoteVGM ScoresAt this time, MAS has a subpar Growth Score of D, a grade with the same score on the momentum front. However, the stock was allocated a grade of B on the value side, putting it in the second quintile for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of C. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.The company's stock is suitable solely for value based on our styles scores.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. Notably, MAS has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.

306,MAS,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put Masco Corporation (MAS  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Masco Corporation has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 18.9, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 compares in at about 20.0. If we focus on the stock’s long-term PE trend, the current level puts Masco Corporation’s current PE ratio noticeably below its midpoint (which is 24.1) over the past five years.However, the stock’s PE compares unfavorably with the industry’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 17.7. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively overvalued right now, compared to its peers.Nonetheless, we should also point out that Masco Corporation has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of 15.1, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for Masco Corporation’s stock in the near term too.  P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, Masco Corporation has a P/S ratio of about 1.5. This is noticeably lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.3 right now. Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is slightly below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.If anything, this suggests some level of undervalued trading—at least compared to historical norms.   Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Masco Corporation currently has a Value Style Score of B, putting it into the top 40% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes MAS a solid choice for value investors, and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too.For example, the PEG ratio for Masco Corporation is just 0.9, a level that is marginally lower than the industry average of 1.0. The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock’s earnings growth rate. Clearly, MAS is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles.What About the Stock Overall?Though Masco Corporation might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of D and a Momentum score of C. This gives MAS a VGM score—or its overarching fundamental grade—of C. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been disappointing. The current quarter has seen seven estimates go lower in the past sixty days and two lower, while the full year estimate has seen nine downward and one upward revisions in the same time period.This has had a noticeable impact on the consensus estimate, as the current quarter consensus estimate has fallen nearly 3.8% in the past two months, while the full year estimate has slipped 1.2%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:Masco Corporation Price and Consensus  Masco Corporation Price and Consensus | Masco Corporation QuoteThis bearish trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and why we are looking for in-line performance from the company in the near term.Bottom LineMasco Corporation is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. Moreover, a strong industry rank (top 6% out of more than 250 industries) further supports the growth potential of the stock. However, with a Zacks Rank #3, it is hard to get too excited about this company overall. In fact, over the past one year, the sector has clearly underperformed the broader market, as you can see below:So, value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn favorable in this name first, but once that happen, this stock could be a compelling pick.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

Recently, the company signed an agreement to take over Kichler Lighting, formally known as L.D. Kichler Co. The financial terms of the deal, which is expected to close by Mar 31, were not disclosed by the company.Kichler Lighting is a 700-employee strong company specializing in interior lighting fixtures, developing decorative residential and light commercial lighting products, ceiling fans and LED lighting systems across both consumer and professional distribution channels.Kichler Lighting generated $450 million in revenues in 2017 and is expected to retain the Kichler name post the completion of the deal. Masco intends to report the financial results of Kichler Lighting in its Decorative Architectural Products segment.Headquartered in Taylor, MI, Masco is one of the leading cabinet manufacturers in the United States and holds one of the largest shares in faucets. Its popular brands include KraftMaid and Merillat cabinets, Delta and Hansgrohe faucets, Behr paint, and Milgard windows and doors. The Behr brand is the number one brand in the do-it-yourself market for architectural coatings. The company has been witnessing strong demand for its market-leading brands.Hence, this addition will compliment Masco’s current product line and the company remains enthusiastic about the prospects of this expansion into the fragmented $6 billion U.S. residential lighting industry.Meanwhile, Masco announced the buyout of another local business, Mercury Plastics, Inc. (Mercury), which was completed in the fourth quarter of 2017. Middlefield, Ohio-based Mercury manufactures water handling systems for appliances and faucets, and various other plumbing products. Mercury had revenues of $45 million in 2017 and employs 300 people.These acquisitions will be accretive to Masco’s earnings in 2018 and is expected to create significant shareholder value.As the housing end market improves steadily, there is increasing demand for new home construction and repair, remodeling products in all channels of distribution and across the price range. This improving momentum is expected to continue, which in turn will improve demand for Masco’s products.Masco’s shares have gained 38.7% in the past year, outperforming the industry’s growth of 27.6%. Earnings estimates for 2018 have also moved 1.3% north in the last seven days.

309,MAS,"Masco Corporation (MAS  -  Free Report) has been expanding its portfolio through acquisitions. In January, the company signed an agreement to take over Kichler Lighting which will complement its product line. Through the deal, the company aims to expand in the fragmented $6-billion U.S. residential lighting industry.Also, Masco acquired Mercury Plastics in 2017. Mercury Plastics manufactures water handling systems for appliances and faucets as well as various other plumbing products. The company posted revenues of $45 million in 2017. These acquisitions will prove accretive to Masco’s earnings in 2018 and are expected to raise shareholder value.Moreover, Masco regularly divests its less profitable and underperforming businesses to focus on its core areas to accelerate growth and improve shareholder value. In 2017, the company divested Moores Furniture Group — its small UK cabinet operation — which was no longer core to its long-term strategy. Also, Masco completed the divestiture of its Arrow Fastener business for $126 million.Apart from acquisitions & divestitures, increasing demand for repair and remodeling as well as product launches are driving sales growth.Repair/Remodel ActivityIncreased demand for repair/remodel products have been an important revenue generator for Masco. Over 80% of Masco’s revenues are generated through repair/remodel activity. Repair and remodel sales grew mid-single digits in the first quarter of 2018.With 70% of homes in the United States now more than 25 years old, U.S. residential housing market has become a key driver of repair and remodel revenues.Cost-Saving InitiativesThe company’s cost-saving initiatives help boost profits through business consolidations, system implementations, plant closures, branch closures, improvement in the global supply chain and headcount reductions.However, expenses related to product launches and raw material costs raise concern. Masco projects additional spending of $4 million in the first half of 2018, split equally between the first and second quarters.  Also, a significant portion of Masco’s sales comes from only two customers — Home Depot and Lowe's.Home Depot contributed to 33% of its consolidated net sales in 2017, while Lowe’s, the second largest buyer, generated less than 10% of net sales. Increased concentration toward these customers may not be a favorable mix, as Masco will be liable to lose its sales in case of adverse events.Meanwhile, Masco’s shares have lost 13.8% year-to-date, underperforming the industry’s growth of 5.3%. Also, the trend in current-year earnings estimate revisions is unsatisfactory, as it moved 1.2% downward over the past 30 days.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderMasco carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in the same space are Patrick Industries, Inc. (PATK  -  Free Report), Armstrong World Industries, Inc. (AWI  -  Free Report) and Gibraltar Industries, Inc. (ROCK  -  Free Report).

313,MAS,"The construction sector is in fine fettle buoyed by robust gains from home building investments, strong economic growth and recent tax reforms. That said, political and economic uncertainties continue to affect the sector. One such obstacle is the recent imposition of tariffs on imported steel and aluminum. An increase in import tariff will escalate raw material cost for builders, which are grappling with increased cost, thanks to the imposition of lumber tariff. This, along with high cost of land and labor and mortgage rate hikes, raises concern.Spending on construction projects in the United States inched up marginally in February, after a flat January. However, the figure logged an annual growth rate of 3%, as revealed by the Commerce Department. The solid labor market along with robust consumer confidence supported an increase in non-residential (lodging and office) construction.Positives such as an improving economy, modest wage growth, low unemployment and positive consumer confidence work in favor of the sector. President Trump had vowed to double economic growth through an ambitious stimulus program featuring tax cuts, deregulation and higher infrastructure spending.Per a study by Dodge Data & Analytics, new construction starts in March increased 11% from the previous month, marking the highest level over the past six months. The considerable improvement followed modest declines in January (down 2%) and February (down 3%). Overall, in the first quarter of 2018, though total construction starts on an unadjusted basis were down 7% from the year-ago quarter, it rose 1% year over year.The implications of the metal tariffs and mortgage hike are yet to be felt in the sector that has occupied the second position out of 16 sectors based on our in-house classification. Notably, a sector with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and 2 (Buy) stocks will have a better average than the rest.Q1 ExpectationsAs we take a closer look at the earnings season, we see a steady improvement over the past few quarters. So far, this earnings season has seen releases from 87 S&P 500 members, with 82.8% beating EPS estimates and 67.8% beating revenue estimates.According to the latest Earnings Preview, total earnings in first-quarter 2018 are expected to be up 18.3% from the prior-year quarter on 7.7% higher revenues compared with 13.4% earnings growth in the fourth quarter of 2017 on 8.6% rise in revenues.The construction sector’s earnings are expected to increase 38.1% in the quarter under review compared with 20.6% in the prior quarter. Revenues are also expected to improve 15.9% (13.3% growth in fourth-quarter 2017).Now let us take a look at how the following construction companies are placed ahead of their quarterly release on Apr 24.Our research shows that when a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) stock has a positive Earnings ESP, the chance of beating earnings estimates is high.

The company managed to surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 3.5%. Last quarter, the company came up with a positive earnings surprise of 2.3%.Recent buyouts along with high demand for repair and remodeling are likely to drive Masco's quarterly results.

Moreover, Strong demand from repair and remodeling products in all channels of distribution are also expected to boost revenues.However, sales and operating profit will be reduced due to the divestiture of Arrow Fastener.

315,MAS,"Increasing demand for new home construction and repair, remodeling products bode well for Masco Corporation (MAS  -  Free Report). Along with it, cost-saving initiatives and divestures at regular intervals to accelerate growth are expected to drive profits.Key Growth DriversGiven the housing end market’s steady improvement, there is an increasing demand for new home construction and repair, remodeling products in all channels of distribution and across the price range. The momentum is expected to continue which in turn will improve demand for Masco’s products. Rising housing prices are also giving a boost to consumer confidence in home investments.More than 80% of Masco’s revenues are generated through repair/remodel activity. Masco’s growth in the last few quarters has mostly been driven by steadily growing repair and remodel activity.The positive momentum is evident from the company’s results in the first nine months of 2017. The company’s net sales increased 3.1% driven by solid contribution from its Plumbing Products (up 5%) and Decorative Architectural Products (up 4%) segments. Strong demand from repair and remodeling products across all channels of distribution led to a 3% increase in North American sales in the first nine months of 2017.Notably, the company’s Plumbing Products segment continues to be strong, particularly in North America, as it gained market share with its high-end showroom products and saw strong growth in eCommerce sales across both pure-play online retailers and omni channel partners.Overall, the company has been witnessing strong demand for its market leading brands. It is one of the leading cabinet manufacturers in the United States and holds one of the largest shares in faucets. Its popular brands include KraftMaid and Merillat cabinets, Delta and Hansgrohe faucets, Behr paint, and Milgard windows.Apart from strong demand, Masco’s effective cost-saving initiatives help it in boosting profit level that include business consolidations, system implementations, plant closures, branch closures, improvement in the global supply chain and headcount reductions. Masco’s adjusted gross profit increased 5.5% year over year in the first nine months of 2017 and gross margin expanded 80 basis points over the time period. Operating margin increased 40 bps, on an adjusted basis, over the said period.Again, Masco regularly divests its less profitable and underperforming businesses to focus on its core areas in a bid to accelerate growth and improve shareholder value. In the second quarter of 2017, Masco completed the divestiture of its Arrow Fastener business for $126 million.Although the recent hurricanes have negatively impacted the last reported quarter, delaying deliveries and installation schedules, Masco’s prospects remain bright given the expectations of continued momentum in housing industry banking on improving economy, low unemployment levels and positive consumer confidence.Masco’s shares have gained 26.3% year to date, outperforming the industry’s growth of 17.7%. Estimates for the current quarter and year have remained stable over the last seven days.Nevertheless, increasing demand for repair and remodeling and new product launches are key growth drivers for this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company.Stocks to ConsiderA few better-ranked stocks in the same space are Patrick Industries, Inc.

In January, the company signed an agreement to take over Kichler Lighting. The acquisition will complement Masco’s product line. The company is optimistic about the prospect of expansion into the fragmented $6-billion U.S. residential lighting industry.Moreover, Masco acquired Mercury Plastics, Inc. in the fourth quarter of 2017. Mercury Plastics manufactures water handling systems for appliances and faucets as well as various other plumbing products. The company posted revenues of $45 million in 2017.These acquisitions are expected to prove accretive to Masco’s earnings in the to-be-reported quarter.Let us delve into other factors that might impact Q1 results.Strong Repair/Remodel Activity to Boost RevenuesRepair and remodel activity has been a key growth driver, contributing 80% to Masco’s revenues. Strong demand from repair and remodeling products in all channels of distribution led to a 4% increase in North American sales in 2017. KraftMaid, the company’s leading repair and remodel brand, came up with a solid performance in retail and dealer channels. The brand posted mid-single digit growth on increased volumes in 2017.  The trend is expected to continue in the to-be-reported quarter.Arrow Fastener Divesture to Hurt ResultsDue to the sale of Arrow Fastener, the company’s first-half sales and operating profit will be reduced by approximately $30 million and $6 million, respectively, split evenly between the first and second quarter.Increased Investments in Showroom DisplaysMasco projects additional spending of $4 million in the first half of 2018 split equally between the first and second quarters. This is due to Plumbing segment’s Delta brand’s investments in showrooms displays. The company anticipates approximately $12 million of investment during the first quarter, thanks to new store displays of cabinets at the Menards stores.Segment PerformanceComing to the different reportable segments, Plumbing Products, comprising about 46% of total revenues, is expected to contribute substantially to overall growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Plumbing Products revenues of $948 million reflects growth of 9.8% on a year-over-year basis.The Cabinets segment is expected to witness little growth this quarter. The consensus estimate for the segment’s revenues of $233 million reflects year-over-year rise of 0.7%.Decorative Architectural Products is expected to grow 3% year over year in the first quarter, owing to strong pro paint growth and Liberty Hardware business. Revenues at Windows and Other Specialty Products are expected to inch up 1.1%.Overall, for the first quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues is pegged at $1.86 billion, implying 4.6% growth. This is likely to translate into higher earnings.

318,MAS,"Masco Corporation (MAS  -  Free Report) has been expanding its portfolio with more acquisitions. In January, the company signed an agreement to take over Kichler Lighting. The acquisition will compliment Masco’s product line. The company is enthusiastic about the prospect of expansion into the fragmented $6-billion U.S. residential lighting industry.Moreover, Masco acquired Mercury Plastics, Inc. in the fourth quarter of 2017. Mercury Plastics manufactures water handling systems for appliances and faucets as well as various other plumbing products. The company posted revenues of $45 million in 2017.These acquisitions will prove accretive to Masco’s earnings in 2018 and are expected to create significant shareholder value.Apart from acquisitions, Masco regularly divests less profitable and underperforming businesses to focus on its core areas and accelerate growth. In the fourth quarter of 2017, the company divested Moores Furniture Group, its small UK cabinet operation, which was no longer core to its long-term strategy. In the second quarter of 2017, Masco completed the divestiture of its Arrow Fastener business for $126 million.Let’s take a look at other factors that have been working in favor of Masco.Strong Repair/Remodel ActivityIncreased demand for repair/remodel products have been an important revenue generator for Masco. Over 80% of Masco’s revenues are generated through repair/remodel activity. Strong demand for such products across all channels of distribution led to a 4% increase in North American sales in 2017. KraftMaid, the company’s leading repair and remodel brand, came up with a solid performance in retail and dealer channels and delivered mid single-digit growth on increased volumes in 2017. Effective Cost-Saving InitiativesThe company’s cost-saving initiatives help in boosting profit level through business consolidations, system implementations, plant closures, branch closures, improvement in the global supply chain and headcount reductions. Masco’s gross margin expanded 80 basis points (bps) and operating margin increased 100 bps in 2017.Bottom LineIncreasing demand for new home construction and repair as well as remodeling products bode well for Masco. Cost-saving initiatives, acquisitions & divestitures at regular intervals to accelerate growth are expected to drive profits. Meanwhile, Masco’s shares have gained 21.7% in the past year, outperforming the industry’s growth of 14.1%. Also, the trend in current-year earnings estimate revisions is satisfactory, as it moved 7.5% upward over the past 30 days, signaling analysts’ optimism surrounding the stock. However, a significant portion of Masco’s sales comes from only two customers — Home Depot and Lowe's. Home Depot contributed to 33% of its consolidated net sales in 2017 and Lowe’s, the second largest buyer, generated less than 10% of net sales. Increased concentration toward these customers may not be a favorable mix, as Masco will be liable to lose its sales in case of adverse events.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderMasco carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in the same space are Advanced Drainage Systems, Inc. (WMS  -  Free Report), Armstrong World Industries, Inc. (AWI  -  Free Report) and Gibraltar Industries, Inc. (ROCK  -  Free Report). All the stocks hold a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

324,MAS,"One problem that Americans face is certainly shoddy infrastructure. President Trump had raised this issue in his first State of the Union Address. He wanted to revamp infrastructure, including roads, bridges, highways and railways. This is something that he has been promising since his campaign days.In the wake of this, Trump has announced a massive infrastructure bill on Feb 12 to modernize infrastructure. Thus, picking stocks gaining from the infrastructure drive seems judicious.Trump Unveils Infrastructure Plan Trump unveiled the long-awaited $1.5 trillion plan to fix America’s infrastructure over the next 10 years. The plan is primarily centered on using the $200 billion in federal funds to spur massive infrastructure investments on roads, highways, ports and airports. The comprehensive bill will also address issues related to drinking and waste water system, energy and rural infrastructure, veterans’ hospitals, to name a few.Researchers in McKinsey & Company have figured out that such a massive amount will indeed be needed to refurbish the country’s infrastructure. To fund the bill, Trump said that every dollar should be “leveraged by partnering with state and local governments and, where appropriate, tapping into private-sector investment.”How Will the $200B be Spent?Of the $200 billion in federal money, half of it will go to incentives for states and cities. The White House said that this money will ultimately be used in new projects like building airports, passenger rail, drinking water facilities and Superfund sites.About $50 billion will be used in Rural Infrastructure Programme. This is aimed at rebuilding and improving infrastructure in rural America. The White House added that “the bulk of the dollars in the Rural Infrastructure Programme will be allocated to State governors, giving States the flexibility to prioritize their communities’ needs. The remaining funds will be distributed through rural performance grants to encourage the best use of taxpayer dollars.”Nearly $20 billion will be spent on “Transformative Projects Program,” while another $20 billion will be allocated toward expanding infrastructure financing programs. US in Desperate Need of Infrastructure OverhaulRhode Island is grappling with problems like dilapidated bridges and roads, while New Hampshire has a lot of catching up to do when it comes to water infrastructure.Meanwhile, the broken-down Sarah Mildred Long Bridge and poor road conditions are plaguing Maine. Meanwhile, all the three states in the New York City have collapsing roads and railways, with Connecticut being the worst. Last but not the least, Mississippi will see substantial improvement in and around Port of Gulfport owing to the infrastructure plan.5 Solid ChoicesCourtesy of the all-inclusive infrastructure bill, for the first time in the history of the United States, investing in stocks related to infrastructure is a smart option at the moment. However, picking winning stocks may prove to be difficult.This is where our VGM Score comes in handy. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores. Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners. However, it is important to keep in mind that each Style Score will carry a different weight while arriving at the VGM Score. Further, these stocks flaunt a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).MasTec, Inc.

327,MAS,"Homebuilding companies, under the broader construction sector, seem to be on solid ground. Positives such as an improving economy, modest wage growth, low unemployment levels and positive consumer confidence raise optimism about the homebuilding industry’s performance in 2017.However, the U.S. housing data has been weak in July/August as inventory shortage has started taking its toll on sales pace and has pushed average home prices higher nationwide. Again, apart from inventory shortage woes and higher land/labor costs, hurricanes Harvey and Irma are expected to have a negative impact to some extent on the companies’ results. That said, the companies anticipate the impact to be temporary and remain confident about the substantial productivity gains in the later part of 2017 and through 2018.Per our latest Earnings Preview, earnings for the total S&P 500 companies are expected to grow 2.6% from the year-ago period, while revenues will increase 5%. The performance of the index is not restricted to a single sector. Of the 16 Zacks sectors, nine are expected to witness an earnings decline.Nonetheless, overall, earnings growth for the quarter is on track to mark growth and construction seems to be one of the stand-out sectors. The construction sector’s earnings are expected to increase 8.9% in Q3 compared with 15.5% in the prior quarter. Revenues are also expected to improve 10.6% (8.8% growth in Q2).Let us take a look at how the following construction companies are placed ahead of their quarterly release on Oct 24.Masco Corporation (MAS  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 24, 2017 before the opening bell.The company managed to surpass/meet the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing four quarters, with an average earnings beat of 1.15%.Masco’s growth in the last few quarters has mostly been driven by steadily growing repair and remodel activity. The trend is expected to contribute in the to-be-reported quarter as well. Notably, over 80% of Masco’s revenues are generated through repair/remodel activity. In the third quarter, the company expects KraftMaid, Masco’s leading repair and remodel brand, to capitalize on its already strong performance with new product launches.Masco’s Plumbing Products segment, comprising about 46% of the total revenues, is expected to contribute substantially to overall revenue growth in the third quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Plumbing Products revenues of $953 million reflect a growth of 6% from the year-ago quarter.The Cabinets segment is expected to return to positive growth trajectory from this quarter, after experiencing year-over-year sales decline for quite some time now. The consensus estimate for segment revenues of $250 million reflects year-over-year growth of 4.6%.Decorative Architectural Products is expected to grow 5.8% on a year-over-year basis in the third quarter owing to strong pro-paint growth, while the Windows and Other Specialty Products is expected to decline 2.5% in the to-be-reported quarter.Thus, for the third quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues is pegged at $1.96 billion, implying 4.3% growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is 53 cents, reflecting a 29% year-over-year increase.Our proven model hints at an earnings beat for this company this quarter, as Masco has the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold).,This combination increases the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Currently, the company has an Earnings ESP of +0.19% and carries a Zacks Rank #3.(Read more: Repair/Remodel Activity to Drive Masco's Q3 Earnings)Masco Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Masco Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Masco Corporation QuotePulteGroup Inc.

Homebuilding, comprising about 97.5% of the total revenues, is expected to get a boost in the third quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Homebuilding revenues of $2.3 billion reflect a growth of 17.6% sequentially and 22.5% from the year-ago quarter. On the other hand, consensus estimate for Financial Services revenues of $54 million indicates an increase of 14.2% from the prior quarter and 12.5% year over year.Overall, for the third quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues is pegged at $2.33 billion, implying 19.8% growth. The solid improvement in the top line is expected to give a meaningful boost to the company’s earnings. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings stands at 59 cents, reflecting a 37.2% year-over-year increase.Meanwhile, PulteGroup does not have the right combination of two main ingredients for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.

The revised outlook includes 10 cents per share charge associated with the Valspar acquisition and a 40-60 cents per share increase from Valspar operations.Thus, total revenues are expected to improve 33.8% from the prior-year quarter as the Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales is $4.4 billion. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of $4.70 per share reflects a 11% improvement on a year-over-year basis.Sherwin-Williams is unlikely to beat earnings estimates as it has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% and a Zacks Rank #3.

330,MAS,"It was a great 2017 for the construction sector, buoyed by robust gains from home building investments and a rebounding U.S. economy. Despite political and economic uncertainties, the sector saw sustainable growth.Spending on construction was up a sizeable 3.8% year over year in 2017, per the latest report from the U.S. Census Bureau. Of the total, although spending on government projects declined 2.5% in 2017, it grew 5.8% in private construction. Specially, residential construction in 2017 was 10.6% higher than the 2016 level.Positives such as an improving economy, modest wage growth, low unemployment and positive consumer confidence raise optimism about the sector’s performance in 2018. Trump had vowed to double economic growth through an ambitious stimulus program featuring tax cuts, deregulation and higher infrastructure spending.Indeed, there are concerns that are restricting the sector’s growth to some extent for quite a while now. The industry has been challenged by shortage of homes for sale, suitable land and skilled labor. Again, limited land availability is driving prices higher, putting a serious question mark on affordability.Again, the brisk growth pace of the economy strengthens the case for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates. That said, higher demand, booming economy along with solid job market will keep the momentum alive.Q4 ExpectationsAs we take a closer look at the Q4 earnings season, we see a steady improvement over the past few quarters. So far, this earnings season has seen releases from 251 S&P 500 members as of Feb 2, 2018. According to the latest Earnings Preview, total Q4 earnings are expected to be up 13% from the same period last year on 7.7% higher revenues compared with 6.7% earnings growth in the third quarter of 2017 on 5.9% rise in revenues.The construction sector’s earnings are expected to increase 18.5% in Q4 compared with 11.6% in the earlier quarter. Revenues are also expected to improve 11% (12.3% growth in Q3).Let us take a look at how the following construction companies are placed ahead of their quarterly release on February 8.Our research shows that when a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) stock has a positive Earnings ESP, the chance of beating earnings estimates is high.

KraftMaid, the company’s leading repair and remodel brand, came up with a solid performance in retail and dealer channels, delivering double-digit growth on increased volumes in third-quarter 2017. The trend is expected to contribute in the to-be-reported quarter.Also, Masco expects approximately $8 million in reset costs in the fourth quarter pertaining to a cabinet hardware program. The company will also incur approximately $5-$10 million in advertising costs as it is now resetting its display sets across the United States. Nonetheless, we are encouraged by the company’s cost-saving initiatives that have been driving margins over the past few quarters.Overall, for the fourth quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues is pegged at $1.83 billion, implying 4.3% growth.

333,MAS,"Masco Corporation (MAS  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 8, before market opens.Repair and remodel activity has been a key growth driver, contributing 80% to Masco’s revenues. Strong demand from repair and remodeling products across all channels of distribution led to a 3% increase in North American sales in the first nine months of 2017. KraftMaid, the company’s leading repair and remodel brand, came up with a solid performance in retail and dealer channels, delivering double-digit growth on increased volumes in third-quarter 2017. The trend is expected to contribute in the to-be-reported quarter.Let us take a look at the other factors that are likely to influence Q4 results:Product Innovation & DivestituresProduct innovation also plays a pivotal role in driving results. Masco regularly invests in new products across its brands. Moreover, the company regularly divests less profitable and underperforming businesses to focus on core areas to accelerate growth. In the second quarter of 2017, Masco completed the divestiture of its Arrow Fastener business for $126 million. Sales and operating profit will be impacted by approximately $18 million and $5 million, respectively, in the fourth quarter due to the sale of Arrow Fastener.Segment PerformanceComing to the different reportable segments, Plumbing Products, comprising about 46% of total revenues, is expected to contribute substantially to revenue growth in the fourth quarter, driven by growth in faucet, shower and spa businesses. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Plumbing Products revenues of $958 million reflects growth of 7.5% from the year-ago quarter.The Cabinets segment is expected to see dismal growth this quarter owing to the impact of hurricanes. The company expects a $5-million hit to revenues in the fourth quarter that will largely impact the Cabinetry segment. The consensus estimate for the segment’s revenues of $238 million reflects year-over-year growth of just 1.7%.Decorative Architectural Products is expected to grow 4.3% year over year in the fourth quarter owing to strong pro paint growth and Liberty Hardware business, while revenues at Windows and Other Specialty Products are expected to decline 2.1%.Cost-Saving InitiativesMasco expects approximately $8 million in reset costs in the fourth quarter pertaining to a cabinet hardware program. Also, the company will incur approximately $5-$10 million in advertising costs as it is now resetting its display sets across the United States.Nonetheless, we are encouraged by the company’s cost-saving initiatives that have been driving margins over the past few quarters. Such initiatives include business consolidations, system implementations, plant closures, branch shut downs, improvement in the global supply chain and headcount reduction. Notably, operating margins improved 40 basis points in the first nine months of 2017. The trend is expected to continue in the fourth quarter as well.Overall, for the fourth quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues is pegged at $1.84 billion, implying 4.4% growth. The improvement in the top line is expected to be driven by increased revenues from the Plumbing and Decorative Architectural segments. This is likely to translate into higher earnings. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings stands at 43 cents, reflecting a 30.3% year-over-year increase.Quantitative Model PredictionPer the quantitative model, Masco does not have the right combination of two main ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — to beat earnings.Masco has an Earnings ESP of -0.31% and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

Buffett then went on to say that they will come to a “bad ending” but he didn’t know when or how it would happen.As you can imagine, he immediately came under attack from those in the crypto community for being out-of-touch, too old, and ignorant.It’s nearly the identical response dot-commers had to his comments in the late 1990s.Picking Winners in Emerging TechnologiesWhen a new technology bursts on the scene, there are always dozens of competitors. After all, it’s seen as a gold rush and some people will get rich off of what is new.In the 1800s, there were hundreds of railroads in the United States. But now, there are less than 10 big commercial railroad companies.Similarly, there were thousands of automobile manufacturers and hundreds of domestic airlines when cars and airplanes came on the scene in the early 1900s.But, again, today, the “winners” have won the contest. There are only a handful of big names in those industries. They are the survivors.With cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology, it’s so new, there’s no way of knowing who the winners may be. Buffett’s strategy, then, is to simply avoid those emerging technologies until winners can be determined.Investing in the Old-School WinnersWhy not invest in those that have become the winners in the older industries?These companies, some of whom have survived for nearly two hundred years, are clearly doing something right.1.      General Electric (GE  -  Free Report) is one of the original Dow Industrial components. Becky Quick asked Buffett about GE in their interview but he wouldn’t say, due to compliance issues, if he was buying now that shares have plunged. Is it even cheap enough? It still has a forward P/E of 18.3.2.     Masco (MAS  -  Free Report) makes plumbing parts like faucets, paints, cabinets and countertops. Founded in 1929, it now has a $14 billion market cap. Earnings are expected to rise 18% in 2018 after jumping about 29% in 2017.3.     Fortune Brands Home & Security (FBHS  -  Free Report) makes cabinets and plumbing, including the Moen brand, but it also makes doors and security devices such as padlocks by Master Lock. With a $10 billion market cap, it’s expected to see double digit earnings growth in both 2017 and 2018.4.     Sherwin Williams (SHW  -  Free Report) recently acquired Valspar and is now one of the largest paint manufacturers in the world. Founded in 1866 in Cleveland, it’s still producing double digit earnings growth all of these years later with analysts expecting earnings to pop 25.5% in 2018.5.     Deere & Company (DE  -  Free Report) traces its roots all the way back to 1837 in Moline, Illinois. This agriculture and construction equipment giant has had a few tough years as farmers cut back on their equipment spending but is turning it around with fiscal 2018 earnings expected to jump 22%.Sometimes, for investors, the tried and true is just as attractive as the shiny and new.What else should you know about why Buffett is avoiding bitcoin and thinks the market isn’t over valued?Tune into this week’s podcast to find out.Exclusive Buffett Report for Podcast ListenersWhat 3 secrets drive the success of arguably the world's greatest value investor?

The trend is expected to contribute in the to-be-reported quarter. Notably, more than 80% of Masco’s revenues are generated from repair/remodel activity.Also, product innovation plays an important role in driving results. In 2016, Masco invested in several new products and programs across its different brands, positioning itself for growth in 2017 and beyond.Coming to the different reportable segments, Plumbing Products, comprising about 46% of the total revenues, is expected to contribute substantially to overall revenue growth in the third quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Plumbing Products revenues of $953 million reflects growth of 6% from the year-ago quarter.The Cabinets segment is expected to return to positive growth this quarter, after seeing year-over-year sales decline for quite some time. The consensus estimate for the segment’s revenues of $250 million reflects year-over-year growth of 4.6%.Decorative Architectural Products is expected to grow 5.8% year over year in the third quarter owing to strong pro paint growth, while the Windows and Other Specialty Products is expected to decline 2.5% in the to-be-reported quarter.We are also encouraged by the company’s cost-saving initiatives that have been driving margins over the past few quarters. Such initiatives include business consolidations, system implementations, plant closures, branch shut downs, improvement in the global supply chain and headcount reduction.

You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Masco Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Masco Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Masco Corporation QuoteHowever, negative impact of currency translation on sales is still significant. About 21% of Masco’s sales is generated outside the United States. As such, the company is subject to currency translation volatility across the globe.Also, increasing material costs act as a dampener for Masco. Currently, the company is facing some pressure from resin-related costs. Further, the prices of copper and zinc have gone up. Apart from raw material costs, the company bears expenses related to product launches as well. The company will see incremental costs of approximately $7 million in the third quarter related to launches and tariffs on imported Chinese plywood.Overall, for the third quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues is pegged at $1.96 billion, implying 4.3% growth. The solid improvement in the top line, driven by increased revenues from Plumbing and Decorative Architectural segments, is expected to boost earnings. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings stands at 53 cents, reflecting a 29% year-over-year increase.Stocks Worth a LookHere are a few construction stocks worth considering as they have the right combination of elements to beat earnings this quarter.Beazer Homes USA, Inc.

336,MAS,"Homebuilding company, PulteGroup Inc. (PHM  -  Free Report), is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 24 before the market opens.PulteGroup is well poised to gain traction on the current positive housing scenario. Homebuilders have been doing well courtesy of steady job and wage growth, a recovering economy, historically-low mortgage rates, rising rentals, rapidly increasing household formation, and a limited supply of inventory. These positive trends point at strong demand in the to-be-reported quarter and 2017 as a whole.Homebuilding, comprising about 97.5% of the total revenues, is expected to get a boost in third quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Homebuilding revenues of $2.3 billion reflect growth of 17.6% sequentially and 22.5% from the year-ago quarter. On the other hand, consensus estimate for Financial Services revenues of $54 million indicates an increase of 14.2% from the prior quarter and 12.5% year over year.The company has also been experiencing strong buyer demand and good traffic into its communities. PulteGroup is also maximizing the value of its land assets by selling houses at higher prices and better margins, thereby using the resulting strong cash flow to invest in the business, pay off debt and systematically return to shareholders.All these are likely to help the company in reporting better-than-expected earnings, driven by higher closing volumes and average selling price. The company expects unit closings in the range of 5,400-5,600 in the third quarter.However, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for net new orders of 5,330 units reflects a decline of 16.7% from the prior quarter but is likely to witness a 11.6% increase year over year.Again, rising land and labor costs are threatening margins as they limit homebuilders’ pricing power. Home sales gross margin decreased 40 basis points (bps) year over year to 21.1% in the second quarter of 2017. That said, PulteGroup expects gross margin in the range of 23.6-24.1%, implying an increase of 20 bps to 70 bps sequentially for both the third and fourth quarters.Apart from higher land/labor costs, hurricanes Harvey and Irma are expected to have a negative impact on the company’s results to some extent.Overall, for the third quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues is pegged at $2.33 billion, implying 19.8% growth. The solid improvement in the top line is expected to give a meaningful boost to the company’s earnings. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings stands at 59 cents, reflecting a 37.2% year-over-year increase.Here is what our quantitative model predicts.PulteGroup does not have the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — to increase the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter. Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for PulteGroup is -6.22%.Zacks Rank: PulteGroup carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP.

339,MAS,"Increased repair and remodeling activity has been driving Masco Corporation’s (MAS  -  Free Report) revenues over the last few quarters along with product innovation and cost-saving initiatives.More than 80% of Masco’s revenues are generated through repair/remodel activity. The company’s growth in the last few quarters has primarily been driven by a steady rise in repair and remodel activity. Strong demand for repair and remodeling products across all channels of distribution led to a 4% increase in North American sales in the second quarter of 2017.KraftMaid, the company’s leading repair and remodel brand, delivered solid performance in the retail and dealer channels, signifying mid-single digit growth on increased volumes in the second quarter.Product innovation also plays an important role in driving results. In 2016, Masco invested in several new products and programs across its different brands, positioning itself for growth in 2017 and beyond.Also, Masco regularly divests its less profitable and underperforming businesses to focus on core areas in a bid to accelerate growth and drive shareholders’ value. In the second quarter of 2017, Masco completed the divestiture of its Arrow Fastener business for $126 million.We are encouraged by the company’s cost-saving initiatives that have been driving the margins over the past few quarters.  Such initiatives include business consolidations, system implementations, plant closures, branch shut downs, improvement in the global supply chain and headcount reduction. These are targeted at company-wide annual savings through reduction of corporate expenses and simplification of the company’s organizational structure. Notably, operating margins improved 40 basis points (bps) in the first half of 2017 and 160 bps in 2016.Meanwhile, as the housing market gains momentum, demand for products associated with home construction or repair is expected to increase, thereby boosting top-line growth for companies like Masco, Owens Corning Inc (OC  -  Free Report), TopBuild Corp. (BLD  -  Free Report) and Grafton Group plc (GROUF  -  Free Report).Raw Material & Product Launch Costs EscalateMasco purchases several commodities like brass, resins, titanium dioxide, zinc, wood among others for the manufacturing of products. Fluctuations in the availability and prices of these commodities might raise the cost of production. Currently, the company is facing pressure exerted by increasing resin-related costs. Also, prices of copper and zinc have gone up.Apart from raw material costs, the company bears expenses pertaining to product launches. In the third quarter of 2017, Masco expects to incur incremental costs of approximately $7 million related to product launches as well as recently-announced antidumping duties and countervailing tariffs on imported plywood from China.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

QuoteSegmental DetailsRevenues of Residential Products segment were $127 million during the quarter, up 6% year over year.

Notably, the lingering tepid conditions in the infrastructure end markets also thwarted the segment’s revenues.Renewable Energy and Conservation segment’s sales dipped 3% year over year to $63 million in the quarter due to the challenging scenario prevailing in overseas energy markets and divestiture of the company’s European raking solar business (Dec 2016).Costs and MarginsCost of sales in the second quarter was $185.8 million, down 5.6% year over year.

348,MAS,"Masco Corporation (MAS  -  Free Report) is slated to release second-quarter 2017 numbers on Jul 27.In the last reported quarter, the company delivered a positive surprise of 14.14%. Notably, the company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the last four quarters, with an average earnings beat of 3.53%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayCost-saving initiatives have been driving the company’s margins over the past few quarters and are expected to drive results in the quarter under review as well. The initiatives include business consolidation, system implementation, plant and branch closures, improvement in the global supply chain and headcount reduction to generate annual savings through reduction of corporate expenses and simplification of organizational structure.Increasing demand for repair and remodeling is driving strong sales growth. With the gradual improvement in the housing end market, there has been an increase in demand for new home construction and repair, remodeling products in all channels of distribution. This encouraging momentum is expected to continue.However, adverse currency translations remain a headwind as about 21% of Masco’s sales are generated outside the U.S. As such, the company is subjected to adverse currency translation across the globe which may hurt Masco’s international sales in the soon-to-be reported quarter.Notably, the company is expected to have exited certain low-margin builder direct businesses in the U.S. and select low-margin accounts in the U.K. Cabinet business in the second quarter, which will likely impact revenues by approximately $5 million.Meanwhile, for the second quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 60 cents a share, reflecting an increase of 29.8% year over year, while the consensus for revenues is at $2.07 billion, implying 3.4% year-over-year growth.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Masco is likely to beat earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP:  Masco has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. That is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 60 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Masco Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Masco Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Masco Corporation QuoteZacks Rank: Masco has a Zacks Rank #2, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company’s 0.00% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.Please note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some companies in the broader construction sector that can be considered as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Owens Corning (OC  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +4.72% and a Zacks Rank #2.
