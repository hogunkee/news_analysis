4,KSU,"In the first big split between the Republican-led Congress and President Trump, House Speaker Paul Ryan and GOP members of the House Ways and Means Committee have come out in opposition to the proposed tariffs on U.S. steel and aluminum imports.X While opposition is one thing, the Washington Post reported that congressional Republicans are privately talking about ""other options"" to keep Trump from risking a trade war if the White House doesn't reconsider, raising the possibility of legislation.It's far from clear whether a veto-proof majority to handcuff Trump on trade could be assembled, given that some Democrats praised last week's tariff announcement and that party lines on trade have increasingly blurred. It's possible that the odds of bucking Trump would improve if his trade measures clearly backfire. Yet the potential for a congressional intervention may have helped ease concerns on Wall Street about the impending imposition of tariffs. The Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite also turned overnight losses into solid gains on the stock market today.Steel stocks — which surged on Thursday, when Trump sprung his surprise announcement amid White House infighting over the idea — were mostly lower Monday. U.S. Steel (X) was off 1.4%, Steel Dynamics (STLD) 2.1% and AK Steel (AKS) 1.85%. Nucor (NUE) fell 1 cent.Use IBD's MarketSmith For Free Until March 11

9,KSU,"Thursday may be remembered as one of the low points of Donald Trump's presidency because of his widely denounced immigration remarks, but it could have been a banner day, with the announcement by Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) that it will move production of its Ram heavy-duty pickup from Mexico to Michigan.X Financial markets were thrown for a modest loop Wednesday afternoon when reports emerged that Canada now expects President Trump to put into motion the U.S. withdrawal from Nafta, possibly in the next few weeks. Shares of General Motors (GM) and Kansas City Southern (KSU) were among those sliding on the speculation. Yet Fiat Chrysler's news is among the recent developments that now make a near-term Nafta exit all but unthinkable.Here are five reasons why it is extremely unlikely that Trump will move to pull out of the 1994 trade agreement:Trump's strategy to boost American manufacturing always has involved both carrots and sticks. Now that he's got his carrots passed into law with a 21% corporate tax rate, making the U.S. a more attractive location to produce goods, the urgency of applying punitive tariffs has abated. Fiat Chrysler's move gives Trump tangible results to prove that his policies are making a difference in the Rust Belt.To the extent that Steve Bannon's worldview still held influence in the Oval Office after his dismissal in August, that abruptly ended with the release of Michael Wolff's best-seller in which Trump's one-time campaign manager lobbed bombs at the president's children. Now Trump seems to be virtually alone, both in the White House and in the Republican Party, in his belief that the U.S. should walk away from Nafta.IBD'S TAKE: Read IBD's The Big Picture column every day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines. As long as the current ""confirmed uptrend"" — the equivalent of a green light — stays in place, leading stocks breaking above a buy point are more likely than not to have the wind at their backs. Here's a good place to start looking for stocks that may be poised to move higher.It may not be an overstatement to say that Trump is bracing for a war to preserve his presidency. Trump's comments this week raising doubt about whether he would submit to an interview with Special Counsel Robert Mueller underscore the possibility that the midterm elections could be a matter of political life and death for Trump. Even if no proof of collusion emerges, Democrats could seize on Trump's unwillingness to cooperate with the investigation to impeach him for obstructing justice. While a two-thirds vote in the Senate is needed for conviction, Trump's priority No. 1 is keeping the House in Republican hands, and when you're in a war, you don't go looking for unnecessary battles.Most economists expect a fairly modest boost to growth from the tax cuts this year, with Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan economists forecasting a 0.3-percentage-point rise in GDP. While it's possible that those estimates are too conservative, as companies like Wells Fargo (WFC) and Wal-Mart (WMT) respond by hiking their minimum wage, the economy is the best thing that the GOP has going for it in an election year. Trump won't want to disrupt the positive trends by spreading uncertainty at a time when businesses have new incentives to invest in growth.Amid growing odds of a potentially prolonged government shutdown over the status of so-called Dreamers, an announced plan to leave Nafta could offset much of the good economic news.Trump pulled out of the Paris climate agreement, disavowed the Iran nuclear deal, and ordered the wind-down of the deferred action program for Dreamers, so what makes Nafta different? In those first three cases, Trump moved when he faced deadlines to either break with existing policy or actively carry out President Obama's programs. In the case of DACA, for example, the Trump administration had to decide whether to defend Obama's executive action in court. Nafta is different: There's no deadline for making a decision — unless Trump starts the six-month clock for withdrawal — and the current uncertainty he's created about Mexico's status as a preferred U.S. trading partner is probably sufficient to influence business decisions like Fiat Chrysler's.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Here Comes A $1 Trillion — Scratch That — $2 Trillion U.S. Federal DeficitApple And Wal-Mart Are Just Below Buy Points, But Be WaryHow To Invest In Stocks For Free: New Apps Aim For BeginnersLooking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch?

11,KSU,"General Motors (GM), Kansas City Southern (KSU), Constellation Brands (STZ) and other U.S. companies with big Canada and Mexico stakes lurched lower Wednesday afternoon on renewed worries that President Trump could pull out of Nafta.X Two Canadian government sources told Reuters the country is bracing for Trump to announce that the United States will pull out of the North American Free Trade Agreement. The U.S. president has often derided the landmark 1994 treaty as harming the interests of American factory workers.But while Trump seeks a better trade deal, U.S. multinationals such as GM and Ford Motor (F) fret that potential changes to trade terms could disrupt international supply chains and raise the prices of key goods, such as automobiles, for Americans.On the stock market today, shares of GM turned sharply lower after the news broke out around 2 p.m. ET and closed down 2.4% at 43, testing support at the 50-day moving average. Kansas City Southern sank 3.6% to 106.54, breaching the 50-day line. Constellation lost 1.2%, losing support at the 50-day. Ford slipped 0.4%.Exchange traded funds holding baskets of Canadian and Mexican stocks also turned sharply negative. IShares MSCI Mexico (EWW) slid 2.2%, slicing below the 50-day, and iShares MSCI Canada (EWC) gave up 1%.IBD'S TAKE: With thousands of publicly traded companies to choose from, how can you quickly find the best stocks to buy right now? IBD's Leaderboard is a curated list of potential stock market winners.GM and Ford have invested heavily in auto plants in Mexico in recent years. Constellation is the leading importer of Mexican beers into the U.S., including popular brands such as Corona and Modelo, which account for a hefty portion of its revenue. Kansas City's extensive rail network crisscrosses several Southern and Midwestern states and reaches deep into Mexico.The Canadian sources told Reuters they expect Trump to make his move when officials from the three Nafta countries meet Jan. 23-28 for talks in Montreal to update the treaty.But they added a U.S. withdrawal could be merely a negotiating tactic to win concessions, doubting that the U.S. Congress would back such a move.MORE YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:The Big Picture: Stocks Rise Modestly, As Curious Trend Re-Emerges Hot Companies In Hot Sector To Report: Investing Action Plan

UnitedHealth Group (UNH) kicked off health insurance earnings, and led many insurers' stocks to record highs. Cancer drug trial data and M&A buzz moved drug stocks. But General Electric (GE) crashed to a fresh six-year lows amid a huge new charge and speculation that the conglomerate may break up.X The Dow and Nasdaq rose 1% for the week while the S&P 500 climbed 0.9%, with the Nasdaq and S&P 500 hitting record highs on Friday. Chip-gear makers led the way, fueled by ASML (ASML) and others. Health insurers also were big winners as UnitedHealth (UNH) triggered a group rally. Energy stocks pulled back while lithium plays also sold off.Apple (AAPL) is expected to bring home $245 billion in foreign profits banked overseas to help pay for domestic projects, thanks to recently enacted U.S. corporate tax reforms. Apple pledged to contribute more than $350 billion to the U.S. economy over the next five years. That includes creating 20,000 new jobs, funding a new campus and more data centers, and forging deals with U.S. component manufacturers. Analysts say Apple likely will use some of the foreign cash for tuck-in acquisitions and to increase stock buybacks and dividends.The semiconductor equipment group led all industries for the week. ASML Holding (ASML), Ichor Holdings (ICHR) and Electro Scientific Industries (ESIO) rallied on upbeat financial reports. ASML reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter results and Ichor and Electro Scientific each announced preliminary December-quarter sales that topped views.

The charge relates to an old long-term-care portfolio. GE's finance arm will pay $15 billion through 2024 to shore up reserves, raising worries that GE's industrial businesses may have to prop up GE Capital with cash at some point. Flannery will update investors on the portfolio review in the spring. Activist hedge fund Trian Fund Management reportedly is pushing for a GE breakup. GE shares tumbled 13.3% to 16.26, their lowest level in more than six years, as investors questioned whether the last original Dow component has much value.GM (GM) expects 2018 earnings to be largely in line with expected 2017 results, in the high end of the $6-6.50 range. The largest U.S. carmaker expects profits to rise in 2019 and beyond, as it shifts its lineup toward more profitable, next-gen SUVs and trucks. Analysts had expected about $6.24 for 2017 and EPS declines in 2018 and 2019. Ford (F) went the other way, forecasting 2017 earnings of $1.78 per share, below estimates. It expects EPS to dip in 2018, to $1.45-$1.70. Ford said Monday it will invest $11 billion in electric vehicles over the next four years, more than doubling an earlier target. GM shares fell 2.1%, with Ford plunging 9.3%, below a recent buy point.Charles Schwab (SCHW) earnings per share and revenue both rose 14%, both meeting views.

Shares of Schwab rose a fraction for the week while Interactive fell 1%.UnitedHealth Group (UNH) helped spark the Dow's run to 26,000, breaking out 6.4% to a record high after easily clearing Q4 earnings estimates and detailing the impact of tax reform. UnitedHealth earnings jumped 23% to $2.59 a share on 9.5% revenue growth.

On Tuesday, Ford said it will invest $700 million to expand a Michigan plant, where it will create 700 jobs and build its new autonomous and electric vehicles.Ford had announced the Mexico plans in April, saying it sought to improve profitability on its small cars, and drew criticism from then-candidate Trump at the time. But CEO Mark Fields refused to back down.On Tuesday, he said he's encouraged by Trump's pro-growth agenda, while noting that the decision to cancel the new Mexico plant was due primarily to weaker demand for small cars. The Focus will instead be made at an existing plant in Mexico.Fields told CNN that the move is a ""vote of confidence"" in Trump's pledge to create a pro-business climate in the U.S., but insisted that Ford ""didn't cut a deal"" with the president elect.Among U.S. automakers, GM has the bigger footprint in Mexico and relies less on U.S. production.In 2015, 63% of GM's North American output came from the U.S., vs. 80% for Ford and 64% for Fiat Chrysler (FCAU), according to IHS Automotive.GM's plans for the Cruze in Mexico were just part of $5 billion in investments that it planned to make in that country by 2018.General Motors is sending Mexican made model of Chevy Cruze to U.S. car dealers-tax free across border.

GM builds the Chevrolet Cruze hatchback for global markets in Mexico, with a small number sold in the U.S.""The company told CNBC that it sold 190,000 Cruzes in the U.S. in 2016, stressing that just 2.4% were made in Mexico, some 4,500 hatchbacks.The next-generation model Cruze will be made in Mexico, but for export markets, shifting production from South Korea.Ford shares rallied 3.8% to 12.59 on the stock market today, rebounding from the 50-day line. GM stock edged up 0.9%.Kansas City Southern (KSU) fell 4.8% on the Ford news to 80.80, its worst close since last February.

The company said a recent operating property sale would offset the effect of a debt refinancing charge.The rail giant expects overall volume for the quarter to be ""flat to slightly up."" Earlier this month, CSX had said it expected ""roughly flat"" volume.Shares rose 3% to 35.83 in the stock market today, hitting their best level intraday since May 2015. The stock has jumped since the election, with Wall Street likely betting that CSX could see more business shipping supplies due to President-elect Donald Trump's plans to improve the nation's infrastructure. But if Trump engages in protectionism, it could hurt rail's shipments of imports and exports.Union Pacific (UNP) rose 0.8%, while Kansas City Southern (KSU) advanced 0.9%.IBD'S TAKE: Stocks that might have anything to do with the roads, bridges and other key elements of America's infrastructure took off following Trump's election. But more recently, questions have surfaced about the sustainability of the so-called Trump rally. Here's the case for a Trump bull market.The railroad sector has been hurt by the commodity oversupply over the past two years; lower demand for those products has meant lower demand for the companies that ship them.CSX's volumes were down 3% so far during the current quarter, with many markets showing ""more moderate declines than in previous quarters,"" the company said.Coal, an industry that has been decimated in part by cheaper alternatives like natural gas, was showing ""sequential volume stabilization and is essentially flat in the fourth quarter to date.""RELATED:Steel Stocks Soar As Trump Seen Fueling 20% Annual Demand GrowthShipping Stocks Ride Tidal Wave On Trump's Infrastructure Plans

The Street estimated payroll data would come in at 205,000 in February, according to Econoday. The figure rolled in at 313,000, which was 36% above the highest estimate in the range.

63,KSU,"Stocks came under selling pressure early yesterday morning as expected, but then did a complete 180 degree turn around closing mostly higher with the Dow up triple digits, piercing the psychologically important 18k level while the S&P surged 13 pts ending the day right on the highs as the rally that people love to hate moves on. Pressure on oil prices worked against stocks in the first moments of trading but investors/traders and the big banks ended up ignoring the news out of Doha in a move that surprised many.Mkts around the world are all celebrating today...taking their cue from the turnaround in US equities....US futures are rocketing higher - currently up 11 pts as we kiss the psychological 2100 level.....but as my friend Scott Redler (@RedDogT3) tells me on twitter this morning""The first kiss us usually meets some opposition, then the romance gets you around the bases"" - to which I say - Yes, but it is the first kiss that is the sweetest which makes you want to go back for more.....and more is what it looks like we are gonna get today.....Remember - the mkt is a discounting mechanism....it is looking 4 - 6 months out....the trading today is not about today.....(Just sayin.....) - it is really about what the mkts expect in the fall......and by the looks of it - the mkt is expecting great things...Asian mkts were all higher overnight - Japan which got clobbered on Monday - snapped back and regained 100% of Monday's losses.....as we saw the Yen weaken a bit....a stabilizing oil mkt is also helping to support mkts today....After yesterday's mkt action - it appears that investors are disconnecting from the whims of the oil mkt....at least for now and concentrating on earnings.....European mkts are also enjoying an explosive rally....because why? Earnings and oil......and the sense is that maybe - the whole Mid-East OPEC summit was all hype.....to confuse the conversation.....interesting that the possibility of increased production has caused oil to stabilize and rally a bit from the Monday lows.....Does it feel like something else is going on? FTSE +0.56%, CAC 40 + 1.21%, DAX + 2.22%, EUROSTOXX +1.58%, SPAIN +0.88% and ITALY + 0.57%.Now just a thought or two about yesterday.....and the role that the Deputy Crown Prince is now playing......Look the big story was OIL and POLITICS – Mid East politics – and after two months of all the hype about this pending agreement in a production freeze – traders and the mkts had to deal with the fact that there was no deal – which now sets up the oil mkt for a possible 'free for all'….Keep your eyes on Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman – for he is now the name to know – for it was this 30 yr old son of King Salman who has now turned over the apple cart and merged the commercial considerations of the kingdom with his political stance – a move that is in complete contrast to what was existing policy.......You see for the past 20 yrs – Ali Al-Naimi – the current Saudi oil minister has kept those two issues on separate pages – keeping supply and pricing as the main drivers of any production decisions, always cooperating with the other members – including Iran – no matter what their politics were – in the past to cut production to boost oil prices. The Deputy Crown Prince is not sure he agrees with this policy and so while all the talk has been about how the Saudi's were cooperating with Russia, Venezuela and Qatar – Iran was still the thorn in Prince Mohammed's side….so in a bid to establish himself as an emerging 'force' - as the potential heir to the throne - he nixed the oil deal sending oil mkts into a tailspin on Sunday night/Monday.What is important to understand is that the deputy Crown Prince has now burst onto the global stage since his father became King last year and appears to have every intention of letting the world know. He was appointed the Defense Minister – and is the one responsible for launching the latest military campaign in Yemen while also chairing the country's 'economic planning body' and the council that controls the massive 'state owned' oil company. In a telling interview last week with Bloomberg – the Prince was very clear –""We don't care about oil prices, $30 or $70, they are the same to us. We have our own programs that don't need high oil prices.""This is not how the rest of the OPEC and non OPEC members feel at all – so by nixing any deal he has protected the Saudi's mkt share, and has secured their role as a 'leader' while at the same time laying the groundwork for continued political instability in the region.OK - back to the mkts.....After the initial concerns over these recent developments – the focus returned to US earnings…the day started off with better numbers from Pepsico (PEP), Hasbro (HAS), JB Hunt (JBHT) and in a another surprise move – we learned that Morgan Stanley (MS) – while reporting horrible numbers did in fact ""beat all the estimates."" Net Income FELL 54%, Equity trading revenues FELL 34%, Fixed Income trading revenues FELL 52% and Investment Banking Revenues FELL 15% - but yet they somehow managed to beat the 'much lower' EPS expectation….so all this means is that we must watch out for Goldman Sachs (GS) report this morning.....Analysts expect EPS of $2.48......Now remember – Uncle Lloyd pre-announced this 're-structuring' plan late on Friday – so investors/traders have been prepped about all the bad news and how he has dealt with it head on…. – and like Cousin Jamie (Dimon) of JP Morgan (JPM)– Uncle Lloyd knows how to 'massage' the street analysts – so what I expect to hear this morning is a 'BLOW YOUR SOCKS OFF EPS' beat to rival even the most generous estimate….and the clock ticks towards 7:30 am......In other news - United Health (UNH) just reported a better number - $1.81 vs. exp of $1.72, Philip Morris (PM) on the other hand missed - $0.98 vs. exp of $1.10.....

65,KSU,"And the mkts have come roaring back…even the trains, planes and automobiles are joining in on the fun as the Dow Transports (Trannies) are now back in 'official' Bull mkt mode having rallied 22% off of the January lows…..Now Dow Theory tells us that the mkt is in an uptrend when ONE of its averages (the industrials or the trannies) advances above a previous important high….it should then be followed by the other Dow index…Now while the Trannies have not pierced their November highs of 8286 - they have rocketed higher over the past 8 weeks – (as noted up 22%), they have pierced the down trending 200 dma at 7856 and look like they are 'breaking out'..... and appear to be on their way to challenge the November high -Now this is important really – because the Trannies represent the transportation sector of the US economy and its companies are tied to the shipping, rail, and trucking sectors – sectors that 'move stuff around' and send signals about the health of the economy…..now recall – this index got 'clocked' in the early part of the year……after concerns about global growth and a coming US recession caused investors to shift out of this important 'barometer group' - Because slowing global growth and a US recession would negatively impact these companies. And there were some real serious concerns – as investors took some 22% out of the index since late November - but remember simple math works in strange ways....if the index (or a stock or any asset) goes down in value by 22% and then rallies back by 22% - you are still short - you have NOT gone back to 0 - in fact the index needs to rally back 30% just to stay even. So it still has work to do.......The latest move now tells us that investors have changed their minds…..Global Growth Concerns? US Recession? – Bah Humbug……Apparently investors are convinced that the worst is over and they have gone out on a buying spree – scooping up some names for a fraction of their current value. Now the Trannies are trading at about 13 times trailing earnings – or a 32% discount to their 3 yr avg of 19.2 times. So there IS value there IF the supposed improving global macro data is true. A look at some of the participants reveals where investors are placing their bets....UPS (UPS) & FedEx (FDX) - have rocketed higher, piercing their 200 dma's....while , Kansas City Southern (KSU), CSX Corp. (CSX), Kirby Corp. (KEX) are all teasing these key trend lines....Now overnight - global mkts began the week a bit mixed.....There is not a lot of macro data due out this week - so we can expect the mkts to churn and digest the latest moves in this holiday shortened week.......Japan was closed for a holiday and China surged by 2% as investors there focused on loosening margin lending requirements.....Australia came under a bit of pressure as losses in commodities weighed on that mkt.In Europe - those mkts are flat to slightly higher after a weaker opening....There was no material news out to drive the mkts either way - so they churn. FTSE -0.09%, CAC 40 -0.2%, DAX +0.4% , EUROSTOXX +0.12%, SPAIN +0.19% and ITALY +0.83%.Oil once again under pressure as the dollar stabilizes and moves a bit higher....remember - much of the oil action has been dollar driven and more unprecedented global monetary easing has created a currency war but has helped to wipe out the losses suffered since January. Now while it makes everyone feel good - the weak dynamics of the global economy still exist....and with earnings season only 2 weeks away - it will be about the fundamentals once again.....And while the central banks have all created the fire - the latest move is sure to come under some pressure if the fundamentals disappoint..... If the fundamentals do not disappoint - then the conversation returns to FED policy and interest rates. I continue to believe that June will see a small hike of 25 bps - but then nothing more.US futures are flat, the dollar is flat and oil is now down 1% as the day begins.....We only have one data point and this is Existing Home Sales - expectations are for a drop of 2.9% m/m. Atlanta FED's Dennis Lockhart is due to speak today at 12:30 pm - I would not expect him to say anything so significant - as he tends to be Dove and is on the side of the latest FED move. - So if anything - look for him to remain cautious on the outlook.....Now the S&P at 2048 is well above the 200 dma which stands at 2017. In this holiday shortened week - with little eco data to digest - it would not be surprising to see the S&P test what is now support for the mkts. After the most recent rally - the mkt is a bit ahead of itself and some back testing is in order.Take Good Care

67,KSU,"The rise of anti-establishment political forces in the U.S., where Donald Trump leads the GOP field, and in Europe represents an ""uncertainty premium"" that markets have yet to price in, said Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic adviser at Allianz, on Thursday.Trump echoed his anti-free-trade rhetoric, which could hurt prospects for top U.S. exporters like aerospace giant Boeing (BA) and industrial conglomerate General Electric (GE).""If I'm losing $505 billion with China, if I'm losing $58 billion a year with Mexico in terms of deficits, what do I want that kind of trade for anyway?"" Trump said Thursday while responding to criticism from Mitt Romney. ""Who needs that kind of trade?""Markets haven't paid attention to the Republican or Democratic races, which has seen Bernie Sanders also ride an anti-establishment surge, but that will change by the summer, El-Erian said on CNBC.When asked if markets should account for a ""Trump premium,"" he said that has been difficult to assess because while the real estate mogul is a front-runner, he lacks the backing from the party establishment.""It will make a difference as to who emerges,"" El-Erian said. ""It will make a difference as to what the plans are and how comprehensive they are.""El-Erian didn't mention specific stocks, but Trump's stance on trade comes amid a backlash against other trade-promotion efforts.Boeing and General Electric have already fought against conservative Republicans in Congress opposed to the Export-Import Bank's charter, which expired last year but was later renewed.Trump has also been vocal in saying that trade agreements such as the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) have made the U.S. weak and that he would abolish them. U.S. railroads such as CSX (CSX), which operates mainly in the U.S. and Canada, and Kansas City Southern (KSU), which runs in the U.S. and Mexico, could be affected.Meanwhile, Sanders has said that free trade has been ""a disaster for the American people."" And Hillary Clinton previously sounded favorable notes on the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal but now opposes it.Boeing closed essentially flat while GE edged up 0.1%t. CSX, which is trying to fend off an offer to merge from Canadian Pacific (CP), rose 1.4%.Kansas City Southern gained 1%. It rose above its 50-day average earlier this month and was trading just below its 10-week line. Canadian Pacific added 1.7%.

68,KSU,"Union Pacific (UNP) and Canadian Pacific Railway (CP) reported lower-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings and revenue as the energy slump continues and economic conditions remain unstable.Union Pacific, the nation's largest railroad operator, reported that operating income dropped 8% to $8.1 billion. That translates to an 18.6% drop in earnings per share to $1.31 early Thursday, missing Wall Street's target by 9 cents. It was the first miss in three quarters.Revenue fell 15.4% to $5.21 billion. Analysts projected $5.45 billion. Overall volume was 9% lower than the same quarter a year ago. The company blamed energy market woes as well as broader economic conditions. Oil prices have tumbled more than 70% since mid-2014.For freight shipments, revenue for coal plunged 31%, while industrial products slid 23%. Tellingly, intermodal — containers used by trains, trucks and ships that carry consumer goods such as electronics — slid 14%, indicating weakness beyond the energy sector.Auto revenue was the only category that rose. It was up 1%.Union Pacific sees first-quarter volume down in the mid-single digits.""Overall economic conditions, uncertainty in the energy markets, commodity prices and the strength of the U.S. dollar will continue to have a major impact on our business this year,"" CEO Lance Fritz said in a statement.Union Pacific stock fell 3.55% to 71 on Thursday. That's well off its intraday high at 98.26 on Oct. 23. Union Pacific has a weak 45 IBD Composite Rating, meaning 55% of all stocks have performed better on key metrics such as sales and profit growth.Canadian Pacific Railway, which is making a hostile bid for Norfolk Southern (NSC) in November, also reported weaker-than-expected Q4 earnings and revenue amid declining volume on weaker oil and coal shipments.Canadian Pacific shares rallied to close up 0.5% at 104.87 after tumbling to 97.09 intraday.Norfolk Southern, which is fighting Canadian Pacific's overtures, fell 1.6%. Kansas City Southern (KSU), slated to announce financial results Friday, rose 0.3%.CSX (CSX), which reported mixed results last week, rose 0.3% after losing 2% on Wednesday.

69,KSU,"They call it stormy December, but January was  -- worse.On the heels of December's 1.58% decline in the S&P 500 and 2.80% tumble for U.S. diversified stock mutual funds, in January the broad market lost 4.96% and U.S. diversified stock funds dove 6.25%, according to Lipper Inc.It was the sixth worst January for the big-cap bogey in the past 47 years. And in that span it was the third worst opening month to a year for U.S. diversified stock funds as a group.Click Here To See List Of Top Performing Mutual Funds Past 6 MonthsThere was no mystery about the main culprits. Investors worried about stock market news that harped on China's economic slowdown and speculated about how badly it would affect the global economy -- including that of the U.S.And investors fretted about oil's declining price. Light sweet crude, for example, fell from $37.04 a barrel to $33.62 by January's end. It closed below $30 on five trading days.""China and oil are two of the reasons for the weak market in January,"" said Phil Orlando, chief equity strategist at Federated Investors. ""I would also throw into the mix the strong dollar, high inventories, weak manufacturing sector and the political cycle.""Still, the market trended higher in its final eight sessions. Why? Credit the Federal Reserve, Orlando says. On Jan. 27, the Fed signaled that its decisions regarding future rate hikes ""would be dovish, data dependent and cautious,"" Orlando said.That was in stark contrast to the Fed's quarter-percentage-point rate hike in December.Also, Japan's central bank went to negative interest rates on certain bank reserves -- a move that bolsters stocks by making them more attractive than cash.The Federal Reserve action preceded by two days the Bureau of Economic Analysis' release of its advance estimate of GDP growth in the fourth quarter: annualized 0.7% growth, lower than Q3's 2% gain and slightly below market expectations of 0.8% for Q4.So investors, who were already spooked by the five indicators that Orlando cites, were relieved by the BEA's move, which virtually wiped out the prospect of three or four rates hikes in 2016. ""And when the Fed does make its next rate hike, investors know that that will be a sign of the Fed's faith that the economy is strong enough to handle it,"" Orlando said.Orlando believes that the Fed won't lift its rate again until the U.S. sees a quarter with 2% annualized GDP growth. ""July is the earliest we might see sufficiently strong data,"" he said. ""Then September is the next time that they'd be likely to raise the rate.""A 9.03% gain made dedicated short-bias funds the best-performing mutual funds among all U.S. diversified stock funds in January.Click Here To See The Top-Performing Stock And Bond Mutual Fund CategoriesAmong just market capitalization and style categories within U.S. diversifieds, large-cap core funds did best by losing the least, 5.35% in the month. Equity-income funds gave up even less: -3.92%.Top large-cap growth managers included Frank Caruso, whose AB Large Cap Growth Fund (APGAX) fell 6.08% last month.Reflecting the flight to safe havens, commodities precious metals funds paced all sectors, gaining 2.53%.Also reflecting the flight to safety, U.S. Treasury bond funds leapt 3.45% as taxable-bond funds overall lost 0.34% in the month.Latin American funds led foreign-region stock funds by losing the least, -4.30%.Orlando expects the market blahs to continue until about midyear.""I don't think China is going into recession,"" he said. ""Consumers are doing well there, but it will take a couple of quarters for investors to figure that out. Consumers in China will offset weakness in manufacturing by midyear.""By midyear, investors should also see that the U.S. dollar has stopped strengthening altogether, or at least as fast as it has, he adds. ""That dollar stabilization will make it easier for U.S. megacaps to export, which will boost corporate earnings,"" he said.Corporate inventories are already falling, he says. ""So we might see a restocking-cycle kick off in the second half of the year, which would boost manufacturing,"" he said.The Chicago Purchasing Managers Index jumped to 55.6 in January from 42.9 in December, the highest pace of growth in a year. When that barometer tops 50, it's a sign of growth in the manufacturing sector. ""It was in contraction mode the last six months,"" Orlando said.As for politics, only once in the past 75 years has the party in power extended control of the White House to a third straight term. Concern about weak growth in jobs and wages should help swing control of the presidency to Republicans, Orlando says. And that should be good for business interests.With his eyes glued to midyear, Orlando expects that the technology, consumer-discretionary and industrial sectors to lead the breakout. That should benefit tech-hardware makers, chipmakers, automakers, homebuilders and airlines, he says.""Once the Fed starts to tighten again, then financials ought to work better,"" he said.In the meantime, his focus is on lower-beta, higher-dividend stocks. Names that he likes include Exxon Mobile (XOM) and Royal Dutch (RDSA).""In the first half of the year, we have overweights in Europe and Japan vs. the U.S.,"" he said. ""We're overweight in developed foreign markets but underweight in emerging markets.""Jeff Rottinghaus, manager of $1.6 billion T. Rowe Price Growth & Income (PRGIX) and of $203 million Large Cap (TRULX), also expects ""a pretty tough year."" To cope with slower earnings growth, he has beefed up what he calls quality and higher-yield stocks. He's also been looking for early cyclical stocks with sound fundamentals, whose prices have been beaten up.In railroads, he began to buy Kansas City Southern (KSU) late last year.

Earnings fell 6% last year and are expected to increase 1% this year and 13% next year.In financials, he likes Intercontinental Exchange (ICE). ""They take advantage of volatility,"" he said. Intercontinental provides a market for derivatives, which many investors use to hedge volatility.He also likes American Tower (AMT) and Crown Castle (CCI), two REITs that own wireless towers. Their long-term contracts with telecom carriers give them ""fantastic recurring revenue businesses that should do well in a more stressed economic environment,"" he said.And in consumer staples he owns CVS (CVS), PepsiCo (PEP) and Philip Morris International (PM).In fixed income, he expects bonds generally to look more appealing if the Fed is forced to pause its rate hikes.

70,KSU,"Shares of Norfolk Southern (NSC) rose Friday on a report that BNSF Railway Chairman Matt Rose said his company may enter the bidding for the struggling railroad. BNSF, which is controlled by Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB), might step in to provide a competitive bid to Canadian Pacific Railway's (CP) $28 billion hostile offer for Norfolk Southern, Rose told Bloomberg…
"
71,KSU,"Rail operator Canadian Pacific (CP) on Wednesday made public the details of its bid for Norfolk Southern (NSC) — a 50/50 cash and stock deal Canadian said would create a safer, more efficient transcontinental railway — after Norfolk said late Tuesday it received the offer but reacted frostily to its terms.
"
72,KSU,"Canadian Pacific, whose interest in buying Norfolk was reported last week, said Norfolk Southern shareholders would get $46.72 in cash and 0.348 share of the new company for every share of Norfolk Southern, making the offer worth around $28 billion. The deal was worth 97.72 a share near midday Wednesday. The new company would run both rail operators.
"
73,KSU,"Canadian, which is Canada's No. 2 rail operator, said that by the time of the deal's closing, expected on Dec. 31, 2017, the new company would be worth $270.68 per share. Shareholders of Norfolk Southern, the eastern U.S.' No. 2 railway, would own 41% of the new company.
"
74,KSU,"Canadian said the deal could bring over $1.8 billion in operating synergies annually in the coming years, as well as ""substantial tax savings.""
"
75,KSU,"Those details, expressed in a letter dated Nov. 9 to Norfolk CEO James Squires from Canadian CEO Hunter Harrison, come after Norfolk on Tuesday said it would evaluate what it called ""an unsolicited, low-premium, nonbinding, highly conditional indication of interest from Canadian Pacific"" that represented ""a premium of less than 10%"" based on Tuesday's closing prices.
"
76,KSU,"""Notably, any consolidation among Class I railroads in North America would face significant regulatory hurdles,"" Norfolk said.
"
77,KSU,"Norfolk Southern has a market cap of around $27.7 billion, according to IBD data. Canadian Pacific has a market cap of nearly $23 billion.

127,KSU,"Kansas City Southern (KSU) said it's reached an agreement to build a storage rail yard that it will lease to diversified firm Sasol Chemicals, which is building an $8.1 billion facility, including six chemical plants, in West Lake, La.The companies did not immediately provide financial terms.The project could help Kansas City Southern rebuild its revenue base, which along with profit growth has fallen due to weakness in the energy market. Like peers such as America's largest railroad Union Pacific (UNP), Norfolk Southern (NSC) and Canadian Pacific (CP), it's been hurt by low commodity prices in coal, oil, gas and steel.On May 14, Kansas City Southern withdrew its revenue and volume guidance and cut its capital spending target, citing uncertainty around energy markets and unfavorable currency rates. The railroad said at the time that its revenue was down by 50% and number of carloads had fallen nearly 40% from the same quarter a year ago.The railroad will build the storage-in-transit rail yard for Sasol and also replace and expand its existing rail car yard in nearby Mossville, La., to support Sasol's ethane cracking facility, which is expected to be completed by 2018.Ethane cracking is a process of converting ethane extracted from natural gas to create ethylene, a widely used chemical in the petrochemical industry.Kansas City Southern shares were down 0.8% to 93.37 in late morning trading in the stock market today, Monday. It closed at 90.02 on May 29, its lowest point since mid-January 2013.

220,KSU,"Following a tour of Canadian National Railway 's (CNI) Chicago operation, RBC Capital Markets said the railroad operator is positioned ""to sustain an industry-leading financial and operating performance"" in one of the nation's strongest sectors of the economy.With an IBD Composite Rating of 99, Canadian National ranks No. 1 in IBD's Transportation-Rail group. The group itself ranks No. 8 of 197 industries tracked, helped by heavy demand for oil and gas transportation.Other leading stocks in the group include three names on the IBD 50 list of top growth stocks: Kansas City Southern (KSU) and Union Pacific (UNP) — both of which also have a 99 Composite Rating — along with Canadian Pacific Railway (CP), with a rating of 98. Also high-ranking in the group is Norfolk Southern (NSC), with a rating of 95.In a note released Monday, RBC Capital analyst Walter Spracklin said he came away from a tour of Canadian National's Chicago operations ""with increased confidence in the company's operating model in this region.""The tour included a ride on the Elgin, Joliet and Eastern railway (EJ&E), which Canadian National acquired in 2009.Spracklin said the EJ&E ""provides control and fluidity in North America's most congested rail freight interchange."" Since taking over the operation, Canadian National has cut the travel time around Chicago from more than 24 hours to a range of four to six hours, he added.""In addition to the velocity benefits, this unencumbered route around Chicago has given (Canadian National) a significant competitive advantage as the company was able to quickly regain fluidity when extreme weather subsided earlier this year,"" Spracklin noted.In contrast, industry performance data suggest that other Class 1 railroad operators ""remain severely impacted by congestion in this region,"" he said. ""With the construction of two more connections on the EJ&E under way, we see upside to the velocity and efficiency gains that Canadian National has achieved to date.""Meanwhile, Canadian National continues to expand its Kirk Yard freight yard property, located southeast of Chicago in Northwest Indiana.The $142 million expansion program is expected to lift the yard's processing capacity by about 80% to 3,200 cars a day, Spracklin noted. ""With increased throughput capacity at Kirk Yard, (Canadian National) will consolidate classification activities in this location, freeing up space at other yards in the Chicago area.""In addition, he said, Canadian National ""will be able to build trains that can bypass other major yards, resulting in longer, more efficient hauls and taking pressure off of other high-traffic parts of the network.""Shares of Canadian National, which fell slightly in midday trading on the stock market today, are up about 24% since the beginning of the year. However, the stock is down about 6% from a Sept. 18 peak. The group is up 18% for the year to date.

299,KSU,"General Electric Company’s (GE  -  Free Report) operating segment, GE Transportation, recently secured orders for 50 new locomotives from the Mexican and US rail subsidiaries of Kansas City Southern (KSU  -  Free Report). Notably, these locomotives are expected to be delivered by GE Transportation in 2019. Also, GE Transportation will offer digital solutions that would improve fuel and operational efficiency.With an increase in freight volume and improving North American rail market, the advanced locomotives will allow Kansas City Southern to boost operational efficiencies across its rail network. This will alsoenable Kansas City Southernto continue with the modernization of its locomotive fleet.Notably, the latest order comprises General Electric’sTier 4 Evolution Series locomotives, Trip Optimizer System as well as Distributed Power LOCOTROL technologies. These technology solutions will help in the optimization of power distribution, brake control, train handling as well as fuel utilization. These new locomotives are to be produced at the GE Manufacturing Solutions facility, located in Fort Worth, with the first units likely to be delivered early next year.Existing Business ScenarioGE Power is the largest business segment of General Electricin terms of corporate revenues. However, the business has been a drag on earnings over the last few quarters. This is because global demand started to decline with increasing popularity of renewable energy sources, overcapacity, lower utilization and fewer outages. Also, in a bid to focus more on its core business activities, the company has exited from the financial business and has increased its investments in key industrial businesses through restructuring, state-of-the-art technology and research & development initiatives.In the past six months, General Electric has underperformed the industry it belongs to. The stock has lost 24.6% compared with the industry’s 12% decline. Moving ahead, the company intends to focus on three core segments — power, aviation and healthcare equipment — which require advanced hi-tech products with a high degree of reliability. These products might expand margins and are likely to contribute to long-term growth, thus driving shares.Currently, the company has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the same space are Federal Signal Corporation (FSS  -  Free Report) and Raven Industries, Inc. (RAVN  -  Free Report). Both these stocks carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

300,KSU,"A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Kansas City Southern (KSU  -  Free Report). Shares have lost about 1.3% in that time frame.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is KSU due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.First-Quarter ResultsKansas City Southern’s  first-quarter 2018 earnings (excluding 10 cents from non-recurring items) of $1.30 fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.35. The bottom line, however, improved 11.1% on a year-over-year basis buoyed by volume growth. Overall carload volumes ticked up 1% in the quarter.Kansas City Southern recorded revenues of $638.6 million, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $643.5 million. However, it compared favorably with the year-ago number of $609.5 million. Strong performance at the Chemical & Petroleum unit contributed to the year-over-year expansion in the top line.Meanwhile, operating income increased 4% (on a reported basis) to $219 million. Kansas City Southern’s operating ratio (operating expenses as a percentage of revenues) deteriorated to 65.8% from 65.4% a year ago.  Operating expenses rose 5% in the quarter.The company still expects current-year volume growth in mid-single digits.Segmental ResultsThe Chemical & Petroleum segment generated revenues of $139.7 million, up 10% year over year. Volumes improved 2% year over year. Revenues per carload also increased 8% from a year ago.The Industrial & Consumer Products segment raked in revenues of $146.3 million, up 4% year over year. Business volumes and revenues per carload climbed a respective 1% and 3% year over year.Total revenues at the Agriculture & Minerals segment were $113.4 million, down 2% year over year. While business volumes declined 5%, revenues per carload were up 3%, both on a year-over-year basis.The Energy segment generated revenues of $61.3 million, down 11% year over year. Dismal performance at the Utility Coal and Coal & Petroleum Coke dented results. While business volumes contracted 20% year over year, revenues per carload rose 11%.Intermodal revenues totaled $90.9 million, up 9% year over year. While business volumes improved 8%, revenues per carload were flat in the reported quarter.Revenues at the Automotive segment came in at $59.8 million, up 17% year over year. While business volumes improved 6%, revenues per carload increased 10%.Other revenues totaled $27.2 million, up 19% year over year.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates. There has been one revision higher for the current quarter compared to three lower.Kansas City Southern Price and Consensus Kansas City Southern Price and Consensus | Kansas City Southern QuoteVGM ScoresAt this time, KSU has a poor Growth Score of F, however its Momentum is doing a lot better with a B. Charting a somewhat similar path, the stock was allocated a grade of C on the value side, putting it in the middle 20% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of D. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.Our style scores indicate that the stock is more suitable for momentum investors than value investors.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. Notably, KSU has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.

301,KSU,"The transportation sector is riding high on first-quarter financial results, with total earnings from 97.8% of the sector’s total market capitalization, reported so far, up 20.9% on revenue growth of 8.7%. Both revenue and earnings surprises of 76.9% also seem impressive.This is because most of the key industry players managed to beat our estimates on earnings or revenues or both, while a few lagged.For a better understanding, let’s dig into the earnings results of some well-known industry players:Transportation Earnings in FocusThe world's largest package delivery company United Parcel Service (UPS  -  Free Report) topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate on both fronts. Earnings of $1.55 surpassed the earnings estimate by a penny while revenues of $17.11 billion edged past the estimated $16.44 billion. For fiscal 2018, the company continued to expect earnings per share in the range of $7.03-$7.37. The Zacks Consensus Estimate at the time of earnings release was pegged at $7.22 (see: all the Industrials ETFs here).The major railroads – Union Pacific (UNP  -  Free Report) and Norfolk Southern Corp (NSC  -  Free Report) – beat on both the top and the bottom lines while Kansas City Southern (KSU  -  Free Report) missed. UNP and NSC surpassed the earnings estimate by 3 cents and 16 cents, respectively, and revenue estimates by $104 million and $35 million. On the other hand, earnings of $1.30 at KSU lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate by five cents while revenues of $639 million were also marginally below our estimated $644 million.Ryder Systems (R  -  Free Report), the leader in supply chain management and fleet management services, beat the earnings estimate by three cents and revenue estimate by $30 million.The two largest U.S. airlines Delta Air Lines (DAL  -  Free Report) and United Continental (UAL  -  Free Report) also reported better-than-expected results. Earnings of 74 cents and revenues of $9.97 billion at Delta edged past the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 73 cents and $9.91 billion, respectively. For the second quarter of 2018, the carrier expects earnings per share in the range of $1.80-$2.00 (read: ETFs & Stocks to Fly High on Record Spring Travel).At United Continental, earnings per share of 50 cents came above the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny and revenues of $9.03 billion slightly edged past the estimated $9.01 billion. The company raised the lower end of the earnings per share to $7.00-$8.50 for the year from $6.50-$8.50. The Zacks Consensus Estimate at the time of earnings release was pegged at $7.83.Last but not the least, earnings for the leading trucking carrier J.B. Hunt (JBHT  -  Free Report) came in couple of cents below the Zacks Consensus Estimate but revenues were $76 million above the estimate.ETFs in FocusWhile the string of solid results from industry players made the case for transport ETFs appealing, a jump in oil price and a rise in dollar led to losses over the past month. As such, iShares Dow Jones Transportation Average Fund (IYT  -  Free Report), SPDR S&P Transportation ETF (XTN  -  Free Report) and First Trust Nasdaq Transportation ETF (FTXR) shed 0.8%, 2.5% and 1.8%, respectively. All these funds have a Zacks ETF Rank #3 (Hold).IYTThe fund tracks the Dow Jones Transportation Average Index, giving investors exposure to a small basket of 20 securities. Though the product is heavily concentrated on the top firm FedEx (FDX) at 14.7%, the in-focus eight firms collectively make up for 47% of the portfolio. From a sector perspective, air freight & logistics takes the top spot with 30.2% of the portfolio while railroads, trucking and airlines round off to the next three spots with double-digit exposure each. The fund has accumulated nearly $804.5 million in AUM while sees solid trading volume of around 248,000 shares a day. It charges 44 bps in annual fees (read: Transport ETFs to Ride High on Huge Earnings Beat by FedEx).XTNThis fund tracks the S&P Transportation Select Industry Index, holding 42 stocks in its basket. The in-focus firms account for over 2% share each. Further, about 31.2% of the portfolio is dominated by trucking, while airlines, and air freight & logistics take one-fourth share each. Airfreight & logistics, and railroads also make up for a double-digit allocation each. With AUM of $225.6 million, the fund charges 35 bps in fees per year from investors and trades in a lower volume of around 34,000 shares a day.FTXRThis fund offers exposure to the 30 most-liquid U.S. transportation securities based on volatility, value and growth by tracking the Nasdaq US Smart Transportation Index. The in-focus eight firms account for a combined 24% share. FTXR has accumulated $3.6 million in its asset base and charges 60 bps in annual fees.

The Technology Select Sector SPDR (XLK) and Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR (XLP) declined 1.5% and 1.7%, respectively. Meanwhile, the tech-heavy Nasdaq shed 7146.13 points.Tech Stocks, Consumer Staples Take a HitTech stocks declined on Friday, with Apple at the helm of the carnage, as concerns over weak demand of iPhones saw the company’s shares plummeting. Shares of Apple declined 4.1% after Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report) predicted that sales of iPhone in the June quarter will be low.This saw other tech stocks taking a hit for the fourth consecutive day ahead of the earnings week for the sector. Tech stocks have been reeling under pressure for quite some time now and the low sales projection of iPhones is a further blow to the sector.Moreover, consumer staples stocks declined led by PepsiCo (PEP  -  Free Report), which fell 2.9%. Also, shares of Procter & Gamble and Phillip Morris International (PM  -  Free Report) declined 2.9% and 1.6%, respectively. Procter and Gamble’s shares declined after the company said on Thursday that higher costs and shrinking retailer inventories were weighing on its margins. Shares of Philip Morris declined after the company reported weak shipment volumes in its quarterly results.10-Year Treasury Note Hits 4-Year HighFriday’s decline in stocks were also driven by investors’ fears over concerns of expectations of rising inflation., The 10-year Treasury yield reached 2.96%, its highest level since January 2014. This saw huge selloffs in bonds. Investors panicked as they felt that the government’s protectionist policy will boost inflation higher. However, banks stocks gained on the back of higher rates. This saw the Financial Select Sector SPDR (XLF) gain 0.1%.Weekly RoundupIt was a mixed week for all the three major indexes as the earnings season got into full swing. U.S. stock markets surged on the first two day of the week driven by robust first-quarter 2018 earnings results, strong economic data and easing geopolitical tensions. The middle of the week was a mixed bag for the markets with the Dow declining marginally.However, the last two days of the week saw all major indexes ending in red. This was primarily because of concerns over rising inflation, which saw the 10-year Treasury yield touching a four year high. Moreover, consumer staples stocks too suffered, as earnings failed to produce any blowout results that the market was looking for. The tech sector was once again hit after Morgan Stanley said that iPhones would witness sales in the June quarter.However, despite this, both Dow and S&P 500 rose 0.4% each over the week, while Nasdaq gained 1.3%.Stocks That Made HeadlinesKansas City Southern Q1 Earnings Miss, Improve Y/YKansas City Southern’s (KSU  -  Free Report) first-quarter 2018 earnings fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate.

307,KSU,"Kansas City Southern (KSU  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 20, before the market opens.Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 1.5%. Moreover, the company has an impressive earnings history, having outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the preceding four quarters with an average beat of 2.3%.However, things do not look up for the company this quarter. As a result, the stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter earnings being revised 3.5% downward in the last 60 days.Factors at PlayHigh operating expenses are expected to hurt the company's bottom line in the first quarter as was the case previously.The uncertainty over the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) might also hamper results in the to-be-reported quarter. This is because the railroad operator draws a significant portion of its revenues from U.S.-Mexico shipments.Kansas City Southern's trailing 12-month return on equity (ROE) undercuts its growth potential. The company’s ROE of 12.1% compares unfavorably with its industry’s 20.4% ROE and the S&P 500 index’s 16% tally.However, overall volume growth is anticipated to aid results in the first quarter. Additionally, the growth of intermodal volume augurs well for the company and is anticipated to drive intermodal revenues.The new tax law should also boost profits for the company, leading to bottom-line growth in the first quarter. Its efforts to reward shareholders through dividend payments and buybacks are a further positive.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Kansas City Southern is likely to beat estimates this quarter.

308,KSU,"There is no doubt that the new tax law has been a big positive for railroads and should be instrumental in driving growth for the industry. The new tax law apart, other factors like a buoyant U.S. economy and intermodal growth act as major tailwinds for this key sector.These positives notwithstanding, there are a few factors that raise concerns for railroads. Let’s dig deep on the subject.Sluggish Automotive Production – A Key ChallengeWeakness in the automotive sector has been hurting railroads for quite some time, with domestic production declining substantially. The scenario was not vastly different in the final quarter of 2017 as well. Results of major railroad operators like Union Pacific Corporation (UNP  -  Free Report) and Norfolk Southern Corporation (NSC  -  Free Report) were hurt by soft automotive volumes.What’s worse is that the situation is unlikely to improve in the current year.Union Pacific on its fourth-quarter conference call said that light vehicle sales for full-year 2018 are projected at 16.9 million units, reflecting a 2% decline from the 2017 levels. Norfolk Southern, meanwhile, said that it expects automotive volume to lag vehicle production in the United States.These disappointing commentaries on the automotive sector do not bode well for railroads. As a significant portion of revenues is accounted for by this key sector, weakness pertaining to automotive production in the United States is a major headwind for railroads.Service IssuesCSX Corporation (CSX  -  Free Report) was plagued by service disruptions last year, which severely dented its operations. However, the railroad took measures to combat the issue. The Precision Scheduled Railroading system, implemented by the company's former CEO, E. Hunter Harrison, seems to be paying off. The system generated efficiency-related savings to the tune of $460 million in 2017.However, service issues now seem to be hurting Canadian railroad operator, Canadian National Railway Company (CNI  -  Free Report). In fact, the company has been facing a number of challenges related to network congestion for the past few months, which have hurt its operational performance. Further, oilfield service major, Halliburton Company's (HAL  -  Free Report) statement issued in February 2018 that Canadian National’s service delays have been affecting its bottom line, underlines the gravity of this situation.Additionally, rival Canadian Pacific Railway Limited’s (CP  -  Free Report) commentary about its increasing network fluidity highlights the fact that these operational issues might affect Canadian National’s customer base and adversely impact its growth prospects, unless resolved quickly.Canadian National announced a change at its helm, in March 2018, in order to primarily address the service issues. The new CEO (interim) has apologized to its customers for the service woes. He has promised an improvement on the service front. However, in the event of management change failing to yield the desired results, the stock would be hurt further.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.NAFTANAFTA refers to the trade pact inked in 1994 between the United States, Canada and Mexico in a bid to secure better terms for domestic workers. NAFTA has basically done away with almost all tariffs among the three nations. However, President Trump has in fact threatened to withdraw from the agreement, if the negotiations, which are currently in progress, fail to yield the desired results. He believes that it is a bad deal, not in favor of American workers.The uncertainty over the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) continues to hurt railroads, especially the ones like Kansas City Southern (KSU  -  Free Report). A significant portion of Kansas City Southern’s revenues come from U.S.-Mexico shipment. In fact, many railroads including Kansas City Southern are not in favor of the U.S. scrapping NAFTA. They believe that such a move might put pressure on supply chains, jobs and consumers apart from having adverse political implications.However, the President has stuck to his guns and imposed a deadline of May 1 pertaining to the NAFTA negations. Beyond that date, there will be imposition of steel and aluminum tariffs on Mexico and Canada.Railroads would be hoping for a favorable resolution to the issue as an unfavorable development on this key issue might dampen their prospects severely.Other HeadwindsPresident Trump’s plans to shift focus to traditional energy businesses such as coal is aimed at benefiting the coal industry and therefore railroads. This is because the fortunes of railroads are tied to coal.However, even if the Obama-era Clean Power Plan (CPP) is repealed, as wished by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), coal revenues might not pick up. In the current year, the EIA predicts coal production to be 736 million short tons (MMst), down 5% year over year.Moreover, many are not in favor of repealing the CPP due to fears of environmental hazards among others. Furthermore, the process of repealing CPP is time-consuming. With uncertainty regarding CPP’S fate, a major overhang on railroad shares would remain until there is clarity on this key issue.Even if legislative and regulatory measures hindering the coal industry come into effect more vigorously, the commodity’s long-term competitive position has materially been weakened by the abundant and largely cheap natural gas supplies. In other words, railroads will benefit from  some incremental improvements in coal shipments, but the long-term trend is in the opposite direction.  Check out our latest Railroad Industry Outlook for more news on the current state of affairs in this market from an earnings perspective, and how the trend looks ahead for this important sector at the moment.

309,KSU,"Shares of Norfolk Southern Corporation (NSC  -  Free Report) have performed well so far in 2017. The stock has gained 22.4% on a year-to-date basis, outperforming its industry’s rally of 21.6%.  Additionally, shareholders of this railroad operator were in for another good news recently. In a bid to enhance its shareholders’ value, the company’s board of directors of approved a new share buyback program. The company is now authorized to buy back an additional 50 million shares through Dec 31, 2022.Notably, Norfolk Southern has been rewarding shareholders through buybacks since 2006. Following the new authorization, the total number of shares that may be bought back now stands at 225 million as opposed to 175 million earlier. In fact, the company has repurchased approximately 43 million shares for $3.8 billion between Aug 1, 2012 and Sep 25, 2017 with approximately 9 million shares remaining as of the latter date. Furthermore, the company’s shareholder friendly attitude can be discerned from the fact that while releasing its second-quarter results in July 2017, it had increased its full-year 2017 target pertaining to buybacks from $800 million to $1 billion. Earlier in 2017, the company raised its quarterly cash dividend by 3% to 61 cents per share (annualized $2.44 per share).Going forward, Norfolk Southern expects its bottom line to expand in double digits by 2020 (compound annual growth rate). Markedly, the company’s decision to approve a new buyback plan is in line with the objective. We note that share repurchases benefit a company’s earnings per share by lowering outstanding share count.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderNorfolk Southern carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Better-ranked stocks in the broader Transportation space are Kansas City Southern (KSU  -  Free Report), GOL Linhas Aéreas Inteligentes S.A.

310,KSU,"It is a well-documented fact that railroads have performed well so far in 2017, driven by multiple tailwinds. In fact, the revival in the coal-related scenario has aided stocks in this space immensely. This is because coal is a key revenue generating commodity for railroads. Notably, coal accounts for more than 15% of revenues for railroads in the United States. Also, President Trump’s support for fossil fuels compared with the renewable energy is an added positive for the commodity.In addition, a thriving and improving economy proves to be a boon for railroads as it implies that more goods are being transported across the United States via rail. Given the importance of this commodity for railroads, any positive coal-related development is expected to bode well for the sector. Markedly, the revival of coal can be made out from the impressive performances of most sector participants with respect to the commodity in the second quarter of 2017. For example, at Union Pacific Corp. (UNP  -  Free Report) coal revenues (freight) increased 25%, while the same at CSX Corp. (CSX  -  Free Report) and Norfolk Southern Corp. (NSC  -  Free Report) improved 27% and 32%, respectively. The improvement in intermodal volumes is also a positive for railroads. Moreover, Kansas City Southern (KSU  -  Free Report), which is a key player in the same space, raised its quarterly dividend to 36 cents per share (annualized $1.44 per share) representing an increase of 9.1% over the previous payout. The likes of Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd. (CP  -  Free Report) and Canadian National Railway (CNI  -  Free Report) have raised their quarterly dividend payout this year as well, thus highlighting the financial prosperity of railroads.Roadblocks to Watch Out for in Q3Given this backdrop, the scenario looks bright for railroads in the third quarter of 2017. Despite the positives, the recent disruptions particularly those caused by Harvey might limit growth. In this regard, Union Pacific expects Harvey to hurt its bottom line to the tune of approximately 5 cents per share.Furthermore, sluggishness pertaining to automotive volumes is an added concern for railroads in the to-be-reported quarter. With the automotive sector accounting for a significant chunk of their revenues, softness in automotive volumes are likely to hurt railroads significantly.What’s in Store in Q3?Despite the above-mentioned headwinds, we expect railroads to perform impressively in the third quarter on the bottom-line front. To counter the top-line woes, many railroads are looking to cut costs to drive their respective bottom lines. To this end, Union Pacific announced its decision to trim its workforce by up to 750 employees in August 2017, in a bid to increase efficiencies.Also, Norfolk Southern is looking to cut costs in order to drive its bottom line. The company anticipates improving coal volumes to boost its third-quarter results. While it is impossible to be sure about the exact nature of performance by railroads in the to-be-reported quarter, we expect stocks in this sector to perform impressively driven by the above-mentioned tailwinds despite the prevailing challenges. Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars? Here's another stock idea to consider.

311,KSU,"FedEx Corporation (FDX  -  Free Report) is set to report first-quarter fiscal 2018 results after the closing bell on Sep 19.Last quarter, FedEx — a leading player in the field of global express delivery services — posted a positive earnings surprise of 9.3%.The company’s earnings (on an adjusted basis) of $4.25 per share comfortably beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.89. The bottom line also expanded 28.8% on a year-over-year basis.Quarterly revenues climbed 21.2% year over year to $15,728 million, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $15,563.8 million. Results were aided by strong sales across all divisions at FedEx.Let’s see how things shape up for this announcement.Factors Likely at PlayHigh costs are likely to hurt the company’s results in the first quarter. Costs related to integration process of TNT express are expected to hamper the bottom line growth in the soon-to-be-reported quarter. In fact, FedEx mentioned that the TNT Express integration process will take three years more to reach full completion.Per the company’s claims, the cyber attack on Jun 28, which has disrupted operations at its TNT Express division, is anticipated to hit results in the quarter to-be-reported.In view of the rapid e-commerce growth, FedEx intends to spend heavily to ensure a record-breaking 2017 peak season. The company will also spend a significant amount on fleet modernization. This high capital expenditure further adds to the company’s woes and raises concerns for first-quarter results.However, the company’s efforts to reward shareholders through dividend payments and share buybacks are impressive. In June, the company hiked its quarterly dividend by 25% to 50 cents a share (or $2 annually) from 40 cents (or $1.60 annually). Shares of FedEx have been struggling of late. The stock has inched up a mere 1.9%, significantly underperforming the industry’s 5.1% gain in the last three months.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that FedEx is likely to beat estimates this quarter.

312,KSU,"You can simply arrive at a decision to Buy or Sell a particular stock by looking at its sales and earnings numbers. But such a strategy does not always guarantee superior returns. A critical analysis of the company’s financial background is always required for a better investment decision. A company’s fundamentals should be sound enough to meet its financial obligations. This can be judged with coverage ratios — the higher these are the more efficient an enterprise will be in meeting its financial obligations. Here we have discussed one such ratio — the Interest Coverage Ratio.Interest Coverage Ratio = Earnings before Interest & Taxes (EBIT) divided by Interest Expense.Why Interest Coverage Ratio?Interest Coverage Ratio is used to determine how effectively a company can pay the interest charged on its debt.Debt, which is crucial for most of the companies to finance operations, comes at a cost called interest. Interest expense has a direct bearing on the profitability of a company and the company’s creditworthiness depends on how effectively it meets its interest obligations. Therefore, Interest Coverage Ratio is one of the important criteria to factor in before making any investment decision.Interest Coverage Ratio suggests the number of times the interest could be paid from earnings and also gauges the margin of safety a firm carries for paying interest.An interest coverage ratio lower than 1.0 implies that the company is unable to fulfill its interest obligations and could default on repaying debt. A company that is capable of generating earnings well above its interest expense can withstand financial hardship. Definitely, one should also track the company’s past performance to determine whether the interest coverage ratio has improved or worsened over a period of time.What’s the Strategy?Apart from having an Interest Coverage Ratio that is more than the industry average, adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a VGM Score of A or B to your search criteria should lead to better results.Interest Coverage Ratio greater than X-Industry MedianPrice greater than or equal to 5: The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.5-Year Historical EPS Growth (%) greater than X-Industry Median: Stocks that have a strong EPS growth history.Projected EPS Growth (%) greater than X-Industry Median: This is the projected EPS growth over the next three to five years. This shows that the stock has near-term earnings growth potential.Average 20-Day Volume greater than 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.VGM Score of less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential. Here are five of the 16 stocks that qualified the screening:Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. (HII  -  Free Report), which is engaged in designing, building, overhauling, and repairing of ships, has a VGM Score of A and an expected EPS growth rate of 15% for 3-5 years.

313,KSU,"The U.S. equity market has been jittery of late as it has been engulfed by domestic as well as international issues. On the domestic front, investors seem to be getting increasingly anxious about President Trump’s capability to push through his pro-business agenda.Moreover, the havoc wreaked by tropical storm Harvey has also hit certain sectors severely like the airlines. In fact, increased volatility on the back of a significant increase in the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) indicate bearish market prospects.Apart from domestic events, issues like the escalating North Korea-Japan tension and the terror attacks in Spain also resulted in markets being subdued, of late.Given this backdrop, investing in companies that pay consistent dividends can make for wonderful investments. Such companies are financially stable and mature, and can even generate steady cash flow irrespective of market conditions.Railroads Riding High on Coal RevivalA sector that boasts well-paying stocks in terms of dividends, is the one having railroad stocks. Notably, railroads are witnessing good times currently after having struggled in the past few years. The most important catalyst behind the upsurge is the revival pertaining to coal, which is a key revenue generating commodity for the sector participants.The revival of coal can be made out from the impressive performances of most sector participants with respect to the commodity in the second quarter of 2017. For example, at Union Pacific Corporation (UNP  -  Free Report) coal revenues (freight) increased 25%, while the same at CSX Corporation (CSX  -  Free Report) and Norfolk Southern Corporation (NSC  -  Free Report) improved 27% and 32%, respectively.Meanwhile, the bullishness surrounding the railroad operators is evident from a 12.3% increase witnessed in the Dow Jones U.S. Railroads Index, year to date. Furthermore, Trump’s pro-coal stance is also a boon for the sector.Rebound in Intermodal Volumes – Another Positive Apart from the improvement on the coal front, intermodal volumes have also improved this year after a disappointing 2016. According to the Intermodal Association of North America (IANA), intermodal volumes improved 2% year over year in the first quarter of 2017.The scenario improved further in the second quarter with intermodal volumes rising 4.5%. In fact, this was the highest growth rate recorded in almost three years. The positive readings certainly support the air of optimism surrounding railroads.Solid Price PerformanceThe improved scenario regarding railroads can be out from the fact that Zacks Rail industry outperformed the broader market so far this year. While the S&P 500 Index gained 11.7%, the industry added 14%.Zacks Industry Rank Supports Favorable ScenarioThe Zacks Industry Rank of 18 (out of 250 plus groups) carried by the Zacks Rail industry further highlights the attractiveness of railroads. The favorable rank places the companies in the top 7% of the Zacks industries.We put our entire 250-plus industries into two groups: the top half (i.e., industries with the best average Zacks Rank) and the bottom half (the industries with the worst average Zacks Rank).Over the last 10 years, using a one week rebalance, the top half beat the bottom half by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Click here to know more: About Zacks Industry RankAttractive ValuationWhen valued according to the forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio for the current financial year (F1), the industry does not appear too expensive as it is trading at 18.7x P/E multiple. The reading appears favorable when compared with its own traded multiple (trading lower than the median of 18.9x) in the last 12 months as well as the S&P 500 (19.4x). The industry’s lower-than-market positioning calls for more upside.Railroads+ Dividends = Winning StrategyIn view of the tailwinds mentioned above, we believe that stocks from the railroad space should be present in one’s portfolio. Moreover, dealing with dividend stocks is a prudent strategy during uncertain times like the current scenario as highlighted above. Markedly, the best dividend stocks that pay out a healthy yield and have strong prospects are less susceptible to market downturns.Consequently, we have zeroed in on four stocks in this high flying space, which have a strong dividend paying history. Also, they have raised their dividend payouts in the past 12 months.Canadian National Railway Company (CNI  -  Free Report) is engaged in the rail and related transportation business.

314,KSU,"Canadian Pacific Railway Limited (CP  -  Free Report) is currently one of the leading companies of the railroad industry. Shares of the company have rallied 3.6% in the last six months compared with a mere 1% gain of the industry it belongs.  Catalysts Behind the UptickThe improvement in the coal scenario is very encouraging for railroads, and Canadian Pacific is no exception. In fact, in the second quarter of 2017, coal revenues and volumes improved substantially thereby boosting results. The uptick was owing to an increase in revenues and earnings per share on a year-over-year basis. The grain and potash franchises also performed impressively in the quarter.Moreover, the company's efforts to control costs are impressive. In the most recently reported quarter, operating ratio (operating expenses as a percentage of revenues on an adjusted basis) improved 330 basis points to 58.7%.In fact, we are also impressed with the company’s efforts to reward investors through share buybacks and dividend payments. Over the last couple of years, the company has increased its annual dividend by over 20%. In May 2017, the company raised its quarterly dividend per share by 12.5% to C$0.5625 per share.Estimate Revisions & Other MetricsUpward estimate revisions reflect optimism in a stock’s prospects. Canadian Pacific scores impressively on this front as well, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings climbed 4.34%, over the last 60 days. For full-year 2017, the same moved up 5% in the considerable period.Furthermore, the stock has attractive projected earnings per share growth rate of 11. 6%  (for three to five years), which compares favorably to its industry’s reading of 10.6%.Canadian Pacific's trailing 12-month return on equity (ROE) supports its growth potential too. Not only has the company’s ROE of 33.1% displayed an upward trend in the last year, it compares favorably with ROE of 20.8% for the industry it belongs to. This is reflective of the fact that it is efficient in using shareholders’ funds.Also, the company’s Value Score of B highlights its attractiveness to value-oriented investors right now.Value investing offers an opportunity to enter the market and grab stocks that have otherwise been overlooked by a majority of investors, and are thus trading at cheap multiples. Going by the price to earnings ratio (F1), the stock doesn’t look expensive at this point.  The measure for the stock is 16.9, which is favorable compared with the S&P 500's 19.3. In fact, the stock’s favorable positioning compared to the overall market certainly signals more upside.Canadian Pacific's Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) when combined with its attractive Value Score makes it a favorable investing option.

315,KSU,"After being laid low by declining coal shipments for the last few years, stocks in the railroad space performed well over the past year. The outlook for coal shipments has notably improved, given the favorable regulatory backdrop under the current administration.The improvement can be made out from the impressive performances of most sector participants with respect to this key revenue-generating commodity in the final quarter of 2017. For example, at Norfolk Southern Corp. (NSC  -  Free Report) coal revenues (freight) increased 5.7%, while the same at CSX Corp. (CSX  -  Free Report) rose 4% year over year. At Kansas City Southern (KSU  -  Free Report), revenues improved 115% at the energy segment on the back of impressive performances at Frac Sand and Crude Oil units.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Railroads are expected to perform well in the first quarter of 2018 as well with coal continuing to show improvements. In fact, under the Trump administration, the coal industry is seeing better days. In a bid to revive the industry, the President has made it clear that he intends to relax regulations that were detrimental to its prospects.Rising natural gas prices also bode well as far as demand for coal is concerned. Since revenues from coal account for a significant portion of railroads’ top line, any positive development toward the commodity augurs well for the sector.Intermodal Strength Augurs WellThe intermodal unit is another key source of revenues for railroads. In the fourth quarter of 2017, the intermodal unit performed reasonably well for the key railroads. For example at Union Pacific Corporation (UNP  -  Free Report), freight revenues from the segment increased 4% year over year. At Norfolk Southern, intermodal revenues rose 14.5% year over year. At Canadian Pacific Railway Company (CP  -  Free Report), intermodal revenues increased 7%.In fact, intermodal volumes increased significantly in 2017 after a lackluster 2016. According to the Intermodal Association of North America (IANA), intermodal volumes improved 5.8% year over year in the final quarter of 2017. Growth on the international front contributed to the impressive performance of this key segment in 2017.In fact, according to many market watchers, the segment is expected to perform strongly in the current year as well driven by a significant rise in international business.New Tax Law a Huge PositiveOn Dec 22, 2017, Trump signed the much-anticipated tax bill into law (Tax Cuts and Jobs Act). Under the $1.5 trillion tax overhaul package, corporate tax rates have been slashed significantly. The significant reduction in corporate tax rate is likely to boost cash flow, which in turn will aid earnings of transportation stocks.Apart from the significant drop in corporate tax rate, the new law allows these companies to deduct their capital expenditures from taxable income in the year of their occurrence, which was not allowed earlier. This aspect hugely favors railroads as they invest substantially in capital expenditures.As a result, their annual tax bills would be lowered significantly due to higher deductions. For example, Norfolk Southern expects the effective tax rate to come down to around 24% from 35.4% recorded in 2017.Uptick in Shareholder-Friendly Activities LikelyThe likes of Union Pacific, Norfolk Southern and Canadian National Railway Company (CNI  -  Free Report) have already announced dividend hikes this year. A further increase in shareholder-friendly activities (dividends as well as buybacks) is likely in the wake of the massive savings prompted by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.Due to the significant reduction in their tax bills, more cash is expected to remain in the hands of these companies to fund their capital expenditures, acquisitions and share repurchases among others.Improvement in Operating Ratio Another PositiveOperating ratio (defined as operating expenses as a percentage of revenues) is an important metric to gauge the performance of railroads. The lesser the value of operating ratio the better, as it implies that more cash is available to the company to reward shareholders through hike in dividends or share buybacks.In fact, many key railroads witnessed improvement with respect to the metric in the final quarter of 2017. At Norfolk Southern, the metric improved 150 basis points last year on a year-over-year basis. Norfolk Southern aims to achieve an operating ratio of below 65% by 2020 or even earlier. Annual productivity savings in excess of $650 million are expected by 2020.Further, efforts of railroads to drive bottom-line growth through cost-cutting measures raise optimism in stocks from this space. Moreover, the significant investments made by railroads to promote safety and enhance productivity are also encouraging.To ConcludeWe expect railroads to perform well going forward on the back of these positives. Moreover, a strong U.S. economy supports the bullish case for railroads, as it implies that more goods are being transported across the country.We believe that in light of factors like better coal and intermodal volumes, Trump’s pro-coal stance and industrial growth, investors should look at stocks in the space with renewed interest.Check out our latest Railroad Industry Outlook for more news on the current state of affairs in this market from an earnings perspective, and how the trend looks ahead for this important sector at the moment.Wall Street’s Next Amazon Zacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

316,KSU,"Stocks in the railroad space are being aided by momentum in the U.S. economy, with more goods being transported across the country.The market is expected to continue its winning streak, banking on a rise in wages and more confident consumers. Moreover, the new tax law (Tax Cuts and Jobs Act) should boost profits further and drive stock prices of the participants of this key sector higher.The robust financial health of railroads is reflective of the improved scenario for its players. The rebound has been aided by the much-improved scenario pertaining to the intermodal unit, a key revenue generating sector for railroads.The sector has bounced back after a disappointing 2016. Intermodal revenues are likely to grow this year as well. In fact, intermodal shipments are expected to expand 4.2% in 2018, strengthening the top line for railroads in turn. Improvement pertaining to another key metric — operating ratio (operating expenses as a percentage of revenues) — is another positive for railroads.In view of the above tailwinds, the fourth-quarter earnings season had been a good one for railroad stocks. Notwithstanding a few headwinds including some lingering impacts of devastating hurricanes, railroad companies continued the earnings momentum in the December quarter. We note that a number of companies in the space — including prominent names such as Norfolk Southern Corp. (NSC  -  Free Report), CSX Corp. (CSX  -  Free Report), Kansas City Southern (KSU  -  Free Report) and Genesee & Wyoming, Inc. (GWR  -  Free Report) — delivered an earnings beat in the quarter.Volume Growth Likely to Drive Railroads in Q1The stocks are likely to perform impressively in the first quarter of 2018 driven by volume growth. For example, the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) railroad — Union Pacific Corp. (UNP  -  Free Report) — expects volume growth in the soon-to-be-reported quarter to increase in the low single-digit range. Strong performance at the intermodal unit is expected to aid results. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Efforts of railroads to check costs should boost their bottom lines further. For example, at the 2018 Investor Conference held in March, CSX stated that its transition to precision scheduled railroading is progressing well. The new model will lead to top-line growth on the back of volume and pricing gains from the merchandise and intermodal segments. Moreover, scheduled railroading is anticipated to provide greater agility to the coal markets. This, in turn, will drive growth.Railroads should continue to see operating ratio-related improvements in the first quarter of 2018. The lesser the value of operating ratio the better, as it implies that more cash is available to the company to reward shareholders through dividends/buybacks.In fact, the transportation sector, which includes railroads, is expected to see double-digit year-over-year earnings growth in the first quarter. For more details about the earnings of this sector and others, please read our Earnings Trends report.Zacks Industry Rank Highlights HeadwindsDespite the above-mentioned tailwinds, the Zacks Industry Rank # 247 (of 250 plus groups) carried by the Zacks Rail Industry highlights that the industry is not bereft of headwinds. This unfavorable rank places the companies within the bottom 4% slot of the Zacks industries.We classify our entire 250-plus industries into two groups: the top half (i.e. industries with the best average Zacks Rank) and the bottom half (industries with the worst average Zacks Rank).Using a week’s rebalance, the top half beat the bottom half by a factor of more than 2 to 1 over the last decade.Click here to know more: About Zacks Industry RankThe ConcernsIt is a well-documented fact that the fortunes of railroads are tied to coal, since the latter is an important revenue-generating commodity for the sector. Despite President Trump’s pro-coal attitude, the coal industry is not yet out of the woods. In fact, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (“EIA”), coal production is expected to be 736 million short tons (MMst), down 5% year over year.The primary reasons for this are a drop in U.S. coal exports and a decline in usage of coal in electricity generation in the United States. The struggles related to coal are likely to hurt railroads in the first quarter. For example, Norfolk Southern stated at the J.P. Morgan Aviation, Transportation and Industrials conference that coal volumes had declined 6% as of Mar 10. Naturally, any negative development for the commodity does not bode well for railroad operators.Declining automotive volumes due to sluggish vehicle production in the United States, have been hurting railroads for the past few quarters and the story is unlikely to be different in the first quarter. Union Pacific on its fourth-quarter conference call said that light vehicle sales for full-year 2018 are projected at 16.9 million units, reflecting a 2% decline from the 2017 levels.Moreover, service issues represent a major headwind for the sector and may hurt its customer base unless resolved quickly. CSX was badly hurt by such issues last year. Canadian railroad operator — Canadian National Railway Co. (CNI  -  Free Report) — is the latest victim of operational problems, which are likely to hurt its first-quarter results.Moreover, uncertainty regarding the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) represents a major overhang on shares of railroads, particularly those like Kansas City Southern, which generate a significant portion of revenues from U.S.-Mexico shipments. Other factors, like the weather-related disruptions — like the ones last year which resulted in freight costs skyrocketing — and the dispute regarding the proposals concerning reciprocal switching, are further challenges for railroads.Valuation PictureThe Zacks Rail industry is up 17.1% over the past year, modestly outperforming the S&P 500 index’s 15.5% gain in the same time period. The industry has struggled since January 9th, likely reflecting the NAFTA uncertainty.The industry’s valuation picture remains attractive, with multiples becoming a lot more reasonable following the recent sell off. The Zacks Rail industry currently trades 16.4X forward 12-month consensus EPS estimates, which is down from 19.4X back in December 2017. This compares to the current forward 12-month P/E multiple of 17X for the S&P 500 index.Over the last 5 years, the industry has traded as high as 19.4X forward 12-month consensus estimates and as low as 13.4X, with a 5-year median of 16.4X. In other words, the industry is trading at the same level as the 5-year median. Wall Street’s Next Amazon Zacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

317,KSU,"Shares of Kansas City Southern (KSU  -  Free Report) have underperformed the industry it belongs to in the last six months on multiple headwinds. The stock has gained 2.6% compared with the industry’s 4.8% rise. The company has been plagued by high costs for quite some time. Continuing from the previous quarter, high operating expenses are likely to hurt the company's bottom line in the first quarter of 2018 as well. Last quarter, the metric increased 9%, mainly due to rise in fuel costs, which grew 20.5%.Declining volumes at the Agriculture & Minerals unit might further hamper results in the first quarter. We remind investors that volumes at this sector contracted 9% in fourth-quarter 2017 on weaknesses in grain and food products.The uncertainty over the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) negotiations is a major overhang on the stock. This is because the railroad operator draws a significant portion of its revenues from U.S.-Mexico shipments.Kansas City Southern's trailing 12-month return on equity (ROE) undercuts its growth potential. Not only has the company’s ROE of 12.1% gradually decreased over the past year, it also compares unfavorably with the ROE of 20.4% for its industry and 16% for the S&P 500 Index.The negativity revolving around the stock is evident from the Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter earnings being revised 1.4% downward in the last 60 days.The company’s Momentum Score of F further highlights its short-term unattractiveness.The stock carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Going by the Zacks proven model, the Sell-rated stocks (4 or 5) are likely to underperform the broader market over the next one to three months.In light of these downsides, it is advisable for investors to discard the stock from their portfolio for now.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader Transportation sector are Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings (AAWW  -  Free Report), International Consolidated Airlines Group SA (ICAGY  -  Free Report) and Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd. (CPCAY  -  Free Report). While Atlas Air Worldwide and International Consolidated Airlines sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Cathay Pacific Airways carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

318,KSU,"Freight railroad is vital for domestic freight as it accounts for around 40% of the U.S. transport sector. A strong U.S. economy supports the bullishness of freight railroad operators, as it implies that more goods are being transported across the country.The robust financial health of railroads bears testimony to the fact that the scenario has improved considerably for players in this industry, after having been battered by coal-related headwinds over the last few years. This indicates that freight railroad stocks will provide good return in the long-term.Coal Price, Intermodal Volume Improvement Boosts RailwaysThe turnaround of this key industry can be attributed to an improvement in the coal-related scenario. This is because coal is considered as a key revenue-generating commodity for railroads.On Feb 16, U.S. Energy Information Association (“EIA”) estimated that U.S. coal production for 2017 will amount to 773 million short tons (MMst), This figure is 45 MMst higher than 2016 as well as the largest year-over-year tonnage increase since 2001. The agency also stated that the coal prices across the United States rose in 2017, especially for Central Appalachian coal.Moreover, prospects of the coal industry have brightened because of President Trump’s pro-coal stance, wherein he promised to relax emissions rules. Higher price of natural gas and improvement of coal prices in global market have also given a boost to the demand for this key commodity. As the fortunes of most railroad operators depend on coal, any positive development related to this commodity augurs well for railroads.Improvement in intermodal volumes is also a positive for railroads. Trump’s proposed policy changes have made the overall economic outlook fairly bullish. The two pro-growth policies of Trump, namely, significant cut in corporate tax and deregulation are major catalysts to the U.S. economy.  Further, efforts of railroads to drive bottom-line growth through cost-cutting measures raise optimism in stocks from this space.Robust AAR DataThe Association of American Railroads (“AAR”), the industry body of the class 1 freight railroad operators, reported that U.S. rail traffic (including carloads and intermodal units) stood at 534,282 for the week ended Mar 10, 2018. This reflects an increase of 1.6% year over year. Six of the 10 carload commodity groups posted an increase compared with the same week in 2017. Total combined U.S. rail traffic (including carloads and intermodal units) for the first 10 weeks of 2018 was 5,193,970, up 2% year over year.Railroads should continue to witness an improvement pertaining to another key metric - operating ratio (operating expenses as a percentage of revenues) in 2018. The lesser the value of operating ratio, the better, as it implies that more cash is available to the company to reward shareholders through hike in dividends or share buybacks.Over a year, the Zacks Rail Industry increased 17.5%. In comparison, stock price of five major railroad operators, Union Pacific Corp. (UNP  -  Free Report), Kansas City Southern (KSU  -  Free Report), Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd. (CP  -  Free Report), CSX Corp. (CSX  -  Free Report)  and Norfolk Southern Corp. (NSC  -  Free Report), rallied 29.1%, 21.5%, 19.9%, 18.4% and 17.2%, respectively.

319,KSU,"Stocks in the railroad industry performed well in 2017 after struggling to find stability for the past couple of years. Factors including increased coal and intermodal revenues have led to this improved scenario.Impressive Q4Most sector participants dished out an impressive performance in the fourth quarter of 2017 on the back of strong volume growth. In fact, key players namely Union Pacific Corp. (UNP  -  Free Report), Norfolk Southern Corp. (NSC  -  Free Report) and Kansas City Southern (KSU  -  Free Report) have reported substantial year-over-year improvement in earnings as well as revenues. Norfolk Southern has reported better-than-expected earnings per share and revenues in the fourth quarter of 2017. This Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company’s bottom line rose 19% on a year-over-year basis while the top line improved 7% year over year.At Union Pacific, earnings per share and revenues increased 10.1% and 5.5%, respectively, year over year. Whereas at Kansas City Southern, both metrics grew 23.2% and 10.3%, respectively. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Price PerformanceThe buoyant performance of railroad stocks in 2017 is well-reflected by its price performance. It surged 30.4%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 Index’s 19.6% rally. We expect the sector to continue performing well in the current year. The factors contributing to this positive scenario are as follows:Coal and Intermodal RevenuesCoal is considered a key revenue-generating commodity for railroads. With Trump’s presidency, the coal industry is seeing better days. In a bid to revive the industry, the president intends to relax regulations that were hurting its prospects.Rising natural gas prices are also favorable to boosting demand for coal. Moreover, per the U.S. Energy Information Administration, coal production in the country is likely to increase by 2018. Since revenues from coal significantly drive the railroads’ top line, any positive development for the commodity augurs well for the sector.Coal aside, the intermodal space is a key revenue source for railroads, which improved by leaps and bounds in 2017. Per the Intermodal Association of North America, intermodal volumes registered the highest growth rate during the third quarter of 2017. In fact, intermodal shipments are expected to expand 4.2% in 2018, strengthening the top line for railroads in turn.Improved U.S. EconomyRecovery of U.S. economy is also anticipated to pave way for the railroads’ progress. Notably, U.S. GDP is expected to climb 2.4% in 2018, higher than the level achieved in the past couple of years. Generally, a buoyant domestic economy results in an uptick in rail shipments of goods across the United States.Per the Commerce Department’s latest report, the inland economy appreciated at a 3% decent annual rate implying a better economic scenario. Moreover, this reading was above the consensus estimate of 2.6%.The New Tax LawTrump’s proposed policy changes have made the overall economic outlook fairly bullish. The two pro-growth presidential agendas such as a vital corporate tax cut and deregulation are major catalysts to the U.S. economy. Given the capital-intensive nature of railroads, this policy seems a huge vantage point for the sector. Under the current legislation, corporate taxes have been reduced to 21% from the previous 35%. Also by dint of the revised law, companies will be able to immediately subtract capital expenditures from the taxable income in the year of their occurrence. As a result, their annual tax bills would be lowered significantly due to higher deductions. This in fact leaves more cash in hand for these companies to fund capital expenditures, acquisitions and share repurchases among others.Moreover, the amended tax law has prompted several companies to hike their quarterly dividend payouts. Companies like Canadian National Railway Co. (CNI  -  Free Report), CSX Corp. (CSX  -  Free Report) and Union Pacific Corp. have raised dividends earlier this year, indicating financial prosperity. Further, we expect this new law to enhance these shareholder-friendly activities.Zacks Industry Rank Highlights the Bright PictureThe Zacks Industry Rank of 64 (of 250 plus groups) carried by the Zacks Rail Industry also emphasizes the optimistic sentiment revolving around railroad stocks. This favorable rank places the companies within the top 25% slot of the Zacks industries.We classify our entire 250-plus industries into two groups: the top half (i.e. industries with the best average Zacks Rank) and the bottom half (industries with the worst average Zacks Rank).Using a week’s rebalance, the top half beat the bottom half by a factor of more than 2 to 1 over the last decade.Click here to know more: About Zacks Industry RankDon’t Even Think About Buying Bitcoin Until You Read ThisThe most popular cryptocurrency skyrocketed last year, giving some investors the chance to bank 20X returns or even more.

320,KSU,"Shares of Norfolk Southern Corporation (NSC  -  Free Report) have gained 13.8% in the past six months, outperforming the Zacks Rail industry’s rally of 10.2%. Let’s take a look into the factors responsible for the impressive price performance and see if the company can add new feathers in its cap.In January 2018, Norfolk Southern reported better-than-expected earnings per share and revenues for the fourth quarter of 2017. The metrics also improved on a year-over-year basis. Results were aided by volume growth owing to impressive performances at the key segments like coal, merchandise and intermodal.Moreover, the company’s efforts to cut costs in order to drive its bottom line are impressive. Improvement in operating ratio (operating expenses as a percentage of revenues) is a positive as well. The metric has improved 150 basis points in 2017 on a year-over-year basis. Norfolk Southern aims to achieve an operating ratio of below 65% by 2020 or even earlier. Annual productivity savings in excess of $650 million are expected by 2020.Additionally, the company’s focus on rewarding shareholders through share repurchases and dividends are encouraging. In keeping with the objective of rewarding shareholders, the company announced an 18% increase in its quarterly cash dividend to 72 cents per share (annualized $2.88 per share) in January. In fact, it has shelled out $703 million in dividends and repurchased shares worth $1 billion in 2017.Apart from Norfolk Southern, fellow railroad operators like Union Pacific Corporation (UNP  -  Free Report) and Canadian National Railway (CNI  -  Free Report) have raised dividend payouts recently. Last year, Kansas City Southern (KSU  -  Free Report) had hiked its quarterly dividend as well.Furthermore, the new tax law (Tax Cuts and Jobs Act), which reduces corporate tax rate significantly, proved conducive for the company. Norfolk Southern expects effective tax rate to come down to around 24% from 35.4% recorded in 2017. The resultant savings is anticipated to increase the shareholder-friendly activities. Moving ahead, the company envisions intermodal and merchandise networks to drive growth.Estimate Revisions & Zacks RankUpward estimate revisions reflect optimism about a stock’s prospects. Norfolk Southern scores impressively on this front too. In fact, this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-quarter and yearly earnings being revised 13.5% and 16.3% upward, respectively, in the last 60 days.

321,KSU,"In a bid to revive its sagging fortunes, railroad operator Canadian National Railway Company (CNI  -  Free Report) announced a change at its helm. Per the company, Jean-Jacques Ruest  has replaced Luc Jobin as the chief executive officer (CEO)  effective immediately. Notably, Jobin served as the company's CEO since July 2016.Ruest has also been appointed as the president of the company. Prior to this latest announcement, Ruest served the company as its executive vice-president and chief marketing officer for eight years. In fact, he has been associated with Canadian National for 22 years now. A search for a permanent CEO at Canadian National is underway. What Prompted the Change?Of late, Canadian National has been struggling due to various headwinds. This is quite evident from its lackluster price performance. In the past six months, the stock has lost 8.2% of its value against the industry’s gain of 8.9%.This Montreal, Canada-based company has been facing a number of challenges related to network congestion recently, which have hurt its operational performances. Unless resolved quickly, these operational issues might adversely impact its customer base, thus affecting company’s growth prospects. Increasing costs and the company’s high debt levels raise further concerns.In fact, the above issues are well-reflected in Canadian National’s lower-than-expected earnings per share in the last two quarters. In February 2018, oilfield service major, Halliburton Company (HAL  -  Free Report), stated that Canadian National’s service delays were also hurting the bottom line.Given the plethora of issues facing Canadian National, it is not at all surprising that the company has decided to make a change at its helm. However, only time will tell whether the CEO replacement revitalizes the company and yields the desired results.Guidance For 2018 Retained Canadian National still expects adjusted earnings per share for the current year between C$5.25 and C$5.40. Moreover, the company, which focuses on improving safety and efficiency, intends to spend C$3.2 billion under its capital program in 2018.Zacks Rank & Key PicksCanadian National carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

322,KSU,"On Aug 24, Kansas City Southern (KSU  -  Free Report) was upgraded to a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) from a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Reasons for the UpswingKansas City Southern has been thriving of late on multiple tailwinds. Shares of the company have gained 8.8%, significantly outperforming the industry’s 3.4% decline, in the last three months.  The company’s efforts to reward shareholders through dividend payments and buybacks are impressive. To realize this initiative, the board of directors has approved of a new share repurchase program worth $800 million in August. The share repurchase plan replaces the company’s previously announced $500 million program in 2015, completed in the second quarter of 2017. The authorization also includes a $200 million Accelerated Share Repurchase program.Simultaneously, the company increased the quarterly dividend in excess of 9%. Additionally, the directors also announced a regular dividend of 25 cents per share on 4% of Kansas City Southern’s outstanding non-cumulative preferred stock. The company performed laudably in the second quarter, reporting better-than-expected earnings per share and revenues. Both metrics also improved on a year-over-year basis. The results were aided by a 6% rise in overall carload volumes.In the reported quarter, operating income increased 9% to $239 million. This significant expansion in utility coal volumes boosted the Energy segment’s results, a chief growth driver behind the stock’s outperformance. Apart from the energy segment, revenues at the company’s chemical & petroleum segment along with automotive unit and agriculture & minerals segments improved on a year-over-year basis in the second quarter of 2017.The above positives substantiate Kansas City Southern’s Zacks Rank #2.Seems the time is ripe for investors to add this stock to their portfolio.

323,KSU,"Stocks in the railroad space have performed impressively so far this year buoyed by the improvement in the coal-related scenario. Since coal is a key revenue generating commodity for stocks in this space, any positive coal-related update is bound to lift their spirits.In fact, improvement on the coal front is highly significant for railroads as stocks in the space had struggled over the last few years due to dwindling coal shipments. The bullishness surrounding the railroad operators is evident from a 11.3% increase witnessed in the Dow Jones U.S. Railroads Index, year to date.Coal Revival - The Primary Catalyst Behind the SurgeThe revival of coal can be made out from the impressive performances of most sector participants with respect to the commodity in the second quarter of 2017. For example, at Union Pacific Corporation (UNP  -  Free Report) coal revenues (freight) increased 25% while the same at CSX Corporation (CSX  -  Free Report) and Norfolk Southern Corporation (NSC  -  Free Report) improved 27% and 32%, respectively.Currently, all these three stocks carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.In fact, the election of President Trump last year has been a boon for this industry. Notably, Trump’s pro-coal stance is a huge positive for the commodity which lost much of its relevance during President Obama’s tenure as a source of fuel.Trump has been advocating the case for fossil fuels instead of renewable energy, and has raised questions regarding climate change and its expected widespread impact. Already, he has started to act on his pre-election promises and has also taken measures to repeal the Clean Power Plan. He walked out of the Paris Climate Agreement as well.A thriving and improving economy also supports the bullish case for railroads as it implies that more goods are being transported across the United States on the rails. This improvement under the new regime is evident from the fact that the Zacks Rail industry outperformed the broader market so far this year. While the S&P 500 Index gained 11%, the industry added 12.8%.Based on this healthy picture, we expect a surge in the usage of coal during the Trump regime. Additionally, coal volumes will be positively impacted in the event of higher industrial production.Intermodal Shows PromiseApart from the bullish coal-related scenario and industrial growth, improvement in intermodal volumes and pricing are also expected to boost stocks in the railroad space. In fact, things  have turned around for the better in the current year, which is a positive for the sector as intermodal continues to generate significant revenues for major U.S. railroad companies.According to the Intermodal Association of North America, intermodal volumes improved 2% year over year in the first quarter of 2017. The scenario improved further in the second quarter with the measure rising 4.5%. In fact, this was the highest growth rate recorded in almost three years.Financial StrengthWe note that the strong balance sheets of major railroads have enabled them to engage in shareholder-friendly activities. In keeping with this trend, Kansas City Southern (KSU  -  Free Report) recently announced a 9.1% hike in its quarterly dividend payout to 36 cents per share. Moreover, the company announced fresh buyback plans.Additionally, the likes of Canadian National Railway (CNI  -  Free Report), Canadian Pacific Railway (CP  -  Free Report) and CSX Corp. have hiked their respective dividend payouts this year. In another shareholder friendly move, Norfolk Southern recently increased its full-year 2017 target pertaining to buybacks from $800 million to $1 billion.In fact, the significant investments made by railroads to promote safety also raise optimism and indicate toward their financial well being.Going forward, railroads are also looking to drive bottom-line growth through various cost cutting measures. To improve efficiencies, Union Pacific recently announced that it intends to trim its workforce by up to 750 employees.Zacks Industry Rank Supports Bullish ScenarioThe Zacks Industry Rank of 17 (out of 250 plus groups) carried by the Zacks Rail industry further highlights the attractiveness of railroads as an investing option on the back of the tailwinds mentioned above. Markedly, the favorable rank places the companies in the top 7% of the Zacks industries.We put our entire 250-plus industries into two groups: the top half (i.e., industries with the best average Zacks Rank) and the bottom half (the industries with the worst average Zacks Rank).Over the last 10 years, using a one-week rebalance, the top half beat the bottom half by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Click here to know more: About Zacks Industry RankRailroads Should Grace Your PortfolioGiven the bullish sentiment surrounding railroads, we believe that it will be prudent for investors to add stocks from the space to their respective portfolios to generate handsome returns.However, given the vastness of the railroad space, it is by no means an easy task to identify the few bright spots.

333,KSU,"Shares of Union Pacific Corporation (UNP  -  Free Report) have gained 15.2% in the last three months, outperforming the Zacks Rail industry’s rally of 8.8%. Reasons Behind the OutperformanceLast month, Union Pacific reported better-than-expected revenues in the fourth quarter of 2017. Also, earnings per share as well as revenues increased on a year-over-year basis. Higher freight revenues on the back of volume growth contributed to the uptick. In first-quarter and full-year 2018, the company expects volumes to increase in the low single-digit range.Additionally, Union Pacific’s efforts to control costs are impressive. Driven by improved efficiencies, the company has been able to reduce its operating ratio (operating expenses as a percentage of revenues) from the highs of nearly 90% in 2004 to below 65% currently. By 2019, it expects operating ratio to come in at around 60% (on an annual basis). Per the company, the metric might decline further to around 55%, after 2019. The company’s efforts to reward investors through share buybacks and dividend payouts are encouraging too. Evidently, Union Pacific returned around $6 billion to its stockholders through dividends and buybacks in 2017. Of the $6 billion, approximately $4 billion were returned through share buybacks. Additionally, the company raised its quarterly dividend by 10% to 73 cents per share (annualized $2.92 per share) in February 2018.The first instalment of the raised dividend will be paid on Mar 30, 2018 to shareholders as of Feb 28. In fact, this is the company’s second dividend hike in three months. In November 2017, the company had announced a 10% hike in its quarterly dividend payout to 66.5 cents per share. We believe that two dividend hikes in three months reflect its increased financial prosperity, following the introduction of the new tax law. The effective tax rate is expected to fall to 25% in 2018.Union Pacific is not the only railroad operator to have increased its dividend payout. Fellow railroad operators like Norfolk Southern Corporation (NSC  -  Free Report) and Canadian National Railway (CNI  -  Free Report) have also raised their dividend payouts recently. Last year, Kansas City Southern (KSU  -  Free Report) had hiked its quarterly dividend payout as well.Estimate Revisions & Zacks RankUpward estimate revisions reflect optimism in a stock’s prospects. Union Pacific scores impressively on this front too. In fact, this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-quarter and current-year earnings being revised 16.1% and 16.4% upward, respectively, over the last 60 days.

335,KSU,"The diversified transportation sector, which includes airline companies, railroads, truckers and shippers, to name a few, recovered in the last quarter of 2017 after struggling for most of the year. An improving U.S. economy, substantial surge in manufactured and retail goods, and a sharp rebound in a number of end markets are expected to fuel growth of the transportation sector. Of the various means of the U.S. transport, freight railroad is an integral one.  Railroads Prosper Due to Multiple TailwindsThe robust financial health of railroads bears testimony to the fact that the scenario has improved considerably for players in the sector, after being battered by coal-related headwinds for the last few years.In fact, the primary reason behind the turnaround in fortunes of this key industry can be attributed to an improvement in the coal-related scenario. This is because coal is considered a key revenue-generating commodity for railroads.Moreover, prospects of the coal industry have brightened because of President Donald Trump’s pro-coal stance, wherein he has promised to relax emissions rules. Higher price of natural gas and improvement of coal prices in global market have also given a boost to the demand for this key commodity. As the fortunes of most railroad operators depend on coal, any positive development related to this commodity augurs well for railroads.Improvement in intermodal volumes is also a positive for railroads. In fact, according to the Intermodal Association of North America, intermodal volumes registered the highest growth rate in the third quarter of 2017. Moreover, efforts of railroads to drive bottom-line growth through cost-cutting measures raise optimism in stocks from this space.Growth-Induced PolicesTrump’s proposed policy changes have made the overall economic outlook fairly bullish. The two pro-growth agendas of Trump, namely, significant cut in corporate tax and deregulation are major catalysts to the U.S. economy.  The proposal to reduce corporate taxes from the current 35% to 20% is likely to bring corporate tax rate at its historic low in 78 years.  A large part of transporters book much of their revenues in the homeland. Therefore, a significant reduction in corporate tax rate faced by transporters would be immediately accretive to cash flow. Moreover, the tax proposal offers to provide incentives to companies to repatriate accumulated profits from overseas with an even lower tax rate.Capital-Intensive Nature of Rail TransportationTransportation stocks, mainly railroads, invest significantly in capital expenditure as the industry is capital-intensive in nature. In the current scenario, capital expenditures cannot be tax-deducted in the year they are incurred. Consequently, U.S. rail operators need to plan judiciously regarding their capital expenditure. However, companies will be able to deduct their capital expenditures from the taxable income immediately, per the U.S. tax overhaul. Naturally, this aspect hugely favors freight rail transports.As and when the companies are able to reduce capital expenses in the year of their occurrence, their tax bills for the year would be lowered significantly due to higher deductions. This in fact will leave more cash in the hands of these companies to fund their capital expenditures, acquisitions and share repurchases among others.Effect on Transportation SectorA thriving and improving economy also supports the overall bullishness of the transport sector, as it implies that more goods are being transported across the United States. Improved global growth prospects and sustained business and consumer confidence have in turn helped the transport sector recover from the sluggishness in 2017 to quite an extent. Easily available credit also strengthens the situation.Momentum to ContinueIn fact, improvement in the prospects of key units like coal and intermodal has been benefiting railroads since the beginning of this year. The rise in natural gas prices will also boost demand for coal. Moreover, per the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), coal production in the United States will increase in 2018. Apart from coal, the scenario pertaining to another key source of revenues for transporters is intermodal, which has improved by leaps and bounds this year. In fact, intermodal shipments are expected to grow 4.2% in 2018.Stabilization of commodity prices has helped reignite investors faith in the transportation sector with the improvement in the economic conditions. Railroads should continue to witness an improvement pertaining to another key metric - operating ratio (operating expenses as a percentage of revenues) in 2018. The lesser the value of operating ratio, the better, as it implies that more cash is available to the company to reward shareholders through hike in dividends or share buybacks.Rail Transport Industry Carries Strong Zacks RankThe Rail Transportation industry is currently in a great position from the Zacks Industry Rank perspective. The industry is currently in the top 16% (41 out of 256) of the Zacks Categorized industries, suggesting that it is well-positioned.

336,KSU,"The picture that has been unfolding in the Q4 earnings season is a rosy one so far. According to the latest Earnings Preview, this positive scenario is anticipated to continue. In fact, the above report projects that companies in the prestigious S&P 500 space will end Q4 with an overall bottom-line growth of 11.4% year over year. Additionally, stocks in this highly sought-after fraternity are expected to end Q4 with their top line expanding 7.5%. Both these figures compare favorably with the readings in the previous quarter, when bottom line expanded 6.7% and revenues grew 5.9%.In fact, 14 of the 16 Zacks sectors are anticipated to end the reporting cycle with earnings growth, one being the widely-diversified Zacks Transportation sector. The bottom line for this sector is projected to increase 2.6% compared to the year-over-year decline of 13.9% in preceding quarter.Transports Bounce BackStocks in the transportation space seem to be back in favour, after being laid low for most of 2017 due to multiple headwinds like the back-to-back hurricanes. Also, the new tax law (Tax Cuts and Jobs Act) is a huge positive for the companies in this space. Notably, the $1.5 trillion tax overhaul package signed into law by President Trump on Dec 22, 2017, reduces corporate taxes from 35% to 21%.Buoyed by the new law, various sector participants like Southwest Airlines  and Kansas City Southern (KSU  -  Free Report) have declared bonuses for their employees. Apart from the huge drop in corporate tax rate, the fact that companies are now allowed to deduct their capital expenditures from taxable income immediately has proved to be favorable for transport stocks as they will be able to invest toward capital expenditures considerably.String of Outperformances in Q4In line with the optimism surrounding the sector, the key players like American Airlines (AAL  -  Free Report) and Norfolk Southern (NSC  -  Free Report) have reported better-than-expected results in Q4.Moreover, the likes of Norfolk Southern and Alaska Air Group have announced hikes in their respective quarterly dividend payouts. This signifies their financial prosperity and shareholder-friendly attitude.What Lies Ahead?Given this healthy backdrop, investors interested in the transportation space will keenly await Q4 reports from key sector participants like United Parcel Service (UPS  -  Free Report), Schneider National (SNDR  -  Free Report), SkyWest (SKYW  -  Free Report) and Heartland Express (HTLD  -  Free Report).According to our quantitative model, a company needs the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — to increase its odds of an earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.United Parcel Service is the world's largest express carrier and package delivery company. The company provides specialized transportation and logistics services in the United States and internationally.

Revenues from the company’s U.S. Domestic Package unit are also likely to benefit from increased package volumes on the back of e-commerce growth.In the to-be-reported quarter, we expect the company to report better-than-expected earnings per share. This is because it has an Earnings ESP of +0.10 and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

Incidentally, the buyback program was initially started in 2013 and following this additional repurchase, the company’s total authorization now stands at $12 billion. The company is expected to fund the repurchase through cash in hand, future cash flow from operations as well as future borrowings.The extension of the stock repurchase program is indicative of the company’s continued efforts to reward shareholders and increase their confidence in its long-term growth. Sirius XM has the requisite amount of capital to make long-term investments in its programming, research and development and overall operations besides pursuing strategic opportunities arising at any point of time.Moreover, the company announced a quarterly cash dividend of 1.1 cent per share, payable on Feb 28 to shareholders of record as of Feb 7.Investors always prefer an income-generating stock and a high dividend-yielding one is obviously much coveted.

While JetBlue’s board approved a new share repurchase of up to $750 million, United Continental announced a new $3-billion share buyback program.

339,KSU,"Benchmarks ended mixed on Tuesday despite better than expected retail data and a de-escalation in tensions with North Korea. Weaker than expected earnings from Home Depot weighed on the Dow and pared gains for the blue-chip index. However, the Dow ended in the green following gains from American Express and Apple. The S&P 500 ended in the red overall losses in the market because of the slump in the retail sector. The Nasdaq also ended in the negative territory due to broad based losses for the markets.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) closed at 21,998.99, advancing 5.28 points or less than 0.1%. The S&P 500 Index (INX) declined 1.23 points to close at 2,464.61. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite Index (IXIC) closed at 6,333.01, increasing 7.22 points or 0.1%. Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 1,799 to 946. On the Nasdaq, decliners outnumbered advancers by a 1,671 to 1,016.Retail Sales Notch Up a Seven Month HighSales at U.S. retailers recorded their biggest increase in seven months in July. Retail sales advanced 0.6% last month, the best performance since a gain of 0.9% last December, according to the Commerce Department. Retail sales jumped 4.2% in the past twelve months, which is near the five-year average. Excluding auto and gasoline, retail sales rose 0.5% in July. In fact, excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services, retail sales went up 0.6% last month. June’s retails sales were also revised to show a 0.3% gain, in contrast to the previously reported 0.2% decline. May’s retail sales were revised up to show no change instead of the earlier report of a 0.1% dip.The lion’s share of the spurt in July retail sales was attributable to a pickup in demand for autos and to what is now a national event, Amazon Prime Day. The annual event, during which consumers flock to Amazon.com (AMZN  -  Free Report) for the year’s best shopping deals, contributed to gains for every product category. The Department of Commerce’s report reflects this as a 1.3% monthly increase in what is categorized as non-store retail spending. But for the sudden spurt in auto sales, other notable movements in the consumer spending report also have crucial linkages with Amazon. For instance, the decline in sales at electronics stores is likely a result of most consumers opting to buy this category of products from online alternatives, possibly Amazon.Amazon Fells the Traditional Retail SectorWhile Amazon did end the day around 0.1% lower, investor attention was largely fixed on the fall in traditional retail stocks. Target Corporation (TGT  -  Free Report), Nordstrom, Inc. (JWN  -  Free Report), Kohl's Corporation KSS and Dollar General Corporation (DG  -  Free Report) declined 2.6%, 1.5%, 1.5% and 3.8%, respectively. Only Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report) ended the day unscathed, notching up a minor increase of 0.1%.The Dow closed higher for the third day on Tuesday. The blue-chip index notched 45 points earlier in the day. These gains were offset by weak earnings from the retail sector. The biggest drag on the Dow was falling shares of Home Depot (HD  -  Free Report). The home-improvement company cut about 30 points from the Dow. Such a turn of events makes it amply clear that the company is not immune to “Amazonification” despite its status as a leading specialty retailer. This is particularly surprising since Do-It-Yourself (DIY) and professional customers form Home Depot’s core audience. But the move to sell Kenmore devices via Amazon indicates that even the building products behemoth is now susceptible to the rising power of the Kindle and Fire Stick maker. (Read More: Home Depot (HD  -  Free Report) Beats on Q2 Earnings & Sales Estimates August 15, 2017)Telecom, Consumer Discretionary Stocks Drag S&P 500 LowerThe S&P 500 declined on Tuesday as the telecom and consumer-discretionary sectors disappointed. Five of the eleven primary sectors ended in the red, led by consumer discretionary. The Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR (XLY) was down 0.9%. Moreover, Advance Auto Parts Inc. (AAP  -  Free Report) reported a 16.8% decline in adjusted earnings to $1.58 per share in the second quarter of fiscal 2017 (ended Jul 15, 2017) from $1.90 earned in the prior-year quarter. The figure also missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.65. Adjusted net income declined to $117 million from $141 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2016.

342,KSU,"The transportation sector is riding high on second-quarter financial results, with total earnings from 97.8% of the sector’s total market capitalization that has reported so far are up 9.6% on revenue growth of 10%. Both revenue and earnings surprises of 76.9% also seem impressive.This is because most of the industry players dominating the sector managed to beat our estimates on earnings or revenues or both, while a few lagged (read: 3 ETFs Loaded with Positive ESP Stocks).For a better understanding, let’s dig into the earnings results of some well-known industry players:Transportation Earnings in FocusThe world's largest package delivery company – United Parcel Service (UPS  -  Free Report) – topped our estimates on both fronts. Earnings of $1.58 surpassed our earnings estimate by 12 cents while revenues of $15.75 billion edged past our estimated $15.48 billion. For the current fiscal 2017, the company continues to expect earnings per share in the range of $5.80–$6.10. The Zacks Consensus Estimate at the time of earnings release was pegged at $5.95.The major railroads – Union Pacific (UNP  -  Free Report)) and Kansas City Southern (KSU  -  Free Report) – beat on both the top and the bottom lines while Norfolk Southern Corp (NSC  -  Free Report) lagged on revenues. UNP and KSU surpassed our earnings estimate by 8 cents and 7 cents, respectively, and revenue estimates by $87 million and $33 million. On the other hand, earnings of $1.71 at NSC trumped the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 7 cents while revenues of $2.637 billion were marginally below our estimated $2.642 billion.Ryder Systems (R  -  Free Report), the leader in supply chain management and fleet management services, beat our earnings estimate by 7 cents and revenue estimate by $24 million (see: all the Industrials ETFs here).The two largest U.S. airlines – Delta Air Lines (DAL  -  Free Report) and United Continental (UAL  -  Free Report) – reported varied results. Earnings of $1.62 and revenues of $10.79 billion at Delta missed our estimates of $1.66 and $10.85 billion, respectively. At United Continental, earnings per share of $2.75 came above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.72 and revenues of $10 billion were ahead of our estimated $9.96 billion.Last but not the least, earnings for the leading trucking carrier – J.B. Hunt (JBHT  -  Free Report) – came in below the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4 cents and revenues were $6 million below our estimate.ETFs in FocusHowever, strong results failed to boost transport stocks as the sector saw 2.4% average decline (average price difference between a day before and after the earnings announcement of a stock) in response to earnings announcements. Given this, both transport ETFs, iShares Dow Jones Transportation Average Fund (IYT  -  Free Report) and SPDR S&P Transportation ETF (XTN  -  Free Report), saw rough trading over the past one month. IYT shed 3.7% while XTN was down 2.2%. Both funds have an unfavorable Zacks ETF Rank of 4 or ‘Sell’ rating with a High risk outlook.IYTThe fund tracks the Dow Jones Transportation Average Index, giving investors exposure to a small basket of 20 securities. The fund has a certain tilt toward large cap stocks at 55% while mid and small caps account for 28% and 18% share, respectively, in the basket. Though the product is heavily concentrated on the top firm – FedEx (FDX) – at 13.7%, the in-focus eight firms collectively make up for 46.7% of the portfolio.

350,KSU,"Another wild week on the Street ended with stocks slumping on word that the House had approved the $700 billion rescue plan. After trading up more than 250 points early in the session, the Dow collapsed under the weight of more bearish data, finally closing down 157 points to close at 10,325.
"
351,KSU,"The day began with news from the Labor Department, whose reading on US payrolls showed that the economy shed 159,000 jobs in September, the 9th consecutive month of contraction, totaling 760,000 jobs. Accordingly, unemployment figures continue to creep higher, with the unemployment rate advancing to 6.1% from 4.7% last year. 
"
352,KSU,"Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report) has taken the lead in the bid for Wachovia, swiping the deal away from Citigroup (C  -  Free Report) with a $15.1 billion agreement to buy the distressed bank. The announcement came as a surprise because Wachovia and Citigroup had reached a tentative deal that had been assisted by the government. 
"
353,KSU,"The biggest story of the day however was the passing of the $700 billion rescue plan by the House by a vote of 263 to 171. The bill was then shuffled over to President Bush, who quickly applied his seal of approval with a signature. The bill gives Hank Paulson, the Secretary of the Treasury, immediate authority to begin snapping up distressed assets from the balance sheets of beleaguered financial institutions, intended to unthaw the credit markets and catalyze lending.

385,KSU,"Q4 Headlines From Companies Of Diverse Industries
"
386,KSU,"The Q2 earnings season is in full swing with a deluge of companies reporting their financial numbers each day. The picture to have emerged so far is a rosy one with many companies reporting better-than-expected earnings per share. Moreover, the growth rate with respect to the bottom line is also a healthy one.In fact, this healthy picture is unlikely to fade, with our latest Earnings Trends report suggesting that stocks in the much sought-after S&P 500 Index will end the current reporting cycle with bottom-line expansion of 8.6%. The same set of companies is projected to witness top-line growth to the tune of 4.7%.Notably, 11 of the 16 Zacks sectors are expected to end Q2 in the green as far as bottom line expansion is concerned. One such sector is the highly diversified Transportation sector. The participants from this space are likely to end this quarter with the top and the bottom line expanding 9.6% and 6.9%, respectively. Both these figures compare favorably with the readings in Q1, when revenues grew 6.9% and earnings contracted 17.8%.Significantly, multiple tailwinds like an improved economy, a better job market scenario and better unit revenue trends have contributed to this bullish picture for the sector. Already, this space has seen strong Q2 earnings reports from key players like Union Pacific Corporation (UNP  -  Free Report), JetBlue Airways (JBLU  -  Free Report) and Kansas City Southern (KSU  -  Free Report) that have outperformed on both the fronts.Given this backdrop, investors interested in the Transportation sector eagerly await the Q2 earnings releases by major sector participants like Southwest Airlines (LUV  -  Free Report), United Parcel Service (UPS  -  Free Report), Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc. (ODFL  -  Free Report) and Spirit Airlines (SAVE  -  Free Report) on Jul 27.According to our quantitative model, a company needs the right combination of two key ingredients – a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better – to increase the odds of an earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Dallas-based, Southwest Airlines is a low-cost carrier, which have lesser chances of beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in this quarter despite its Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). This is because it has an Earnings ESP of -1.67% as the Most Accurate estimate of $1.18 per share is pegged at 2 cents below the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Our model did not predict an earnings beat earlier as well. When we issued its Q2 earnings preview article, the company carried a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) while the Earnings ESP remained the same.

389,KSU,"Ryder System, Inc. (R  -  Free Report), which operates one of North America’s largest truck fleets, is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 24, before the market opens.In the second quarter, the Florida-based company’s adjusted earnings of $1 per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 93 cents. Earnings, however, declined 36% on a year-over-year basis. Ryder has a mixed record with respect to earnings per share, having outshined the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the last four quarters.Factors Likely at Play in Q3Strong rental activity is likely to boost Ryder’s third-quarter results. The company's efforts to grow its lease fleet remain a positive. The continuous growth in ChoiceLease revenues is encouraging, which is driving growth at Ryder's primary division — Fleet Management Solutions.As bulk of the company’s revenues is derived from the Fleet Management Solutions division, impressive performance at this unit will boost the top line in the third quarter. In view of the improving rental activity, Ryder expects third-quarter adjusted earnings per share between $1.25 and $1.35, much higher than the figure reported in the second quarter.The company's strong customer base is also a positive. We believe Ryder's top line in the third quarter might benefit from a strong product portfolio.However, weakness pertaining to automotive production volumes is expected to hurt results at its Supply Chain Solutions unit. High costs also might affect segmental results. Results at the company’s Dedicated Transportation Solutions may be hurt owing to higher insurance premiums.What Does Our Model Say?Our proven model does not show conclusively that Ryder will beat earnings in third-quarter 2017. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. However, that is not the case as highlighted below.Zacks Rank: Ryder carries a Zacks Rank #2.Zacks ESP: The company’s Earnings ESP of -0.19%, however, acts as a spoiler. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.28 per share exceeds the Most Accurate estimate by a penny. The Zacks Rank combined with a negative Earnings ESP leaves the surprise prediction inconclusive. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Note that we caution against stocks with Zacks Ranks #4 or 5 (Sell-rated) going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Ryder System, Inc.

394,KSU,"To finish off this first busy week of Q2 earnings season — and with a lack of new economic headlines and/or tweets from the President this morning — perhaps we’re best served with a quick run-down of earnings reports ahead of today’s opening bell. We also look for an 11th straight day of gains on the Nasdaq, which would be the longest such stretch in 8 years.General Electric (GE  -  Free Report) posted beats on its Q2 top and bottom lines this morning, with 28 cents per share topping the Zacks consensus by 3 cents, and revenues of $29.56 billion surpassing the $29.13 billion expected. This marks the 4th earnings beat in the last 5 quarters for GE (that 5th quarter was a meet, not a miss), and the company has reiterated its fiscal 2017 guidance. GE also announced that incoming CEO John Flannery will be taking over for Jeff Immelt as of August 1st, and will secure the reins to the Chairmanship as of the first of the year.Zacks Rank #2 (Buy)-rated Honeywell (HON  -  Free Report) modestly beat estimates on the bottom line to $1.80 per share. $10.08 billion in quarterly sales also topped expectations. The New Jersey-based industrial major raised its fiscal 2017 guidance, and this Q2 earnings report also represents the 4th beat in the last 5 quarters (the 5th quarter was also a meet, not a miss).Oil & gas services major Schlumberger (SLB  -  Free Report) handily outperformed estimates on both top and bottom lines, with 35 cents a share beating the Zacks consensus by 5 cents and revenues of $7.46 billion surpassing the $7.26 billion expected. The company’s Drilling business was up 77% in the quarter, and its Production Group income rose 170% year over year.Fifth Third Bank (FITB  -  Free Report) put up mixed Q2 results this morning, topping estimates by 4 cents to 46 cents per share but with a miss on the top-line: $1.50 billion in revenues compared with the $1.53 billion expected. Higher net interest income and lower provisions for loan and lease losses — down 43% — were the quarterly highlights. Fifth Third has beaten earnings estimates in 3 of its last 4 quarters.Railroad major Kansas City Southern (KSU  -  Free Report) posted a strong Q2 before today’s opening bell, with earnings of $1.45 per share beating the Zacks consensus by 8 cents — +24% year over year — on quarterly sales of $5.25 billion that outpaced the estimate of $5.16 billion. Freight revenues grew 11% overall, with Operating Income up 21% to $2 billion. The company also bought back $850 million in KSU shares in the quarter.Posting a real blow-out quarter this morning is Encana (ECA  -  Free Report), the Calgary, Alberta, Canada-based natural gas E&P firm, which blew away expectations on both top and bottom lines. Its 18 cents per share more than quadrupled the 4 cents anticipated, on sales of $1.08 billion that easily topped the $773 million in the Zacks consensus. This revenue beat represents 197.5% growth year over year. Operating costs fell 16% since this time a year ago. We expect an upgrade to its current Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) based on this stellar quarterly performance.

Although the devil is in the details for IBM in the quarter just passed, we still see beats on the top and bottom lines and growth year over year.Another transportation firm, Kansas City Southern (KSU  -  Free Report), has this morning topped the Zacks consensus earnings estimate by 2 cents to $1.38 per share. The railway major narrowly missed the analyst consensus on quarterly revenues, however, to $660.4 million.

410,KSU,"Canadian National Railway Company (CNI  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Jan 23 after the market closes.Last quarter, the company delivered a negative earnings surprise of 0.9%. Moreover, revenues fell short of expectations. However, both earnings and revenues increased substantially year over year.Let’s see, how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors at PlayHigh fuel costs might hurt the company's performance in the to-be-reported quarter just as the previous one. Moreover, the metric is anticipated to affect its operating ratio in the period.Also, declining revenues at the Forest Products plus Grain and Fertilizers segments might hamper the top line in the final quarter. Additonally, the company’s high debt levels are a concern.Due to the above headwinds, shares of the company have underperformed its industry in the last three months. The stock has declined 2.2% against the industry’s gain of 10.8%. However, volume growth at its key units like Overseas Intermodal, Frac sand, Coal and Petroleum coke exports plus Canadian grain should aid the company in the fourth quarter. Rail freight revenues, accounting for the bulk of the top line, should also rise significantly in the quarter.What Does Our Model Say?Our proven model does not conclusively show that the stock is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here as explained below.Zacks Rank: Canadian National carries a Zacks Rank #3, which incresaes the predictive power of ESP.Zacks ESP: Canadian National has an Earnings ESP of -0.93% as the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at 96 cents per share, lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 97 cents. However, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise. Hence, this combination leaves surprise prediction inconclusive.

The figure excludes the $3.6 billion net tax reform benefit from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 and a net restructuring charge of $10 million. Moreover, the bottom line climbed 30.6% year over year due to lower costs.However, revenues of $2,863 million missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2,882.2 million. Also, the top line declined 5.7% year over year to the tune of $178 million, mainly due to the impact of an extra fiscal week in 2016, resulting from CSX’s 52/53 fiscal reporting calendar in 2016.

412,KSU,"Kansas City Southern (KSU  -  Free Report) was added in the Focus List back in February to provide leverage to the economic recovery, since rail transportation tends to increase during such times. Well, that seems to have been a good decision, as the economy continues to recover and KSU recently announced a positive earnings surprise of more than 46% in its first-quarter report. 
"
413,KSU,"The company's Zacks #1 Rank ('strong buy') signifies the Street's positive reaction to its performance. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for this year is at $1.82 per share, or 22% better than 30 days ago as 11 of 12 total estimates were revised higher. The agreement among analysts was just as impressive for next year, sending the Zacks Consensus Estimate up by 20% to $2.33 per share in the same timeframe. At the moment, KSU is expected to grow profit by 28% next year over this year.  
"
414,KSU,"Kansas City Southern's first-quarter also included revenue growth of 26% to $436.3 million, as revenue improved in the double digits for each of its reported commodity groups. KSU fulfilled its forecast for sales of more than 20% in the quarter. In addition, the company has now reported better-than-expected earnings for 3 consecutive quarters.  
"
415,KSU,"KSU, which was upgraded by UBS on Monday of this week, has gained more than 15% since joining the Focus List. We currently have a longer-term ""Outperform"" recommendation on the railroad operator.  Dolan Media (DM) is likely to change its name to The Dolan Company soon. One thing that hopefully won't change anytime soon is this company's impressive streak of better-than-expected earnings; it stands at 6 straight now with the most recent being a more than 15% surprise in its first quarter.   
"
416,KSU,"Also in the quarter, total revenues advanced 20.4% to $77 million from $63.9 million last year. Its Professional Services Division, which represented 72.8% of total revenues in the quarter, jumped by 33.3%. Revenues for its Business Information Division, which accounted for most of the revenues just a few short years ago, declined by 4.3%. According to the company, this reflects its evolution to a more diversified professional services firm from a media-focused company.  
"
417,KSU,"If there was a problem with the quarter, it was that Dolan Media's guidance was left unchanged, rather than raised. As a result, earnings estimates for this year and next haven't moved much of late. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.16 per share for this year is up only a penny in 30 days and 2 cents in 3 months. The guidance for next year is $1.30 per share, which is unchanged in 2 months but a nickel better than 3 months ago. It also suggests 12% profit growth year over year.   
"

419,KSU,"Last week, three of the largest investment banking firms reported fiscal second-quarter results: Lehman Brothers (LEH), Goldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report) and Bear Stearns (BSC). The results topped expectations, but the prices of the three stocks ended the week slightly down after some modest volatility. 
"
420,KSU,"There was not a single explanation as to why. LEH topped estimates by nine cents with profits of $1.69 per share. The results were six cents below the blowout first-quarter numbers, however, which sparked some concern among investors. Other traders wanted to see what Goldman was going to report the following day. GS topped expectations by 62 cents with profits of $4.78 per share. The quality of earnings were questioned somewhat because of a one-time sale of a power generation facility that resulted in a $700 million gain. BSC said on Thursday that it generated profits of $3.72 per share, 62 cents above expectations.
"
421,KSU,"The overall state of the equity markets played a role. Stocks were down early last week before rallying on Wednesday and Thursday. LEH and GS reported on down days, while BSC was lucky enough report in the middle of a two-day, 300-point rally. The inability Lehman and Goldman Sachs to top extremely strong first-quarter results caused a bit of disgruntlement. There were also worries about the impact that market volatility and rising interest rates would have on the investing banking sector as a whole.
"
422,KSU,"On the other hand, earnings estimates for all three firms were raised for this year and next  a very bullish sign in the face of lackluster price action. The latest consensus forecast for LEH calls for fiscal 2006 earnings of $6.46 per share and fiscal 2007 earnings of $6.71. These estimates represent one-week increases of three cents for both forecasts. In regards to GS, the consensus estimates are $16.67 for fiscal 2006 and $16.07 for fiscal 2007. These new projections represent increases of 39 cents and 20 cents, respectively. Estimates for BSC now stand at $12.78 for fiscal 2006 and $13.38 for fiscal 2007, representing increases of 13 cents and 17 cents, respectively.
"
423,KSU,"Astute investors will notice that the revisions do not fully reflect the magnitude of the fiscal second-quarter surprises. This is partially due to the fact that not all of the covering analysts have adjusted their forecasts. Consensus estimates for both the third and fourth quarters have been ratcheted up, however, implying that analysts expect the positive earnings momentum to continue.
"
424,KSU,"Second quarter earnings season does not officially kick off until July 10, when Alcoa (AA) is expected to report. One analyst raised his forecast on the aluminum company last week. The recent change and two other positive revisions within the past 30 days have caused the quarterly estimate to rise by a cumulative three cents to 80 cents per share. Alcoa belongs to the Mining-Non Ferrous group, which has a Zacks Industry Rank of 1.57.
"
425,KSU,"Another company with recent revisions in estimates is CSX Corporation (CSX  -  Free Report), a Zacks #1 Rank stock. Two of the 10 covering analysts have raised their quarterly and full-year estimates over the past 30 days, with one analyst adjusting his estimate within the past seven days. The current second-quarter forecast calls for profits of $1.12 per share  a penny above the month-old estimate. The current full-year forecast calls for profits of $4.34 per share, five cents above the month-old estimate.
"
426,KSU,"CSX belongs to the Transportation-Rail group, which has a Zacks Industry Rank of 2.30. This group also contains five Zacks #2 Rank stocks: Canadian National Railway (CNI  -  Free Report), Florida East Coast Industries (FLA), Genesee & Wyoming (GWR  -  Free Report), Kansas City Southern (KSU  -  Free Report) and Union Pacific (UNP  -  Free Report). As I have stated previously, the railroads are benefiting from both sustained economic expansion and high energy prices. Elevated fuel prices have resulted in a shift of market share from trucks to rail. 
"
427,KSU,"Ethanol and coal are also helping the rail industry. On Friday afternoon, UNP issued a press release stating that it set a new all-time record for carloadings in a seven-day period. This was the first-time that the company has set such a record outside of its peak season. UNP is handling a 57% increase in ethanol shipments and is experiencing record coal volumes.

432,KSU,"Friday, July 21st, 2017To finish off this first busy week of Q2 earnings season — and with a lack of new economic headlines and/or tweets from the President this morning — perhaps we’re best served with a quick run-down of earnings reports ahead of today’s opening bell. We also look for an 11th straight day of gains on the Nasdaq, which would be the longest such stretch in 8 years.General Electric (GE  -  Free Report) posted beats on its Q2 top and bottom lines this morning, with 28 cents per share topping the Zacks consensus by 3 cents, and revenues of $29.56 billion surpassing the $29.13 billion expected. This marks the 4th earnings beat in the last 5 quarters for GE (that 5th quarter was a meet, not a miss), and the company has reiterated its fiscal 2017 guidance. GE also announced that incoming CEO John Flannery will be taking over for Jeff Immelt as of August 1st, and will secure the reins to the Chairmanship as of the first of the year.Zacks Rank #2 (Buy)-rated Honeywell (HON  -  Free Report) modestly beat estimates on the bottom line to $1.80 per share. $10.08 billion in quarterly sales also topped expectations. The New Jersey-based industrial major raised its fiscal 2017 guidance, and this Q2 earnings report also represents the 4th beat in the last 5 quarters (the 5th quarter was also a meet, not a miss).Oil & gas services major Schlumberger (SLB  -  Free Report) handily outperformed estimates on both top and bottom lines, with 35 cents a share beating the Zacks consensus by 5 cents and revenues of $7.46 billion surpassing the $7.26 billion expected. The company’s Drilling business was up 77% in the quarter, and its Production Group income rose 170% year over year.Fifth Third Bank (FITB  -  Free Report) put up mixed Q2 results this morning, topping estimates by 4 cents to 46 cents per share but with a miss on the top-line: $1.50 billion in revenues compared with the $1.53 billion expected. Higher net interest income and lower provisions for loan and lease losses — down 43% — were the quarterly highlights. Fifth Third has beaten earnings estimates in 3 of its last 4 quarters.Railroad major Kansas City Southern (KSU  -  Free Report) posted a strong Q2 before today’s opening bell, with earnings of $1.45 per share beating the Zacks consensus by 8 cents — +24% year over year — on quarterly sales of $5.25 billion that outpaced the estimate of $5.16 billion. Freight revenues grew 11% overall, with Operating Income up 21% to $2 billion. The company also bought back $850 million in KSU shares in the quarter.Posting a real blow-out quarter this morning is Encana (ECA  -  Free Report), the Calgary, Alberta, Canada-based natural gas E&P firm, which blew away expectations on both top and bottom lines. Its 18 cents per share more than quadrupled the 4 cents anticipated, on sales of $1.08 billion that easily topped the $773 million in the Zacks consensus. This revenue beat represents 197.5% growth year over year. Operating costs fell 16% since this time a year ago. We expect an upgrade to its current Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) based on this stellar quarterly performance.Mark VickerySenior EditorQuestions or comments about this article and/or its author? Click here>>

437,KSU,"Things have looked up for the railroad space so far this year  after not-so-favorable past few years (particularly 2015 and 2016) owing to weakness in domestic coal shipments. The improvement in the coal scenario has turned out to be a huge blessing for railroads as it is a key revenue generating commodity for the sector participants.The election of Donald Trump as the President of United States last year also worked wonders for the coal industry.  The President is in favor of reviving the industry by relaxing regulations detrimental to its prospects. He has started to act on his promises made during the campaigning phase. For example, he has taken measures to repeal the Climate Power Plan.The rise in natural gas prices is also helping to revive the demand for coal. Moreover, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), coal production in the United States will improve in 2017 and 2018. Given the importance of coal to railroads, any positive development for the commodity implies good news for the sector. Improvement in the freight scenario is also a positive for railroads.The revival of coal is evident  from the impressive performances of key sector participants like Union Pacific Corporation (UNP  -  Free Report), CSX Corporation (CSX  -  Free Report) and Norfolk Southern Corporation (NSC  -  Free Report) that registered double-digit growth with respect to coal revenues in the second quarter of 2017. In addition, an improving economy has also proved to be a boon for railroads as it implies that more goods are being transported across the United States via rail.The shareholder-friendly activities of the likes of Norfolk Southern and Canadian National Railway Company (CNI  -  Free Report) in 2017 also highlight the financial prosperity of the sector participants.Rail Traffic Data Highlights ImprovementThe latest U.S. rail traffic report (for the week ended Sep 30, 2017) of the Association of American Railroads (“AAR”) reveals 1.9% year-over-year growth in rail traffic (sum of total carloads and intermodal units). While total carloads for the week declined 1.6%, intermodal volume increased 5.5% year over year. The favorable intermodal scenario is also a positive development for railroads.The year-to-date data unveiled by AAR is also encouraging with a 3.8% improvement in total carloads. The favorable coal scenario is underscored by the fact that coal volumes have registered double-digit (12.3%) percentage gains so far this year. Overall rail traffic is up 3.6% year to date, with intermodal traffic rising 3.5%.Headwinds That May Mar Q3 Earnings PictureIn view of the coal-related improvement, the bullish scenario related to the intermodal unit and the thriving domestic economy, results of companies in the railroads space are expected to impress in the third quarter of 2017. However, there are a few factors, which might dampen their third-quarter performance.The back-to-back hurricanes (Harvey and Irma) have hurt operations of railroads by damaging important rail lines. Freight costs have skyrocketed following the natural disasters. With fuel costs on the rise, the bottom line of these companies are likely to be hurt in the third quarter due to higher costs as a result of the hurricanes.Union Pacific expects Harvey to hurt its bottom line to the tune of approximately 5 cents per share in the third quarter.The sluggishness of the automotive unit is also a cause of worry for railroads.  With the automotive sector accounting for a significant chunk of their revenues, softness in automotive volumes is also likely to hurt railroads in the third quarter.  What Awaits These 6 Railroads in Q3?Given this backdrop, let’s take a look at how key railroad operators might fare in the third quarter of 2017. According to our quantitative model, a company needs the right combination of two key ingredients – a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better – to increase the odds of an earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Kansas City Southern (KSU  -  Free Report), based in Kansas City, MO, is unlikely to report better-than-expected earnings per share in the third quarter despite its Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). This is because it has an Earnings ESP of -1.18% as the Most Accurate estimate of $1.33 per share is a penny below the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Its results are likely to be hurt by Harvey. In a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, last month, Kansas City Southern provided a detailed account of its operations being hurt by Harvey. Its results are scheduled to be announced on Oct 20.Kansas City Southern Price and EPS Surprise  Kansas City Southern Price and EPS Surprise | Kansas City Southern QuoteYou can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Genesee & Wyoming (GWR  -  Free Report), based in Darien, CT, is also unlikely to report better-than-expected earnings per share in the third quarter. This is because it carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) and has an Earnings ESP of -1.15% with the Most Accurate estimate of 83 cents per share is pegged a penny below the Zacks Consensus Estimate. In fact, Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement, especially when it is witnessing negative estimate revisions. High costs are expected to limit the company's bottom-line growth in the quarter. Results are scheduled to be announced on Oct 31.Genesee & Wyoming, Inc.

QuoteNorfolk Southern Corporation, based in Norfolk, VA, is likely to report better-than-expected earnings per share in the third quarter. This is because it carries a Zacks Rank #3 and has an Earnings ESP of +1.36% as the Most Accurate estimate of $1.66 per share is pegged 2 cents above the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The company will report results on Oct 25, which are expected to  benefit from higher coal volumes.Norfolk Souther Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Norfolk Souther Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Norfolk Souther Corporation QuoteUnion Pacific Corporation, based in Omaha, NE, is likely to report better-than-expected earnings per share in the third quarter. This is because it carries a Zacks Rank #3 and has an Earnings ESP of +0.07%.

This is because it has an Earnings ESP of -0.32%. Its results, scheduled to be reported on Oct 24, are expected to be hurt by lower revenues.Canadian National Railway Company Price and EPS Surprise  Canadian National Railway Company Price and EPS Surprise | Canadian National Railway Company QuoteCSX Corporation, based in Jacksonville, FL, is also unlikely to report better-than-expected earnings in the third quarter. This is because it carries a Zacks Rank #4 and has an Earnings ESP of -2.47% as the Most Accurate estimate of 52 cents per share is pegged a penny below the Zacks Consensus Estimate. High costs and sluggish auto production are expected to limit bottom-line growth in the quarter. Its results are due on Oct 17.CSX Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  CSX Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | CSX Corporation Quote

"
440,KSU,"The Q3 earnings season saw upbeat bottom-line performances by most railroad operators despite the recent hurricanes (Harvey, Irma and Maria). In fact, railroads seem to be recovering this year after a prolonged struggle due to coal-related issues.The string of encouraging releases in Q3 (on the top- and bottom-lines) from key segmental players like Union Pacific Corp. (UNP  -  Free Report), Norfolk Southern Corp. (NSC  -  Free Report), Kansas City Southern (KSU  -  Free Report) reflects the improved scenario regarding railroads.All the above-mentioned stocks carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks hereFactors Driving the Turnaround Stocks in the railroad space have performed well so far this year on the back of multiple tailwinds. In fact, the improvement in the coal industry has immensely benefited stocks in the space as coal is a key revenue generator.The commodity is likely to see even better days given President Trump’s pro-coal stance. Apart from coal, other key divisions of railroads like intermodal are also performing well. The strong performance of key sectors at railroads is leading to an uptick in overall volumes.Another factor working in favor of railroads is the improvement in the U.S. economy. In the third quarter of 2017, intermodal volumes increased 6.3% on a year-over-year basis. This was the highest growth rate recorded in more than three years.A buoyant domestic economy has also contributed to the turnaround at railroads. A vibrant economy implies that more goods are being transported across the United States via rail.In fact, the likes of Kansas City Southern, CSX Corp. (CSX  -  Free Report), Canadian National Railway Co. (CNI  -  Free Report) and Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd. (CP  -  Free Report) have hiked their quarterly dividend payouts this year, which further highlights the financial prosperity of the sector participants.Operating Ratio Improvement - A Positive CatalystIn the third quarter, Kansas City Southern’s operating ratio (defined as operating expenses as a percentage of revenues) came in at 64.4% compared with 66.9% reported a year ago. At Norfolk Southern, this key metric improved to 65.9% from 67.5% in the third quarter of 2016.Norfolk Southern aims to achieve an operating ratio of below 65% by 2020 or even earlier. At CSX, operating ratio operating ratio improved 90 basis points to 68.1% in the third quarter. In 2017, CSX expects operating ratio in the high end of mid-60s. The metric also improved at Genesee & Wyoming (GWR  -  Free Report). Additionally, the prudent cost management of railroad operators raise optimism in the stocks.Solid Price PerformanceDriven by the above-mentioned tailwinds, the Zacks Rail industry has outperformed the broader market so far this year. While the S&P 500 Index gained 15.7%, the industry rallied 19.2%.Also, a 19.3% improvement in the Dow Jones U.S. Railroads Index on a year-to-date basis, bears testimony to bullishness surrounding railroads.Zacks Industry Rank Supports Favorable ScenarioThe Zacks Industry Rank of 118 (out of 250 plus groups) carried by the Zacks Rail industry further highlights the attractiveness of railroads. The favorable rank places the companies in the top 46% of the Zacks industries.We put our entire 250-plus industries into two groups: the top half (i.e., industries with the best average Zacks Rank) and the bottom half (the industries with the worst average Zacks Rank).Over the last 10 years, using a one week rebalance, the top half beat the bottom half by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Click here to know more: About Zacks Industry RankWhat to Expect in Q4?We expect railroads to continue performing well in the fourth quarter of 2017, driven by volume growth as was the case in Q3. Key units such as intermodal and coal are also expected to aid in delivering encouraging results,.The cost discipline of railroads might also drive the bottom line. For example, CSX expects its bottom line to expand between 20% and 25% in 2017 (on a reported basis) over 2016 levels, driven by improved efficiencies.Currently, the valuation picture for railroads is favorable and certainly points at some degree of upside. When valued according to the forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio for the current financial year (F1), the Zacks Rail Transportation industry does not appear too expensive as it is trading at 19.8x P/E multiple. In fact, the reading appears favorable when compared with its own traded multiple (trading lower than its high end of 20.1x) in the last 12 months as well as the S&P 500 (20.5x). The industry’s lower-than-market positioning calls for more upside.Despite the positives, there are a few factors which might hurt results in the fourth quarter. Evidently, weakness in the automotive sector had hurt the results of major railroads in the third quarter, consequently production declined in the Unites States.  The scenario is expected to remain gloomy in the final quarter of 2017 as well. In fact, sales of U.S. light vehicle sales for 2017 are projected at 17 million units, down approximately 3% on a year-over-year basis. With the automotive sector accounting for a significant chunk of their revenues, softness in automotive volumes might hurt railroads.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest Strategies It's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +18.8% from 2016 - Q1 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +157.0%, +128.0%, +97.8%, +94.7%, and +90.2% respectively.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon.

441,KSU,"The transportation sector is struggling this earnings season with total earnings from 97.9% of the sector’s total market capitalization that has reported so far down 14.2% despite revenue growth of 5.1%. This is much below earnings growth of 9.6% and revenue growth of 10% for the same period, in the last reporting cycle (read: 5 Sector ETFs for Revenue Growth Play).Earnings and revenue beat ratio of 69.2% and 61.5%, respectively, are also disappointing despite the fact that most of the industry players dominating the sector managed to beat our estimates on earnings or revenues or both.For a better understanding, let’s dig into the earnings results of some well-known industry players:Transportation Earnings in FocusThe world's largest package delivery company United Parcel Service (UPS  -  Free Report) topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate on both fronts. Earnings of $1.45 surpassed our earnings estimate by a penny while revenues of $15.98 billion edged past the estimated $15.61 billion. For fiscal 2017, the company narrowed its earnings per share guidance range from $5.80-$6.10 to $5.85-$6.10. The Zacks Consensus Estimate at the time of earnings release was pegged at $6.00.The major railroads Union Pacific (UNP  -  Free Report), Kansas City Southern (KSU  -  Free Report) and Norfolk Southern Corp (NSC  -  Free Report) also beat on both the top and bottom lines. NSC outpaced the earnings estimate by a wide margin of 11 cents while earnings at UNP and KSU came ahead by a penny and three cents, respectively. Revenues for the three railroads trumped their Zacks Consensus Estimate by $102 million, $9 million and $40 million, respectively.Ryder Systems (R  -  Free Report), the leader in supply chain management and fleet management services, beat the earnings estimate by four cents and revenue estimate by $42 million.The two largest U.S. airlines Delta Air Lines (DAL  -  Free Report) and United Continental (UAL  -  Free Report) reported better-than-expected results but the latter lagged on revenues. Earnings of $1.57 and revenues of $11.1 billion at Delta edged past the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.54 and $11.03 billion, respectively. At United Continental, earnings per share of $2.22 came above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.18 but revenues of $9.878 billion slightly fell shy of the estimated $9.88 billion (read: Will Airline ETF Crash on Subdued Q3 or Take Off on Value?).Last but not the least, earnings for the leading trucking carrier J.B. Hunt (JBHT  -  Free Report) came in below the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a nickel but revenues were $28 million above the estimate.ETFs in FocusGiven this, the sector saw a 2.3% average decline (average price difference between a day before and after the earnings announcement of a stock) in response to earnings announcements. As such, both transport ETFs, iShares Dow Jones Transportation Average Fund (IYT  -  Free Report) and SPDR S&P Transportation ETF (XTN  -  Free Report), saw rough trading in the past one month. IYT shed 1.6% while XTN was down 0.4%. Both funds have an unfavorable Zacks ETF Rank #4 (Sell) rating with a High risk outlook (see: all the Industrials ETFs here).IYTThe fund tracks the Dow Jones Transportation Average Index, giving investors exposure to a small basket of 20 securities. The fund has a certain tilt toward large-cap stocks at 55% while mid and small caps account for 26% and 19% share, respectively, in the basket. Though the product is heavily concentrated on the top firm FedEx (FDX) at 14.3%, the in-focus eight firms collectively make up for 47.2% of the portfolio. From a sector perspective, air freight & logistics takes the top spot with 30.8% of the portfolio while railroads, trucking and airlines round off to the next three spots with double-digit exposure each. The fund has accumulated nearly $799.2 million in AUM while sees solid trading volume of around 258,000 shares a day. It charges 44 bps in annual fees.XTNThis fund tracks the S&P Transportation Select Industry Index, holding 43 stocks in its basket. It is skewed toward small caps at 47% while the rest is split between mid and large caps. As a result, the in-focus firms account for over 2% share each. Further, about 32.3% of the portfolio is dominated by trucking, while airlines takes one-fourth share. Airfreight & logistics, and railroads also make up for a double-digit allocation each. With AUM of $194.6 million, the fund charges 35 bps in fees per year from investors and trades in a lower volume of around 22,000 shares a day (read: ETFs to Buy After Weak Jobs Report).Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week.

484,KSU,"The second-quarter earnings season is expected to be strong, with the S&P 500 index anticipated to see earnings growth of 5.6% and revenue growth of 4.5%, per the latest Earnings Trends. The stock market is also at record levels. However, the ongoing turmoil in Washington, geopolitical risks, Fed-related uncertainty, and lofty valuation could bring some difficulties for stocks this season (read: Sector ETFs & Stocks to Tap Q2 Earnings Growth).  While five of the 16 Zacks sectors are expected to post double-digit earnings growth, six sectors would lag. Plus, the current earnings estimate is down from 7.9% projected at the start of the second quarter. Amid such volatility, investors should focus on ETFs with large allocations to stocks that have a high chance of surprising in their upcoming release. This could result in a winning bet this earnings season.How to Find ETFs?Handpicking ETFs with a portfolio of stocks that are most likely to beat on earnings is no mean task. However, our proprietary methodology of finding out the Earnings ESP of stocks by calculating the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate is a solid building block.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Betting on ETFs with the winning combination of stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) would lead to profits in investor portfolios. This is especially true as an earnings beat will definitely draw investors’ attention and propel the stock price and related ETFs higher. Let’s see how the ETFs have been selected with this combination of stocks.First, we ran our Zacks stock screener to find out the stocks with a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank. Then, we narrowed down the list by selecting the group of stocks with higher positive Earnings ESP. Accordingly, we chose three ETFs, which contain few stocks with higher chances of beating estimates in a particular industry (see: all the ETF Categories here).Our research shows that for the stocks with this combination, the chance of a positive earnings surprise is as high as 70%. As a result, this trio could be excellent for investors seeking sure profits this earnings season.PowerShares Dynamic Leisure and Entertainment Fund (PEJ  -  Free Report)This fund tracks the Dynamic Leisure and Entertainment Intellidex Index and holds a small basket of 30 stocks. It is pretty well spread out across various securities as each holds less than 5.6% of total assets.

485,KSU,"The market lacks a clear directional move. It is down on the year and generally appears to be tentative despite the solid fourth-quarter GDP and earnings reports. What should we make of this lack of conviction? What does it mean in terms of investment opportunities or lack thereof?  
"
486,KSU,"As I pointed out in today's Roundtable Review video (Top Sectors and Stock Picks), the market's lack of a directional move is inline with my overall outlook for the market this year. I don't expect any fireworks from the market in 2010 with a full-year gain in the 5% to 10% range; so a fairly tame affair by last year's standards. The 2009 Run-Up Predicted the Recovery
"
487,KSU,"Last year's impressive performance reflected the realization in the market and proved correct by subsequent developments: we were not after all going into a Great Depression 2.0 and there may actually be light at the end of the tunnel. The extraordinary level of stimulus pumped into the system, both by fiscal as well as monetary authorities, helped the financial sector and the broader economy back on its feet.  
"
488,KSU,"We saw the economy get out of the recession in the third quarter of 2009 (though we are still waiting for an official announcement on that score) and then produced a phenomenally impressive 5.7% growth in the fourth quarter. While the macro picture is still evolving with a number of key metrics showing persistent weakness, other areas show clear signs of recovery. Even in the labor market, we are getting close to the point where we will start seeing positive job growth. On the corporate earnings front as well, we saw excellent numbers in the third quarter and then again very impressive numbers in the current reporting season.  
"
489,KSU,"The exit from the recession and the above-mentioned recovery was priced by last year's market run up. Uncertainties for the Market 
"
490,KSU,"From here onwards, the market needs to be reassured that the recovery is sustainable and that we are not going back into a recession. The fear has been that as the fiscal stimulus is steadily removed towards the second half of the year, the growth momentum would be difficult to sustain. These growth fears/concerns also show up in concerns about the labor market. Everybody is talking about a jobless recovery, but how strong can the economic recovery be if we continue to have so much labor market slack?  
"
491,KSU,"And related to all these issues is the Fed's eventual removal of the extremely stimulative monetary policy stance that was put in place during the downturn. They have already announced measures to roll-back some of the provisions. Specifically, the Fed plans to end its mortgage bond purchases next month and pay banks interest on excess reserves they keep with it.  
"
492,KSU,"A key Fed move that the markets are trying to handicap pertains to its interest rate policy. The Fed has been saying for a while now that it intends to keep interest rates low for an 'extended period'. But at some stage, they will have to remove that language from their statement(s) and start raising rates. As such, while a timeline on the Fed's eventual move is uncertain, the direction of the move is quite obvious.  China Worries are a Bigger Deal than Greece
"
493,KSU,"It is in this backdrop of macro uncertainties, or rather lack of near-term visibility, that the market has been preoccupied with sovereign risk issues and moves by China's central bank. As I mentioned here last week, Germany and France have too much skin in the game to let the Euro project be derailed by worries about the sovereign debt profile of Greece or any other countries (i.e. the so-called PIGS  Portugal, Italy, Greece, and Spain).  
"
494,KSU,"So, with full apologies to Greece, I don't think their woes by themselves are enough to make us re-evaluate our investment options in the current market. This newfound concern about the viability of sovereign liabilities, if sustained going forward, will however be welcome.  
"
495,KSU,"China, on the other hand, is a different story. As explained in my analyst blog post Further Tightening from China, China is trying to control some of the speculative excesses in its real estate sector. It is trying to let the air out of a bubble without actually popping it. Monetary authorities in other countries, including the U.S., have been hesitant to confront bubbles in real time. So, in a way, they are in uncharted territory.  
"
496,KSU,"But it is more than an academic issue. A key question, in my view, pertains to the ability of Chinese authorities to effectively handle the speculative bubble in its real estate sector without affecting its overall growth profile. Given China's centrality to the global economy, this issue is expected to weigh on the overall global growth outlook. Portfolio Changes 
"
497,KSU,"Unless China's growth trajectory materially changes, we will remain largely on track with our plans for the Focus List and Growth & Income Portfolios. We continue to view the key emerging markets (China, Brazil, and India) as critical to the growth of the global economy and will look for direct and indirect exposure there. 
"
498,KSU,"Overall, we remain constructive on the economy, with an outlook of steady positive growth and no double dip. As such, we are not making any changes to the portfolio due to the current fixations on sovereign risk issues. We will also continue to look for opportunities in the banking group, as we have articulated here in recent weeks.  
"
499,KSU,"In terms of portfolio changes, we added one stock and deleted three from the Focus List. We did not make any changes to the Growth & Income Portfolio. 
"
500,KSU,"We added freight railroad operator Kansas City Southern (KSU  -  Free Report), given its strong cyclical leverage to an economic turnaround. The company is cautiously optimistic about growth and volume trends for 2010 and currently has a Zacks #1 Rank ('strong buy').  
"
501,KSU,"We sold World Fuel Services (INT  -  Free Report) after the fuel marketer fell to a Zacks #4 Rank ('sell'). We remain true to the discipline of the Zacks Methodology that mandates getting out of such positions. We also deleted Buffalo Wild Wings (BWLD) after the company's earnings shortfall. BWLD came out with quarterly earnings that were a nickel short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate, prompting us to exit this stock. Finally, we exited our Newmarket Corporation  position to lock in our gains (~15%) following the recent weakness in the stock. The company had decent quarterly results, but the market has been unimpressed lately given concerns about emerging market growth issues. 
"
502,KSU,"Wall Street saw modest losses after Tuesday's gains. News and trading was light as many traders called it a day early amid an East Coast snowstorm. 
"
503,KSU,"The optimism and market upswing that were generated by Tuesday's announcement of a possible Greece debt bailout were short lived as Bernanke outlined his post economic recovery strategy. The Fed Chairman talked about plans for removing the stimulus and indicated that interest rates may be increased at some point but not for a long time.     
"
504,KSU,"The Dow dipped by 20.26 points, or 0.20%, to 10,038.38. The S&P 500 edged down by 2.39 points, or 0.22%, to 1,068.13. The Nasdaq gave up 3.00 points, or 0.14%, closing at 2,147.87.
"
505,KSU,"A Focus List UpdateBuffalo Wild Wings. (BWLD) rose 1.7% today. We received several estimate revisions over the past month. The full-year estimate for 2010 continues to inch higher, now up to $2.13 on 5 revisions in the past month. BWLD is reporting its quarterly results next Thursday. 
"
506,KSU," A Focus List AdditionKansas City Southern (KSU  -  Free Report) was added to the Focus List after the close on Feb 10. The company operates railroads in North America, Mexico and Panama. It recently surprised on the Zacks Consensus by 13.79% for its second consecutive quarterly beat. KSU is cautiously optimistic about growth and increasing volumes in 2010. While the company is trading with a forward P/E of 23.26, its price-to-book ratio is just 1.27 which is well below the industry average of 1.74. 
"
507,KSU,"Focus List DeletionsWorld Fuel Services (INT  -  Free Report) was removed from the Focus List after the close on Feb 10. The company has fallen to a Zacks #4 Rank (sell) stock so it must be removed from the portfolio. 
"
508,KSU,"NewMarket  was removed from the Focus List after the close on Feb 10. In spite of the company's solid Q3 results on Jan 29 that included year-over-year sales growth and a respectable earnings beat, shares proceeded to sell off and drop sharply. We wanted to wait a few days to see if shares would bounce higher on a very compelling valuation, but since that hasn't happened, and even though this is still a Zacks #2 rank stock, we are going to cover and lock in our gain. NewMarket was originally added to the portfolio on May 19, 2009 at the price of $72.99. 
"
509,KSU,"A Growth and Income UpdateBuckeye Partners (BPL  -  Free Report) was one of the few gainers in the volatile session, adding .62% on the day as oil has moved above $74. As it stands, shares are back within striking distance of the 52-week high at $58.32.   
"
510,KSU,"Kansas City Southern (KSU  -  Free Report) dodged a bullet and announced that it did not sustain any major damage to infrastructure after hurricane Ike. The company will be able to repair the minimal damages to rails and facilities as soon as flood waters retreat.  
"
511,KSU,"Kansas City Southern is confident that it and its customers in the gulf region will be able to resume business as usual soon.  In addition, analysts predict that most of the lost revenue for the third quarter will be re-captured later in the year. 
"
512,KSU,"The consensus estimates for the current year are up 12.5% within the past two months.  The company has also seen estimates for the current quarter, next quarter, and next year increase as well.  
"
513,KSU,"Current estimates are forecasting a 38% increase for full-year 2008 and a 29.7% year-over-year increase for the current quarter.

He have a bullish read on the MACD here too. Look for support from the short-term low just above $39 on any weakness, take a look below.
"
520,KSU,"Last week, three of the largest investment banking firms reported fiscal second-quarter results: Lehman Brothers (LEH), Goldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report) and Bear Stearns (BSC). The results topped expectations, but the prices of the three stocks ended the week slightly down after some modest volatility. 
"
521,KSU,"There was not a single explanation as to why. LEH topped estimates by nine cents with profits of $1.69 per share. The results were six cents below the blowout first-quarter numbers, however, which sparked some concern among investors. Other traders wanted to see what Goldman was going to report the following day. GS topped expectations by 62 cents with profits of $4.78 per share. The quality of earnings were questioned somewhat because of a one-time sale of a power generation facility that resulted in a $700 million gain. BSC said on Thursday that it generated profits of $3.72 per share, 62 cents above expectations.
"
522,KSU,"The overall state of the equity markets played a role. Stocks were down early last week before rallying on Wednesday and Thursday. LEH and GS reported on down days, while BSC was lucky enough report in the middle of a two-day, 300-point rally. The inability Lehman and Goldman Sachs to top extremely strong first-quarter results caused a bit of disgruntlement. There were also worries about the impact that market volatility and rising interest rates would have on the investing banking sector as a whole.
"
523,KSU,"On the other hand, earnings estimates for all three firms were raised for this year and next  a very bullish sign in the face of lackluster price action. The latest consensus forecast for LEH calls for fiscal 2006 earnings of $6.46 per share and fiscal 2007 earnings of $6.71. These estimates represent one-week increases of three cents for both forecasts. In regards to GS, the consensus estimates are $16.67 for fiscal 2006 and $16.07 for fiscal 2007. These new projections represent increases of 39 cents and 20 cents, respectively. Estimates for BSC now stand at $12.78 for fiscal 2006 and $13.38 for fiscal 2007, representing increases of 13 cents and 17 cents, respectively.
"
524,KSU,"Astute investors will notice that the revisions do not fully reflect the magnitude of the fiscal second-quarter surprises. This is partially due to the fact that not all of the covering analysts have adjusted their forecasts. Consensus estimates for both the third and fourth quarters have been ratcheted up, however, implying that analysts expect the positive earnings momentum to continue.
"
525,KSU,"Second quarter earnings season does not officially kick off until July 10, when Alcoa (AA) is expected to report. One analyst raised his forecast on the aluminum company last week. The recent change and two other positive revisions within the past 30 days have caused the quarterly estimate to rise by a cumulative three cents to 80 cents per share. Alcoa belongs to the Mining-Non Ferrous group, which has a Zacks Industry Rank of 1.57.
"
526,KSU,"Another company with recent revisions in estimates is CSX Corporation (CSX  -  Free Report), a Zacks #1 Rank stock. Two of the 10 covering analysts have raised their quarterly and full-year estimates over the past 30 days, with one analyst adjusting his estimate within the past seven days. The current second-quarter forecast calls for profits of $1.12 per share  a penny above the month-old estimate. The current full-year forecast calls for profits of $4.34 per share, five cents above the month-old estimate.
"
527,KSU,"CSX belongs to the Transportation-Rail group, which has a Zacks Industry Rank of 2.30. This group also contains five Zacks #2 Rank stocks: Canadian National Railway (CNI  -  Free Report), Florida East Coast Industries (FLA), Genesee & Wyoming (GWR  -  Free Report), Kansas City Southern (KSU  -  Free Report) and Union Pacific (UNP  -  Free Report). As I have stated previously, the railroads are benefiting from both sustained economic expansion and high energy prices. Elevated fuel prices have resulted in a shift of market share from trucks to rail. 
"
528,KSU,"Ethanol and coal are also helping the rail industry. On Friday afternoon, UNP issued a press release stating that it set a new all-time record for carloadings in a seven-day period. This was the first-time that the company has set such a record outside of its peak season. UNP is handling a 57% increase in ethanol shipments and is experiencing record coal volumes.

532,KSU,"^Net percentage of total estimates for this fiscal years earnings (primarily 2006) that have been revised upwards. This number is calculated by subtracting the number of estimates revised downwards over the past four weeks from the number of estimates revised upwards over the past four weeks and dividing this total by the total number of next fiscal year estimates.
"
533,KSU,"PPG Industries, Inc. (PPG  -  Free Report) made the cut as one of the fastest-growing stocks on the Focus List this week. This manufacturer of coatings, glass and chemicals is a new addition to the portfolio. It was added on Aug 12, thanks, in large part, to an impressive track record of dividends that stretches back more than 100 years.  
"
534,KSU,"Some of the company's customers are getting back on track, but the housing and construction market looks like it will continue to be a problem. (This was underscored just yesterday with a worse-than-expected drop for existing home sales in July, see Home Sales Plunge, Prices to Follow.) Nevertheless, PPG continues to enjoy a longer-term ""Outperform"" recommendation and a Zacks #1 Rank ('strong buy').
"
535,KSU,"The Zacks Consensus Estimate for this year and next is currently $4.66 and $5.19 per share, respectively. Each of these outlooks is up approximately 9% over the past 2 months.  
"
536,KSU,"As far as its ""Outperform"" recommendation is concerned, we expect PPG Industries to experience healthy growth from improving macro trends, and also appreciate its increasing focus on emerging markets, especially in Asia.  
"
537,KSU,"For its second quarter, PPG Industries reported earnings per share of $1.64 that topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate by more than 14%. It also improved substantially from the year-ago performance of 90 cents. Sales jumped 11% to $3.5 billion.  
"
538,KSU,"The company attributed these results to a 10% increase in volumes. The weak construction markets of the U.S. and Europe are being offset by higher industrial activity and strong demand in Asia/Pacific and Latin America.   
"
539,KSU,"PPG Industries has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for nine straight quarters now. If you average the last four quarters, the company has surprised by approximately 13%.   
"
540,KSU,"A few weeks ago, Kansas City Southern (KSU  -  Free Report) reported 55 cents per share for its second quarter, which bettered the Zacks Consensus Estimate by almost 20%. This marked the company's fourth straight quarter with a positive earnings surprise, amassing an average of a little more than 24% in that time (thanks to a more than 46% beat for the first quarter).  
"
541,KSU,"Last year's second quarter marked the worst point in a very bad market environment for KSU, so the company had some good comparisons to work with. For example, EPS surged by almost eight times year over year from 7 cents per share. In addition, revenues of $461.6 million advanced 35% from last year, thanks to an improvement in volumes and a solid pricing environment.  
"
542,KSU,"We have a longer-term ""Outperform"" recommendation on KSU, but, for the shorter-term, the company has a Zacks #3 Rank ('hold').   
"
543,KSU,"Over the past two months, there have been nine upward revisions for this year and seven upward revisions for next. There are 15 total estimates for each period. There has also been one downward revision for 2010 and two downward revisions for 2011.  
"
544,KSU,"The Zacks Consensus Estimate for this year is up 2.6% in 30 days to $1.95 per share, but is down a penny in the past 7 days. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for next year is up 4.2% to $2.46 per share, which also suggests year-over-year improvement of more than 26%.   
"
545,KSU,"Kansas City Southern has been on the Focus List since Feb 10 of this year. In that time, the company is up 6.5%.  
"

"
547,KSU,"Veeco Instruments Inc. (VECO  -  Free Report) will be going for a fourth straight quarter with a positive earnings surprise when it announces second-quarter results next week. The chip equipment manufacturer is expected to report earnings per share of 78 cents, which would easily reverse a year-ago loss. That Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter has improved by 44% in 3 months.  
"
548,KSU,"In the first quarter, VECO's earnings per share of 46 cents beat the consensus by more than 12%. This was the third consecutive quarter with a better-than-expected result. Revenues jumped 160%. All three of its businesses enjoyed sequential gains in revenue and profits. The company also offered a second-quarter earnings per share guidance that was above the Zacks Consensus Estimate at the time.  
"
549,KSU,"That report led to sharp gains in earnings estimates for VECO, which you can still see when compared to three months ago. Since then, expectations have been rather sluggish, underscored by its Zacks #3 Rank ('hold'). However, it could be a totally different story by this time next week.  
"
550,KSU,"The Zacks Consensus Estimate for this year is $3.30 per share, which is up nearly 45% from 3 months ago. Meanwhile, the expectation for next year is at $3.60 per share, marking an advance of 15.4% in 3 months, including an improvement of 2.6% in the past 30 days. Furthermore, the guidance for 2011 suggests year-over-year profit growth of 9%.  
"
551,KSU,"Veeco Instruments was added to the Focus List in March and has since gained approximately 9%. Kansas City Southern (KSU  -  Free Report) is also looking to report a fourth straight quarter with a positive earnings surprise next week. If you average the last 3 quarters together, this railroad operator has beaten by 26%.  
"
552,KSU,"A big part of that average surprise came from its first-quarter report, where earnings per share of 44 cents surged past the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 30 cents by more than 46%. Revenue grew by 26% to $436.3 million. Each of its reported commodity groups saw revenue advance in the double digits.  
"
553,KSU,"However, all eyes are on the second quarter, scheduled to be reported on Jul 27. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter is at 44 cents, which is nearly 42% higher than 3 months ago. In the year-ago second quarter, KSU reported 7 cents.  
"
554,KSU,"There are 14 total estimates covering Kansas City Southern for each this year and next. In the past 30 days, there have been 2 upward revisions for this year and 3 downward revisions. However, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.88 per share for 2010 is still 3.3% higher than 2 months ago and even a penny better than 30 days ago, despite the downward revisions.

And on June 9, the Barclays Capital analyst was bullish on the whole sector given that volumes are rising and that the railroads have little to no exposure to the Eurozone either through currency translation or slower European growth.Next Earnings Report on July 22

"
562,KSU,"Kansas City Southern's stock has held its gains even in the volatile market in May. It was recently hitting its 52-week high, again, but has recently pulled back off of that.
"
563,KSU,"Still, it's been an impressive run for the stock.Fundamentals
"
564,KSU,"Kansas City Southern has gotten a little more expensive since we added it. The company now has a forward P/E of 20.6, which is above the industry average of 16.7.
"
565,KSU,"It also has a price-to-book ratio of 1.6, again, slightly above the industry average of 1.3.
"
566,KSU,"But we don't feel Kansas City Southern is an ""expensive"" stock at this level.
"
567,KSU,"We like the stability of this company and this sector given the economic uncertainties in the global economy.
"
568,KSU,"Kansas City Southern is a Zacks #1 Rank (strong buy) stock.Tracey Ryniec is the Value Stock Strategist for Zacks.com. She is also the Editor in charge of the market-beating Zacks Value Trader service.
"
569,KSU,"Along with all other industries in the U.S., railroads also suffered during the economic downturn. Freight rail is a “derived demand industry -- demand for the rail service is tied with demand for the products that the railroads haul. Rail traffic, therefore, acts as a solid barometer of the overall health of the economy.
"
570,KSU,"Since around 2003−2004, a number of factors have led to an increase in rail freight volume in the U.S:Rising fuel costs led to an increased demand for rail, since railroads are on an average four times more fuel-efficient than trucks.A surge in U.S. imports and record U.S. agricultural exports boosted rail shipments to and from ports.A rise in natural gas prices caused power plants to burn more coal to generate electricity, and most coal is shipped by rail.Railroad investments in capacity, innovations and use of technology led to service improvements and enhanced reliability.
"
571,KSU,"By 2006, America’s railroads were carrying more freight than ever before in the country’s history. However, the recent downturn that officially began in December 2007 witnessed reduced traffic and volumes. In 2009, carload traffic was down 16.1% compared with 2008 and down 18.2% compared with 2007.
"
572,KSU,"With the economy now out of the recession, the fortunes of the railroad industry are also on the mend. The overall sentiment with respect to railroads is clearly improving, with total traffic for the 17th week of 2010 increasing 15.0%, preceded by a traffic increase of 14.8% year-over-year in the 16th week, 16.1% in the 15th week and 17.2% in the 14th week. The volumes grew steadily due to a pick-up in end market demand. Moreover, structural cost cuts during the downturn are expected to help railroads generate high incremental margins.
"
573,KSU,"Although the macro picture has improved, the recovery appears to be sluggish and fragile, at least over the next few quarters. Our long-term outlook for rail transport is positive. As the U.S. economy recovers, manufacturing production picks up and consumers begin spending again, industry revenue will return to steady growth. Adding to our confidence is Warren Buffett’s investment in the sector − Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway , (BRK.B  -  Free Report) acquisition of the rail company Burlington Northern Santa Fe is what we are talking about here. His investment in the group is clearly a seal of approval.
"
574,KSU,"On a modestly negative note is the lingering concern about legislative/regulatory changes that may affect industry profitability and operating conditions.OPPORTUNITIES
"
575,KSU,"One railroad company that we like with a Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) is Kansas City Southern (KSU  -  Free Report), which has great momentum. Its capital position improved with increased liquidity and reduced leverage, followed by the recent equity issuance. Management expects double-digit growth in fiscal 2010, with volume growing in the mid- to high-single digits along with growth in revenue yield. We are optimistic about new business wins and growth prospects for fiscal 2010 and beyond, given the overall improvement in the economy.
"
576,KSU,"Another of our picks is CSX Corporation (CSX  -  Free Report), which looks attractive based on the its earnings power, pricing power, potential improvements in network fluidity, cost controls, probable improvements in safety and fewer distractions. Cost-cutting efforts undertaken during the past few years will now accrue to the earnings. Steady pricing, improving volumes and cost saving efforts will likely help the company to outperform its peers in the near term.Canadian National Railway (CNI  -  Free Report) is also poised to benefit from the eventual rebound in the economy as suggested by the recent volume gains.   
"
577,KSU,"Elswhere, we are Neutral on Canadian Pacific Railway (CP  -  Free Report), Norfolk Southern (NSC  -  Free Report) and Rail America (RA). Our Neutral recommendations for these operators primarily reflect the lack of near-term earnings momentum in their businesses.
"
578,KSU,"WEAKNESSES
"
579,KSU,"The economic growth is tardy and difficult conditions are expected to continue through 2010, with U.S. consumers still conservative in their expenditure. Coupled with this, the new home construction market continues to be weak, which in turn affects a number of commodities transported.
"
580,KSU,"Growth in automotive sales also will take time before getting into full swing. These sluggish economic conditions will delay the industry recovery.
"
581,KSU,"We shouldn’t lose sight of the growing concerns about the sustainability of the U.S. recovery given the headwinds from Europe and uncertainty about China’s outlook. While we view the U.S. economic growth trajectory to be essentially on track, some downside risks can not entirely be ruled out. And given the economic sensitivity of the rail transport sector, any diminution of the U.S. growth prospects remains a risk factor for the industry.
"
582,KSU,"Another potential headwind facing the rail industry is the ongoing debate on increasing regulations in the industry. If this materializes, it may weigh on further efficiency gains and earnings growth.                    
"
583,KSU,"Kansas City Southern (KSU  -  Free Report) recently rebounded from a key trend line after pulling back from a fresh multi-year high in early May. With a bullish 28% next-year growth projection and a strong showing in May rail activity, the company looks well positioned for more gains.

But now, with the domestic and global economy on the upswing, the group is once again back in favor, benefiting from surging demand and strict attention to controlling costs.
