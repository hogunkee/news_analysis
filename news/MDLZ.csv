0,MDLZ,"The candy and snack food industries are doing well right now, based on statistics released Tuesday at the Sweets and Snacks Expo. But you wouldn't know that from the share prices of publicly traded companies in the sector.""Consumer staples in general are extremely out of favor,"" Edward Jones analyst Brittany Weissman said. ""Consumer staples have significantly underperformed the broader market.""IBD's confectionery industry group ranks near the bottom of 197 industry groups. It includes just four stocks: Mondelez International (MDLZ), Hershey (HSY), Tootsie Roll Industries (TR) and Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory (RMCF).Many makers of sweets and snacks are in IBD's packaged-food industry group, which ranks No. 161. It includes 29 stocks, among them Nestle (NSRGY), PepsiCo (PEP), General Mills (GIS), Kellogg (K), ConAgra Brands (CAG) and Hostess Brands (TWNK).Investors started rotating out of food stocks in mid-2016 in anticipation of rising interest rates, Weissman said.Amazon's (AMZN) acquisition of Whole Foods Market, announced in June 2017, added to the worries, she said.The Amazon-Whole Foods merger, completed in August 2017, led to large grocery sellers like Walmart (WMT) and Kroger (KR) gaining more negotiating power with manufacturers, she said. That's made it harder for food makers to pass on cost increases, such as rising grain and cocoa prices.Another factor hitting major candy and snack makers has been the rise of store brands. They include Kirkland Signature at Costco Wholesale (COST), Member's Mark at Walmart-owned Sam's Club and Wickedly Prime at Amazon.To combat these private-label products, the major candy and snack companies are focusing on product innovation to attract consumers. They're using new ingredients, different combinations, bold flavors and novel textures to entice customers.Many of these new products were on display at the annual Sweets and Snacks Expo, which ran Tuesday through Thursday in Chicago. The show had about 900 exhibiting companies and was expected to attract about 18,000 attendees.This year's Sweets and Snacks Expo is the biggest yet in terms of number of exhibitors and attendees, said Christopher Gindlesperger, vice president of public affairs and communications for the National Confectioners Association, which sponsors the show.Product trends among candy makers at this year's show include greater use of coconut and caramel in products, Gindlesperger said.Cocoa and chocolate producer Barry Callebaut is promoting its new ruby chocolate at the trade show. Introduced last September, it is the fourth type of chocolate after milk, dark and white. Made from the ruby cocoa bean, the pink chocolate has a ""berry-fruitness and luscious smoothness,"" the Swiss firm said in a press release.Candy sales in the U.S. are expected to reach $25.3 billion in 2018, up from $24.9 billion in 2017, marketing and consulting firm IRI said at the show.Snack sales are seen hitting $42.5 billion in 2018, up from $41.1 billion in 2017.""Consumers are still snacking,"" said Sally Lyons-Wyatt, executive vice president at IRI. ""On average consumers are snacking over 2.5 times a day. Younger consumers actually snack more than that.""Top growing categories in snacks include protein, fiber and energy snacks, she said. Consumers are also shifting more to crisps not made from potato or corn, she said. Consumers enjoy variety and are trying chips made from chickpeas, lentils, quinoa and other ingredients.Food companies are targeting millennials by offering products in smaller portion sizes suitable for snacking.""It seems like almost anything can be a snack right now,"" Edward Jones' Weissman said. ""You change the portion size and suddenly it's a snack. Everybody is focused on snacks. Yogurt went from breakfast to a snack. It's a much more crowded marketplace.""RELATED:Amazon Widens Its Influence Even More And Takes A Bite Out Of SnacksCampbell, Hershey, Humana Lead Frenzy Of Year-End M&A Activity

1,MDLZ,"Another chief executive fell victim to the slump in the U.S. packaged-food industry.Campbell Soup (CPB) CEO Denise Morrison, 64, abruptly stepped down Friday after a lackluster seven-year tenure at the helm of the company. She tried — and never managed — to move beyond canned soup to ignite sales growth as Americans change how they eat and shop. The shares plunged the most in almost two decades.""They've had a rough go of it,"" said Michael Halen, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. ""The move into the fresh business has been problematic — they've had a lot of things that didn't work.""Morrison will be replaced on an interim basis by Keith McLoughlin, a 61-year-old former CEO at Electrolux who has been a board member since 2016, Campbell said. The Camden, New Jersey-based company didn't say who will permanently succeed her, but last month promoted industry veteran Luca Mignini to chief operations officer.Whoever replaces Morrison will face the same challenges that have claimed the leaders of other Big Food companies like Kellogg (K) and Mondelez International (MDLZ). The stock, down 38% in the past two years, plunged an additional 11% to 34.94 on Friday as Campbell also gave a bleak full-year forecast. Campbell is suffering its biggest intraday loss since January 1999.Morrison, who has been with Campbell for 15 years, took over in 2011 and less than a year later Campbell agreed to buy Bolthouse Farms, a maker of fresh juice and salad dressing that also operated a carrot-farming business. The deal was seen as a way to push the canned soup company into fresher and more natural products, which are on trend with modern consumers. But the merger has been hampered by operational issues and a recall that battered results. Campbell has since been mired in a three-year sales slump.The stock said it will start a strategic review of its businesses, which will ""take several months to complete."" It plans to update investors on the outcome when it reports fourth-quarter results in late August.Campbell has been seeking other sources of growth as it grapples with the soup slowdown. In December, the company agreed to buy Snyder's-Lance in a bid to push deeper into salty snacks — a bright spot in the struggling packaged-food industry. That deal gives Campbell, which makes Goldfish crackers, brands such as Cape Cod potato chips and Snyder's pretzels.The recently promoted COO, Mignini, 55, joined Campbell in 2013. He had been running the snacks unit, and is now overseeing Campbell's soup business in addition to managing the expanded portfolio of snacks.

2,MDLZ,"Shares of General Mills (GIS) sank Wednesday after the Cheerios and Yoplait maker delivered mixed results and lowered its growth outlook citing significant cost headwinds.General Mills' dive spread contagion through the packaged food sector, taking down shares of Kellogg (K), Kraft Heinz (KHC), Campbell Soup (CPB), J.M. Smucker Co. (SJM), ConAgra (CAG) and Mondelez (MDLZ). Kraft Heinz and Campbell Soup hit the sector last month on their weak quarterly reports.Shares of General Mills plunged 8.85% to 45.51 on the stock market today, hitting their lowest level in nearly five years. General Mills is by far the worst-performing stock on the S&P 500 index.They have tumbled since their Jan. 25 high of 60.69. Kellogg crashed 4%. Kraft Heinz lost 1.9%, hitting its worst levels since August 2015, while Campbell Soup sank 2.2%, reaching a 4-year low. Mondelez slid 0.8% and J.M. Smucker retreated 4.2%.Kellogg, J.M. Smucker, Campbell Soup and ConAgra all were among the S&P 500 index's worst-performers.The Minneapolis-based company reported adjusted quarterly profit grew 10% to 79 cents per share, meeting the Zacks Investment Research consensus estimate. Revenue ticked up 2% to $3.88 billion, just short of views for $3.89 billion. Organic net sales — stripping out the effect of currency movements, acquisitions and divestitures — were up 1%.Cost pressures are impacting the full-year outlook, said General Mills Chairman and CEO Jeff Harmening. General Mills cut its adjusted earnings growth forecast to flat to up 1% from up 3% to 4% earlier.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of Use""Like the broader industry, we're seeing sharp increases in input costs, including inflation in freight and commodities,"" Harmening added. ""Because of our improved volume performance, we're also incurring higher operational costs.""Net sales for the North America retail segment rose 1% to $2.52 billion, thanks in large part to Canada. Yogurt and cereal sales fell in the U.S.Sales in the convenience stores and food service segment rose 3% to $460 million, driven by growth in frozen meals, cereal, and snacks.Europe and Australia sales grew 11% to $470 million, benefiting from favorable currency moves. Organic net sales slipped 1%.Asia and Latin America sales increased 3% to $435 million, also helped by foreign currency exchange. Organic net sales matched year-ago levels.  Asia markets saw higher sales, offsetting lower net sales across Latin America.General Mills said Wednesday its previously announced $8 billion acquisition of natural pet food brand Blue Buffalo Pet Products (BUFF) is expected to close before the end of fiscal 2018. Natural, wholesome and premium fare is in demand in pet food, as in human food, according to General Mills.Packaged food is under strain as private-label house brands as well as organic and natural offerings displace mainstream products on grocery shelves at the likes of Walmart (WMT) and Kroger (KR) and Amazon (AMZN)-owned Whole Foods.Walmart is General Mills' biggest customer, accounting for some 20% of sales.Packaged food companies have responded with cost cuts, including on marketing, to preserve profit margins, but that strategy is running out of steam. Kraft Heinz's latest results show the cost-cutting strategy is running out of steam.Blue Buffalo shares edged 0.3% lower Wednesday. Walmart rose 0.3%, Amazon dipped 0.3%. and Kroger added 0.2%.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Forget Facebook: Why These 5 Chip Stocks Are Stock Market Bullish; S&P 500, Dow Jones Futures Await Fed Rate HikeThe Big Picture: Stock Bounce Leaves Much To Be DesiredNo. 1-Ranked IPO Stock Breaks Out, Expects Big Q1 Earnings GrowthThese 5 Top Stocks Stood Out MondayThese 3 China Nets Are Flashing This Bullish Signal; This 1 Has Earnings Due'China's Amazon' JD.com Has These Futuristic Projects In The Works

3,MDLZ,"Dr Pepper Snapple (DPS) skyrocketed Monday after the soft-drinks company agreed to a merger with privately held K-Cup maker Keurig Green Mountain,. Dr Pepper shareholders will get $103.75 a share cash plus hold 13% of the combined Keurig Dr Pepper.X Shares of Dr Pepper Snapple vaulted 22% to 117.07 on the stock market today. after rising as high as 126.65 intraday.Keurig Green Mountain was bought out by private equity firm JAB Holding in March 2016. JAB owns Panera Bread, Peet's Coffee, Krispy Kreme Doughnuts, Caribou Coffee and more.Keurig Dr Pepper would have combined 2017 annual revenues of approximately $11 billion, bringing together brands Dr Pepper, 7UP, Snapple, A&W, Mott's and Sunkist with the maker of Keurig single-serve coffee machines and K-cup pods.

5,MDLZ,"Snack and beverage giant PepsiCo (PEP) reported second-quarter earnings on Tuesday that topped analyst forecasts. So did sales growth.X Estimates: Earnings per share of $1.39, a 3% increase, as revenue advanced a percentage point higher to $15.59 billion, according to analysts tracked by Zacks Investment Research.Results: Pepsi earned $1.50 a share, including 6 cents from a one-time Britvic sale. That's an 11% gain. Revenue climbed 2% to $15.71 billion. Organic revenue, which includes currency swings and structural changes, advanced 3.1%. Organic volume rose 2% for snacks and other food but fell 2% for beverages.Outlook: Pepsi sees 2017 adjusted earnings of $5.13 a share. Analysts expect $5.12, according to Zacks.Pepsi sees foreign exchange cutting full-year core profit by 2 percentage points vs. its prior estimate of 3 percentage points. The dollar weakened at the end of Q2. The weakening dollar likely will be a notable factor in multinationals' results and guidance during the current earnings season.Shares fell 0.5% to 113.69 in the stock market today. The stock on Monday pierced through support at its 50-day line in heavy volume.PepsiCo, whose brands include its namesake soft drink as well as Mountain Dew, Tropicana, Doritos and Quaker, has tried to offer more ""guilt free"" products to an increasingly wellness-focused population with a deepening distaste for soda.More than 45% of the company's net revenue comes from those products, the company said during its first-quarter earnings call in April. Meanwhile, U.S. soda sales more broadly have fallen for 12 straight years, according to Beverage Digest, an industry trade publication.PepsiCo has introduced healthier, non-carbonated drinks, tested natural sweeteners in sodas, tried out new frying methods to cut fat in potato chips, and offered up healthier, grain-based snacks, Zacks notes. Emerging markets abroad, where consumption is still low, and a growing middle class in some nations could also drive growth and help demand, Zacks said.But turmoil and currency swings internationally risk cutting into sales figures. Pepsi has tightened up its pricing, which can help protect revenue and make up for weaker volumes. But that tactic's durability could become a bigger issue over time.Volumes in the company's large Frito-Lay North America division fell 1.5% in the first quarter. That marked the first decline in some five years, Jefferies analyst Kevin Grundy said in a report, according to Bloomberg. Management said in April that the dip was temporary and partly a product of shifts in holidays, and that volume had begun to rebound.But Amazon (AMZN) looms over consumer products too. The Amazon-Whole Foods Market (WFM) deal raises the prospect of more private-label goods vs. branded packaged consumer products from the likes of General Mills (GIS), Mondelez (MDLZ) and Pepsi's Frito-Lay. Packaged goods firms are cutting market spending, Marketwatch reported, citing James Cakmak, an analyst at Monness, Crespi, Hardt to support profits. Cakmak wrote in a Monday note that the cuts are in part reflect less of an emphasis of fighting for shelf space in the age of Amazon and other e-commerce options such as Jet.com and Walmart.com from Wal-Mart (WMT). But cutting ads and marketing may only spur the push to commoditize packaged goods, reducing margins further.Coca-Cola (KO) dipped 0.1%. Coca-Cola fell below its 50-day line last week.Monster Beverage (MNST) slid 0.1%. Monster Beverage recently found 50-day support after a failed late June breakout. Dr Pepper Snapple (DPS) rose 0.2%.National Beverage (FIZZ) edged down 0.2%. National Beverage, fueled by its Lacroix sparking water, shot up nearly 7% to 103.28 on Monday, now extended from Friday's breakout from a 96.15 buy point of a flat base.RELATED:Is This Unique Soda Maker Set To Pop Its Top, Or Fizzle?Thirsty Investors Drive Coca-Cola Shares Higher As Buy Point FormsNot Your Father's PepsiCo: Company Expands Into Healthy Fare

6,MDLZ,"Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi met with top executives from Apple (AAPL), Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google, Amazon (AMZN) and others in the tech, banking and consumer industries  on Sunday, ahead of his meeting with President Trump on Monday.Apple CEO Tim Cook, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, and Adobe CEO Shantanu Narayan attended a round table Sunday, along with Mondelez (MDLZ) CEO Irene Rosenfeld, Mastercard (MA) CEO Ajay Bhanga, JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon,  David Rubenstein from the Carlyle Group and David Yergin from IHS Markit.The executives reportedly told Modi that India's tough business climate and bureaucracy make it hard to operate there, but Cook and Dimon said afterwards the meeting was  positive and productive.Wal-Mart (WMT) CEO Doug McMilon asked for a private meeting with Modi after the group meeting as the company looks to expand operations in India, according to a CNBC report,The big-box retailer has had trouble navigating India's regulatory system and in 2013 dissolved its joint venture, Bharti Wal-Mart, over corruption charges and other issues.Apple shares were up 0.1% at 146.39 in afternoon trading on the stock market today.

The deal would still need approval from Congress.Last week, Lockheed Martin (LMT) agreed to send its Texas-based F-16 production to India, if it secures a major fighter deal from New Delhi.Other possible defense deals between the U.S. and India could include Lockheed's C-130J and Boeing's (BA) P-8 maritime surveillance aircraft.Another topic on the table is the H-1B visa program, which Trump has put under review as part of his ""hire American buy American"" initiative. Without the visa, Indian IT workers would be shut out from working in Silicon Valley.Modi reportedly will highlight the jobs created by Indian-Americans and could use Infosys (INFY), an Indian IT company that pledged to hire 10,000 Americans, as an example a two-way street of investment in hiring between the U.S. and India.RELATED: Amazon's Reentry Into Smartphones Signals Battle For India E-Commerce

13,MDLZ,"Emmanuel Faber's first big move as Danone's chief, the $10 billion takeover of WhiteWave Foods (WWAV), is a foray into soy milk, protein shakes and kale aimed at kickstarting growth at the French yogurt maker grappling with a drop in dairy consumption.The Paris-based producer of Actimel drinks and Evian bottled water agreed to buy the U.S. company for $56.25 a share in cash, acquiring leadership in the burgeoning natural and organic food sector through its biggest acquisition in almost a decade.After spending his first year trying to revive sluggish sales in Danone's core European dairy segment, Faber is now expanding his portfolio to include a broad range of faster-growing, higher-margin items like the Silk brand soy beverage, cashew milk and soy yogurts that cater to more affluent and health-conscious consumers. The agreement is a victory for Douglas L. Braunstein and James C. Woolery, former JPMorgan Chase (JPM) bankers, who prodded WhiteWave to consider a sale through their investment fund.""The purchase will allow us to double the size of our U.S. business and become the world leader in organic,"" Faber, who joined Danone in 1997 and became CEO in October 2014, said on a conference call with journalists.WhiteWave soared 19.8% to $56.80 in trading before U.S. exchanges opened on the stock market today. Danone jumped 3.9% to 65.76 euros at 1 p.m. in Paris.IBD'S TAKE: WhiteWave shares were breaking out of an 11-month base before the Danone takeover bid. But it's only rated No. 4 in its industry group. Find out who the leaders are in the IBD Stock Checkup.The acquisition would make Danone the global leader in fresh dairy and health-food brands including Horizon milk, Wallaby Organic yogurt and Earthbound Farm packaged salads as consumers increasingly shun processed foods perceived as unhealthy. The deal is the second potential takeover in the food industry in recent weeks, following the Mondelez International (MDLZ) advance towards Hershey (HSY), which the chocolate maker snubbed. Both of those deals aim to beef up the acquirer's presence in the U.S.In recent years, dairy milk's reputation as nature's perfect food has suffered as consumers question its nutritional merits as well as the environmental costs and treatment of animals housed at big industrial farms. The U.S. organic-food market expanded 11% in 2015 to $43 billion, while the overall food industry grew 3.3%, according to the Organic Trade Association.Unit sales in Danone's fresh-dairy business have fallen for two years straight, weighed down by a slump in Brazil and declining demand in Russia and Europe.""The key question to our mind is the real strength of the WhiteWave brands,"" wrote Jeff Stent, an analyst at Exane BNP Paribas. ""To what extent has WhiteWave's success been less about the brands and more about first-mover advantage in a high-growth category. Time will tell.""Denver-based WhiteWave began trading in 2012 after U.S. dairy company Dean Foods (DF) spun off the unit, which was its most profitable business. Investors have speculated since then that the company would become an acquisition target.Sales at  WhiteWave will increase about 11% this year, based on the average of analyst estimates, after doubling since 2010 on rising demand for more healthful beverages and food, data compiled by Bloomberg show. North America accounted for 86% of the company's $3.9 billion in revenue last year, with Europe contributing the rest.Growth like that doesn't come cheap -- Danone is paying about 26.2 times earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization for WhiteWave, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That's well above the median multiple of 14.8 times earnings paid by buyers in acquisitions of dairy companies over the past five years, the data show.The WhiteWave purchase, to be funded through debt, will boost results in the first year after closing, the maker of Activia yogurt said. Danone expects a $300 million boost to operating profit by 2020.Danone, which makes Oikos Greek-style yogurt, is targeting sales growth of more than 5% by 2020, with half of its business keying in on consumers seeking healthy-eating alternatives. North American sales will be 22% of Danone's total revenue after the purchase, compared with 12% now.The purchase values WhiteWave at $12.5 billion including net debt and other liabilities. The companies expect to complete the deal this year. Lazard Ltd. advised Danone, while Goldman Sachs Group Inc. advised WhiteWave.Braunstein and Woolery announced in February that their firm, Hudson Executive Capital LP, had bought shares in six companies, including WhiteWave, with an eye to nudging them to take steps that would boost their stock prices. The investors said they wouldn't pursue proxy fights or publicly berate companies, preferring ""constructive engagement.""
"
14,MDLZ,"In the background of another epic bounce for U.S. stocks was the bull market's oldest friend: buybacks.American companies announced $52 billion of repurchases last week alone, following the Federal Reserve's approval of capital plans for 33 financial firms, according to data compiled by Birinyi Associates. That pushed total buybacks in June to more than $65 billion, the most since February.The cascade of announcements came as the S&P 500 Index was erasing a loss that swelled to more than 5% after the U.K. voted to exit the European Union.The Fed's vote of confidence in the ability of U.S. banks to withstand a severe economic shock cleared the way for large firms from Morgan Stanley (MS) to Bank of America (BAC) to outline planned share repurchases last week. Buybacks have been a primary source of buoyancy for the second-longest bull market in history -- a pillar of strength that the Fed has been happy to fuel with dovish monetary policy.""It was helpful to the market in the wake of Brexit that all those announcements came last week,"" said John Carey, a Boston-based fund manager at Pioneer Investment Management, which oversees about $230 billion. ""The central bank has signaled that they'll do what they can to support markets by continuing to supply cheap credit and bond-purchasing activity.""Resurgent buybacks may help ease or even erase a falloff earlier in the year. Through the first four months of 2016, announced repurchases were down 38% from a year ago.The S&P 500 slipped 3.6% on June 24, the first day of trading after the U.K. voted to leave the EU. That Friday loss marked its biggest daily decline since August. The benchmark index fell another 1.8% the following Monday before reversing course and rising in four straight sessions to end the week. The gauge's 5.1% increase over the period got it back within 0.5% of where it was before the Brexit referendum.Financial shares had the most at stake in the Fed's stress tests, and when the central bank gave the all-clear last Wednesday, they surged on the news. An index of financial stocks in the S&P 500 climbed 3.9% across the following two days.IBD's Take: Shares of JPMorgan, Bank of America, Citigroup, Wells Fargo, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are all trading below their 50-day and 200-day moving averages.  All have reported declining earnings in some recent quarters as sluggish economic growth and flat yield curves weigh on results.JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) announced $10.6 billion in buybacks, the most out of any financial firm last week, according to Birinyi Associates data. Citigroup (C) authorized $8.6 billion in repurchases, while Bank of America and Morgan Stanley said they'll buy back more than $3.5 billion each.The U.S. stock recovery last week also received a boost from investors closing bearish options bets they'd made heading into the Brexit decision. Short sales had reached the highest since the financial crisis amid the uncertainty leading up to the referendum. The S&P 500 also got a lift from deal activity, as Mondelez International (MDLZ) bid $23 billion for Hershey (HSY) on Thursday.Still, U.S. stocks are going to need alternative sources of strength going forward, like improved growth for both profits and the overall economy, according to Carey. The S&P 500 is expected to see earnings contraction of 5.4% for the second quarter, according to a survey conducted by Bloomberg.""We're seeing some steps that could prop up the U.S. market in the near-term,"" said Carey. ""At some point we're going to need economic growth and improving earnings to keep the market going higher.""

The Nasdaq remains about midway between its 50- and 200-day lines, but both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq are tinkering with their fifth straight weekly gains.Initial jobless claims edged up to 265,000 in the week ended March 12 vs. the 258,000 claims the Labor Department reported in the prior week. That was better than the rise to 270,000 claims expected by economist consensus.Mid-Atlantic region manufacturing firmed more than expected in March, lifting the Philadelphia Federal Reserve's Business Outlook Survey to 12.4. That reversed a negative 2.8 reading for February, and clobbered consensus expectations of minus 1.4.At 10 a.m. ET, the Labor Department reports its January Jobs Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, and the Conference Board doles out its Leading Economic Index for February.WTI crude oil futures strengthened above $39 a barrel, following up Wednesday's 6% rebound from losses early in the week. Oil is up a bit more than 1% for the week.Dow stocks were mixed, with decliners slightly ahead of advancing stocks. All the moves held to less than 1%.Nasdaq 100 stocks also held to moves of less than 1%. The exception was Mondelez International (MDLZ), which dropped more than 2% after news reports said hedge fund Pershing Square sold 20 million shares of the Illinois-based snack maker. The move reduced Pershing's stake in the company to 5.6%.Laser maker Rofin-Sinar Technologies (RSTI) flashed 35% higher. Peer Coherent (COHR) agreed to buy the Plymouth, Mich.-based company in a $942 million deal. The companies expect the deal to close in six to nine months and anticipate $30 million in cost savings within 18 to 24 months of the close.FedEx (FDX) rumbled up 8% to head the S&P 500 after reporting a solid fiscal third-quarter beat late Wednesday. The stock technically ended Wednesday 1% below a 146.38 buy point in a valid cup-with-handle base. The base formed within a nine-month consolidation.Caterpillar (CAT) fell hard in premarket trading but recovered by the open. A regulatory filing forecast first-quarter revenue of $9.4 billion or less, below consensus views for $10.3 billion. It forecast adjusted EPS of 70 cents or lower vs. views for 97 cents. The heavy equipment maker maintained its full-year guidance. Shares eased 0.3%.Inside the IBD 50,  Maxlinear (MXL) gave up 1% in early trading. A 6% spike in powerful trade on Wednesday put the Carlsbad, Calif.-based chipmaker 12% past a 16.29 buy point. But 17.85 is also a legitimate buy point.Overseas markets played catch-up to Wednesday's Fed announcement, made after most markets were closed. Benchmark indexes in Shanghai and Hong Kong rose more than 1%. Tokyo's Nikkei 225 in Japan dipped 0.2%. Eurozone exchanges in Frankfurt and Paris were under pressure, with the CAC 40 in Paris and the DAX in Frankfurt off nearly 2% each near midday. Outside the eurozone, London's FTSE 100 traded down 0.3%.Image provided by Shutterstock.

The idea is not completely far-fetched, but one thing seems clear: If it happens, most of the new jobs will go to robots.Even in lower-cost China, Foxconn, which assembles the iPhone there, reportedly replaced 60,000 workers with robots at one facility. That's more than half the facility's workforce. Foxconn says it is adding 10,000 ""Foxbots"" per year.China has seen its cost advantage wither away due to wage gains. It's investing more than $3 billion a year in robots — up from next to nothing before 2009 — to keep from losing its manufacturing base to lower-cost developing nations, Bernstein analysts Michael Parker and Alberto Moel wrote in a December report.Trump has vowed to rewrite or walk away from trade deals and cut corporate tax rates to level the playing field for U.S. companies. He told Congress on Feb. 28 that he'll ""bring back millions of jobs.""Although economists concur that North American Free Trade Agreement and China's admission to the World Trade Organization have taken a toll on U.S. manufacturing jobs, Trump's battle plan seems geared to fight the last war.If China must shrink its costs with a massive deployment of robots, U.S.-based manufacturers that pay much higher wages and benefits will face the same pressures.A 2015 study by Boston Consulting Group found that an automotive industry welder earned about $25 an hour, including benefits, while a robot could do the job for $8 an hour, including installation, maintenance and operating costs. The gap is expected to widen sharply as technology improves.""It is still possible to force the relocation of production"" by restricting trade via tariffs or applying political pressure, wrote Bernstein's Parker and Moel. ""However, if the point of the exercise is to restore well-paying, middle-class jobs in manufacturing in the process, the result is going to disappoint. Mandating a physical task be carried out in a high-cost labor market in 2017 is simply going to increase the chances the task is automated.""Trump relentlessly bashed air conditioning company Carrier during the campaign for its plan to close an Indiana factory and move the work to Mexico. He intervened in December, saving about 800 jobs — for now. But Carrier's parent, United Technologies (UTX), which is getting $7 million in tax incentives from Indiana to stay, said it would invest $16 million to automate the factory ""to drive the cost down.""Like Apple, United Technologies is a member of Dow Jones industrial average.United Technologies CEO Greg Hayes told CNBC that while moving to Mexico would have been cheaper, the company will ""make that plant competitive just because we'll make the capital investments there, but what that ultimately means is there will be fewer jobs.""Mondelez (MDLZ), the maker of Oreos, was another regular Trump campaign target for its decision to cut 600 jobs from a Chicago factory and move the work to Mexico. The company said it considered installing new production lines at its Chicago Nabisco plant but chose to do the work in Salinas, Mexico, because of a $46 million cost differential. Mondelez noted that even if the project had gone forward in Chicago, half the jobs would have been eliminated because of new labor-saving technology.IBD'S TAKE: Since taking office, President Trump has talked less about the sticks he'll use against U.S. trading partners and more about the carrots he'll offer to manufacture in the U.S. via tax reform. But, for now, Trump's economic agenda and his tax cuts for business are stuck in line behind the ObamaCare repeal effort.The food and beverage industry is expected to be among the bigger adopters of industrial robots in coming years, says Boston Consulting Group, with automakers and electronics firms continuing to lead the way. Metals and machinery, rubber and plastics, and pharmaceuticals and cosmetics are also seen ramping up robot use. A 2016 McKinsey & Co. study concluded that 59% of manufacturing activities could be automated.Foxconn said in January that it's mulling a $7 billion highly automated factory for making displays, including flat-panel TVs and monitors, in the U.S. in partnership with Apple. Transportation costs for ever-larger displays, which aren't shipped by plane like the iPhone, are a driving force behind the plan. Foxconn Chairman Terry Gou said March 1 that such plans are on hold as the company waits to see what bills are passed and what incentives are offered.Pegatron, another Apple contract manufacturer that does assembly for Dell and HP Inc. (HPQ) out of plants in California and Indiana, reportedly said after Trump's election that it could expand its U.S. capacity fourfold, relying on automation and with a minimal increase in labor. The tech industry began formulating its response last year in the event that Trump was elected and turned out to be serious about imposing 35% tariffs on imports from China.Trump hasn't threatened such hefty tariffs in recent weeks. The focus has shifted to House Republicans' plan to slash the corporate tax rate to 20% and make export revenues tax-free. The 20% rate would apply to the full value of imports, raising $1 trillion over a decade that would effectively pay for the corporate tax cut. Still, economists who back the idea say that the dollar would rise 25%, offsetting any trade advantage. Major importers like Wal-Mart (WMT) hate the idea and trade experts warn that the WTO would likely find the import tax to be illegal.Some companies haven't needed new tax deals or threats to open factories in the U.S., but automation is key to their strategies.Adidas is a prime example. The maker of athletic shoes, which has long done its labor-intensive manufacturing out of China, Indonesia and Vietnam, last year piloted what it's calling a Speedfactory in Germany, making shoes almost entirely by robots. This year, the second Adidas Speedfactory is slated to open in Atlanta, where it's expected to employ 160 people facilitating the production of a half-million shoes.The high-tech operation, Adidas says, won't just eliminate the drudgery in manufacturing (along with a lot of the workers). It also will enable the company ""to make product for the consumer, with the consumer, where the consumer lives in real time, unleashing unparalleled creativity and endless opportunities for customization.""Meanwhile, Nike (NKE), another Dow industrials component, and Under Armour (UAA) are both developing strategies for manufacturing in the U.S., close to their customers. It's a safe bet that robots will be doing most of the work.The implications for workers are clear, says Boston Consulting Group. ""As U.S. factories adopt advanced manufacturing technologies, demand will surge for higher-skilled, white-collar workers who can quickly adapt to new technologies and processes, and demand will lessen for blue-collar workers who are trained in specific skills.""Despite his vow to bring back millions of jobs, Trump isn't oblivious to the job threat posed by robots. In a postelection interview, the New York Times asked Trump whether he was worried that companies will keep their factories in the U.S. but automate their workers out of jobs.""They will, and we'll make the robots too,"" Trump said. He added: ""Right now we don't make the robots. We don't make anything. But we're going to. I mean, look, robotics is becoming very big and we're going to do that.""Trump is more right than wrong about the U.S. ceding an opportunity, writes Frank Tobe, publisher of the Robot Report. ""Two-thirds of the robotics industry and 100% of industrial robots are manufactured outside of the U.S. by non-U.S. companies.""China's leadership has fully embraced the adoption of robots as part of its ""Made in China 2025"" strategy. The plan reflects not only wage pressures but demographics, as its working-age population shrinks. Whether the U.S. will avoid committing to robots for fear of displacing workers is a real question with serious competitive implications.Academics and industry leaders made the case in ""A Roadmap for U.S. Robotics"" last fall that robots have been a plus for manufacturing jobs. ""Over the last 5-6 years we have seen introduction of 600,000 new jobs in manufacturing. During the same period, we have seen significant growth in adoption of robot systems in industry,"" they wrote.Yet their upbeat predictions come with some uncertainty. The auto industry has been the biggest adopter of robotics, but that's happened as sales rebounded from just 10.4 million in 2009 to a record high 17.5 million in 2016. But if demand has peaked, as industry players suspect, then increasing automation may not be quite so positive for employment in auto manufacturing in the future.RELATED:U.S. Manufacturing Gears Up As 'America First' Trump Takes OfficeThe Top 10 Jobs Robots Could Steal From Humans By 2025Forget The Doomsday Clock, There's Now A Robot Fear IndexThe Trump Economy: Jobs, Regulations, Taxes And Trade

47,MDLZ,"When it comes to long-term performance, less than 60 basis points separates the top five performing international stock mutual funds in the IBD Best Mutual Funds 2017 Awards list in IBD's 2017 survey of the best and brightest active fund managers.But one thing is common: All five mauled the scrawny return of the MSCI EAFE (Europe, Australasia and Far East) equity benchmark.Each award winner beat the benchmark in the last year, the past three, five and 10 years. Award winners were ranked by 10-year average annual returns with the top five earning recognition as the best of the best.The $2 billion Thornburg Global Opportunities I(THOIX) ranked 1st among 438 funds having a 10-year track record, showing an annual average return of 7.95%. That's more than 10 times the 0.75% gain for MSCI EAFE over the same time frame.Matthews Asia Dividend Fund(MAPIX) was 2nd with a 7.60% return, followed by Morgan Stanley Institutional Global Franchise (IMSFAX) at 7.46%, Oppenheimer Global Opportunities Class A(OPGIX) 7.40% and Oakmark Global Select(OAKWX) 7.39%.Four of the top five performers searched the entire globe for good stocks. Just one, Matthews Asia Dividend Investor, focuses on the Asia and Pacific region; in fact, the $5 billion fund must invest at least 80% of total assets in dividend-paying equity securities of companies located in Asia.Why has Thornburg done well?Contrary to its name, the fund actually takes a larger stake in U.S. companies than you might think. Historically, American companies have made up 30% to 50% of the entire portfolio. Emerging markets have taken up just 5% to 20%.As of Jan. 31, indeed, the U.S. comprised 45.1% of the entire fund. Netherlands was 2nd at 14%, followed by the U.K. at 9.1%, China 8.1%, Spain 7.6% and Ireland 5.5%. All other countries make up less than 3% of the portfolio.The fund prefers to concentrate its holdings in 30 to 40 positions. The typical global fund has more than three times as many. ""We know what we own, and why own it"" is one of the fund's mantras.So is finding value.Look at the top 10 holdings and the active equity investor will recognize plenty of names. At the top is integrated Level 3 Communications (LVLT), followed by wireless telecom play T-Mobile USA (TMUS). Candy, chocolate and cheese maker Mondelez (MDLZ), Chinese internet search giant Baidu (BIDU) and global banking franchise Citigroup (C) also make up part of the top 10.""We are global value investors,"" says Vinson Walden, according to Thornburg.com. ""We use a value-based research process to identify quality businesses at attractive prices around the world.""Broomfield, Colo.-based Level 3 sells network access to telecom providers. At about 57, shares trade a hefty 28 times fiscal year 2016 earnings. However, Level 3's peak P-E ratio over the past five years is 70.Baidu, one of the hottest Chinese ADRs in the U.S. following the market bottom in 2009, also does not seem cheap. At 173, the stock trades 30 times its FY 2016 earnings of $5.66 a share. However, Wall Street sees earnings rising to $7.54 a share by 2018 after a slight dip in 2017.Like Thornburg Global Opportunities, the $4.1 billion Oppenheimer Global Opportunities carries a heavy weighting on the U.S., which makes up 47.6% of the entire fund as of Jan. 31. Next is the U.K. at 12.6%. But Oppenheimer differs from Thornburg in its next three largest weightings: Denmark at 8.5%, Germany 8.5% and Japan 6.0%.One major Oppenheimer holding that hails from Denmark is the biotech Genmab, the fourth-largest holding in the fund with a 2.9% weighting as of Jan. 31. Genmab develops therapies for cancer and other diseases including multiple sclerosis.According to the global equities database of William O'Neil + Co., Genmab turned profitable in 2012, earning 2.20 Danish krone per share. Earnings have risen every year since then and are up nearly 10-fold to 19.83 krone a share in 2016.The stock broke out of a long cup with handle base at 257.10 krone in the final week of October in 2014. Genmab rose 15 weeks in a row before cooling off and forming a new cup-with-handle pattern from July to October 2015. Genmab eventually broke out again and is now near 1,443.Other top holdings in the Oppenheimer fund include U.S.-based Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) at a 5.2% weighting, laser and precision optical device maker Coherent (COHR) at 3.6% and semiconductor manufacturing equipment titan Applied Materials (AMAT) at 1.7%.Meanwhile, the $2.2 billion Oakmark Global Select fund has juiced its returns partly due to some timely and big bets on the banks and other financial institutions. Bank of America (BAC) is the biggest investment, taking up 6.8% of the fund's assets as of Dec. 31, 2016.Credit Suisse (CS) is also a hefty holding at 5.8%, followed by the insurance giant American International Group (AIG) at 5.5% and Citigroup (C) at 5.1%. Together, those four stocks make up nearly a quarter of the fund.Switzerland-based Credit Suisse and New York-based Citi clearly have operations around the world and are known as a banker to corporations and large institutions as well as high net worth individuals. But Citi is also a play on the rising middle class across many emerging market economies. According to its Q4 2016 report, Citigroup posted $3.36 billion in adjusted revenue from Asia, $2.65 billion from the EMEA region (Europe, Middle East, Africa) and $2.23 billion from Latin America. Together, they equaled $8.24 billion, or 50% of total adjusted revenue of $16.36 billion.RELATED:Top Global Mutual Funds: Why India Mattered In The 2016 Big WinnersHow To Invest: Top Global Stocks Trading In The U.S. TodayHow To Trade Index ETFs: Making Money With IBD's Results-Proven Stock Market Timing Mechanism

48,MDLZ,"After rebuffing Kraft Heinz's (KHC) advances last week, making headlines, Unilever (UN) said it is conducting a ""comprehensive review of options available to accelerate delivery of value for the benefit of our shareholders.""""The events of the last week have highlighted the need to capture more quickly the value we see in Unilever,"" said the statement. ""We expect the review to be completed by early April, after which we will communicate further.""Unilever shares rose 3.7% to 46.75 at the close on the stock market today. It tumbled 7.6% on Tuesday, but lost only half of Friday's Kraft-fueled gain. The company, whose broad consumer products portfolio includes Axe, Dove and Lipton and others brands, also trades as Unilever PLC (UL).Kraft Heinz shares retreated 1.6% to 93.36 at the close.The major food conglomerate said Friday that it had pitched a $50-a-share takeover offer worth $143 billion, which Unilever had rejected. By Sunday, the ketchup and Kool-Aid maker said it had ""amicably"" given up its pursuit.IBD'S TAKE: Food-stock chatter abounds. Get caught up on what's happening in the space.Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB), a major shareholder in Kraft Heinz along with cost-cutting specialist 3G Capital, is known to prefer ""friendly"" acquisitions.Berkshire Hathaway edged up 0.4% to 169.61.Meanwhile, Colgate (CL) shares were up 0.4% to 73.49 at the close. The stock had risen 6% in the prior two sessions as the consumer products firm has been tossed about as a potential new target for Kraft Heinz or even Unilever.Mondelez International (MDLZ) fell 0.7% to 44.65.

49,MDLZ,"While merger discussions roil the food industry, Mondelez International (MDLZ) is doing its best to increase sales on its own.The company is introducing a new line of crackers and snack bars made without artificial ingredients and GMOs, and it's revamping some of its existing products to better appeal to millennials. The rollout is Mondelez's biggest since it was created by splitting with Kraft Foods in 2012.The maker of Oreo cookies and Triscuits, which has posted declining sales the past three years, is renovating its portfolio as consumers increasingly demand less-processed snacks. The new products, called Vea, were developed in-house by a ""startup"" team — a sign the food giant is trying to be more entrepreneurial.Vea arrives as traditional packaged-food companies have been gobbling up upstart brands in response to the changing tastes, and as Kraft Heinz's (KHC) freshly abandoned courtship of Unilever (UL) (UN) raises the prospect of bigger realignments in the industry.IBD'S TAKE: Mondelez shares rose sharply Tuesday, retaking their 50-day line on revived hopes that Kraft or another company might make a takeover bid. Mondelez has generated profit growth even as revenue falls, much like Kraft and some of its peers. How long can the snacks giant rely on cost cuts and other margin-boosting moves without topline growth?Tim Cofer, Mondelez's chief growth officer, said the Deerfield, Ill.-based company considered making an acquisition but ultimately decided to develop the new food line itself.""There was nothing out there that hit this space as well as what we developed,"" he said. Shares ended the day up nearly 6% to 44.97.The Vea products are slated to reach shelves across the U.S. in July, and they will eventually be expanded to overseas markets — where the company generates most of its revenue. Mondelez also is removing genetically modified organisms from Triscuits and will tout that the crackers are made from just three ingredients.Mondelez's profit margins have lagged behind competitors, and the company is under activist pressure to improve its performance. Chief Executive Irene Rosenfeld has been cutting costs to boost results, but the strong dollar has battered the company, which generates more than 70% of its sales outside North America.Last year, Mondelez made a failed bid for Hershey (HSY), an attempt to crack the U.S. chocolate market. The merger approach was also seen as a defensive move: By bulking up, Mondelez would be less of a takeover target itself.Kraft Heinz, which was formed when Kraft Foods merged with Heinz in 2015, made a $143 billion takeover bid for Unilever last week, but formally pulled the offer after it was rejected. Mondelez has been seen as a possible target of Kraft Heinz as well.Ultimately, companies have to figure out a way to increase sales if they want to keep investors happy, said Asit Sharma, an analyst at the Motley Fool.""Investors understand that cost-cutting and productivity initiatives have a limited shelf-life in boosting earnings,"" he said. ""Sooner or later, revenue growth will be top of mind for investors.""RELATED:Kraft Heinz, Unilever Fall After Bid Nixed, But Deal Buzz Continues

50,MDLZ,"Shares of Kraft Heinz (KHC) fell nearly 2% Tuesday afternoon after the food giant ""amicably agreed to withdraw"" its $143 billion, $50-a-share proposal to merge with consumer goods conglomerate Unilever (UN), but deal buzz continued to support the two giants as well as other food and consumer product makers.""Unilever and Kraft Heinz hold each other in high regard,"" said the Sunday release. ""Kraft Heinz has the utmost respect for the culture, strategy and leadership of Unilever.""The joint statement from Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB)-backed Kraft Heinz and Unilever spurred a 180-degree shift from Friday's market action, in which Kraft Heinz's stock spiked 10.7% on public confirmation of the bid. Friday's statement from Kraft Heinz had also indicated that it would continue to pursue the parent company of Dove and Vaseline, despite its initial rejection of the offer. Shares ended the day off 1.78 to 94.87.Unilever shares plunged nearly 8% to 45.09 on the stock market today after soaring 15.3% Friday. The company, which trades as both Unilever NV and Unilever PLC (UL) said last week that the proposal ""fundamentally undervalues"" the company and provides no financial or strategic merit for Unilever shareholders.The quick reversal in Kraft Heinz's intentions may stem from Warren Buffett's sentiment toward hostile takeovers. Berkshire Hathaway ""will join only with partners making friendly acquisitions,"" he said in his 2015 annual letter to shareholders. He acknowledged that some hostile bids are ""justified.""""We, though, will leave these 'opportunities' for others,"" he wrote. ""At Berkshire, we go only where we are welcome.""Berkshire Hathaway and 3G engineered the 2015 merger of Kraft and Heinz. Berkshire Class B shares were up fractionally.A Kraft Heinz-Unilever merger would have made for the second-largest food-and-drink company in the world, according to Bloomberg data, bringing together brands such as Oscar Mayer and Planters and Lipton and Hellmann's. The combination of Kraft and Heinz two years ago created the fifth largest.While Kraft and Unilever retreated Tuesday, they kept a good share of Monday's gains on speculation that industry consolidation could still happen.Other consumer goods heavyweights were on the move Tuesday as speculation circulated that Kraft Heinz might have another acquisition target in mind. Colgate Palmolive (CL) was up 1.2%. Clorox (CLX) ticked up 0.9%. Procter & Gamble (PG) edged 0.5%. Kimberly-Clark (KMB) inched up 1.2%.Colgate, Clorox and Kimberly-Clark posted big gains Friday on the initial Kraft-Unilever news. Dow component P&G inched up to a 2-year high Friday after surging earlier in the week on news that activist investor Trian Fund Management had taken a $3.5 billion stake.Meanwhile, Mondelez International (MDLZ) was up 4.9% as it announced an overhaul of its snack line, while General Mills (GIS) added 2.8%. Mondelez shares fell Friday after previously rallying on hopes of a Kraft takeover bid.

51,MDLZ,"Kraft Heinz (KHC) withdrew its $143 billion offer for Unilever (UN) on Sunday, citing the Anglo-Dutch consumer and food products giant's opposition. So which companies may Kraft target next?""Kraft Heinz's interest was made public at an extremely early stage,"" spokesman Michael Mullen said Sunday in an e-mailed statement. ""Our intention was to proceed on a friendly basis, but it was made clear Unilever did not wish to pursue a transaction. It is best to step away early so both companies can focus on their own independent plans to generate value.""Unilever said Friday that the $50-a-share offer undervalued it, with management quietly concerned about Kraft Heinz's cost-cutting culture.Shares of Unilever rose 15.3% to 48.79 in Friday stock market trading. Kraft leapt 10.7% to 96.65. Both set record highs.Snacks giant Mondelez (MDLZ) fell 1.6%, paring earlier losses. Mondelez, maker of Oreos and other Nabisco products, rose 4.4% on Dec. 15 on Kraft buyout buzz.Meanwhile, Colgate Palmolive (CL) popped 4.3%, retaking its 200-day moving average. Clorox (CLX) popped 2.8% to a six-month high, while Kimberly-Clark (KMB) advanced 4.2% to its highest levels since late July. Colgate has a $64 billion market cap, Colgate $17 billion and Kimberly-Clark 47%.Procter & Gamble (PG), which has a $233 billion valuation, edged 0.3% higher on Friday, hitting a fresh two-year high. Procter & Gamble had gapped up 3.7% on Wednesday following the disclosure that activist investor Trian Fund Management snapped up a $3.5 billion stake in the Dow industrials component.It's unclear to what extent investors were snapping up consumer products stocks on takeover speculation, or speculation that industry consolidation generally would boost pricing power broadly.Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) and Brazil's 3G Capital own about 50% of Kraft Heinz stock.

68,MDLZ,"Politicians and policymakers continued to deal with the ramifications of the U.K.'s decision to vote to leave the European Union, but investors shrugged off ""Brexit"" with stocks enjoying solid gains. Big banks such as JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC) and Citigroup (C) hiked payouts after the Federal Reserve OK'd their capital plans in the second round of stress tests. Nike (NKE) ran ahead despite a sales stumble, the finance arm of General Electric (GE) is no longer ""too big too fail."" Tesla Motors (TSLA) faces a regulatory probe while Volkswagen (VLKAY) paid a hefty price to settle an investigation.Stocks started the week as they finished the prior week -- falling sharply in reaction to the Brexit vote. But financial markets roared back, with the S&P 500, Nasdaq and Dow industrials all up more than 3% for the week and above key support levels, helped by Bank of England signals Thursday that it would ease further this summer. Notable breakouts included NetEase (NTES) and Lockheed Martin (LMT).Thirty-one of the 33 biggest banks on Wednesday passed the second round of the Fed's annual stress tests, the industry's equivalent to final exams, clearing their plans to hike buybacks or dividends. The U.S. subsidiaries of Deutsche Bank (DB) and Banco Santander (SAN) were the only ones that failed the second half of the tests, which gauges whether banks' capital and shareholder-return plans would hold up in a downturn and evaluates banks' abilities to assess their own financial planning. The Fed passed Morgan Stanley (MS) on condition that it fix risk-management weaknesses and resubmit its capital plan – the financial forecast that banks submit to the Fed for the tests – by Dec. 29. But Morgan, along with Bank of America, JPMorgan and Citigroup, all announced bulked-up capital-return plans shortly after results were released.Wednesday's results follow the first round of the stress-test results during the prior week. All 33 banks passed that round.JPMorgan rose 2.8%, but failed to end the week above its 200-day line. Morgan Stanley climbed 5.7%. Deutsche Bank slid 5.5%, setting fresh record lows.The finance arm of General Electric is no longer deemed ""systemically important,"" according to the Financial Stability Oversight Council, ending the GE Capital ""too big to fail"" listing. With the ruling, GE will no longer have to follow minimum capital and liquidity requirements outlined in the Dodd-Frank Act. The nonbank Systemically Important Financial Institution (SIFI) label was put on GE Capital in 2013. But since then General Electric has slashed GE Capital assets as it refocuses on its industrial core.GE shares rose 5.6% to 31.49, near a 32.15 buy point.The ISM manufacturing index rose 1.9 points in June to 53.2, its best reading in 15 months. The new orders and production subindexes showed solid gains. The employment measure rose 1.2 points to 50.4, the first positive reading of 2016. The export orders gauge rose to its best level since late 2014. Separately, U.S. automakers reported strong U.S. sales, with most roughly in line with analyst expectations.The June employment report is due July 8, but with the Federal Reserve likely on hold for the foreseeable future, it may not have as great a market impact.The No. 1 sportswear brand topped analysts' profit views by a penny with flat year-over-year Q4 EPS of 49 cents. But sales slightly missed views with a 6% gain to $8.24 billion, the third straight quarter to miss revenue estimates. Currency-neutral global futures orders rose 11%, below estimates. Nike sees high-single-digit reported revenue growth in fiscal 2017. Q1 guidance disappointed. But analysts broadly remain bullish on Nike's long-term story, and management assured on the earnings call that inventory levels were ""clean"" and its basketball business was strong.Nike named Apple (AAPL) CEO Tim Cook as its lead independent director late Thursday. Founder Phil Knight is stepping down as chairman.Nike shares rose 5.7% for the week.Volkswagen agreed to an estimated $14.7 billion in buybacks and fixes for diesel engine models sold in the U.S. after earlier admitting that it had altered software in them to cheat on emissions tests. But the problem is far from resolved. The world's largest automaker still faces multiple lawsuits. And after Volkswagen confirmed the U.S. settlement, Europe's Industry Commissioner Elzbieta Bienkowska called on Volkswagen to offer similar compensation to VW buyers in Europe, Reuters reported. Volkswagen fell 2.6% for the week.Tesla Motors confirmed late Thursday that regulators are probing a fatal crash of a Model S operating in self-driving mode. The news could have negative implications for autonomous driving broadly. But Tesla still rose 2% on Friday and 12.1% for the week, closing just below its 200-day and 50-day moving averages.Mobileye (MBLY), which makes driver-assistance camera systems for Tesla and many others, announced an alliance with BMW and Intel (INTC) on Friday to produce a fully autonomous vehicle by 2021.

Starz Series A stockholders will receive 18 in cash and 0.6784 of a share of Lions Gate nonvoting stock, while Starz Series B common stockholders will receive $7.26 in cash, 0.6321 of a share of Lions Gate voting stock and 0.6321 of a share of Lionsgate nonvoting stock, the companies said. Stifel called the move ""appropriately defensive,"" given the movie industry's volatility, among other factors. The deal brings Lions Gate a rival to Time Warner (TWX) premium channel HBO. Lions Gate fell 3.9% to 19.45, while Starz jumped 3.35% to 29.67.Hershey (HSY): The chocolate giant rejected an unsolicited $107-a-share bid from snacks giant Mondelez (MDLZ), saying it sees no basis for further talks. Hershey still closed up 14.3% to 111.95 on Thursday, suggesting that some investors see a sweeter offer working.Energy Transfer Equity (ETE): The pipeline company terminated its $33 billion merger deal with gas pipeline leader Williams Co. (WMB) after a court ruled, despite an appeal from Williams, that Energy Transfer was contractually entitled to end the agreement. Energy Transfer shares fell 0.2%. Williams, which is seeking monetary damages, fell 3.5%, largely on the surprise news that its chairman and five other board members resigned.In what some view as a defensive play against Wal-Mart (WMT), Amazon.com set July 12 for its second annual deal-loaded Prime Day -- expected to be its biggest shopping day of the year. Last year's Prime Day was the biggest single-day shopping sale in Amazon's history and helped drive Prime memberships, even though many shoppers and analysts said the actual deals weren't that great.Wal-Mart, apparently in a pre-emptive strike against Amazon, announced it was offering a 30-day trial membership of its Prime-comparable ShippingPass, which also offers free two-day shipping. The membership fees are half that of Prime membership.Amazon shares rose 3.8%, Wal-Mart 1.2%.Alcoholic beverage maker Constellation Brands (STZ) reported a 50% per-share earnings bump to $1.55, while revenue rose 15% to $1.87 billion, topping Street views on both the top and bottom lines. Beer sales rose 19%. Wine and spirits sales grew 8%. Shares rose 7.3% for the week, hitting a record high.Late Thursday, Micron Technology (MU) reported $2.89 billion in sales minus items, down 25% year over year, and an 8-cent per-share loss ex items, swinging from a 54-cent gain in the year-earlier quarter. Fiscal Q3 sales missed analysts' forecast for $2.96 billion, but losses topped views for a 9-cent loss.  Micron announced a $300 million cost-cutting plan that includes job cuts.Micron shares tumbled 9.2% on Friday, 5.4% for the week.General Mills' (GIS) fiscal Q4 earnings per share and revenue both beat estimates, and it raised its cost savings estimate to $600 million by 2018, up from $500 million earlier. The maker of Cheerios and Wheaties cereals and other shelf-stable brands has topped earnings estimates in four of the last five quarters. Shares leapt 8.8% for the week to a record high.In contrast, shelf-stable and frozen foods maker ConAgra Foods (CAG) reported lower Q4 EPS that just met views and a worse-than-expected revenue decline. ConAgra affirmed plans to split off its Lamb Weston potato products business this fall, sell parts of its commercial foods business and move its headquarters to Chicago. ConAgra climbed 3.1% for the week, hitting a record high.Acuity Brands (AYI), a highly-rated company that makes smart, connected lighting systems, reported third-quarter results that topped expectations. Acquisitions helped sales, and the company remained optimistic despite any potential impact from the U.K.'s vote to leave the EU. The company has a 97 Composite Rating out of a best-possible 99. Acuity Brands stock rose 1.45% for the week.Paychex: Outsourcing services firm Paychex (PAYX) said Q4 EPS climbed 11% to 49 cents, in line with views. Revenue increased 9% to $753.9 million, beating estimates. The stock popped on the report, trading up 8.8% for the week to 59.44, the best since late 2000. That's also more than 8% past a consolidation buy point at 54.88.

69,MDLZ,"Mondelez International (MDLZ) beat first-quarter estimates amid cost cuts and rising volumes, joining names like Procter & Gamble (PG), Coca-Cola (KO) and big banks that have relied on cuts to improve profit.Excluding items, the maker of Oreo cookies, Ritz crackers and Cadbury chocolates earned 48 cents a share in Q1, up 17% from a year earlier and nine cents better than estimates of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. Including items, Mondelez earned $554 million, or 35 cents a share, compared to Q1 2015's $324 million, or 19 cents a share.Revenue fell 17% to $6.5 billion, beating estimates of $6.4 billion. It was the 10th straight quarter of revenue declines for the company.Volumes rose in North America, Europe and the Asia Pacific region but fell in Latin America and the region of Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Mondelez reaffirmed its full-year guidance.Slowing emerging markets, the strong dollar and consumers shifting their tastes away from sugary food have impacted the company. Activist investors Pershing Square Capital Management and Trian Fund Management also have been pressuring Mondelez to improve its performance.In response, the company has introduced healthier new products, cut costs and sold its coffee businesses. Its gross margin rose to 39.3% from 37.9%, while its operating margin rose to 11.2% from 10.4%.Mondelez says that it expects the dollar to be less of a drag and predicts that it will reduce net revenue growth by around three percentage points, in contrast to its previous estimate of six percentage points.Shares closed up 3.25% on the stock market today, pushing above their 200-day line, which crossed above the 50-day line in February.Other S&P 500 companies have relied on cost cutting in order to improve their bottom lines amid weak global demand and a strong dollar. A stronger dollar makes U.S. goods more expensive in overseas markets.Procter & Gamble said that its Q1 profit rose 28% to $2.75 billion. It has cut thousands of jobs, reduced its marketing budget and sold more than $20 billion of its units, including its Duracell battery business.Coca-Cola has aggressively moved to cut costs by $3 billion over several years, including $600 million in costs in 2016.Big banks such as JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Bank of America (BAC) have moved to cut costs, including eliminating scores of jobs, partly in response to a tough revenue environment and partly due to increasing regulatory costs.Meanwhile, Mondelez Chief Commercial Officer Mark Clouse has joined Pinnacle Foods (PF) and will become its chief executive officer.

70,MDLZ,"It was a busy week for business, economic and investing news. The stock market came under more pressure as Apple (AAPL) reported its first sales decline since 2003, while Facebook (FB) and Amazon (AMZN) turned on the gas. The Federal Reserve signaled it's in no rush to raise rates, while the U.S. economy crawls.The market rally came under more pressure amid a slew of earnings reports and big economic news. The Nasdaq tumbled 2.7% for the week, falling through its 200-day line on Thursday and its 50-day average on Friday, as losers such as Apple, Twitter (TWTR) and First Solar (FSLR) trumped big gains for Facebook and Amazon. The S&P 500 and Dow are well above those support levels, but also tumbled, with all of the losses coming Thursday-Friday. Oil prices continued to march higher, helped by a weaker dollar and further declines in U.S. production. The 10-year Treasury yield gave up much of its recent gains.How healthy are shares of Amazon and Facebook, and how do they compare to rivals? Find out at IBD Stock CheckupThe tech titan certainly wasn't a growth company in its fiscal second quarter, reporting its first revenue decline since 2003 as iPhone unit sales tumbled. Earnings per share fell 18%, worse than expected. And Apple gave weak guidance for the current quarter. Apple hasn't had a huge product since the big-screen iPhone 6, and smartphone sales generally are stagnating. At this point Apple is so huge it will be hard for a new product to really move the needle.In another sign of its shift from rapid growth to a more mature model, Apple added an additional $50 billion to its shareholder return program, with more buybacks and a higher dividend.Meanwhile, activist investor Carl Icahn decided to cash out of Apple stock, and so did others. Apple stock fell 11.3% for the week, nearly settling at its worst close since mid-2014.Apple chip suppliers generally fared relatively well, in part due to diversifying away from Apple or smartphones generally.Apple Investors Worry Glory Days Are OverThe Federal Reserve, as expected, voted to leave interest rates unchanged at its latest policy meeting and gave no hints that it would tighten before the fall at the earliest. The Fed noted that labor markets have strengthened even as economic growth slowed. And that's true, for now. The U.S. economy rose at a 0.5% annual rate in the first quarter, the weakest in two years. Meanwhile, jobless claims are near 42-year lows. If the economy is barely growing, it's hard to see how the U.S. can continue to add 200,000 jobs a month. But that's what analysts are expecting in Friday's April employment report.The Fed's go-slow approach -- coupled with the Bank of Japan's unexpected decision not to increase its stimulus efforts -- pushed the dollar to big losses. That could boost U.S. multinationals' profits and give a further lift to dollar-priced oil and other commodities.The e-commerce giant sees Q2 sales of $28 billion-$30.5 billion, largely above Wall St. views and a 26% gain at the midpoint. While that would mark a slowdown from Q1's 28% pop, the highest in nearly 4 years, it would still be faster than what was typical the past three years. Q1 earnings also crushed estimates, as cloud unit Amazon Web Services remained hot. China's version of Amazon, Alibaba (BABA), reports Thursday.Alphabet (GOOGL) unit Google, Ford Motor (F), Uber, Lyft and Volvo announced Tuesday the formation of a coalition to advocate for self-driving cars. The lobbying effort comes as automakers race to develop autonomous technologies. Alphabet is in late-stage talks with Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) about a partnership regarding autonomous cars, according to multiple reports. Meanwhile, Tesla Motors (TSLA) already has self-driving features in its electric cars, but has not unveiled plans to join the coalition. Tesla will report earnings on Wednesday, with autonomous tech firm Mobileye (MBLY) out Thursday.Social networking kings Facebook and LinkedIn had a good week, as both posted Q1 earnings that topped estimates and sent the stocks higher. Facebook reported its third straight quarter of accelerating earnings and revenue growth. Despite concerns about slowing user engagement, advertisers are definitely using Facebook. Mobile advertising accounted for 82% of Facebook's $5.2 billion in ad revenue, up from 73% in Q1 2015. Facebook stock spiked Thursday to a record high of 120.71, but pulled back to close the week modestly above a 117.09 buy point.LinkedIn renewed investor confidence after a harrowing Q4 that saw its stock plunge 44%. LinkedIn turned in a solid Q1 earnings that investors applauded.With the U.S. and global economy growing at a tepid pace, companies are stressing cost cuts to prop up earnings as revenue flatlines or falls. In the latest week, defense contractor Lockheed Martin, snack giant  Mondelez International (MDLZ) and Procter & Gamble (PG) announced recent or new efforts to curb expenses, restructure or sell assets. They join the likes of Coca-Cola (KO)  and banking giants JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Bank of America (BAC). While cuts may help companies in the short run, they need stronger top-line growth to fuel earnings longer term.Shifting priorities for media companies came into play last week, as a handful of megamergers captured the spotlight and served as an attempt to keep growing or simply cling to survival. Cable and content titan Comcast (CMCSA) sought to grow in foreign markets via a $3.8 billion deal to buy DreamWorks Animation (DWA), the studio responsible for ""Shrek"" and ""Kung Fu Panda."" Meanwhile, it looks like Comcast rival Charter Communications (CHTR) will be able to keep up, as its $55 billion bid to buy Time Warner Cable (TWC) won regulatory approval. But survival in the struggling newspaper industry was on the mind of USA Today parent Gannett (GCI) as it bid $815 million to buy Tribune Publishing (TPUB), owner of the Los Angeles Times and Chicago Tribune.Crude oil futures continued to rise, hitting 2016 highs. But Big Oil is still adjusting to lower prices. Saudi Arabia aims to reduce its oil dependence and float less than 5% of Saudi Aramco in an IPO, valuing the world’s largest oil company in excess of $2 trillion Meanwhile,  ConocoPhillips (COP) slashed its 2016 capital spending even further and BP (BP) said it was considering further cuts in '17.  Baker Hughes (BHI) warned that N. American rig counts still have room to fall, but the U.S. count may stabilize later this year. Chevron (CVX) swung to a loss in Q1. While U.S. production falls overall, output for most majors rose even as investment fell. Exxon (XOM) lost its AAA rating at S&P, but still kept its commitment to its dividend, raising it to 75 cents from 73 cents.Quarterly results from shale players Continental Resources (CLR), EOG (EOG) and Carrizo (CRZO) are out this week.Medical merger activity took off Thursday. Abbott Laboratories (ABT) inked a $25 billion buyout deal with cardiac device giant St. Jude Medical (STJ). Abbott's former biopharma arm AbbVie (ABBV) agreed to buy biotech startup Stemcentrx for $5.8 billion plus up to $4 billion in possible milestone payments. Big French pharma Sanofi (SNY) made an unsolicited $9.3 billion cash bid for smaller drugmaker Medivation (MDVN). Medivation rejected Sanofi's offer, but Sanofi vowed to press on, and Medivation's stock traded as if investors are expecting Sanofi (and perhaps another bidder) to go higher. Both Stemcentrx and Medivation are focused on cancer treatments, a field that has provided some of the biggest drug launches of recent years.Chipotle Mexican Grill's (CMG) recovery might be slow-going, with April same-store sales down 26% to date, surprising many. The burrito king logged its first-ever quarterly loss -- of 88 cents per share -- in Q1, though Wall Street expected worse. A revenue decline to $834.5 million missed views, as comps plummeted 29.7%.But another fast-casual chain, Panera Bread (PNRA), reported strong results. Its stock is setting up in a short consolidation going back to March 8.Burger King parent Restaurant Brands International (QSR) turned in mixed results, Domino's Pizza (DPZ) missed completely and Dunkin' Brands (DNKN) edged past forecasts.
"
71,MDLZ,"Donald Trump used his prime-time Super Tuesday victory stage to vow that Apple (AAPL) would make iPhones in the U.S., ""not in China,"" if he is elected.He browbeat United Technologies (UTX)-unit Carrier and Mondelez (MDLZ)-unit Nabisco for moving hundreds of U.S. jobs to Mexico and Ford (F) for planning to double its production south of the border (though it continues to boost U.S. capacity too).Suffice it to say that multinationals don't relish the prospect of a president who stands ready to use the bully pulpit to sully their brands any time they move or expand production offshore, but GOP primary voters seem to like the idea.Trump's threats — to slap tariffs on Ford and United Tech's Carrier when they ship their products back into the U.S. and impose large tariffs on all imports from China for unfairly devaluing its currency -- have dominated the debate. None of the candidates is talking up the case for free trade -- the traditional stance of the GOP and most economists. The only thing that matters in this election is making the rules of trade more favorable to the U.S.In that context, President Obama's Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal — the biggest since Nafta — is too hot to touch and unlikely to get a vote before Election Day. Both Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz voted in favor of Trade Promotion Authority, allowing Obama to finalize terms of the deal with the assurance of an up-or-down vote in Congress without amendments. But Cruz has said he can't support the TPP in its current form and Rubio would rather talk about almost anything else.At the Detroit debate on Thursday, Rubio tried to turn Trump's populism against him: ""He can start tonight by announcing that all the Donald Trump clothing will no longer be made in China and in Mexico but will be made here in the United States.""Trump's uncomfortable response showed the limits of bad publicity, when business decisions are guided primarily by economics: ""They devalue their currencies, and they make it impossible for clothing makers in this country to do clothing in this country.""Trump hit back at Rubio for his support of the TPP, which he called ""a disaster for our country"" because of currency devaluation.Trump isn't likely to have any more success in getting Apple to make its iPhones in the U.S. than President Obama did, when he discussed it with Steve Jobs in 2011, due to the logistical and economic advantages of keeping the assembly in China.What about slapping tariffs on Ford and Carrier when they ship products back to the U.S. from Mexico? Could that be a game-changer?Only if Trump is prepared to risk tanking the American economy by canceling Nafta, says Scott Lincicome, international trade attorney and adjunct Cato Institute scholar. The trade agreement doesn't permit such tariffs, he notes.Declaring China a currency manipulator to slap big tariffs on imports of Chinese products also looks far-fetched. First, Congress, which has rejected more-modest measures of this sort, would need to go along. If it did, such a tariff would almost surely run afoul of World Trade Organization rules, Lincicome says. Yet, if Trump were somehow successful, nothing good would likely come of it.""All you would see is trade diversion,"" Lincicome said, with imports shifting to other low-cost producers like Vietnam.If Chinese imports did face a big tariff -- Trump has tossed around 45% -- then prices would soar for low-income customers in the U.S.What's remarkable about the state of the GOP debate is that it's happening even as China's central bank has been intervening in currency markets, deploying hundreds of billions of dollars to keep its currency from falling in value relative to the dollar. But the effort may fail. China is at risk of depleting its foreign reserves and economists are worried that the country will have no choice but to devalue by 10% or more to stave off a damaging outflow of capital.U.S. exports fell in January to their lowest level since June 2011. Imports have fallen less, but also are at 2011 levels, as the weak global economy is a drag on trade.Despite the powerful economic evidence that trade is a net benefit to the U.S. and that much of the loss of manufacturing jobs is related to productivity gains, even solidly pro-trade folks will acknowledge that the complaints aren't much ado about nothing.Of 5 million lost manufacturing jobs since 2000, Lincicome figures about 20% were trade-related, meaning the jobs were lost to other countries. In some industries such as apparel, where the number of factory jobs has plummeted by 80% in recent decades, the marketplace is clearly stacked against the U.S.But a good portion of job losses stem from high corporate taxes in the U.S. and more-stringent regulation, he says. That's where all the GOP candidates are in agreement to a large extent.Each of the candidates would cut the corporate tax rate, with Rubio slicing the current 35% rate to 25% and Trump slashing it to 15%.At Thursday's debate, Cruz touted his proposed 16% business-tax plan, saying that the tax would apply to imports but exports would be ""entirely tax-free.""""What that will do . . . is bring millions of manufacturing jobs back to this country, bring the steel industry back to this country, create an environment where when we compete on a fair and level playing field,"" Cruz said.
"
72,MDLZ,"Genpact (G) has made its mark helping companies operate more efficiently, but over the last two years the business processing firm has invested heavily to make its own firm run more effectively.The company, once an India-based arm of General Electric (GE), had gone through some growing pains. The outsourcer for hundreds of companies worldwide -- handling non-core functions such as accounting and finance -- decided it was time to be more selective in the businesses it pursued.Out of the loop went telecom, utilities and government, among other lackluster sectors. More attention was paid to financial services, manufacturing, consumer products, pharma and high tech -- and in finding new ways to service those customers.""We’ve spent about $100 million-plus across a range of new capabilities to take the company to the next level, such as building out mobile and analytical solutions,"" Chief Executive N.V. ""Tiger"" Tyagarajan told IBD.Making such a move came with a price, though. Margins and earnings took a hit initially. In 2014, per-share earnings fell 9%. And as part of that, business from its largest client and former parent, GE, has shrunk to a fraction of what it was.But it’s a different picture now. The strategy to invest in client sectors with the best growth potential and dial back on smaller, less lucrative areas is starting to pay off.""They basically decided to take down their profitability to strategically drive revenue in specific areas,"" analyst Joseph Foresi of Cantor Fitzgerald told IBD. ""You’ve seen growth rates pick up and positive data points in bookings’ numbers.""Genpact's total revenue in 2015 rose 8% over 2014 to $2.46 billion, but new bookings jumped 20%. Earnings for the year climbed 22% to $1.26 a share. In the fourth quarter, earnings grew 31% to 34 cents a share on revenue of $646.5 million, up 7% from the prior year.Revenue would have been higher had it not been negatively impacted by GE’s business divestitures. In the fourth quarter, GE revenue fell 1% year-over-year to $117 million, accounting for 18% of the total. Non-GE revenue from other global clients rose 10% to $529 million.For the full year, revenue from GE was down 1% to $460 million, representing 19% of total revenue. Global-client revenue grew 10% to $2 billion, or up 13% in constant currency.GE once accounted for 100% of Genpact’s revenue, when it was still an India-based business process management and information technology services arm of the massive U.S. conglomerate. In 2005, Genpact started providing services to non-GE clients, too, as an independent company. It went public in 2007.“As GE continues to change its portfolio, our relationship changes,” Tyagarajan said.About 60% of Genpact’s work is still performed in India. The rest is done in 18 other countries, including Romania, the Philippines, China, Mexico and Hungary. The company is headquartered in New York.The shrinking of GE’s contributions has been especially apparent since last March, when GE announced it would divest its financial services arm, GE Capital. Accelerated GE divestitures will weigh on 2016 results: Genpact expects GE revenue to fall 8% to 10% this year. But it forecasts that revenue from non-GE global clients will rise by 12.5% to 14%.Analysts expect total revenue this year to grow 7% to $2.64 billion, according to a poll by Thomson Reuters. Earnings are seen rising 12% to $1.42 a share.Tyagarajan doesn’t seem worried about lost business from GE.“As GE sells those businesses, it’s natural for us to enter into new relationships with the buyers. The work has to continue,” he said.Of the 12 GE Capital businesses sold so far, Genpact has already entered into contracts with four buyers, including Bank of Montreal (BMO). Tyagarajan says it’s in talks with the eight others.Meanwhile, the outsourcing of business and technology services is a market with a lot of growth left in it, he says.“So much change and disruption in technology is very good for us,” he said. “Our role is to help our clients think about change and help them change.”As Genpact has changed its focus, its client roster has fallen from more than 800 to roughly 700, though Tyagarajan says the value of its contracts has been growing.Clients range from drug-store retailer Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) to manufacturers such as Boeing (BA), Nissan Motor (NSANY) and Honeywell (HON). Consumer products customers include Mondelez (MDLZ) and Kimberly-Clark (KMB). In pharma, it counts AstraZeneca (AZN) and others among its clients.The company’s ties with GE are a ""competitive advantage,"" noted analyst Frank Atkins of SunTrust Robinson Humphrey in a recent note to clients, which came with a buy rating and price target of 30.Among those advantages are GE’s culture of lean principles and systems. What’s more, he noted, many GE execs go on to management roles at other firms, creating an expanded network of potential new client wins for Genpact.""Its relationship with GE and recent investments give it solid positioning versus competitors,"" Atkins wrote. The company also addresses more industry verticals than many of its peers, he said.Genpact competes with pure-play business process management providers WNS (WNS) and ExlService Holdings (EXLS), as well as business processing units of larger global consultancies such as Accenture (ACN) and Cognizant Technology Solutions (CTSH).Tata Consultancy Services, Wipro (WIT) and Infosys (INFY) are also rivals in certain areas.""Genpact has a longer sales cycle than typical outsourcing companies,"" said Cantor Fitzgerald's Foresi, meaning it takes longer to land a sale and start servicing clients once a deal is signed. ""So the business is potentially stickier.""

73,MDLZ,"Shares of Mondelez International (MDLZ) moved lower Wednesday after the maker of Oreo cookies, Ritz crackers and Cadbury chocolates fell short of quarterly earnings views, as improving margins were offset by the strong U.S. dollar and uncertain global economy.Reporting before the open, Mondelez logged fourth-quarter earnings of 46 cents a share, down from 47 cents the prior year and a 2 cents below analysts' consensus views. Revenue fell 17% to $7.4 billion, slightly ahead of consensus.The revenue figure included a negative 11.4% impact from transactions tied to its coffee business and a negative 11% impact from unfavorable currency exchange rates. Last year, Mondelez and D.E. Master Blenders 1753 merged their coffee businesses to form a company called Jacobs Douwe Egberts, a move that allowed Mondelez to focus more on snacks. Excluding those items, organic net revenue rose 4.7% for the quarter, helped by higher prices on some items.Mondelez also posted a one-time accounting charge of $778 million during the quarter to remove all assets and liabilities of its Venezuelan operations from its balance sheet.The company’s shares closed down 6.5% on the stock market today. The stock is down 18% from its high of 48.58 set in August.The Q4 results marked the ninth straight quarter of lower revenue for Mondelez and the second straight quarter of double-digit declines. The strengthening dollar has been a major top-line headwind for the company, which gets about three-quarters of its revenue outside North America.To help offset that problem, Chief Executive Irene Rosenfeld has led efforts to slash expenses by $3 billion and move production to lower-cost countries. During the fourth quarter, Mondelez’s adjusted gross profit rose 280 basis points from a year earlier to 38.8%.Rosenfeld put an upbeat face on the results, saying in a statement that Mondelez “delivered another year of very strong results despite the highly volatile macroeconomic environment.”“Our aggressive cost-savings programs drove significant margin expansion,” she added. “In addition, we increased our marketing investments, enabling us to steadily accelerate organic revenue growth and improve our share performance as the year progressed. We remain confident in our ability to execute our transformation agenda despite weakening macroeconomic conditions in emerging markets.”The shaky global economy isn’t the only problem Mondelez faces. It and other snack food companies must contend with increasingly health-conscious consumers who are shying away from processed foods, particularly in Europe. This shift is reflected in the fact that Mondelez’s North America business reported a 2.6% gain in Q4 net organic revenue, while its Europe business logged a 1.1% decline.Meanwhile, Mondelez also has faced pressure to improve its performance from activist investors Trian Fund Management and Pershing Square Capital Management.

74,MDLZ,"Eighty-year old companies that specialize in meat production aren’t usually looked upon as growth stocks, but Tyson Foods (TSN) aims to position itself as one anyway.The world’s largest processor and marketer of chicken, beef and pork plans to do so by putting more focus on branded products rather than commodities such as fresh poultry.Its ultimate goal? To become the ""leading branded protein company in the world,"" RBC Capital Markets analyst David Palmer noted in a recent report.""Tyson continues to position itself as a growth company with advantaged brands within advantaged categories,"" Palmer said.Those categories include high-margin, ""value-added"" products such as marinated and breaded poultry; prepared foods, including what it calls its “Core 9” packaged brands like Jimmy Dean sausage and Hillshire Farms lunch meat; and antibiotic and gluten-free chicken.During the recent Consumer Analyst Group of New York conference in Boca Raton, Fla., Tyson officials said 85% of the company’s chicken business consists of poultry that is more than just raw meat.""This further differentiates (Tyson) from its more commodity-oriented peers,"" Palmer noted.Tyson Chief Executive Donald Smith echoed that point on a fiscal first-quarter conference call with analysts.""I believe we've demonstrated separation from the commodity players in large part due to the disproportionately high mix of value-added products in our portfolio as well as the production flexibility created with our buy vs. grow strategy, which also reduces commodity exposure,"" Smith said. The ""buy vs. grow"" strategy refers to Tyson’s decision to purchase some of its chickens from other facilities and reduce the number of chickens it grows itself.Tyson officials have made no secret of their desire to change the way investors view the company. As JPMorgan analyst Ken Goldman pointed out in a recent note, the first two words of Tyson’s presentation at the consumer group event were ""different company.""""Tyson remains firmly (and understandably) committed to convincing investors that it is a different company than it used to be,"" Goldman noted. ""The primary reason for the difference continues to be Tyson’s emphasis -- both in reality and perception -- on branded food rather than commodity protein.""One difference between branded food and commodity meat items is that the former carries higher prices and margins, Goldman says. Tyson’s Core 9 brands carry ""an 11% average premium over the category average.""Tyson also spent a lot of time talking about revenue growth during the consumer group event. That stood in contrast to other food companies, such as General Mills (GIS) and Nabisco parent Mondelez International (MDLZ), which mainly focused on cost-cutting.""These companies spent much, maybe most, of their time today talking about costs, whereas the opposite was true for Tyson,"" Goldman noted. ""It helps to have a category (meat/protein) growing at a better-than-average pace, as well as a category that responds well to mix- and margin-accretive innovation today.""There appears to be plenty of demand for Tyson’s meat products. Palmer cited Tyson research showing that 54% of U.S. consumers want to increase the amount of protein in their diets.Worldwide, long-term demand for protein is expected to increase more than 60% from current levels due to population growth and the emergence of a global middle class that can afford to buy more meat products.Favorable industry trends, combined with investor optimism over the food sector in general, have helped push Tyson’s stock price up more than 40% since Nov. 20. Its shares set a record high of 64.63 on Feb. 23 — the sixth straight session they reached a new high.Other large-cap food companies that have set new highs this month include Sysco (SYY), Campbell Soup (CPB) and J.M. Smucker (SJM).One reason for the recent stock gains is the defensive nature of the food business. When stock markets are volatile, many investors flock to consumer staples such as food. Companies in this industry aren’t as vulnerable to wide swings in performance and value and also tend to pay regular dividends. Some food companies also have benefited from cheap gas prices, which lower transportation costs.Meanwhile, Tyson has gotten a lift from falling food costs. Excessive supplies of cattle feed such as corn and soybeans have lowered production prices of beef, poultry and pork. Lower costs were one reason Tyson raised its full-year earnings forecast earlier this month to a range of $3.85 to $3.95 a share from prior guidance of $3.50 to $3.65.The company also recently reiterated its goal of 10%-or-better annual earnings-per-share growth in coming years, and suggested that its long-term margin goals might be conservative.“We would not be surprised if before the fiscal year ended, Tyson raised its long-term chicken margin to maybe 8% to 10% from 7% to 9% currently,” Goldman noted.Tyson posted earnings of $1.15 a share for its fiscal first quarter, which ended in December. That was up 49% from the previous year and well above consensus analyst estimates for 89 cents. It was the biggest quarterly EPS gain in nearly two years.On the downside, revenue declined 15% to $9.15 billion -- the first dip since the September 2012 quarter -- partly because of the divestiture of a few noncore businesses. The top-line result fell short of consensus for $10 billion.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect Tyson’s full-year earnings to climb 27% this fiscal year and another 7% in fiscal 2017.

122,MDLZ,"Shares of Dr Pepper Snapple Group Inc.  soared more than 22% on Jan 29 after news came out that the beverage company will be acquired by coffee-maker Keurig Green Mountain, Inc.Terms of the DealPer the terms of the transaction, which has been approved by Dr Pepper Snapple’s board of directors, the company’s shareholders will receive a special cash dividend of $130.75 per share, making the deal worth $18.7 billion. Dr Pepper Snapple’s shareholders will retain 13% ownership of the combined entity, while Keurig shareholders will own the remaining 87%.European investment fund JAB Holding, which helped take Keurig private for $13.9 billion in 2016, will make a $9 billion equity investment as a part of the transaction financing, and will be the controlling shareholder when the transaction closes in the second quarter of 2018. Meanwhile, snack giant Mondelez International Inc. (MDLZ  -  Free Report) — JAB Holding's partner in Keurig — is slated to have about 13-14% stake in the merged entity.Both Keurig and Dr Pepper Snapple will continue to operate from their respective headquarters, and their leadership will run their businesses.Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc Price  Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc Price | Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc Quote Keurig Dr Pepper’s Impact on the IndustryThe new company, known as Keurig Dr Pepper, will have $11 billion in combined pro forma revenues and will realize $600 million in synergies on an annualized basis by 2021, per the companies. The merger creates a portfolio that contains a number of iconic beverage companies that includes Dr Pepper, 7UP, Snapple, A&W root beer, Mott’s apple juice, Sunkist and Green Mountain Coffee Roasters, which includes the Keurig single-serve coffee business.The combined company's new CEO, Keurig's Bob Gamgort, says that Dr Pepper Snapple's distribution network will help market drinks such as Peet's Coffee and Forto coffee shops, while Keurig's online presence will boost sales of Dr Pepper Snapple’s products through digital platforms like Amazon.com Inc. As such, the Keurig-Dr Pepper deal would mark the largest soft-drink deal in history.Overall, the deal is likely to push JAB Holdings into escalating competition with beverage giants like of Coca-Cola Co. (KO  -  Free Report) and PepsiCo Inc. (PEP  -  Free Report).The deal primarily validates the ongoing trouble in the food and beverage industry. Changing demographics and purchasing behaviors make it important for beverage industry giants to understand and capitalize on main consumer insights that identify growing trends. Health awareness has been prime concern for consumers in recent times and capitalizing on this trend can prove to be beneficial for any beverage company.Continuing decline in carbonated soft drinks or CSDs and impressive growth in noncarbonated beverages are creating headaches for many established players like PepsiCo, Coca-Cola, and Dr Pepper Snapple, leading to lower volumes and weak sales. Among CSDs, the cola segment particularly has been facing challenges, as consumers are opting for alternatives. Also, potential new taxes on sugar-sweetened beverages and growing regulatory pressures are affecting CSD sales. This shift in consumer preferences resulted in Dr Pepper Snapple’s soda sales declining for the12th consecutive year in 2016.In order to combat this weakness, the company added Bai Brands in January 2017 to its priority portfolio, one of the fastest growing beverage brands that offer a family of premium better-for-you beverages. However, despite its efforts, Dr Pepper Snapple has about 8.5% of the U.S. non-alcoholic beverage market and has been the slowest to diversify its offerings alongside market leaders Coca Cola Co. and PepsiCo Inc., according to the consultancy Euromonitor International.In the words of Keurig CEO Bob Gamgort, “Our view of the industry through the lens of consumer needs, versus traditional manufacturer-defined segments, unlocks the opportunity to combine hot and cold beverages and create a platform to increase exposure to high-growth formats.”Dr Pepper Snapple holds a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

123,MDLZ,"Mondelez International, Inc. (MDLZ  -  Free Report) is set to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Jan 31, after market close.The company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 5.56% last quarter. The company surpassed estimates in three of the trailing four quarters, the average positive surprise being 2.96%.Mondelez has been facing challenges to boost its volume since 2014, primarily due to soft consumer demand. In fact, the food industry, which includes legacy brands like General Mills Inc. (GIS  -  Free Report), The Kraft Heinz Company (KHC  -  Free Report) and The Kellogg Company (K  -  Free Report), has been giving a dismal performance for quite some time to boost sales. Mondelez, in particular, witnessed a decline in revenues in nine out of the last 10 quarters, primarily due to lower demand. Mondelez’s sales and volumes were down 1.2% and 0.9%, respectively, and in the first nine months of 2017.Resultantly, the company’s share price has advanced only 0.9% in the last six months, underperforming the industry’s 2.6% growth.  Let’s See How Things Are Shaping Up for Q4In the last reported quarter, Mondelez’s net revenues increased 2.1% year over year on organic revenue growth and currency tailwinds. Revenues from emerging and developed markets increased 4.5% and 0.7%, respectively. Power Brands also witnessed a 5.6% increase in revenues.The trend is expected to continue in the to-be-reported quarter with improved volumes in its Power Brands, which includes Oreo, Cadbury Diary Milk, Halls and Tang. Higher sales from its wellness product portfolio is also anticipated to support its revenue growth. Further, improvements in China, Europe, Russia and India along with strong pricing in emerging markets are added positives.However, softness in North America due to a tough retail environment will mar the growth rate to some extent. Again, weakness in the Middle East is also expected to hurt the company’s sales.Segment Wise: Mondelez’s Europe revenues, comprising about 36.9% of the total revenues, are likely to witness 15% growth sequentially and 4.7% year over year to $2.8 billion. North America segment, comprising about 27.7% of the total revenues, is expected to witness growth in the fourth quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.83 billion for the segment’s revenues reflect growth from $1.77 billion in the prior quarter and $1.81 billion in the year-ago quarter.Latin America revenues of $910 million indicates an increase from $908 million in the prior quarter and $864 million in the prior-year quarter.Coming to the company’s bottom line, the snacks giant surpassed analysts’ expectations for earnings in eight of the past 10 quarters. Despite lower sales growth, the company has managed to boost its profit level, banking on effective promotional strategies, introduction of nutritious products, cost-saving and restructuring initiatives that benefited it at large.However, higher commodity prices, primarily on dairy products, and increased trade spending are likely to adversely impact its gross margins. Then again, the company’s zero-based budgeting program, productivity savings and lower overhead costs are expected to boost its operating margin.Hence, fourth-quarter bottom line is expected to witness solid growth from higher pricing, higher volumes as well as lower overhead and increased productivity savings, partly offset by higher input costs.For the fourth quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 56 cents, reflecting a 19.2% year-over-year increase. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues is pegged at $6.98 billion, implying 3.1% growth.Quantitative Model PredictionHere is what our quantitative model predicts:Mondelez does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — to increase the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: Mondelez has an Earnings ESP of -0.58%.Zacks Rank: Mondelez carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP.

124,MDLZ,"Mondelez International, Inc. (MDLZ  -  Free Report) has teamed up yet again with the third-largest cereal company in the United States, Post Consumer Brands, to create two cookie-inspired breakfast cereals.The new Post NUTTER BUTTER and CHIPS AHOY! cereals are inspired by classic, NUTTER BUTTER and CHIPS AHOY! cookies. In July 2017, the companies had teamed up to bring back Post OREO O's, which have been off store shelves since 2007. Also, they created a cereal — Honey Maid S’mores. It is to be noted that Post Consumer Brands is a business unit of Post Holdings, Inc. (POST  -  Free Report), formed from the combination of Post Foods and MOM Brands in May 2015.The North American food industry is seeing growing demand for healthier products, changes in consumer dynamics and a shift in spending toward lower-priced products. As a result of this, food companies like Kellogg Company (K  -  Free Report), General Mills Inc. (GIS  -  Free Report) have been witnessing weak sales over the past few quarters.Given the sluggish growth and slowdown in consumption in the food industry, co-branding is expected to bring success to companies. In line with this, Cereal Partners Worldwide deserves special mention. General Mills formed a joint venture with Nestle called Cereal Partners Worldwide, which serves customers in more than 130 global markets.Mondelez has been refreshing its brand portfolio through product innovation and extending brands to newer geographies and platforms. The company is increasing investments in in-store execution and advertising to support the Power Brands.Also, Mondelez plans to offer more good-for-you snacks and expects 50% of its product portfolio to comprise “well-being” items by 2020 instead of the current one-third. Apart from simplifying the ingredients and improving nutritional benefits of the existing products, the company will develop products to meet the growing demand for healthier and natural items.Stock Price MovementMondelez’s shares have lost 5.5% so far this year, compared with the 4.2% decline of its industry. Nonetheless, earnings estimates for 2018 moved up 0.9% over the past 60 days. This signifies that analysts are optimistic about this stock’s near-term performance. Also, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock surpassed earnings estimates in three of the trailing four quarters, recording an average positive surprise of 2.96%.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Investor Alert: Breakthroughs PendingA medical advance is now at the flashpoint between theory and realization.

125,MDLZ,"Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc.  and Keurig Green Mountain have announced the board of directors of the new company — Keurig Dr Pepper — after the shareholders of Dr Pepper unanimously voted in favor of the merger deal on Jun 29. With other necessary regulatory approvals for the deal already obtained in the United States and Canada, the companies are on track to close the transaction on Jul 9. Moreover, on Jul 10, Keurig Dr Pepper will start trading on the New York Stock Exchange, under the new ticker symbol — “KDP”.The board will include 12 members, working under the leadership of CEO Bob Gamgort. The board members will work together to make KDP a leading beverage company, delivering upon substantial value creation opportunities.This merger announcement dates back to January 2018 when the leading coffee maker, Keurig Green Mountain, Inc., agreed to buy Dr Pepper Snapple. Under the terms of the deal, the company’s shareholders will receive a special cash dividend of $103.75 per share, making the deal worth $18.7 billion. Dr Pepper Snapple’s shareholders will retain 13% ownership of the combined entity while Keurig shareholders will own 87%.Previously, it was revealed that European investment fund JAB Holding will make a $9-billion equity investment to finance the transaction. Also, Mondelez International, Inc. (MDLZ  -  Free Report), JAB Holding's partner in Keurig, was about to have 13-14% stake in the merged entity.The combined company, Keurig Dr Pepper, will have $11 billion in combined pro forma revenues and will realize $600 million in synergies on an annualized basis by 2021. This will make it the seventh-largest company in the U.S. food and beverage sector, and the third-largest non-alcoholic beverage company. The company’s portfolio will contain a number of iconic brands, including Dr Pepper, 7UP, Snapple, A&W, Mott’s, Canada Dry and Clamato, among others. The merged entity is likely to gain from Dr Pepper Snapple's distribution network while Keurig's online presence will boost sales through digital platforms like Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report). In fact, analysts are of opinion that the combined company can pose tough competition to beverage giants, including The Coca-Cola Company (KO  -  Free Report).We note that Dr Pepper Snapple has been witnessing weak volumes of carbonated beverages, including the diet versions, owing to CSD category headwinds. Further, cross-category competition, and growing health and wellness consciousness among consumers are hurting CSD category growth. Moreover, new taxes on sugar-sweetened beverages and growing regulatory pressures are affecting CSD sales. Consequently, the company currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Shares of Dr Pepper increased 1.4% yesterday.

However, economists have clearly stated that they do not expect the Fed to make any changes to existing monetary policies.A White House official stated on Monday that President Trump would announce his decision regarding who he has chosen as the next Fed Chief on Thursday.

128,MDLZ,"The U.S. stock market seems to have defied the eerie All Hallows’ Eve by maintaining its bull run, and the ‘Halloween Strategy’, a technique in which investors start placing big bets on All Hallows' Eve after restraining in the preceding six months, gives us even more optimism right now.Demand for candies and costumes in the Halloween season drives sales at U.S. retailers, including discount stores. Sales of such items are poised to beat the previous year numbers, courtesy of upbeat consumer sentiment. The finances of consumers have, largely, benefitted from an improving economy with lower unemployment and better wages.Spooky Stock Market Ghosts, Goblins and GhoulsThe fears and apprehensions concerning the broader market are unsubstantiated.For instance, has the war of words between North Korea’s Kim Jong-Un and Trump scared investors? Apparently not, as the market continues to gain unhindered.Another fear is that the Fed will hike rates, killing a bull market fueled by cheap borrowing. But, policymakers haven’t hiked rates yet. They fear that a rate hike will strengthen the dollar, eventually denting U.S. exports and hampering economic growth.Finally, should a lofty valuation give you goosebumps? Nope and nope. Bull markets often scale to a string of record highs. So, if you succumb to the fear of highs, you eventually lose money.Halloween Drives Record Sales of CandyWith more money expected to pour in, candy sales are expected to rise. In fact, Halloween accounts for about 10% of the industry’s total annual sales, which in turn leads to fierce competition among confectioners.According to IHS Markit data, candy sales are set to rise 4.1% from last year, reaching a seasonally adjusted $4.1 billion. This is particularly impressive given that candy prices have declined 0.9% from last year, marking the second successive drop in Halloween candy prices.Halloween is like Super Bowl Sunday for North America’s largest chocolate maker — Hershey Co (HSY  -  Free Report). Banking on this upbeat sales forecast, the maker of Kisses, Reese’s, Krackel, Symphony and Mr. Goodbar expects sales to go up 8% from last year. The company has seen its earnings grow over the last five years, driving its share price from $70 to nearly $105.Another major player, Mondelez International Inc (MDLZ  -  Free Report), is expected to gain immensely from this year’s rise in candy sales. It is a successor to Kraft Foods Inc, which owns household names in the candy industry like Nabisco, Cadbury and Toblerone. It has seen its share price climb from around $27 the year it was introduced to almost $40 today.Halloween to Boost Costume and Discount Store SalesA large chunk of Halloween spending will go to costumes as well. According to a survey by the National Retail Federation (NRF), Americans are expected to spend $3.4 billion on costumes. The survey also shows that majority of consumers will shop online for costumes, while about 30% will do so at retail stores.In fact, as per the NRF, spending on All Hallows' Eve this year will be more than $9 billion. This marks a rise from around $8.5 billion last year.Consumer Confidence Rides HighThe upbeat reading on Halloween sales says a lot about consumer sentiments, which have been improving on a strengthening economy. The U.S. economy expanded at a solid seasonally adjusted 3% annual rate in the third quarter of 2017, according to the Commerce Department. Such an expansion came on the heels of 3.1% growth in the second quarter. It also marks the first time of two consecutive quarters of 3% growth or more since mid-2014.The economy was boosted by solid consumer spending, and a steady job market buoyed household optimism. The unemployment rate declined to 4.2% in September, the lowest since February 2001, while wages increased 0.5% to an average of $26.55 an hour, per the Labor Department. In fact, in the last 12 months, hourly pay increased 2.9%, up from 2.7% in the prior month and also in line with a post-recession high (read more: US GDP Hits 3% Despite Twin Hurricanes: 5 Top Gainers).4 Solid PicksHere we look at four publicly traded companies from the aforesaid areas that are positioned to gain the maximum this Halloween.

In the first half of 2017, reported sales of $13.04 billion declined 2.4% year over year due to soft consumer demand in North America and Canada. In fact, the food industry, which includes legacy brands like General Mills Inc. (GIS  -  Free Report), Mondelez International, Inc. (MDLZ  -  Free Report) and The Kellogg Company (K  -  Free Report) have been performing dismally for quite some time. Consumption trends in a number of the company’s key categories remain challenged. Three of the four reporting segments registered year-over-year decline during this period, with the steepest decline in Canada (down 8.9%) and Europe (down 5.8%). Its flagship U.S. segment saw a 2.3% year-over-year decline in net sales. The company’s overall organic sales also declined 1.8% during the period. The trend is expected to persist in the to-be-reported quarter. Nevertheless, the company expects organic sales growth to ramp up in the third and fourth quarter of 2017. This will likely be driven by strong marketing, go-to-market and product quality initiatives.  Kraft Heinz has implemented several cost-saving initiatives, including the integration of Kraft Foods and Heinz. The company plans to cut annual costs by $1.7 billion by 2017-end, primarily through work-force reduction along with factory closures and consolidations. Cost savings have driven margins for the company, mainly in the developed markets of the United States and Europe. Other productivity improvement initiatives include programs such as zero-based budgeting, modernization and capability building within the manufacturing footprint. However, adverse impact of lower volumes, higher commodity costs and foreign exchange headwind could hurt profits in the to-be-reported quarter. Overall, for the third quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 83 cents, reflecting a 0.3% year-over-year increase. The consensus estimate for revenues is $6.3 billion, implying a 0.9% increase. Here is what our quantitative model predicts: Kraft Heinz does not have the right combination of ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP  and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — which increase the odds of an earnings beat. Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Kraft Heinz is +0.56%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.   Zacks Rank: Kraft Heinz carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

130,MDLZ,"Kellogg Company (K  -  Free Report) is set to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 31 before the opening bell.Kellogg has been witnessing top-line weakness for the last two years, primarily due to lower demand. Particularly, weak performance of its cereal products in developed markets as well as soft U.S. snacks business has been negatively impacting the company.Kellogg, much like a number of other U.S. food producers such as General Mills Inc. (GIS  -  Free Report), The Kraft Heinz Company (KHC  -  Free Report), Mondelez International, Inc. (MDLZ  -  Free Report), has been struggling due to the shift in consumer preference toward natural and organic ingredients over packaged and processed food. This trend is unlikely to change in the to-be-reported quarter and Kellogg expects its top line to remain subdued in 2017.Nonetheless, given the tepid sales growth, the company is making aggressive efforts toward improving its food offerings. The company is investing in brand building, in-store capabilities along with product and packaging innovation. The company’s sales in the second half of 2017 are expected to somewhat benefit from innovation and Pringles’ improved performance in Europe. Again, the company’s sales in Brazil are likely to benefit from the Parati acquisition. Mexico and Australia’s sales are likely to be higher owing to better shipments and improvement in pricing and mix.As per the Zacks Consensus Estimate, Kellogg’s total North America segment’s revenues are expected to witness a 0.04% decline in the third quarter. Europe revenues are likely to witness a decline of 0.01%. However, Latin America as well as Asia Pacific revenues are likely to register 0.2% and 0.03% growth in the quarter, respectively.Overall, for the third quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues is pegged at $3.2 billion, implying a 1.2% decline.However, cost-savings initiatives like Project K and zero-based budgeting (ZBB) program are somewhat compensating for the weakness in sales. Although the top line has been weak, Kellogg’s margin growth has been impressive. Pricing and mix improvement is anticipated to give support to its bottom-line growth. Currency headwinds are also expected to diminish, thereby further supporting EPS growth.Overall, for the third quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 93 cents, reflecting a 2.8% year-over-year decrease.Kellogg Company Price and EPS Surprise  Kellogg Company Price and EPS Surprise | Kellogg Company QuoteHere is what our quantitative model predicts:Kellogg has the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — which is required to be confident of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter. Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Mondelez is +0.50%.Zacks Rank: Kellogg carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Zacks’ Best Private Investment IdeasWhile we are happy to share many articles like this on the website, our best recommendations and most in-depth research are not available to the public.Starting today, for the next month, you can follow all Zacks' private buys and sells in real time.

131,MDLZ,"Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc.  unveiled plans to pay special dividend of $103.75 per share, setting a conditional record date on Jul 6, 2018. This is with respect to the Agreement and Plan of Merger among Dr Pepper Snapple and Maple Parent Holdings Corp, the indirect parent of Keurig Green Mountain, Inc. Closure of this merger transaction depends on stockholder approvals after Annual Meeting on Jun 29 as well as other regulatory closing conditions. However, the closing is slated for Jul 9, 2018.Per the terms of the merger, Maple Parent is expected to merge with a special purpose merger subsidiary of Dr Pepper Snapple. As a result, it will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of the company. On completion of the merger, Dr Pepper Snapple will be renamed as Keurig Dr Pepper Inc. and will trade under the symbol ""KDP"" on the New York Stock Exchange.This merger announcement dates back to January 2018, when the leading coffee maker, Keurig Green Mountain, Inc., agreed to buy Dr Pepper Snapple. Under the terms of the deal, which was then approved by Dr Pepper Snapple’s board of directors, the company’s shareholders will receive a special cash dividend of $103.75 per share, making the deal worth $18.7 billion. Dr Pepper Snapple’s shareholders were likely to retain 13% ownership of the combined entity, while Keurig shareholders were about to own the remaining 87%.Previously, it was revealed that European investment fund JAB Holding will make a $9 billion equity investment to finance the transaction. Also, Mondelez International, Inc. (MDLZ  -  Free Report), JAB Holding's partner in Keurig, was about to have 13-14% stake in the merged entity.The combined company, Keurig Dr Pepper, will have $11 billion in combined pro forma revenues and will realize $600 million in synergies on an annualized basis by 2021. The merger creates a portfolio that will contain a number of iconic brands, including Dr Pepper, 7UP, Snapple, A&W, Mott’s, Canada Dry and Clamato, among others. The merged entity is likely to gain from Dr Pepper Snapple's distribution network, while Keurig's online presence will boost sales through digital platforms like Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report). In fact, analysts are of opinion that the combined company can give a tough competition to beverage giants, including The Coca-Cola Company (KO  -  Free Report).We note that Dr Pepper Snapple has been witnessing weak volumes of carbonated beverages, including the diet versions, owing to CSD category headwinds. Further, cross-category competition, and growing health and wellness consciousness among consumers are hurting CSD category growth. Moreover, new taxes on sugar-sweetened beverages and growing regulatory pressures are affecting CSD sales. In the past month, the stock lost 0.1% against the industry’s 5.4% rally.So, it remains to be seen whether this merger transaction can really prove to be meaningful.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of All Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.(We are reissuing this article to correct a mistake.

133,MDLZ,"In an effort to build an outstanding supply chain, Mondelez International, Inc. (MDLZ  -  Free Report) has invested $200 million in its Opava biscuit manufacturing facility ever since 2014. For the European market, this manufacturing unit produces Power Brands like Oreo, belVita, Milka and Cadbury. Notably, the company’s portfolio includes seven brands that generate revenues in excess of $1 billion and have been christened as Power Brands.Over the last few years, the company have opened or upgraded Mondel??z International Sites like Sri City, India; Salinas, Mexico; Bournville, the United Kingdom; and Bahrain.International Expansion: A Key CatalystMondelez is reviving its brand portfolio through product innovation and extending its brands to newer geographies and platforms. Also, the company’s expenditures on advertisement are biased toward the high-margin Power Brands. In fact, it is increasing investments in in-store execution and advertising to support the Power Brands and innovation funded by cost savings from the company’s restructuring plans.The company generates around 75% of its revenues from outside the United States, with around 40% coming from the emerging markets like Brazil, China, India, Mexico, Russia and Southeast Asia. This is because food/beverage companies are increasingly investing in developing and the emerging markets like India, China and Brazil, which boast significant growth potential owing to relatively low per-capita consumption. Also, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company is keen on expanding its business via acquisitions. In this regard, Mondelez’s acquisition of the LU biscuit business in 2007 and Cadbury in 2010 are the worth mentioning. These buyouts significantly expanded its routes-to-market across the globe, especially in Europe and emerging markets. Further, the company intends to make more acquisitions for improving its categories or distribution capabilities. In May 2018, Mondelez inked a deal to acquire Tate’s Bake Shop for approximately $500 million. Tate’s has been one of the fastest growing biscuit brands in the United States and complements well with Mondelez’s portfolio.Stock Price PerformanceSo far, the current year has not been encouraging for Food - Miscellaneous industry as well as Mondelez. Year to date, the company has lost 6.3% compared with the industry’s 9.9% decline. Stocks such as B&G Foods, Inc. (BGS  -  Free Report), Darling Ingredients Inc. (DAR  -  Free Report) and Blue Apron Holdings, Inc.

134,MDLZ,"The food industry has underperformed the broader market in a year’s time as the industry has been struggling in the face of numerous issues. Again, the industry currently ranks among the bottom 20% of all Zacks industries, signifying that industry-level factors will continue to be unfavorable.With obesity ballooning into a major heath issue in America, consumers are desperately looking for food with health benefits. They are cutting back on food items that contain artificial flavor, color, sodium and saturated fat. Also, food items proven to contain traces of pesticides, genetically modified organisms and antibiotics are consciously avoided. Hence, with an increasing number of Americans choosing healthier lifestyle practices, packaged food companies are finding it hard to survive.Meanwhile, this rising health awareness is not going down well with companies selling snacks and packaged food products. Companies like Kellogg Company (K  -  Free Report), General Mills, Inc. (GIS  -  Free Report), Mondelez International (MDLZ  -  Free Report) have been facing top-line weakness over the past several quarters. Along with a shift in preference, increased price consciousness among consumers is acting against the industry.All is Not LostPer the Organic Trade Association, organic food now accounts for more than 5% of total food sales in the United States. Organic food sales increased 6.4% from last year in 2017. Sales are expected to rise further this year, largely banking on innovation and product launches. The organic food and beverages market is expected to grow at a rate of 14% from 2017 to 2021, per the latest market research report by Technavio.Needless to say, it makes it pertinent for food companies to comply with changing preferences to regain footing. Food companies are aggressively trying to improve their products through innovation as well as acquisitions and divestitures. They are channeling funds toward product and packaging innovation as well as reformulating a number of existing products to meet rapidly changing consumer view on health and wellness. Apart from this, companies have adopted multi-year restructuring initiatives with focus on improving operational efficiency to generate cost savings.Again, some companies are opting for co-branding to boost sales. Cereal Partners Worldwide deserves a special mention here. General Mills formed a joint venture with Nestle called Cereal Partners Worldwide, which serves customers in more than 130 global markets. Mondelez International teamed up yet again with the third-largest cereal company in the United States, Post Consumer Brands, to create two cookie-inspired breakfast cereals.Moreover, the overall economy appears to be in good shape, driven by an improved labor market, higher consumer spending, rising consumer confidence and increased business investments.Making the Right ChoiceSeveral food companies defy all odds on varied endeavors like product innovation and co-branding to keep up with evolving trends. Using the Zacks Stock Screener, we have zeroed in on three food stocks that have been performing well. We have ensured that the selected stocks possess a  Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) with other relevant metrics. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Medifast, Inc. (MED  -  Free Report) sports a Zacks Rank #1. Shares of the company have gained more than 200% against the industry’s loss of 18.5% in the past year. Moreover, the company is witnessing upward estimate revisions — 12.3% for 2018 and 18.6% for 2019 — in the last 60 days. This reflects that analysts are optimistic about the stock’s prospects. Per the Zacks Consensus Estimate, EPS growth is at 59.4% and sales growth at 30.9% for 2018. Again, EPS is projected to grow nearly 15% in the next three to five years.The Chefs' Warehouse, Inc. (CHEF  -  Free Report) carries a Zacks Rank #2. The stock has gained around 82% in the past year. Though estimates have been stable over the last 60 days, earnings are expected to grow a solid 65.9% in 2018. Again, EPS is projected to rise nearly 22% in the next three to five years. Meanwhile, the company’s Value Score of B reflects that there is upside potential for the stock.Conagra Brands, Inc. (CAG  -  Free Report) has a Zacks Rank #2. Earnings are expected to grow a solid 17.8% in 2018. Again, EPS is likely to grow nearly 8% in the next three to five years. Meanwhile, the company’s Value Score of B reflects that there is more room to run for the stock.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

135,MDLZ,"In an attempt to keep up with consumer’s changing preference, Mondelez International, Inc. (MDLZ  -  Free Report) entered into an agreement to acquire cookie-maker Tate’s Bake Shop for approximately $500 million.Tate’s is one of the fast growing, premium cookie and baked goods brand in the United States. The company’s retail sales in measured channels surged more than 40% through March 2018. Moreover, its sales quadrupled over the past five years.Buyout BenefitsWith the acquisition, Mondelez will able to bolster its presence in the fast-growing premium cookie segment. As Mondelez has been persistently facing the brunt of changing consumer preference in North America for a while, it is appropriate for the company to diversify portfolio. In 2017, net revenues fell 0.1% from the year-ago level.The food industry has been struggling with numerous issues. Major U.S. food companies like Mondelez, General Mills (GIS  -  Free Report), Kellogg Company (K  -  Free Report), B&G Foods, Inc. (BGS  -  Free Report) are striving to retain market share with packaged food items losing ground. A shift in consumer’s preference toward healthier options and a higher level of price consciousness are hurting the industry, which is denting sales growth.The acquisition can be considered a right move to fight the sales slump, as Tate’s uses authentic, high-quality and healthy ingredients, in line with the current consumer preference.“Tate’s is a great strategic fit that will complement our portfolio of beloved snacks brands,” states Dirk Van de Put, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Mondelez.  Notably, Tate’s will operate as a separate standalone business, while providing resources to accelerate overall growth for Mondelez. The acquisition is expected to close during the summer of 2018.Mondelez International, Inc. Price  Mondelez International, Inc. Price | Mondelez International, Inc.

136,MDLZ,"Mondelez International, Inc. (MDLZ  -  Free Report) is set to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 30 after market close.Mondelez has been facing challenges to boost its volume since 2014, primarily due to soft consumer demand. In fact, the food industry, which includes legacy brands like General Mills Inc. (GIS  -  Free Report), The Kraft Heinz Company (KHC  -  Free Report) and The Kellogg Company (K  -  Free Report), has been giving a dismal performance for quite some time to boost sales. Mondelez, in particular, witnessed a decline in revenues for the last nine quarters, primarily due to lower demand.Mondelez’s sales were down 2.8% on a 2.1% decline in volumes in the first half of 2017. Organically, sales decreased 1% in the period. However, the company expects its sales to rebound in the second half delivering companywide organic sales growth of 1% for 2017. The company’s third-quarter volumes are expected to get a boost owing to delayed shipments after the cyberattack in the preceding quarter. The company’s shipping process was affected due to the global malware attack. That said, the company expects to recognize and recover delayed shipments during the third quarter that would result in higher volumes.Mondelez’s North America segment, comprising about 26% of the total revenues, is expected to witness growth in the third quarter after registering a 5% year-over-year decline in revenues in the first half of 2017. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.78 billion for the segment’s revenues reflect growth of 1.5% from the year-ago quarter.The company has a strong innovation agenda in North America for the second half of 2017. Mondelez has several new products in the pipeline to boost North American sales. These include new Vea brand snacks, non-GMO Triscuits, Belvita Protein, Ritz Crisp & Thins, and Good Thins.Europe revenues are likely to witness 12.4% growth. The consensus estimate for Latin America revenues of $911 million indicates an increase of 5% from the prior-year quarter.Coming to the company’s bottom line, the snacks giant surpassed analysts’ expectations for earnings in seven of the past nine quarters. Despite lower sales growth, the company has also been able to boost its profit level, banking on effective promotional strategies, introduction of nutritious products, cost-saving and restructuring initiatives that benefited it at large.Mondelez’s third-quarter margins are expected to gain from higher volumes as well as lower overhead and advertising costs. Again, the company’s zero-based budgeting program, higher pricing and restructuring are expected to boost its margin. Mondelez anticipates adjusted earnings to increase at a double-digit rate on a constant-currency basis for 2017 and remains on track to reach its 17-18% profit-margin goal by 2018.For the third quarter, Mondelez’s Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 54 cents, reflecting a 3.4% year-over-year increase. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues is pegged at $6.5 billion, implying 1.2% growth.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:Mondelez has the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — which is required to be confident of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter. Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Mondelez is +0.84%.Zacks Rank: Mondelez carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

137,MDLZ,"The Kraft Heinz Company (KHC  -  Free Report) posted first-quarter 2018 results, wherein earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate while revenues missed the same. Higher input costs, lower sales in the United States along with higher investments to boost capabilities seemed to have adversely affected this food company’s quarterly performance. However, lower taxes and higher pricing have benefited the results.Shares of Kraft Heinz have gained 3.9% in the after-hour trading session on May 2, following the earnings release.In the first quarter, the company re-aligned some of its international businesses. It formed a new reportable segment — Europe, Middle East, and Africa (“EMEA”) by shifting Middle East and Africa businesses from the historical Asia Pacific, Middle East, and Africa (“AMEA”) operating segment to the historical Europe reportable segment.

Organically, sales decreased 1.5%.Volume/mix declined 2.5% compared with a decrease of 1.6% in the fourth quarter. This was due to lower shipments across several categories in the United States as well as Rest of World. That said, Canada and EMEA registered solid retail growth in the quarter.

The upside can be primarily attributed to the October 2017 takeover of RXBAR, improved business delivery along with favorable currency translation. The top line outpaced the consensus mark of $3.32 billion.Currency and acquisitions had a 2.5% and 1.6% positive impact on revenues in the quarter. Accordingly, organic revenues (excluding the impact of acquisitions, dispositions and foreign exchange) were up 0.6% compared with 1.5% decline in the previous quarter. This marks the company's best performance in several quarters. Except North America, organic sales increased across all other regions.Volumes increased 2.9% in the quarter, while remaining unchanged in the preceding quarter. Meanwhile, price/mix had a 2.3% adverse impact on sales versus 1.5% negative contribution in the last reported quarter.Kellogg Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Kellogg Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Kellogg Company QuoteMargin DetailsKellogg’s adjusted gross margin (currency-neutral adjusted) in the quarter was down 120 basis points (bps) from the year-ago level.Kellogg’s operating margin (currency-neutral comparable growth) was 14.7%, reflecting an improvement of 40 bps year over year. The uptick can be attributed to higher sales benefit and strong productivity savings related to the Project K restructuring program, particularly last summer’s exit from its U.S. Snacks segment's Direct Store Delivery (DSD) system.Segment DiscussionTotal North America: Kellogg’s North America sales improved 1.8% (down 0.6% organically) from the prior-year quarter to $2.3 billion. The upside was mainly driven by the acquisition of RXBAR and favorable currency translation. However organically, sales declined owing to the impacts related to the transition out of DSD in the U.S. Snacks business as well as continued consumption softness in U.S. cereal business. Volumes increased 1.5% against a decline of 0.7% in the last reported quarter. Price/mix was down 2.1% compared with 2.6% decline in the prior reported quarter. Adjusted (comparable) operating profit grew 3.7% in the segment.Europe: The segment’s revenues of $587 million improved 14.4% and currency had a 12.2% positive impact on the same. Organically, sales were up 2.2% in the quarter compared with 3% growth in the fourth quarter. Adjusted operating profit improved 1.1% as well.Latin America: Revenues of $232 million in the segment improved 5.3% (organically, sales were up 3.3%). Price/mix, volume and currency had a 0.5%, 2.8% and 2% positive impact on sales, respectively. However, adjusted operating profit plunged 32.8% in Latin America.Asia Pacific: The segment’s revenues of $252 million improved 11% on the back of strong growth in cereals in the emerging markets and continued expansion of Pringles. Organically, sales increased 6.2%, better than 4.3% growth in the fourth quarter. While volume increased 7%, price/mix had a negative impact of 0.8% on sales. Adjusted operating profit improved 17.3% in the Asia Pacific.2018 ViewKellogg expects revenue growth to be in the range of 3-4% (versus flat growth expected earlier) on a currency-neutral basis for 2018. On an organic basis, sales are expected to decline within 1-2%, of which 1% is related to the negative impact of U.S. Snacks’ DSD transition, including its list-price adjustment and rationalization.It still anticipates adjusted earnings to grow in the range of 9-11% on constant currency.Adjusted constant-currency operating profit growth is projected within 5-7% (versus 4-6% expected earlier). Cash from operating activities is expected to increase in the band of $1.7-1.8 billion for 2018 driven by higher net income, sustained working-capital improvement and benefits from the U.S. Tax Reform.Zacks RankKellogg carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Organically, sales decreased 1.5%.Volume/mix declined 2.5% compared with a decrease of 1.6% in the fourth quarter. This was due to lower shipments across several categories in the United States as well as Rest of World. That said, Canada and EMEA registered solid retail growth in the quarter.

142,MDLZ,"On Jan 11, we upgraded Mondelez International, Inc. (MDLZ  -  Free Report) by a notch to a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Going by the Zacks model, companies with a Zacks Rank #2 have chances of outperforming the broader market in the next two to three months.It goes without saying that major food companies are having a tough time due to the shift in consumer preference toward natural and organic food. The industry woes have also been hurting Mondelez’s stock price performance for quite some time now, gaining only 3.3% in the past three months compared with 4.3% of its industry. Nonetheless, we are encouraged by the company’s focus on innovation and brand building, cost savings and productivity gains.Also, upward estimate revisions further optimism regarding the stock’s prospects. Earnings estimates for 2018 moved up 0.4% over the past 30 days. This signifies that analysts are optimistic about this stock’s near-term performance. Earnings are expected to increase 10.3% and 11.1% in 2017 and 2018, respectively. Growth InitiativesProduct innovation is an important part of Mondelez’s growth strategy, given the changing consumer preferences. The company regularly refreshes its brand portfolio through innovation and reaches its brands to new geographies and platforms. Recently, the company teamed up with the third-largest cereal company in the United States, Post Consumer Brands, to create two cookie-inspired breakfast cereals.  Mondelez plans to offer more good-for-you snacks and expects 50% of its product portfolio to comprise “well-being” items by 2020, instead of the current one-third. Apart from simplifying the ingredients and improving nutritional benefits of the existing products, the company will continue to develop products to meet the growing consumer demand for healthier and natural items.It is also improving its presence in high-growth channels like e-commerce, discounters, convenience stores and traditional trade.  Mondelez inked an e-commerce partnership with China’s leading online and mobile commerce company, Alibaba Group. It expects to generate $1 billion in annual revenues by 2020 from the e-commerce platform. Notably, e-commerce net revenues were up more than 70% in the first nine months of 2017.Mondelez has been focusing on driving margins through cost savings and productivity improvement. In February 2014, the company announced a $3.5-billion restructuring plan (2014-2018 Restructuring Program) which is expected to generate annualized savings of at least $1.5 billion by the end of 2018. Savings from the program are being used to fund marketing investments and expand capacity to boost the top line and market share. The company is also working to drive advertising cost efficiencies by consolidating media providers, reducing non-working media costs and shifting spending to lower-cost digital media outlets.The company also focuses on expanding its business through acquisitions. Major buyouts include LU biscuit, Cadbury and certain intangibles from Burton's Biscuit Company. Mondelez plans to make other acquisitions, mainly in developing countries.Mondelez has been regularly divesting non-core underperforming businesses in order to streamline its operations. In April 2017, the company completed the sale of several manufacturing facilities in France and the license of several local confectionery brands.In July 2017, the company completed the divestiture of a major part of its grocery business in Australia and New Zealand to Bega Cheese Limited. These deals are expected to increase the Power Brand mix, improve growth rate and expand margins.Bottom LineThough challenging industry conditions hurt to some extent, we expect Mondelez’s focus on innovation, brand building, cost savings and productivity improvement along with acquisitions and divestitures to work in favor of the company.Other Key PicksOther top-ranked stocks in the same industry include Ingredion Incorporated (INGR  -  Free Report), Nomad Foods Limited (NOMD  -  Free Report) and Sysco Corporation (SYY  -  Free Report). All the three companies carry a Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Ingredion is likely to see a 9.2% increase in 2018 earnings.Nomad Foods is expected to see an 18.1% rise in 2018 earnings.Sysco’s fiscal 2018 earnings are expected to grow 13.3%.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +18.8% from 2016 - Q1 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +157.0%, +128.0%, +97.8%, +94.7%, and +90.2% respectively.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon.

143,MDLZ,"B&G Foods Inc. (BGS  -  Free Report) is set to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 31, after market close. The company posted a negative earnings surprise in the last quarter and has missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by average of 8.12% in the trailing four quarters.Let’s see how things shape up prior to this announcement.In the third quarter of 2017, the company had plans to extend the line of Green Giant frozen innovation products launched in 2016 with five new entries. This is expected to boost demand, thereby driving revenues in the to-be-reported quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $1.10 billion, implying 8.7% growth. Notably, net sales of Green Giant frozen products grew $9.4 million or 14% in the second quarter, driven by the brand's innovative products.We are also encouraged by the company’s aggressive acquisition strategy. B&G Foods acquired snack foods manufacturer, Back to Nature Foods Company. The deal is expected to contribute to cash earnings per share (EPS) and free cash flow.Meanwhile, the company’s earlier buyouts, Victoria Fine Foods Holding Company and Victoria Fine Foods, LLC in December 2016 and spices and seasonings business of ACH Food Companies, Inc in November 2016, are also likely to contribute to third-quarter results.B&G Foods expects cost savings from Mama Mary's plant consolidation, procurement savings and packaging changes of few Green Giant products to drive incremental adjusted EBITDA of approximately $7 million in the third and fourth quarter of 2017.However, the company expects incremental frozen, warehouse and distribution costs of approximately $4 million to impact third-quarter results.Also, the company’s weak base business raises concerns. The company's base sales declined 2.4% in the first quarter and 4.9% in the second quarter of 2017 owing to declining unit volumes.Again, the North American food industry has been witnessing sluggish growth and slowdown in consumption over the last few quarters due to a shift in consumer preference toward healthier options. This has been hurting results of major food companies like General Mills, Inc. (GIS  -  Free Report), Mondelez International Inc. (MDLZ  -  Free Report) and Kellogg Company (K  -  Free Report). For the third quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings stands at 48 cents, reflecting a 14.3% year-over-year decline.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:B&G Foods has the right combination of two main ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — which increase the odds of an earnings beat.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for B&G Foods is +4.17%.

144,MDLZ,"General Mills Inc. (GIS  -  Free Report) is set to report second-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Dec 20, before market open. It isn’t unknown that seismic shift in the U.S. food industry is creating hurdles for food behemoths such as General Mills, Kellogg Company (K  -  Free Report), Mondelez International, Inc. (MDLZ  -  Free Report), The Kraft Heinz Company (KHC  -  Free Report) and others, making it harder for legacy brands to improve sales. Although General Mills expects fiscal second quarter to register improvement in sales, we believe that the company needs time to be back in the positive territory (Read more: Will Soft Volume Weigh on General Mills’ Q2 Sales?).Let’s take a look at how the company's margin is shaping up for this earnings season.The company is currently taking a number of initiatives focused on improving operational efficiency to generate cost savings and support its key growth strategies. General Mills is on track to reduce its COGS (cost of goods sold) through its Holistic Margin Management (HMM) program that has helped it boost margins despite lower volume.By fiscal 2018, the company expects to achieve cost savings through increased efficiency, reduced complexity through SKU optimization, supply chain optimization and continued expansion of zero-based budgeting across the business, which will result in accelerated margin expansion.Buoyed on the above-mentioned initiatives, General Mills was successful in reporting higher margins until the first quarter of its fiscal 2018. Despite having profound strategic plans, General Mills’ adjusted gross margin contracted 230 basis points (bps), while its adjusted operating margin plunged 210 bps year over year in its last reported quarter. The downside was mainly due to continued decline in volumes, higher input costs on imported products, increase in advertising media expenses, and unfavorable mix that offset the benefits of its cost-saving plan.General Mills, Inc. Gross Margin (TTM)  General Mills, Inc. Gross Margin (TTM) | General Mills, Inc. QuoteFor the to-be-reported quarter, the company expects the factors to turn more favorable. Primarily, General Mills anticipates its volume to improve, banking on innovation in brand building. Hence, the rate decline of the company’s adjusted operating margin is expected to lessen in the second quarter.The company expects its margin headwinds to subside gradually during the second half of fiscal 2018. Also, it expects to generate higher cost savings during the period, driving its margins and thereby profit.Overall, this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company has plans of delivering approximately $390 million in supply chain productivity savings in fiscal 2018 through its ongoing HMM efforts that will more than offset input cost inflation of 3%. General Mills also expects to deliver about $160 million in incremental savings from other restructuring and cost-reduction initiatives, which equates to approximately $700 million in aggregate cost savings by fiscal 2018.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Zacks Editor-in-Chief Goes """"All In"""" on This StockFull disclosure, Kevin Matras now has more of his own money in one particular stock than in any other.

145,MDLZ,"General Mills Inc. (GIS  -  Free Report) is set to report second-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Dec 20, before market open. The food giant has been reporting dismal revenues for the last few quarters. Much like other U.S. food giants like Kellogg Company (K  -  Free Report), Mondelez International, Inc. (MDLZ  -  Free Report), The Kraft Heinz Company (KHC  -  Free Report) and others, General Mills too is having a tough time due to the shift in consumer preference toward natural and organic food.The company’s total sales declined 3.5% in the first quarter. Organic sales declined 4%, wider than the 3% drop in the prior quarter. Price/mix did not impact quarterly revenues but volumes declined 4% in the quarter.Resultantly, General Mills’ shares have declined 9.3% year to date, compared with the industry’s decline of 6%.Let’s see how the company's top line is shaping up for this earnings season.Although General Mills is making efforts to drive revenue growth through consumer-focused innovations and marketing initiatives in its key businesses, the company is expected to follow the trend in the second quarter as well. This is due to continued volume declines in North America.Sales and profits at the North America Retail segment, accounting for about 65% of the company’s total sales, have been soft owing to lower volumes in yogurts and cereals. At the same time, retailers are also reducing inventory, given the ongoing price war. The company’s North America Retail’s sales declined 6.8% in fiscal 2017 and 4.6% in the last reported quarter.Although the company expects organic sales to be better in the second quarter sequentially, we believe that the company needs time to be back in the positive territory. The company expects product innovations, promotions during key seasons for soup and refrigerated dough, and investments in compelling media campaigns to strengthen its brands will bring in improvements. As for fiscal 2018, General Mills expects its total organic sales to decline 1-2%.According to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, the company’s North America segment revenues, of $2.7 billion are likely to surge 9.2% sequentially but is expected to decline 0.03% year over year.Convenience Stores & Food Service segment is likely to witness 8.9% sequential growth but is expected to remain unchanged year over year. On the other hand, consensus estimate for Europe & Australia segment revenues of $454 million indicates a decrease of 7.7% from the prior quarter but 0.04% growth on a year-over-year basis. Again, the consensus estimate for Asia & Latin America segment revenues of $457 million are likely to increase 16.6% sequentially and 0.04% year over year.Overall, for the second quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues is pegged at $4.1 billion, reflecting a sequential growth of 7.8%. However, revenues of this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company are likely to decline 1.2% year-over-year.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.General Mills, Inc.

147,MDLZ,"B&G Foods Inc. (BGS  -  Free Report) is set to report first-quarter 2018 results on May 3, after the market closes.The company delivered a negative earnings surprise of 3.39% in the last reported quarter. However, B&G Foods surpassed expectations in two of the last four quarters, with the average being a positive 0.08%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayTrends that have gathered steam in the United States in the recent years include a shift toward healthier options in the food sector (predominantly fresh foods) and high level of price consciousness. Additionally, factors such as growing awareness of ""clean label"" and genetically modified organism or GMOs, increasing concerns related to sugar consumption and rising demand for free-from products are also sketching the food landscape afresh.Given this backdrop, B&G Foods has been on an acquisition spree in the recent times to bolster its healthy offerings. B&G Foods acquired snack foods manufacturer, Back to Nature Foods Company, in October 2017. The deal is likely to contribute to earnings per share (EPS) and free cash flow. The earlier buyouts, Victoria Fine Foods Holding Company and Victoria Fine Foods in December 2016, as well as spices and seasonings business of ACH Food Companies in November 2016, are likely to contribute to first-quarter results.Green Giant frozen products are expected to drive revenues in the to-be-reported quarter. Net sales of Green Giant frozen products increased more than 11% in 2017. While its spices & seasonings acquisition generated more than $260 million in net sales, Victoria generated nearly $43 million of the same in 2017.The company’s base business net sales in 2017 decreased 1.1%. The decrease was mostly concentrated in the first half of the year. Net sales in the third and fourth quarters of 2017 increased 1.2% compared with the same quarters of 2016.Again, the company’s Pirate Brands had a strong rebound, delivering a 6.1% increase in net sales in 2017.Given the weak sales trajectory, B&G Foods’ major cost-cutting initiatives are likely to support the bottom line to some extent.Conversely, challenging conditions of the North American food industry are expected to hurt its results to some extent. These have been hurting results of major food companies like General Mills, Inc. (GIS  -  Free Report), Mondelez International Inc. (MDLZ  -  Free Report) and Kellogg Company (K  -  Free Report).The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $434.7 million, reflecting an increase of 4% year over year. The consensus estimate for earnings is pegged at 51 cents, showing a decrease of 12.1% from the prior-year quarter. B&G Foods, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  B&G Foods, Inc.

This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP:  B&G Foods has Earnings ESP of 0.00%.

148,MDLZ,"U.S. food producers are striving to retain market share as easy-to-prepare and ready-to-eat food items are losing ground. A shift in consumer preference toward healthier options and a higher level of price consciousness are hurting the industry, making it hard for legacy brands to boost sales.In order to combat weak sales, food majors are aggressively trying to improve their products through innovation as well as by pursuing strategic acquisitions and divestitures. They are channeling funds toward product and packaging innovation as well as reformulating a number of existing products to meet the rapidly changing consumer view on health and wellness. Apart from this, companies have adopted multi-year restructuring initiatives with a focus on improving operational efficiency to generate cost savings.Therefore, though the companies’ sales have been relatively soft, cost savings have led to better margins. Again, savings are being re-invested in the business for innovation, brand building and marketing to stimulate top-line growth.Among the food companies, Mondelez International, Inc. (MDLZ  -  Free Report) has already reported first-quarter 2018 results, wherein earnings and revenues surpassed the consensus mark. The company posted solid results on the back of strong performance from Asia, Middle East & Africa and Europe. Adjusted earnings grew 9.6% and revenues increased 5.5% from the year-ago level.In March, McCormick & Company Inc. (MKC  -  Free Report) posted solid first-quarter fiscal 2018 results, with earnings and revenues outpacing the Zacks Consensus Estimate and improving year over year. The quarterly performance gained from positive acquisitions synergies, which led to growth in the consumer business and flavor solutions segments. General Mills, Inc. (GIS  -  Free Report) delivered in-line earnings and revenues in the third quarter of fiscal 2018. Meanwhile, the food giant has lowered its fiscal 2018 profit outlook to reflect higher supply chain costs.Q1 ExpectationsAccording to the latest Earnings Preview, results of 267 S&P 500 members are already out. As of Apr 27, 2018, total earnings for these S&P 500 members were up 25.1% year over year on more than 10% higher revenues. Of these, 76.8% surpassed earnings estimates, while 73.8% beat revenue expectations.Total earnings for the S&P 500 index are likely to increase 22.6% from the same period last year on 8.4% higher revenues. For the Consumer Staples sector (which includes food stocks), the expected earnings and revenue growth is 6.8% and 3.1%, respectively, for the first quarter.Let’s take a look at what’s in store for the following food stocks within the consumer staples sector that are scheduled to release first-quarter 2018 results on May 3.Our research shows that when a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) stock has a positive Earnings ESP, the chance of beating earnings estimates is high.You may uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Kellogg Company (K  -  Free Report) is set to report results before the opening bell. In the last reported quarter, the company’s earnings met the Zacks Consensus Estimate. It surpassed expectations in three of the trailing four quarters, with the average beat being 5.82%.The company’s top line remained subdued since 2014, primarily due to lower demand in North America. Particularly, sluggish performance of its cereal products in the developed markets as well as a soft U.S. snacks business have been affecting the company.Nonetheless, given the tepid sales growth, the company is making aggressive efforts toward improving its food offerings. The company is investing in brand building, in-store capabilities, along with product and packaging innovation. Also, revenues are expected to benefit from Pringles’ improved performance in Europe, the Parati acquisition in Brazil, better shipments, and improvement in pricing and mix in Mexico and Australia.Meanwhile, cost-saving initiatives like Project K and zero-based budgeting program are somewhat compensating for the sales decline.Overall, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues of $3.32 billion indicates a 2% uptick on a year-over-year basis. The consensus estimate for first-quarter earnings is pegged at $1.08, reflecting a 1.9% year-over-year increase.Our proven model does not show that Kellogg is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter.

Though net sales in the quarter is expected to gain from early Easter, overall top line looks somewhat under pressure from hurdles like the exit of certain low-margin Aunt Jemima (“AJ”) products, the shutdown of Boulder UK operations and soft underlying sales. Nevertheless, the company’s solid productivity initiatives aimed at generating savings and improving gross margin are commendable.The consensus estimate for first-quarter earnings is pegged at 56 cents, which marks an improvement of 12% from 50 cents recorded in the year-ago period. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales currently stands at $763.2 million, reflecting a decline from $766.1 million reported in the year-ago period.Our proven model does not show that Pinnacle Foods is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter.

149,MDLZ,"Kellogg Company (K  -  Free Report) is set to report first-quarter 2018 results on May 3, before the opening bell. In the last reported quarter, the company’s earnings met the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Meanwhile, it surpassed expectations in three of the trailing four quarters, the average beat being 5.82%.The company’s top line remained subdued since 2014, primarily due to lower demand in North America. Particularly, sluggish performance of its cereal products in the developed markets as well as a soft U.S. snacks business have been affecting the company. Kellogg missed analysts’ expectations on sales in five of the past 11 quarters.The food industry in the region is experiencing changes in consumer preference toward natural and organic ingredients over packaged and processed food. In fact, the food industry, including legacy brands like General Mills Inc. (GIS  -  Free Report), The Kraft Heinz Company (KHC  -  Free Report) and Mondelez International, Inc. (MDLZ  -  Free Report), has been displaying a dismal performance for quite some time.Kellogg Company Price and EPS Surprise  Kellogg Company Price and EPS Surprise | Kellogg Company QuoteLet’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Business in North America WeakThe North America business accounts for about more than 65% of Kellogg’s total revenues. Hence, it is evident that revenues generated from this segment largely impact overall sales of the company. The segment is further categorized into U.S. Morning Foods, U.S. Snacks, U.S. Specialty and North America Other.In the last reported quarter, Kellogg’s total North America sales declined 1.7% year over year to $2.1 billion (down 3.3% organically), owing to the exit from its U.S. Snacks segment's Direct Store Delivery (DSD) system and continued consumption softness in U.S. cereal business (particularly in the health and wellness segment). Moreover, in 2017, sales declined 2.6% from the prior-year period (down 3% organically). The trend is expected to continue in the to-be-reported quarter as well. Overall, for the first quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for North America segment revenues is pegged at $2.3 billion, implying a 1.7% decline year over year. Conversely, these are likely to improve 7.5% sequentially.North America Business by SegmentU.S. Morning Foods:  Kellogg’s mainstay U.S. cereal business, accounting for 40-45% of sales, has been performing poorly for quite some time now. Lower demand for cereals due to competitive pressure from other breakfast alternatives, including yogurt, eggs, bread and peanut butter, has been hurting category growth. In the last reported quarter, revenues slipped 4.9% and declined 5.2% in 2017. The trend is expected to persist in the to-be-reported quarter, with revenues likely to decline 4.6% year over year but improve 2.4% sequentially, per the consensus estimate.U.S. Snacks: This business has been struggling since 2013 due to weak volumes. In the fourth quarter, sales declined 5.8% from the year-ago level due to discontinued shipping through its DSD distribution system, reducing workforce, and exiting leases for its distribution centers, trucks, and other equipment and SKU rationalization. In 2017, the segment’s net sales dropped 4.1% year over year. The trend is expected to continue in the to-be-reported quarter as well, with revenues likely to decline 5.9% year over year but improve 1.7% sequentially, per the consensus estimate.U.S. Specialty: This segment’s sales rose 2.1% in the last reported quarter, marking the 10th straight quarter of sales growth, given strength in the convenience and foodservice channels, such as K-12 schools. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for U.S. Specialty segment revenues is pegged at $396 million, implying a 0.3% year-over-year and 37.5% sequential increase.North America Other: Segmental revenues grew 9.6% in the fourth quarter on contribution from frozen foods. The trend is expected to continue in the to-be-reported quarter with revenues likely to increase 10.9% from the prior-year quarter and 5.8% sequentially, per the consensus estimate.Europe revenues in the first quarter are likely to witness 12.1% growth from the year-ago level but a decline of 6.5% from the prior quarter. However, revenues for Latin America are likely to witness a 0.9% decline from the year-ago level and 15.1% from the prior quarter. For Asia Pacific, revenues are expected to register 4.7% year-over-year rise in the quarter. Sequentially, revenues are expected to be in line.Overall Earnings & Revenue ExpectationsThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues of $3.32 billion indicates a 2% uptick on a year-over-year basis. In 2017, net sales declined 0.7% (down 2.6% organically), with volumes down 3.1% as a result of soft consumption trends across most categories during the period.Nonetheless, given the tepid sales growth, the company is making aggressive efforts toward improving its food offerings. The company is investing in brand building, in-store capabilities, along with product and packaging innovation. Also, revenues are expected to benefit from Pringles’ improved performance in Europe, the Parati acquisition in Brazil, better shipments, and improvement in pricing and mix in Mexico and Australia.Meanwhile, cost-saving initiatives like Project K and zero-based budgeting program are somewhat compensating for the sales decline. Although the top line has been discouraging, Kellogg’s margin growth has been impressive. Pricing and mix improvement is anticipated to lend support to the company’s bottom-line growth. Currency headwinds are also likely to subside, further supporting EPS growth.List price adjustments owing to its DSD transition and weak cereal volumes in the United States are gross margin headwinds in the first quarter. Higher logistic expenses also remain a drag. Expenses related to brand building initiatives are likely to hit operating margin to some extent in the to-be-reported quarter.Earnings increased 5.5% year over year in the last reported quarter. Notably, the consensus estimate for first-quarter earnings is pegged at $1.08, reflecting a 1.9% year-over-year increase.Here is What Our Quantitative Model Predicts:Kellogg does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — that are required to be confident of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Kellogg is -0.34%.Zacks Rank: Kellogg carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP.

Total earnings for consumer staples companies are expected to grow 6.8% while revenues are likely to increase 3.1% in the first quarter of 2018.Some of the key players in the sector — Procter & Gamble (PG  -  Free Report), PepsiCo (PEP  -  Free Report) and Coca-Cola (KO  -  Free Report) — have already released their quarterly numbers. Procter & Gamble, popularly known as P&G, reported third-quarter fiscal 2018 financial results, wherein both earnings and revenues surpassed expectations, benefiting from higher demand for skincare products, along with fabric and home care products. The company has also lifted its core earnings per share guidance.PepsiCo reported first-quarter 2018 results, with earnings and revenues both beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Notably, this is the eighth consecutive quarter of positive earnings surprise for the company. The improvement was mainly attributable to strong performances in its international divisions, propelled by higher revenue growth in developing and emerging markets.Coca-Cola started 2018 on a strong note, beating the consensus mark on both counts in the first quarter. Apart from a significant rise in soda volumes, the cola giant gained from its growing beverage portfolio and restructuring efforts. Cost-cutting initiatives led by refranchising of its low-margin bottling operations, helped it to come up with better numbers.Let’s take a look at what’s in store for the following stocks within the consumer staples sector that are scheduled to release first-quarter 2018 results on May 1.Mondelez International, Inc. (MDLZ  -  Free Report) delivered a positive earnings surprise of 1.79% last quarter. The Oreo-maker surpassed estimates in all the trailing four quarters, with the average positive surprise being 4.43%.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Mondelez is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You may uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Mondelez has an Earnings ESP of +0.34% and Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Strong Sell) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The food industry within the consumer staples sector has been witnessing sluggish growth and slowdown in consumption for the past few quarters. The industry is experiencing changes in consumer preference (for example, a shift toward products with less artificial sweeteners, sodium and saturated fat) and consumer dynamics (such as increased need for portable and on-the-go products), demographic shifts and also a shift in demand for low-priced products.Mondelez, like other legacy brands including General Mills Inc. (GIS  -  Free Report), The Kraft Heinz Company (KHC  -  Free Report) and The Kellogg Company (K  -  Free Report), has been facing challenges to boost its volume since 2014.Nonetheless, in order to counter the tepid sales trend, Mondelez has been focusing on innovation and brand building. The company has also undertaken some major steps to improve margins, cash flow and return on invested capital. Mondelez’s to-be-reported quarter’s results are likely to gain from its Power Brands, favorable trends in emerging markets, higher pricing, productivity and cost saving initiatives, partly offset by higher input costs.For the first quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 61 cents, indicating a 15.1% year-over-year increase.

The company has a mixed record of earnings surprise in the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 1.7%.Our proven model does not show that Archer Daniels is likely to beat earnings estimates in the to-be-reported quarter. Archer Daniels sports a Zacks Rank #1, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company’s Earnings ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult.Archer Daniels has a dismal surprise history. In fact, the company has been lagging sales estimates for more than three years now. Notably, analysts polled by Zacks expect first-quarter revenues to be $14.52 billion, down 3.1% from the year-ago quarter. Though the company delivered earnings beat in fourth-quarter 2017, it recorded negative surprise in eight of the preceding 10 quarters. This drab performance can be attributed to fluctuating commodity prices, oversupply in the industry and unfavorable margins.However, Archer Daniels’ focus on cost savings to strengthen its business has been offsetting the sales headwind to some extent. Overall, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of 50 cents for the quarter under review reflects a decline of 16.7% year over year.

152,MDLZ,"The Kraft Heinz Company (KHC  -  Free Report) will report first-quarter 2018 results on May 2, after market close.Top-line weakness in the past several quarters has been marring Kraft Heinz’s prospects. In 2017, net sales declined 1.1% year over year primarily due to soft consumer demand in the United States and Canada. The dismal scenario is not expected to see a turnaround in the to-be-reported quarter. Kraft Heinz’s sales are expected to witness negligible growth (0.1%) in the first quarter of 2018, per the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Increased retail competition in developed markets, distribution losses for Planters in the club channel leading to lower volumes in United States, Ore-Ida supply deficits as well as the impact of some pricing actions and trade spend timing will inhibit top-line growth in the to-be-reported quarter.Its flagship United States segment, accounting for more than 70% of its total net sales, requires sustained improvement in sales for the company to regain its position. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment’s revenues of $4.4 billion reflects 2.9% decline on a year-over-year basis.Again, lower retail inventory and lower promotion activity in Canada will hold back organic growth potential in the quarter to be reported. Segment’s revenues of $462 million reflect 4.3% fall for the first quarter, per the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Meanwhile, Rest of World (Asia Pacific, Latin America and India, the Middle East and Africa) segment revenues of $837 million are likely to witness 1.3% growth. Meanwhile, consensus estimate for Europe segment revenues of $650 million indicates an increase from $543 million a year ago.Increased Investments to Hurt MarginsIn order to boost demand, the company is consistently investing in building go-to-market capabilities, e-commerce and digital investments in selected markets, leveraging distribution and whitespace gains in developing markets, launching a strong pipeline of “Big Bet” products innovation. These initiatives are likely to pressurize margins in the to-be-reported quarter.Earnings to DeclineDismal revenue growth and increased costs owing to various investments undertaken will likely translate into lower earnings. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 82 cents, reflecting a 2.4% year-over-year fall. The expected decline in earnings indicates the fact that cost-savings and productivity-improvement initiatives will not be able to provide impetus to earnings in the to-be-reported quarter.Also, our quantitative model predicts earnings miss for Kraft Heinz in the first quarter.Kraft Heinz does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — which is required to be confident of an earnings beat.

(MDLZ  -  Free Report) is set to report first-quarter 2018 results on May 1, after market close.The company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 1.79% last quarter. The company surpassed estimates in all the trailing four quarters, with the average positive surprise being 4.43%.Mondelez has been facing challenges to boost its volume since 2014, primarily due to soft consumer demand. In fact, the food industry, including legacy brands like General Mills Inc. (GIS  -  Free Report), The Kraft Heinz Company (KHC  -  Free Report) and The Kellogg Company (K  -  Free Report), has been displaying a dismal performance for quite some time to boost sales.Let’s Have a Look at Mondelez’s Past PerformanceMondelez witnessed a decline in revenues in nine out of the last 11 quarters, primarily due to lower demand. Mondelez’s sales were down 0.1% and its volumes decreased 0.6 percentage points (pp) in 2017.Resultantly, the company’s share price has declined more than 9% in the past year, compared with its industry decline of 15.3%.In the last reported quarter, Mondelez’s net revenues increased 2.9%, courtesy of the Power Brands and favorable trends in emerging markets. Emerging markets’ net revenues rose 6.3% and the Power Brands witnessed a 3.7% increase in revenues.Regionally, Latin America, Asia, Middle East & Africa (AMEA) and Europe registered an increase of 4.2%, 2.6% and 5% in revenues, respectively. However, North America’s revenues declined 0.6%.Organic revenues increased 2.4%, softer than 2.8% in the third quarter of 2017. The improvement was primarily driven by the Power Brands as well as strong performance in Latin America and Asia, Middle East & Africa.Pricing increased 2.1 pp, more than 1.5 pp in the preceding quarter. Volume/Mix had a positive impact of 0.3 pp on the revenues. In the third quarter, it was 1.3 pp.Let’s See How Things are Shaping Up for Q1In order to counter the tepid sales trend, Mondelez has been focusing on innovation and brand building. The company has also undertaken some major steps to improve margins, cash flow and return on invested capital.Mondelez’s advertisement spend is biased toward the high-margin Power Brands. Mondelez is increasing investments in in-store execution and advertising to support the Power Brands and innovation, funded by cost savings from its restructuring plans. The company is thereby reaping benefits from the Power Brands that include Oreo, Cadbury Diary Milk, Halls and Tang. The trend is expected to continue in the to-be-reported quarter as well, with improved volumes in its Power Brands. Higher sales from its wellness product portfolio are also anticipated to support its revenue growth. Further, improvements in China, Europe, Russia and India, along with strong pricing in the emerging markets are added positives. Notably, the company has been experiencing improvements in the emerging markets.However, softness in North America due to a tough retail environment will mar the growth rate to some extent.Segment Wise: Mondelez’s Europe revenues, comprising about 37.8% of the total revenues, are likely to witness 8.5% decrease sequentially but 6% year-over-year improvement to $2.6 billion, per the Zacks Consensus Estimate. North America segment, comprising about 26.2% of the total revenues, is expected to witness $1.64 billion of revenues in the first quarter, compared with $1.8 billion in the last reported quarter and $1.65 billion in the year-ago period.Latin America revenues of $921 million indicate an increase from $900 million in the preceding quarter and $910 million in the prior-year quarter.Coming to the company’s bottom line, the snacks giant surpassed analysts’ expectations for earnings in nine of the past 11 quarters. Despite lower sales growth, the company has managed to boost its profit level, banking on effective promotional strategies, introduction of nutritious products, cost-saving and restructuring initiatives that benefited it at large.However, higher commodity prices, primarily on dairy products, and increased trade spending are likely to adversely impact its gross margins. Then again, the company’s zero-based budgeting program, productivity savings and lower overhead costs are expected to boost its operating margin.Overall, first-quarter bottom line is expected to witness solid growth from higher pricing, higher volumes, as well as lower overhead and increased productivity savings, partly offset by higher input costs.For the first quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 61 cents, reflecting a 15.1% year-over-year increase. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues is pegged at $6.66 billion, implying 3.8% growth.Mondelez International, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Mondelez International, Inc.

155,MDLZ,"With a significant portion of its revenues coming from outside the United States, Mondelez International, Inc.’s (MDLZ  -  Free Report) international markets have contributed significantly to growth. The company generated about 73.2% of revenues from outside the United States in 2016 and 73.6% in the first nine months of 2017.The emerging markets of Brazil, China, India, Mexico, Russia and Southeast Asia offer solid long-term prospects. The company’s organic revenues from emerging markets increased 2.7% in 2016 as well as in the first nine months of 2017. Mondelez is building new plants and expanding existing ones in China — one of the key emerging markets.Another key market for Mondelez is India where its business is run by Cadbury India Ltd. The company has seen strong growth in the country in the past few quarters. India revenues grew double digits in the third quarter of 2017 owing to the ongoing momentum in products like Fuse and Silk Oreo.In Brazil, improving dynamics in chocolate resulted in a fourth straight quarter of growth. Overall, Brazil revenues were up low single digits in the third quarter. Mexico continued to deliver solid growth, driven by strength in candy while growth in Argentina was led by pricing to offset currency-driven inflation.We believe emerging markets with continue to enhance Mondelez’s prospects at a time when the North American food industry has been witnessing sluggish growth and slowdown in consumption due to a shift in consumer preference toward organic food items. Food companies like General Mills Inc. (GIS  -  Free Report), Kellogg Company (K  -  Free Report) The Kraft Heinz Company (KHC  -  Free Report) and others, have also been struggling to boost sales over the last few years. Revenues from North America were down 1.2% in the first nine months of 2017 and overall sales declined 1.2% over the same time frame.Though overall sales have been sluggish, Mondelez's margins have been consistently strong buoyed by cost savings and productivity gains.  Operating margin expanded 330 basis points year over year, in the first nine months of 2017.The company’s $3.5-billion restructuring plan (2014-2018 Restructuring Program) is expected to generate annualized savings of at least $1.5 billion by 2018. Operating margin is expected to scale to 17-18% by next year. Savings from the program are being used to fund marketing investments and expand capacity to boost the top line and market share. The company is also working to drive advertising cost efficiencies by consolidating media providers, reducing non-working media costs and spending in lower-cost digital media outlets.Stock Price MovementThough Mondelez’s shares have lost 4.5% so far this year, it compares favorably with the 8.2% decline of its industry. Earnings estimates for 2017 and 2018 increased 0.9% each, over the last 30 days. This signifies that analysts are optimistic about this stock’s near-term performance. Also, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock surpassed earnings estimates in three of the trailing four quarters, recording an average positive surprise of 2.96%.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

156,MDLZ,"Even though the picture appears rosy for the U.S. economy, this favorable economic landscape can divert investors’ focus from the defensive consumer staples zone to other seemingly attractive spaces.This is likely one of the explanations for the sector’s recent underperformance, a trend that can remain in place for quite some time. Stocks in the Zacks Consumer Staples sector are down -4% over the last 12 months, lagging the S&P 500 index’s +14.2% gain over the same time period.Continued Fed tightening and higher interest rates also remain an issue for these stocks. This is so for two reasons. First, Consumer Staples stocks, like Utility stocks, are typically dividend payers which tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates. Second, Consumer Staples companies have global operations and remain vulnerable to strength in the exchange value of the U.S. dollar. The dollar has started gaining ground lately on account of the Fed and interest rate backdrop.Also, possibility of a trade war with China continues to raise fears for companies whose business operations are likely to be hit by tariffs.Other than this, the consumer staples space is grappling with rising input costs as well as intense competition, with the latter stemming from consumers’ changing preferences and Amazon’s AMZN ever-growing dominance. This, in turn has created significant pricing pressure, alongside compelling companies to undertake aggressive promotional activities. These factors pose major threats to margins, which have been plateaued for quite some time now.That said, we believe that investors must take stock of the possible obstacles in the consumer staples sector before making any investment decision within it.Input Cost Volatility, Escalated Freight CostsInput costs play a major role in determining the performance of a company. An increase in input cost directly hits the company’s margins and profits. Moreover, any price increase to offset the same may drive consumers away. We note that many Consumer Staples companies are bearing the brunt of high input costs, which remains a concern for the future. Also, the food industry in general is battling a tough transportation landscape due to lower driver availability.This, in turn, has raised freight costs for many players like Smucker’s (SJM  -  Free Report), Pinnacle Foods (PF  -  Free Report), United Natural UNPI and Sysco SYS, among others. In fact, most of these companies expect higher freight costs to remain a threat to their margins.Moving to higher commodity costs, consumer goods behemoth Colgate has been bearing the brunt of increased commodity and packaging costs, which have been hurting its gross margin. Input cost inflation also remains a cause of concern for players like Campbell Soup CPB, Dean Foods DF, Molson Coors (TAP  -  Free Report), Pinnacle Foods, Church & Dwight CHD and Kimberly-Clark KMB. In fact, Kimberly expects commodity costs to shoot up mainly due to higher prices for several raw materials, including pulp. As for Church & Dwight, it expects both higher commodity and transportation expenses to weigh on gross margin in 2018. Sysco and Pinnacle Foods are other examples that remain troubled by both these headwinds.Intense CompetitionConsumer staples companies face stiff competition with respect to innovation, pricing, brand strength, promotions and responsiveness to evolving consumer trends. This results in lower pricing power and a decline in market share, which in turn compresses margins and earnings. For example, Kimberly-Clark’s diaper segment faces significant competitive activity, which puts the company’s market share at risk.Dean Foods also battles stiff competition, not only with various dairy processors for shelf space, but also with various beverages and nutritional products. Further, the beauty and beauty-related products industry is highly competitive, which remains a challenge for players like Avon Products AVP and Coty COTY. Results of alcohol giants like Constellation Brands (STZ  -  Free Report) and Brown-Forman BF.B may also be somewhat stifled in a cut-throat competitive environment.Strained Margins Many companies in the consumer staples sector have been plagued by strained margins, stemming from various factors. These include tough grocery market conditions, rising input costs, costs associated with meeting consumers’ changing demands and stiff competition that leads to aggressive promotions and price wars. From grocery chains like SUPERVALU (SVU  -  Free Report), food companies like Campbell Soup, cosmetic biggies like Estee Lauder to consumer products companies like Church & Dwight, Colgate CL, Newell Brands (NWL  -  Free Report) and Kimberly-Clark, all remain troubled by squeezed margins.The grocery industry has been grappling with challenges like stiff competition and aggressive promotions, which became more pronounced after Amazon’s takeover of Whole Foods Market. Traditional grocery companies are facing competition from rivals, which are strengthening their franchises and offering alternative outlets for food and other staples. Also, customers are more inclined toward private label products, which are low-cost alternatives to national brands. This, in turn, is hurting food companies.Higher Operating Expenses to Limit ProfitsAs demand for staples is usually consistent, companies strive to increase sales and market share through innovations, promotions and efficient marketing and advertising. Thus, consumer staple companies tend to spend heavily on marketing and advertising. Though advertising strengthens brand appeal and helps to counter competition, it severely hits the profit margins of these companies. Also, efforts to keep up with consumers’ changing needs entail significant costs. In this regard, costs related to e-commerce development and marketing are likely to impact profitability.Companies like Kimberly-Clark, PepsiCo (PEP  -  Free Report) and Procter & Gamble (PG  -  Free Report) have significantly stepped up their investments in marketing, innovation, R&D, supply chain and capacity additions, which may hinder profits. Pinnacle Foods has also been witnessing escalated marketing costs, and expects these barriers to linger.Emerging Market VolatilityThe majority of the global population is clustered in emerging economies. Thus, food/beverage companies are increasingly investing in developing and emerging markets like India, China and Brazil which boast significant growth potential due to relatively low per-capita consumption. Another reason is the burgeoning middle-class population with rising income levels, which in turn is increasing the demand for convenience food and beverages. Though emerging markets offer strong growth prospects, they are generally volatile due to fluctuating currencies and other structural and political issues. Moreover, any unprecedented event that may impact economic conditions in countries like China, Brazil and Russia remains a threat.Soft VolumesMany consumer staples companies are struggling with declining volumes or soft volume growth, which is hurting their top line. Mondelez’s (MDLZ  -  Free Report) volumes have been weak since 2014 due to volume erosion from higher pricing and category weakness because of lower demand. Another company that has long been battling soft volumes is dairy products player, Dean Foods.Apart from this, growing health and wellness consciousness has resulted in volume declines of carbonated drinks of Coca-Cola (KO  -  Free Report), PepsiCo (PEP  -  Free Report) and Dr. Pepper DPS, while it has also been hurting cigarette volumes of bigwigs like Altria (MO  -  Free Report) and Phillip Morris (PM  -  Free Report). Molson Coors has also been posting soft beer volumes in the United States for quite some time now, on account of difficult industry conditions.Government RestrictionsTobacco companies like Altria Group, Philip Morris and British American Tobacco are facing constant government regulations to make consumers aware of the health hazards associated with tobacco products. Well, government authorities have been brandishing the whip on tobacco players as smoking has become one of the primary causes of heart diseases and cancer. Apart from seeking authorization for any new tobacco product, the FDA has made it mandatory for tobacco companies to use precautionary labels on cigarette packets.Additionally, these companies have been directed to put self-critical advertisements on television and newspapers, particularly emphasizing the addictive nature of cigarettes. To add to the woes, the FDA is bent on drastically reducing nicotine in cigarettes to minimally addictive levels. The initiative was proposed in 2017 but was delayed due to ongoing research. If enacted, low nicotine levels will prove to be disastrous for cigarette manufacturing companies.Moreover, increasing regulatory moves have raised awareness amongst consumers regarding the detrimental effects of tobacco consumption, motivating them to quit smoking. These restrictions have lowered cigarette consumption and significantly dented volumes.While this was for tobacco companies, alcohol stocks also remain vulnerable to government regulations. Distilled spirits are subject to excise tax in various countries. Thus, rising fiscal pressure in the United States, European and emerging markets may lead to increasing risk of a potential excise tax on spirits by governments of the respective countries.Bottom LineThough the consumer staples industry is faced with a number of problems, does the sector have anything to offer to short-term investors?Check out our latest Consumer Staples Outlook for more on the current state of affairs in this market from an earnings perspective and the trend in this important sector of the economy.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

157,MDLZ,"Demand for everyday-use products created by operators in the Consumer Staples space doesn’t tend to fluctuate a lot, but it is nevertheless exposed to macroeconomic forces at the margins. As such, the outlook for this space perks up as the outlook for the U.S. and global economy improves.The outlook for the U.S. economy has been favorable for the last several years, with the recent tax legislation expected to add to the longevity of the current U.S. expansion cycle. In addition to the indirect benefits to Consumer Staples companies from the tax cuts, these companies also stand to benefit directly from the legislation, as reflected in the improving earnings outlook for many companies. That said, Consumer Staples operators tend to be global in their operations and as such don’t benefit to the same extent from U.S. tax law changes as the more domestic companies. With growth hard to come by for companies in this mature space, Consumer Staples players have to remain focused on squeezing more out of their operations and coming out with revenue-boosting initiatives, which mainly include efforts to keep pace with the changing consumer patterns.On that note, let’s delve deeper in some of the major growth-driving strategies of the space.Strengthening Product Portfolio via Strategic Alliances, Buyouts Consumer staples companies are regularly undertaking both domestic and international acquisitions to expand their product lines and gain access to new markets. Some of these are also forming partnerships, mostly with larger and better-known companies, to strengthen their distribution networks, diversify portfolios, expand their reach and enhance market positioning. Notably, leveraging each other’s efficiencies creates significant synergies for companies that go for M&A activities.Mergers of Tyson Foods (TSN  -  Free Report) with packaged meat producer The Hillshire Brands (in August 2014); tobacco giants Reynolds American and Lorillard (in June 2015); food giants Kraft Foods Group, Inc. KHC and H.J. Heinz Company (in July 2015) and consumer goods companies Newell Brands (NWL  -  Free Report) and Jarden (in 2016) were the most talked about deals. Belgium-based brewer Anheuser Busch InBev’s BUD buyout of SABMiller in October 2016 also created a buzz in the beverage industry. Apart from this, Molson Coors (TAP  -  Free Report) acquired SABMiller plc’s 58% stake in MillerCoors, which made the former the third-largest brewer in the world, after Anheuser-Busch InBev and Heineken.Cost Cutting and Restructuring InitiativesMost consumer staples companies are implementing cost-reduction initiatives to boost profits. In the latter half of 2017, Tyson Foods announced a Financial Fitness Program, with the objectives of enhancing operating efficiency, reducing overheads and fuelling bottom-line performance. Colgate CL has also been benefiting from its Global Growth and Efficiency Program, which focuses on reducing structural costs in order to improve gross and operating profit, standardizing processes to improve the decision-making procedure and enhance its market share worldwide.Additionally, Sysco’s (SYY  -  Free Report) core strategies for 2020 include plans to optimize business and achieving operational efficacy. We also commend Kimberly Clark’s KMB 2018 Global Restructuring & Focus on Reducing Costs Everywhere (FORCE) programs, which are expected to generate cost savings of more than $2 billion over the next four years. Companies like McCormick MKC, Coca-Cola KO, Molson Coors, Mondelez International MDLZ, Smucker (SJM  -  Free Report), Kellogg K and many others have also been benefiting from significant cost savings and restructuring initiatives to boost earnings.Focus on InnovationInnovation remains the guiding principle of consumer staples companies as it enables them to enhance brand appeal through product differentiation and capture market share across all regions and categories. Thus, companies put a lot of thrust on innovation to upgrade their brands and create differentiated value propositions. Notably, constant innovations supported by efficient marketing are essential for consumer staples companies to stay ahead of competition.As evidence, novelty has been a driving force for consumer product giants like The Procter & Gamble Co. (PG  -  Free Report) and Colgate-Palmolive, and cosmetic majors like Estee Lauder EL. These companies constantly come up with new products that suit changing consumer trends, to tap demand and boost revenues. Also, major food companies like Smucker and Campbell Soup CPB, alcohol stocks like Brown-Forman BF.B and Constellation Brands (STZ  -  Free Report), and even tobacco players like Altria (MO  -  Free Report) and Phillip Morris (PM  -  Free Report) have been adding new products to gain competitive edge and augment market share.Exiting Underperforming Units to Enhance OperationsApart from growing their businesses through buyouts, companies also remain focused on improving their product portfolios through divestitures. Offloading underperforming operations enables the companies to concentrate on the core and profitable areas.For example, as part of its strategic business review following its merger with Jarden, Newell Brands announced plans to sell nearly 10% of its current portfolio, including a major chunk of its Tools segment. This highlights the company’s focus on simplifying its operating structure, alongside highlighting its commitment toward making prudent investments in areas with higher growth potential. Similarly, Unilever (UL  -  Free Report) announced plans to sell its shrinking Spreads business to KKR (in December 2017) to shift concentration on fast-growing products.Adopting E-Commerce Mantra: The Need of the HourWith technology having advanced by leaps and bounds, online shopping has become the order of the day. Thanks to various mobile apps and dot.com business lines, shopping for anything is literally on consumers’ finger-tips. Consumers’ rapid shift to e-marketplace has compelled companies to adopt the e-commerce mantra. Companies like United Naturals (UNFI  -  Free Report), SUPERVALU (SVU  -  Free Report), Campbell Soup and Estee Lauder among others, are striving to enhance e-commerce space, through investments in technology and infrastructure.Driven by these efforts, United Natural Foods’ e-commerce sales jumped almost 28.9% in the second quarter. As for SUPERVALU, the company’s contract with Instacart, along with endeavors to upgrade website and mobile applications underscore its knack to enhance consumer shopping experiences.Transition to Health and Wellness ProductsAs consumer preference is the life blood of Consumer Staples, companies have to adapt to evolving trends to stay strong in the industry. A key trend over the last few years has been the desire for natural and organic products, prompting many players in the space to come out with health and wellness offerings. This is the case with almost all industries in the sector.Apart from this, tobacco companies like Altria and Reynolds American are also adapting to the evolving needs of consumers and have resorted to less harmful alternatives like electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes). To cater to changing consumer preference, Philip Morris launched the much talked about IQOS, a smokeless cigarette in November 2014, aiming to lead the tobacco industry’s push into reduced-risk products. IQOS is anticipated to boost market share and offset declining volumes in traditional cigarette business over the long term.Additionally, rising consumer awareness regarding the harmful impact of toxic chemicals has been driving the market share for organic personal care products too. Consequently, players like Unilever are making solid progress in the natural and organic products category. This is evident from its deal to buy Schmidt’s Naturals that specializes in personal care products such as deodorants, toothpaste and bar soaps. Clearly, these robust efforts are expected to boost the companies’ top line in the future.Clearly, the consumer staples space offers plenty of reasons to be optimistic about it over the long term. So how about investing in the space right now?Check out our latest Consumer Staples Outlook here for more on the current state of affairs in this market from an earnings perspective, and how the trend is looking for this important sector of the economy now.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

158,MDLZ,"The Procter & Gamble Company (PG  -  Free Report), popularly known as P&G, reported third-quarter fiscal 2018 financial results, wherein both earnings and revenues surpassed expectations, benefiting from higher demand for skincare products, along with fabric and home care products.

The bottom line increased 4% from the prior-year quarter. Currency-neutral core earnings per share (EPS) also improved 1%. The upside was primarily driven by increased net sales and a lower core effective tax rate.Meanwhile, P&G agreed to acquire the consumer-health business of Germany-based Merck KGaA for approximately 3.4 billion euro ($4 billion). Per the terms, P&G will also acquire 51.8% stake in India-listed Merck Ltd. The deal is expected to close during the 2018/19 fiscal.

159,MDLZ,"Leading pharmaceutical and healthcare company GlaxoSmithKline plc (GSK  -  Free Report) has started a strategic review of Horlicks — a famous malted milk hot drink in India — along with other smaller nutrition products like Boost. The company is also planning to offload its 72.5% stake in India-listed GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Healthcare. Although it is still unclear which company GlaxoSmithKline would prefer selling Horlicks to, market speculations point at Nestle, Kraft Heinz (KHC  -  Free Report) and Unilever.Other potential bidders include Mondelez International (MDLZ  -  Free Report), Indian company ITC Ltd., PepsiCo (PEP  -  Free Report), Associated British Foods, Coca-Cola (KO  -  Free Report) and JAB holdings.Why is Horlicks Up for Sale?Glaxo recently inked a deal with Novartis (NVS  -  Free Report) to take over the latter’s 36.5% stake in its Consumer Healthcare joint venture for $13 billion (£9.2 billion). In order to fund the deal, Glaxo is looking to vend Horlicks and other nutrition products. Moreover, Glaxo wants to shift focus toward over-the-counter and oral health categories.But why sell GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Healthcare? The Indian arm of the pharmaceutical giant has been grappling with sluggish sales for quite some time now. Revenues decreased 3.1% in 2017 and 0.5% in the first nine months of 2017. This clearly indicates that Horlicks, which accounts for about 90% GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Healthcare sales, has also not been performing well.Moreover, malt-based drinks are losing sheen in India of late. Major players in the health food drinks category have been facing the brunt of increased popularity of breakfast cereals and intense competition. Nevertheless, focusing on providing actual nutritional benefits and not just on enhancing taste can change the scenario. According to a study by Research and Markets, India's malted drink market is expected to see a CAGR of 17.4% during 2017–2021.Who All Will Show Interest?It goes without saying that adding Horlicks will drive market share for the buyer as it currently dominates the malt-based drink market in India. According to GlaxoSmithKline, its nutrition products portfolio, including Horlicks, had raked in total sales of $550 million in 2017.According to market sources, the stake is worth $3.1 billion as per current market prices but Glaxo wanted a premium in any sale. They also estimate valuation of the consumer health nutrition business at around $4 billion.Apart from the companies mentioned earlier, other potential bidders include Mondelez International, India’s ITC Ltd., PepsiCo, Associated British Foods, Coca-Cola and JAB holdings.Nestle had previously expressed interest in Horlicks. The company already has a minor presence in the health nutrition space in India with Milo.  Beverage giants PepsiCo and Coca-Cola could also consider buying Horlicks as recently they have been keen on diversifying product offerings given the slump in carbonated beverage drink sales.Mondelez, which operates thorough Cadbury Ltd., has a commanding presence in India. The company generates about 40% revenues from emerging markets, which include India and is keen on expanding in developing countries to gain scale in its categories or distribution capabilities.Meanwhile, Kraft Heinz acquired malt-based health food drink brand Complan from Glaxo in 1994. The company is currently facing a decline in sales primarily due to soft consumer demand in the United States and Canada. Thus, expanding business in emerging markets can prove beneficial.European investment firm, JAB Holdings, backed by Austria’s billionaire Reimann family is also a key contender. The company has been actively taking over companies in the consumer and food sectors over the past few years.Associated British Foods might also show interest in order to expand in India although the size of Glaxo’s business could be a drag, according to a market source.GlaxoSmithKline expects the outcome of the strategic review to be out by the end of 2018. So for now, it’s a wait-and-see story.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time. It’s a once-in-a-generation opportunity to invest in pure genius.Click for details >>

160,MDLZ,"Kellogg Company (K  -  Free Report) is launching a new flavor of cereal under the Kellogg's Frosted Flakes brand. The latest Kellogg's Chocolate Frosted Flakes has been developed in collaboration with the company’s consumers.To ensure the latest flavor meets consumer expectations, Kellogg ensured consumer participation in almost every step of the development process of Chocolate Frosted Flakes by “testing how different cocoas interacted with the cereal flake and the milk left at the bottom of the bowl.”Kellogg’s mainstay U.S. cereal business, which accounts for 40–45% of sales, has been performing poorly since 2012 due to sluggish category growth. Revenues at the U.S. Morning Foods segment, which includes cereals, slipped 6.5% in the first six months of 2017.Lower demand for cereals due to competitive pressure from other breakfast alternatives, including yogurt, eggs, bread and peanut butter, has been hurting category growth. Moreover, changing consumer preference toward healthier products has hurt sales of Kellogg’s along with that of other food giants like General Mills, Inc. (GIS, B&G Foods, Inc. (BGS  -  Free Report) and Mondelez International, Inc. (MDLZ  -  Free Report).The latest addition is expected to boost cereal demand to some extent. The company is making aggressive efforts to improve its product line. It is channeling funds toward product and packaging innovation as well as reformulation of many existing products to meet the rapidly changing taste of consumers pertaining to health and wellness.This apart, Kellogg’s is focused on its restructuring program (Project K) to drive growth and profitability. The program aims to optimize the supply chain, improve productivity and bring a new global focus on categories. The company also started an aggressive zero-based budgeting program in 2015 in its North American business to generate savings in addition to that from Project K.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

161,MDLZ,"With thanksgiving around the corner, Kellogg Company’s (K  -  Free Report) acquired brand Pringles introduced a snack named Pringles Thanksgiving Dinner in eight new flavors.This new thanksgiving-themed snack is not available for retail sale. To ensure that the latest flavors meet consumer expectations, the snack has been launched as a pilot taste test in limited quantity.Notably, the buyout of Pringles, the biggest brand of Kellogg, has helped the company offer a more balanced cereal and snacks basket and gain traction in international markets. Pringles ended 2016 with solid mid-single digit growth and the company continues to see strong growth in emerging markets across all categories — cereal, wholesome snacks and Pringles. In fact, Kellogg concluded 2016 with double-digit internal growth in its Mediterranean Middle East business and Russian business.The latest addition is in line with Kellogg’s efforts to diversify its product line. The company has been channeling funds toward product and packaging innovation as well as reformulation of existing products to meet the rapidly changing taste of consumers pertaining to health and wellness. The new flavors are expected to drive demand for wholesome snacks, helping the company gain further traction.However, despite Pringles’ robust Asia-Pacific performance in third-quarter 2017, the overall snacks business in the United States has been weak since 2013 owing to low volumes. Shift in consumer preference toward healthier food options has been particularly hurting the company’s sales along with that of food giants like General Mills, Inc. (GIS  -  Free Report) B&G Foods, Inc. (BGS  -  Free Report) and Mondelez International, Inc. (MDLZ  -  Free Report).In fact, the wholesome snacks business has been weak in the past few quarters due to lack of effective innovation. Though management is working to revive the business through investments in innovation and better in-store execution, the efforts are yet to show results. In the first nine months of 2017, the U.S. Snacks segment’s net sales dropped 3.6% year over year (also organically).Meanwhile, shares of Kellogg have underperformed its industry so far this year. The company’s shares have lost 11.4% when compared with the industry’s decline of 8.2%. Nevertheless, continuous expansion of product line and restructuring initiatives are expected to drive growth and profits for Kellogg.In fact, earnings estimates for the current year have inched up 1.3% over a month, reflecting analysts’s optimism over the stock’s prospects.Kellogg currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

162,MDLZ,"Campbell Soup Company (CPB  -  Free Report) is slated to release first-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Nov 21. The question lingering in investors’ minds is, whether this convenience foods behemoth will be able to come up with a positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported.The company missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the last two quarters. It delivered an average negative earnings surprise of 1.2% in the trailing four quarters.Estimates TrendThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fiscal first quarter is pegged at 97 cents compared with $1 in the year-ago period. Estimates have been stable in the last 30 days. Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of roughly $2.2 billion, down 1% from the prior-year quarter.Factors at PlayCampbell Soup has been struggling to revive its top line, which hasn’t witnessed year-over-year growth for quite some time. Moreover, it has missed the Zacks consensus mark for three straight quarters now. Known for its canned foods, much of the sales debacle could be attributable to consumers’ changing eating patterns and their evolving preferences for healthy, fresh and organic food products. Nevertheless, the company’s Campbell Fresh (C-Fresh) division recovered slightly in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, after it was marred by lingering constraints related to the Bolthouse Farms Protein PLUS drinks recall in June 2016.These factors have also weighed upon the company’s shares that lost 21.9% so far this year, wider than the industry's decline of 9.5%.  Further, the company anticipates the operating environment to remain challenging in fiscal 2018, wherein it expects to witness cost inflation. The company’s earlier guidance indicates that the first-half results will remain significantly soft.Additionally, stiff competition in the food industry and rising commodity prices might dent the company’s performance in the near term.Nevertheless, Campbell Soup is on track with its four core plans including focus on real food philosophy and transparency, undertaking robust digital endeavors, portfolio diversification and concentrating on growing its snacks brands. Meanwhile, the company is progressing well with its cost savings plan, which evidently helped it achieve gross margin, EBIT and earnings growth in fiscal 2017.So let’s wait and see whether these obstacles are offset by the company’s robust brand portfolio, solid cost-savings and four core plans.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not show that Campbell Soup is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Campbell Soup Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Campbell Soup Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Campbell Soup Company QuoteWhile Campbell Soup has an Earnings ESP of +0.70%, its Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) makes surprise prediction difficult.As it is, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Strong Sell) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks With Favorable CombinationHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:The J. M. Smucker Company (SJM  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.62% and a Zacks Rank #3. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Ollie's Bargain Outlet Holdings, Inc.

164,MDLZ,"Are you apprehensive that a bubble formed by an overvalued stock market can burst anytime? Or are you scared of rising rate concerns with both the Fed and ECB giving hawkish signals?Well, fear before Halloween is understandable. But unlike the real event, its effect on the market is not at all scary. In fact, instead of tricking investors, the Halloween Effect is usually a treat.Halloween Effect is a historically observed increase in stock prices from the month of November through the end of April. It is exactly opposite the popular adage ""sell in May and then walk away” which refers to the six months between May 1 and Oct 31.Among overall buoyancy, retail sales deserve a special mention this time around. Vacations, holiday season buying (both Christmas and spring season) and seasonal optimism may play a huge role in this surge.The National Retail Federation expects retail sales to grow between 3.6% and 4%, totaling $678.75 billion to $682 billion in the November-December period. Also, the International Council of Shopping Centers sees a 3.8% uptick in retail sales. Deloitte sees this figure going higher to 4% to 4.5% (without considering cars and gasoline). Forrester Research estimates that online sales will jump 12% this holiday season, to $129 billion (read: 3 ETFs to Tap Upbeat Electronics Sales Forecast).In fact, the likely rosy trend starts with Halloween itself as the event greets the fall season. And “conventional wisdom is that strong Halloween spending is an indicator of strong Christmas season spending” as per an analyst. So, let’s take a look at the Halloween sales projection.Spending to Touch All-Time High This HalloweenHalloween spending jumped three times in the last 12 Years. National Retail Federation estimated that Americans will likely spend a staggering $9.1 billion this Halloween, up about 8% year over year. Consumers are expected to expend $86.13 on average, up from last year’s $82.93. Sentiments are pretty upbeat with 12.9% thinking about economic conditions before spending, down from 14.1% in 2016.Costumes will account for the largest share of spending, in billions, though just 69% of consumers will likely go for them. On the other hand, 95% will likely shell out around $2.7 billion on candies. As much as 72% of consumers will spend about $2.7 billion on decorations and 37% will pay nearly $410 million for greeting cards.In fact, a new idea has emerged lately. People are celebrating with Halloween trees like they do in Christmas. Sales of Halloween trees at the -commerce home goods company Wayfair, leapt about 20% year over year. This upbeat numbers came despite Toys R Us’ bankruptcy and store closures by Sears and Macy’s (read: Profit from Retailers' Defaults With These ETFs).Needless to say, retail sales will be on a roll in the upcoming days and put the following ETFs and stocks in focus.ETF PicksGlobal X Social Media ETF (SOCL  -  Free Report)About 64.6% of population under the survey search for shopping ideas from social media, including Facebook, Pinterest, YouTube and Twitteralong with traditional ways.Two years ago, only 44% used to follow these online tools.

The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because Mondelez is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings—with the most up-to-date information possible—is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for MDLZ in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at 55 cents per share for MDLZ, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of 54 cents per share.

166,MDLZ,"The Hershey Company (HSY  -  Free Report) is slated to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 26, before the opening bell.Changes in consumer preference and consumer dynamics, demographic shifts, and also a spending shift toward lower-priced products have been a dampener for Hershey’s sales since 2014.Nevertheless, Hershey regularly innovates its core brands to meet consumer demand and needs that are not addressed by its current portfolio. The company’s initiatives have been bearing fruit of late, with net sales increasing 2.2% year over year in the first half. The company experienced sales growth for the fifth straight quarter after a few quarters of no growth. However, the company had earlier stated that owing to the timing of some second-quarter shipments, Hershey’s second half net sales are likely to be same as the year ago.To add to the woes, Hershey has been delivering weak performance in international markets since 2015, primarily due to soft results in China. Lower net price realization in international markets and challenges in China are expected to remain a drag on the soon-to-be reported quarter.According to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, the company’s North America (U.S. and Canada) segment revenues, comprising 89% of the total revenues, of $1.76 billion are likely to remain unchanged in the third quarter from the year-ago quarter. International and Other segment is likely to witness a decline of 0.01%.Meanwhile, Hershey’s adjusted gross margin and operating margin expanded 160 basis points (bps) and 270 bps, respectively, in the second quarter driven by favorable trade, supply chain productivity and costs-saving initiatives and lower input costs. The trend is expected to continue in the to-be-reported quarter as well. However, softness in sales and unfavorable mix are expected to hurt Hershey’s margins. Again, higher advertising as well as selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses are expected to restrict the margins.Overall, Hershey’s bottom line is likely to benefit depending on its ability to increase prices, along with productivity and cost-cutting initiatives to offset lower volumes, flat sales, unfavorable mix and more advertising expenses and SG&A costs.For the third quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at $1.28, reflecting a decrease of 0.9% year over year, while the consensus for revenues is at $2 billion, implying 0.02% year-over-year growth.Here is what our quantitative model predicts.Hershey has the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — which is required to be confident of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter. Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Hershey is +0.13%.Zacks Rank: Hershey carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which increases the predictive power of ESP.Hershey Company (The) Price and EPS Surprise  Hershey Company (The) Price and EPS Surprise | Hershey Company (The) QuoteStocks Worth a LookHere are a few consumer staples stocks you may consider, as they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Mondelez International, Inc.

168,MDLZ,"The Coca-Cola Company (KO  -  Free Report) is slated to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 25, before the opening bell.Coca-Cola has been struggling to boost sales amid weak demand in certain emerging and developing markets and shift in consumer preference. The company has been witnessing a decline in revenues for the last nine quarters, primarily due to weak volumes especially in the sparkling beverage category, and structural changes.Coca-Cola’s second-quarter revenues declined 16% year over year due to currency headwinds and negative impact of structural items. Acquisitions/divestitures and structural items had a 17% impact on revenues, while currency headwinds hurt sales by 2%. The company’s soon-to-be reported quarter is also expected to be adversely impacted by 19-20% in net revenues from acquisitions, divestitures, and other structural items. The company also expects currency headwinds to hurt quarterly net revenues by 1-2%.Segment Discussion: North America, comprising about 30% of the total revenues, is expected to see tepid growth in third quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment revenues of $2.6 billion reflect growth of 1% from the year-ago quarter.Latin America revenues are likely to witness 4.8% growth. On the other hand, consensus estimate for Europe, Middle East and Africa segment revenues of $1.9 billion indicates a decrease of 7.1% from the prior quarter and Bottling Investments revenues are likely to decrease 54% year over year. Again, Asia Pacific revenues are expected to decrease 0.4% on a year-over-year basis.Coming to the company’s bottom line, i.e. EPS, the cola giant has surpassed analysts’ expectations for earnings in 12 of the past 13 quarters. However, the company’s adjusted EPS, excluding one-time items, have fallen for the past nine consecutive quarters.As mentioned earlier, Coca-Cola expects net impact of acquisitions, divestitures, and other structural items to have a headwind of 9-10% on profits before taxes in the to-be-reported quarter. Currency fluctuations are anticipated to have an adverse impact of 2-3% on quarterly profits before taxes.That said, Coca-Cola is taking aggressive cost-cutting and strategic measures to mitigate the impact of lower sales and weak volumes. Adjusted consolidated gross margins expanded 210 basis points (bps) year over year to 62.6% in the second quarter of 2017, as currency headwinds were offset by positive pricing and productivity gains. We expect to witness similar trends in the to-be reported quarter as well.Overall, the beverage behemoth’s third-quarter revenues/profits are likely to decline owing to structural changes and currency headwind. We feel pricing gains, cost cuts and productivity savings should continue to support bottom line to some extent. The refranchising efforts, though hurting sales/profits in the near term, will result in higher operating margins, lower capital spending, and improved return on invested capital in the long run by reducing exposure to the low-margin bottling operations.For the third quarter, Coca-Cola’s Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 49 cents, reflecting a 0.7% year-over-year decrease. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues is pegged at $8.84 billion, implying 16.9% decline.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:Coca-Cola has the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — which is required to be confident of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.  Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Coca-Cola is +0.17%.Zacks Rank: Coca-Cola carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which increases the predictive power of ESP.Coca-Cola Company (The) Price and EPS Surprise  Coca-Cola Company (The) Price and EPS Surprise | Coca-Cola Company (The) QuoteStocks Worth a LookHere are a few consumer staples stocks you may consider, as they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.The Hershey Company (HSY  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.13% and a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

169,MDLZ,"General Mills Inc. (GIS  -  Free Report) is set to report third-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Mar 21, before market open.A Look at General Mills’ Margins Performance in Q2It isn’t unknown that a seismic shift in the U.S. food industry is creating hurdles for food behemoths such as General Mills, Kellogg Company (K  -  Free Report), Mondelez International, Inc. (MDLZ  -  Free Report), The Kraft Heinz Company (KHC  -  Free Report) and others, making it harder for legacy brands to improve sales and thereby profit level.General Mills and other food majors have been focusing on various strategies to combat weak sales trajectory. However, higher promotions and advertising spending to support innovation and new product launches have been putting pressure on these companies’ margins. Again, inflation in commodity prices as well as price competition among retailers also remained headwinds.General Mills has been experiencing weak margins for the past several quarters. Adjusted gross margin declined 240 basis points (bps) to 34.4% due to higher input costs in the last reported quarter. Adjusted operating margin also plunged 220 bps to 17.4%, owing to lower adjusted gross margins, and an increase in advertising and media expenses. Adjusted gross margin declined 230 bps and adjusted operating margin plunged 210 bps in the fiscal first quarter as well.General Mills, Inc. Gross Margin (TTM)  General Mills, Inc. Gross Margin (TTM) | General Mills, Inc. QuoteThird-Quarter ExpectationsThe company is currently taking a number of initiatives, focused on improving operational efficiency to generate cost savings and support its key growth strategies. General Mills is on track to reduce its COGS (cost of goods sold) through its Holistic Margin Management (HMM) program that has helped it boost margins despite lower volume.General Mills has plans of delivering approximately $390 million in supply chain productivity savings in fiscal 2018 through its ongoing HMM efforts that will more than offset input cost inflation of 3%. General Mills also expects to deliver about $160 million in incremental savings from other restructuring and cost-reduction initiatives, which equates to approximately $700 million in aggregate cost savings by fiscal 2018.By fiscal 2018, the company expects to achieve cost savings through increased efficiency, reduced complexity through SKU optimization, supply chain optimization and continued expansion of zero-based budgeting across the business, which will result in accelerated margin expansion.Also, General Mills had earlier stated that it expects margin headwinds to subside in the second half of fiscal 2018 and generate higher cost savings during the period, driving its margins and thereby profit. Additionally, the company’s higher net price realization and benefits from its global sourcing initiative are expected to support margins in the to-be-reported quarter.However, weak sales, and higher expenses associated with promotional activities and commodities could weigh on this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company’s margins. Despite having profound strategic plans, the company expects its adjusted operating margin to remain below the prior-year’s level in fiscal 2018. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Overall Earnings & Revenues ExpectationsOverall, for the fiscal third quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues stands at $3.89 billion, implying 2.5% year-over-year growth. The consensus estimate for earnings is pegged at 79 cents, reflecting an increase of 9.7% year over year.

170,MDLZ,"Mondelez International, Inc. (MDLZ  -  Free Report) has been focusing on strengthening margins through cost savings and productivity improvement. The company’s margins improved 600 basis points (bps) since 2013.The company’s operating margin grew 130 basis points (bps) to 16.3% in 2017, driven by strong net productivity and lower SG&A. On a regional basis, strong net productivity and cost execution drove margins in three of four regions. Europe delivered a strong margin growth of 160 bps to 19.7%, AMEA increased 140 bps to 13.1% and Latin America rose 260 bps to 15.5%. However, North America fell 10 bps to 20.1%, thanks to limited margin growth stemming from select trade investments and lower revenues.Mondelez has undertaken some major steps to improve margins, cash flow and return on invested capital. In February 2014, the company announced a $3.5-billion restructuring plan (2014-2018 Restructuring Program). The program continues to accelerate supply chain cost savings and reduce overhead costs through layoffs, asset disposals and implementation of a zero-based budgeting system (ZBB) to offset commodity and currency-driven inflation.The savings from the program will not only expand margins but also fund growth initiatives like streamlining infrastructure and internal processes. Mondelez expects to complete the re-structuring program by 2018-end.The program is expected to generate annualized savings of at least $1.5 billion by 2018 and annual net productivity to improve of around 3% of cost of goods sold which can be re-invested in margin expansion. In 2018, operating margins are expected to be approximately 17%.Sales WeakIt goes without saying that major food companies are having a tough time due to the shift in consumer’s preference toward natural and organic food. The industry woes have also been hurting Mondelez’s price performance for quite some time. The stock has gained only 0.4% in the past year compared with 10% decline of its industry. Nonetheless, we are encouraged by the company’s focus on innovation and brand building, cost savings as well as productivity gains.Also, upward estimate revisions further optimism regarding the stock’s prospects. Earnings estimate for 2018 moved up 3.8% over the past 60 days. This indicates analysts’ optimism about this stock’s near-term performance. Earnings are expected to increase 15.4% and 9.3% in 2018 and 2019, respectively.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderMondelez carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in the same industry include Post Holdings, Inc. (POST  -  Free Report), US Foods Holding Corp. (USFD  -  Free Report) and United Natural Foods, Inc. (UNFI  -  Free Report). All the three companies sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

171,MDLZ,"The Procter & Gamble Company (PG  -  Free Report)) is set to report first-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Oct 20, before the market opens. This consumer goods company has exceeded analysts’ expectations for nine consecutive quarters despite lower sales.The company has been struggling to boost sales for the last few years. Weak volumes and slowing market growth along with foreign exchange headwind have been hurting its sales. Soft consumer-spending environment in developed markets, particularly in the United States and the United Kingdom, also adds to the worries.The trend is unlikely to change for the to-be-reported quarter. Softness in the United States, United Kingdom and volatility in developing markets is likely to adversely impact Procter & Gamble’s results. In fact, categories in the company’s largest and most profitable market, the United States (accounting for 42% of total net sales in fiscal 2017), grew barely above flat in fiscal fourth-quarter 2017. The U.S. market growth slowed to just above 1% in fiscal 2017 from over 2% in fiscal 2016. Overall, the company expects fiscal 2018 organic sales growth of 2-3%.Importantly, Procter & Gamble expects first quarter to witness the lowest organic sales and core earnings per share (EPS) growth of the year, as the period compares against the highest organic growth base period. Top-line headwinds from portfolio choices and the recent Gillette price reduction in the United States will primarily impact the first half of fiscal-2018 results.Segment Discussion: Fabric & Home Care, comprising about 32% of the total revenues, is expected to get a boost in the first quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Fabric & Home Care revenues of $5.4 billion reflect growth of 3.5% sequentially and 1.3% from the year-ago quarter. The consensus estimate for Baby, Feminine & Family Care revenues of $4.6 billion indicates an increase of 0.5% from the prior-year quarter.Again, revenues from Beauty segment are expected to increase 2.1% on a year-over-year basis. Health Care revenues will most likely witness 0.9% growth. However, Grooming revenues is likely to register 2.1% year-over-year revenue decline.Here are the other factors that might influence Procter & Gamble’s Q1 results:To counter the tepid sales growth, Procter & Gamble has been benefiting from its ongoing restructuring program aimed at reducing costs and driving efficiency. The company has been taking various restructuring initiatives aimed at generating higher profit and lowering costs. These initiatives have helped the company to accelerate margins growth amid the slowdown in sales.The company’s focus on reducing its SG&A (selling, general, and administrative) costs and lowering its marketing and advertising spending could boost its operating margins in the coming quarters.However, lower pricing owing to increased competition in the shave care category, higher commodity costs, a tough retail environment, an unfavorable mix, and year-over-year comparables are anticipated to continue being a drag in its bottom-line growth rate.For the fiscal first quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at $1.07, reflecting an increase of 4.3% year over year. Meanwhile, the consensus estimate for revenues is pegged at $16.6 billion, implying a 0.8% growth.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:Procter & Gamble has the right combination of two main ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — which is required to be confident of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter. Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Procter & Gamble is +0.33%.Zacks Rank: Procter & Gamble carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP.Procter & Gamble Company (The) Price and EPS Surprise  Procter & Gamble Company (The) Price and EPS Surprise | Procter & Gamble Company (The) QuoteStocks Worth a LookHere are a few consumer staples stocks worth considering as they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.The Hershey Company (HSY  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.13% and carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Emerging markets’ net revenues rose 6.3%, while Power Brands witnessed a 3.7% increase in revenues.Regionally, Latin America, Asia, Middle East & Africa and Europe registered an increase of 4.2%, 2.6% and 5% in revenues, respectively. However, North America’s revenues declined 0.6%.Reported total revenues missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6,973 million, meagerly.Organic revenues increased 2.4%, softer than 2.8% in the last quarter. The improvement was primarily driven by Power Brands as well as strong performance in Latin America and Asia, Middle East & Africa.Pricing increased 2.1 percentage points (pp), more than 1.5 pp in the previous quarter. Volume/Mix had a positive impact of 0.3 pp to the revenues. In the prior quarter, it was 1.3 pp in the last quarter.MarginsAdjusted gross margin was 39.2%, which remained unchanged from the year-ago level. Higher input costs and unfavorable mix were offset by continued net productivity gains and higher pricing.However, adjusted operating margin expanded 180 basis points (bps) year over year to 15.9% on the back of lower overhead costs owing to continued cost reduction.FinancialsMondelez reported cash and cash equivalents of $761 million as on Dec 31, 2017, down from $1.74 billion at the end of 2016.The company repurchased approximately $400 million of its common stock and paid approximately $300 million in cash dividends.

Organically, net revenues grew 0.9%, which includes a negative impact of approximately 40 bps from the June 2017 malware incident.Adjusted earnings were $2.14 per share, an increase of 15% year over year, driven by operating efficiencies, lower interest expense and lower shares outstanding.2018 GuidanceOrganic net revenues are expected to increase between 1% and 2%. Adjusted operating margin is expected to be 17%.Management expects adjusted earnings to grow by double-digit on a constant currency basis. The company expects currency translation to increase net revenue growth by approximately 4% and adjusted EPS by approximately 12.3 cents.Also, management commented on Keurig's deal to buy soda maker Dr Pepper Snapple.  Mondelez had a stake in Keurig before the deal and will now have a 13% to 14% stake in the new company, Keurig Dr Pepper, when the transaction closes next quarter.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed an upward trend in fresh estimates.

(GOOGL  -  Free Report), Altria Group (MO  -  Free Report), and Mondelez (MDLZ  -  Free Report), formerly Google, Philip Morris, and Kraft, respectively.Tapestry is likely mimicking European giants like LVMH and Kering, among others, each of whom boast an impressive slate of fashion brands among their portfolios. LVMH owns Louis Vuitton, Moët Chandon, Hennessy, Céline, Dior, and Sephora, including many others, while Kering operates Gucci, Saint Laurent, Balenciaga, Alexander McQueen, and Bottega Veneta.It’ll be interesting to see what moves Michael Kors (KORS  -  Free Report) makes going forward, too. After their recent purchase of high-end shoemaker Jimmy Choo earlier this year, will the retailer follow in Tapestry’s footsteps and change their corporate name as well?As a reminder, if you feel that something was missed, or if you want a different topic covered, send an email to podcast@zacks.com.

176,MDLZ,"Tuesday, October 10, 2017It’s being called the biggest proxy fight in history: activist investor an co-founder of Trian Fund Management, Nelson Peltz, has been trying for months to attain a seat on Procter & Gamble’s (PG  -  Free Report) board of directors. The company has thus far disallowed the move, fearing disruption from high-profile Peltz. This morning — right now, in fact, P&G is putting it to a vote.No company remotely this large — P&G has a $235 billion market cap — has ever gone through this. Yet Trian routinely invests in big brand names, of which P&G has many — Charmin, Tide, Head & Shoulders and Downy, just to name a few. Trian itself owns interest in Pepsico (PEP  -  Free Report), Mondelez (MDLZ  -  Free Report), among others, and just yesterday gained a seat on General Electric’s (GE  -  Free Report) board. From Peltz’s perspective, this bid should be a slam-dunk. But the consumer discretionary giant has reportedly stated Peltz shouldn’t be granted a seat on the board “just because he can.”As an activist investor, Peltz has freely shared his opinion that P&G relies too heavily on its established products at the expense of innovation. P&G board members supporting CEO David Taylor, who took the reins not quite two years ago, are not taking kindly to Peltz’s forceful assertion that he should be given the seat. Thus we find ourselves in this current situation.Wall Streeters voting at P&G would tend to support Peltz’s entry to the board today. But 40% of P&G shareholders are retail, not insiders, and they would more likely be supporting the corporation’s status quo. At 1 P&G Plaza in Cincinnati, OH, the x-factor may be the index funds which swing the balance. Representatives from Vanguard, BlackRock (BLK  -  Free Report), and the like are considering whether to push P&G in a more aggressive direction under Peltz’s influence, or safeguard this staple corporation of Southern Ohio.P&G currently employs roughly 95K people worldwide. Should Peltz win himself a seat, many feel he would push to further consolidate its workforce, which has already been trimmed more than 25% since the company put its internal reforms into play five years ago. Pre-market trading for PG shares are up slightly, though the stock has traded down over the past month. That said, PG still trades up near all-time highs.Mark VickerySenior EditorQuestions or comments about this article and/or its author?

"
178,MDLZ,"Earnings season is still in its early stages, but the pace is beginning to pick up. Just 48 firms have reported third quarter earnings so far, so it is not much to go on -- but so far so good, with 38 beats and only 5 misses.
"
179,MDLZ,"One thing to note is that for the Earnings and Revenue Scorecards, as well as the “Growth Reported tables, are based on only those 48 firms, while the “expected growth tables"" are based on the other 452 firms. Your main attention should be focused on the “Growth Expected tables.
"
180,MDLZ,"The same is true for the ""new net margin"" tables. The quarterly reported table is only based on 48 firms, but the comparative data is also for just those firms as well. The “expected table is based on the remaining 452 firms. The annual net margin table is based on all 500 firms. Still, historically, if the first 10% of the firms have a good earnings season, most of the time the remaining firms will as well.Total Net Income
"
181,MDLZ,"As far as total net income is concerned, year-over-year growth is expected to decelerate to 15.5% growth from the 35.8% reported in the Second quarter (among the 452). That is still a very healthy level of earnings growth. A big part of the slowdown can be traced to the fact that third quarter earnings in 2009 were significantly better than second quarter earnings in 2009. Thus we are facing tougher comparisons.
"
182,MDLZ,"However, it is not all just tougher comps. Sequentially, earnings are expected to drop by 6.9% from the second quarter. In the second quarter, earnings were 8.93% higher than in the first quarter. As far as the sectors are concerned, the list of high-growth sectors in the third quarter (year over year) will be pretty much the same as the high growth sectors in the second quarter.
"
183,MDLZ,"The one exception is Aerospace, which was one of only two negative growth sectors in the second quarter, by will see more than a doubling of net income in the third quarter. The rest of the high growth sectors are very cyclical, such as Construction, Autos and Transportation.
"
184,MDLZ,"Looking at the early expectations for the fourth quarter. Somewhat surprisingly, the analysts are collectively expecting a bit of reacceleration in earnings growth, with total net income rising 21.8% over the fourth quarter of 2009. Sequentially, earnings are expected to be 5.3% higher in the fourth quarter.
"
185,MDLZ,"The thousands of analysts tracking individual companies are thus not looking for a double-dip recession, and implicitly see the third quarter slowdown as more of a pause in the economy, rather than the start of a new downturn.2nd Quarter Recap
"
186,MDLZ,"In the second quarter reports, arguably revenues were even more important than earnings. Firms that disappointed on the top line were spanked by the market even if they did well on the bottom line. In some cases, this pattern seems to be in place again for the third quarter. The most notable case was Gannett (GCI), which produced a positive surprise of 6.1% on the bottom line, but missed slightly on the top line and saw its shares plummet almost 9% in response.
"
187,MDLZ,"Year-over-year revenue growth is expected (the 452) to decelerate sharply, growing just 4.1% down from 10.7% in the second quarter. However, most of the deterioration in overall revenue growth is coming from the financials. Revenue for financials is notoriously flakey.
"
188,MDLZ,"A big part of it is interest income, which falls when interest rates are low. At the same time, though, interest expense also falls. Thus don’t read too much into the revenue slowdown in the financials. Excluding the Financials, revenue growth is expected to slow to 8.75% from 11.86% in the second quarter. This is one area where the trends in the individual sector are more important than what is going on with the S&P 500 as a whole.
"
189,MDLZ,"On a sequential basis, revenues are expected to decline by 3.2% in total, but excluding the financials growth is expected to be a positive 0.80%. That is down from sequential growth of 2.80% in the second quarter. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, revenues are expected to rise 0.23% year over year and be up 2.3% sequentially. Ex-financials year-over-year growth of 3.80% is expected. This implies continued very strong growth in net margins.New Margins Tables
"
190,MDLZ,"I recently introduced three new tables: quarterly net margins reported, quarterly margins expected and net margins for the full year. Since we are tracking aggregate earnings and aggregate revenues, this seemed to be a logical addition to the coverage.
"
191,MDLZ,"For the quarter, the firms that have not yet reported are expected to post net margins of 8.49% for the third quarter, up from 7.65% a year ago, but down from the 8.85% net margins they posted in the second quarter. In the fourth quarter net margins of 8.72% are expected. Excluding financials, net margins are expected to rise to 8.08% from 7.65% a year ago, but down from 8.50% in the second quarter and are expected to rise to 8.30% in the fourth quarter.
"
192,MDLZ,"For the full-year net margins are expected to rise to 8.62% in 2010 from 6.42% in 2009, (and just 5.90% in 2008) with a further rise to 9.32% in 2011. Excluding financials, margins are expected to rise from 7.13% in 2009 (7.81% in 2008) to 8.62% in 2010 to 8.61% in 2011.
"
193,MDLZ,"For the full year, earnings are expected to grow 39.4% in 2010, with further growth of 16.2% in 2011.  Next year we should once again set a new all time record high for S&P 500 earnings. That will be long before employment returns to record levels. These results refer to the S&P 500, which are almost by definition, big businesses, many of which get a majority of their earnings from overseas. With interest rates low, they are able to float bonds at very attractive interest rates. For example, Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report) was recently able to float three-year paper at a yield of less than 1.0%. 
"
194,MDLZ,"Full-year revenue growth is expected to be 5.05%, which does not fully make up for the 6.75% decline in 2009. For 2010, a further 5.92% revenue growth is expected. However, revenues for financial firms are flakey and distort the numbers significantly. Revenue growth excluding the financials is expected to be 8.37% in 2010, not quite reversing the 10.46% plunge in 2009. In 2011, revenue growth of 6.96% is expected. With earnings growing much faster than revenues, it means that net margins are headed higher. 
"
195,MDLZ,"It is important to note, that when we say ""2009 in this report, we mean the last full fiscal year to be reported, even if that year happens to end in June 2010. Thus, as those firms ""switch over not only the projections for 2010 can change, but so too can the ""historical 2009 results.Earnings Still Expected to Recover by 2011
"
196,MDLZ,"Regardless of some of the technical timing issues, it means that earnings will have fully recovered by mid-2011, and that full-year 2011 earnings will be 8.5% above full-year 2007 earnings (before the Great Recession started). That is years before we are likely to see a full recovery in the job market. Collectively the 500 firms in the S&P 500 earned $546.2 billion in ""2009, and that is going to grow to $761.4 billion this year and $884.5 billion in 2011. Translated into ""EPS for the index, earnings are expected to rise from $57.54 in 2009 to $80.40 in 2010 and $92.27 in 2011.
"
197,MDLZ,"In other words, then, the S&P 500 is selling for 20.4x 2009 earnings, but just 14.6x 2010 and 12.6x 2011 earnings. By historical standards that is quite cheap (particularly on forward earnings). Normally, when interest rates and inflation are low, P/E ratios are higher than average. Well, we currently have some of the lowest rates of inflation in decades and interest rates are at near record lows.
"
198,MDLZ,"It only costs the government 2.51% to borrow for 10 years. It is not hard to find good solid blue chip companies that are providing dividend yields of more than that, and not just a bunch of electric utilities either.
"
199,MDLZ,"One thing is certain: the coupon on a 10-year T-note will not increase over the next 10 years. The odds of the likes of Kimberly Clark (KMB  -  Free Report), 3.98%), Kraft Foods (KFT, 3.67%) or Lockheed Martin (LMT  -  Free Report), 3.60%) increasing their dividend in the next 10 years is pretty high. Currently, 132 S&P 500 stocks yield over 2.51%, and 84 of those have payout ratios of less than 60%. Earnings that are not paid out in dividends are reinvested for future growth, or are used to buy back stock, which also lifts earnings per share. Based on this year’s earnings, the earnings yield is 6.85% and based on next year it is 7.94%.Scorecard & Earnings SurpriseOnly 48 firms have reported 3Q earnings. The numbers are thus not particularly meaningful, but we present them anyway. Your focus should be on the “expected tables, which cover the other 452 firms. For what it is worth, we are off to a strong start with a median surprise of 6.72%, and a 7.60 surprise ratio.Positive year-over-year growth for 41, falling EPS for 7 firms -- a 5.86 ratio.Total net income up 27.7%. Pay attention to the % reported in evaluating the significance of sector growth rates and surprise medians.
"
200,MDLZ,"Historically, a “normal earnings season will have a surprise ratio of about 3:1 and a median surprise of about 3.0%. Thus, this is a very positive earnings season, or will be if the numbers hold up as more firms report. While the jury is still out, it seems like this is going to be another better-than-expected earnings season.Scorecard & Earnings Surprise 3Q Reported Income Surprises Yr/YrGrowth %Reported SurpriseMedian EPSSurpPos EPSSurpNeg #GrowPos #GrowNegConstruction 181.08% 9.09% 166.67 1 0 1 0Finance 21.94% 7.69% 11.05 5 0 4 2Retail/Wholesale 16.95% 24.44% 9.80 11 0 11 0Auto -22.22% 16.67% 9.21 1 0 1 0Industrial Products 13.11% 10.00% 8.72 2 0 1 1Conglomerates 5.83% 10.00% 7.41 1 0 1 0Business Service 6.45% 5.26% 5.88 1 0 1 0Consumer Staples 10.32% 15.79% 3.85 4 1 3 3Computer and Tech 63.66% 14.29% 3.43 6 2 10 0Consumer Discretionary 20.49% 15.15% 2.67 4 0 5 0Transportation 67.51% 22.22% 1.51 1 1 2 0Basic Materials -9.80% 8.70% 0.00 1 1 1 1Medical Na 0.00%      NA 0 0 0 0Aerospace Na 0.00%      NA 0 0 0 0Oils and Energy Na 0.00%      NA 0 0 0 0Utilities Na 0.00%      NA 0 0 0 0S&P 27.65% 9.60% 6.72 38 5 41 7Sales SurprisesSales Surprise ratio at 1.81, median surprise 0.59%, 60.4% of all firms do better than expected on the top line.

202,MDLZ,"This table shows the growth of the 48 firms that have actually reported. Your principal interest should be in the “growth expected"" tables, which cover the other 452 firms. See comment in the Earnings Scorecard section.S&P 500 reported revenues up 5.48% year over year in 3Q, down from 9.44% revenue increase the same firms showed in the 2Q. This is a very healthy level of revenue growth, but the sample size is small and un-representative.Seven of 12 sectors with firms reporting are showing double-digit revenue growth, financials the biggest drag on revenue growth. Revenue growth excluding the financials is 10.1%, down from 11.5% in the second quarter.Quarterly Growth: Total Revenues Reported Sales Growth Sequential Q4/Q3 E Sequential Q3/Q2 A Year over Year3Q 10 A Year over Year4Q 10 E Year over Year2Q 09 AComputer and Tech -3.98% -1.46% 31.32% 14.37% 36.44%Consumer Staples -15.60% 1.85% 20.76% 19.61% 18.96%Transportation 0.97% 0.55% 17.93% 13.37% 20.28%Construction -23.52% 1.35% 14.42% -11.82% -8.74%Industrial Products -5.14% 4.83% 13.74% 5.80% 11.65%Auto -7.49% 3.65% 13.20% 6.92% 12.31%Basic Materials 34.90% -11.15% 11.49% 1.88% 10.71%Consumer Discretionary -14.31% 14.50% 7.46% 6.78% 10.07%Retail/Wholesale 2.62% 11.11% 5.99% 5.14% 7.51%Business Service 1.16% 4.44% 3.60% 2.82% 0.00%Conglomerates -1.14% -4.16% -5.06% -2.07% -4.19%Finance 17.38% -17.21% -20.59% -1.15% -1.78%Medical Na Na Na Na NaAerospace Na Na Na Na NaOils and Energy Na Na Na Na NaUtilities Na Na Na Na NaS&P 4.55% 0.67% 5.48% 6.03% 9.44%Quarterly Growth: Total Revenues ExpectedTotal revenue for the S&P 500 expected to grow 4.1% from a year ago, a sharp slowdown from the 10.7% year over year growth posted in the second quarter. Revenue growth of 0.2% is now expected for the fourth quarter.Revenue for the financials is the principal source of the revenue slowdown. Low interest rates depress interest income, which is a major part of financials revenue, but also reduce interest expense. As a result, revenues at Financials are notoriously flakey.Excluding financials, total revenues expected to grow 8.75%, down from 11.86% in the second quarter.Five sectors expected to post double-digit revenue growth in the third quarter. The same five also posted double-digit growth in the second quarter and are expected be among the leaders again in the fourth quarter. High revenue growth in energy and materials is largely a function of commodity prices.Quarterly Growth: Total Revenues Expected Sales Growth Sequential Q4/Q3 E Sequential Q3/Q2 E Year over Year3Q 10 E Year over Year4Q 10 E Year over Year2Q 10 AIndustrial Products 0.05% 0.40% 21.39% 20.38% 20.33%Oils and Energy 3.36% 3.47% 18.56% 14.55% 27.70%Transportation 3.45% 1.90% 16.62% 12.83% 20.17%Computer and Tech 9.67% 1.72% 14.25% 10.12% 19.60%Basic Materials 1.38% -3.17% 13.78% 9.24% 19.41%Medical 2.62% -0.09% 9.04% 2.71% 10.09%Utilities -2.39% 12.94% 7.01% 5.35% 0.60%Business Service 5.50% 0.53% 5.86% 5.28% 7.06%Retail/Wholesale -0.19% 0.01% 5.80% -6.91% 3.47%Conglomerates 3.93% -1.11% 4.68% 4.37% 8.12%Aerospace 6.02% 3.35% 3.23% 2.70% -2.25%Consumer Discretionary 7.92% 1.61% 2.16% 3.64% 7.52%Construction -4.14% -2.72% 1.84% -3.44% 8.78%Auto 4.62% -12.67% -1.51% -8.86% 26.91%Consumer Staples 3.27% -9.54% -6.90% -6.44% 5.32%Finance 0.06% -22.49% -22.20% -21.61% 4.41%S&P 500 2.53% -2.50% 4.09% 0.23% 10.74%Quarterly Net Margins ReportedThis is only for the 48 firms that have already reported, calculated as total net income for the sector divided by total revenues for the sector.

215,MDLZ,"It’s being called the biggest proxy fight in history: activist investor an co-founder of Trian Fund Management, Nelson Peltz, has been trying for months to attain a seat on Procter & Gamble’s (PG  -  Free Report) board of directors. The company has thus far disallowed the move, fearing disruption from high-profile Peltz. This morning — right now, in fact, P&G is putting it to a vote.No company remotely this large — P&G has a $235 billion market cap — has ever gone through this. Yet Trian routinely invests in big brand names, of which P&G has many — Charmin, Tide, Head & Shoulders and Downy, just to name a few. Trian itself owns interest in Pepsico (PEP  -  Free Report), Mondelez (MDLZ  -  Free Report), among others, and just yesterday gained a seat on General Electric’s (GE  -  Free Report) board. From Peltz’s perspective, this bid should be a slam-dunk. But the consumer discretionary giant has reportedly stated Peltz shouldn’t be granted a seat on the board “just because he can.”As an activist investor, Peltz has freely shared his opinion that P&G relies too heavily on its established products at the expense of innovation. P&G board members supporting CEO David Taylor, who took the reins not quite two years ago, are not taking kindly to Peltz’s forceful assertion that he should be given the seat. Thus we find ourselves in this current situation.Wall Streeters voting at P&G would tend to support Peltz’s entry to the board today. But 40% of P&G shareholders are retail, not insiders, and they would more likely be supporting the corporation’s status quo. At 1 P&G Plaza in Cincinnati, OH, the x-factor may be the index funds which swing the balance. Representatives from Vanguard, BlackRock (BLK  -  Free Report), and the like are considering whether to push P&G in a more aggressive direction under Peltz’s influence, or safeguard this staple corporation of Southern Ohio.P&G currently employs roughly 95K people worldwide. Should Peltz win himself a seat, many feel he would push to further consolidate its workforce, which has already been trimmed more than 25% since the company put its internal reforms into play five years ago. Pre-market trading for PG shares are up slightly, though the stock has traded down over the past month. That said, PG still trades up near all-time highs.

216,MDLZ,"General Mills Inc. (GIS  -  Free Report) has been implementing cost saving initiatives, investing in consumer-focused innovation and accelerating the natural and organic product portfolio to boost its sales keeping the changing food preferences in mind.Earlier this month, the company posted weak first-quarter fiscal 2018 results, wherein both the top and bottom lines missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.5% and 7.8%, respectively.ChallengesMajor U.S. food companies are fighting a tough battle as easy-to-prepare and ready-to-eat convenience foods are gradually losing sheen. Consumers would earlier take decisions based on taste, price and convenience.This seismic shift in the U.S. food industry is creating hurdles for food behemoths such as General Mills, Kellogg Company (K  -  Free Report), Mondelez International, Inc. (MDLZ  -  Free Report), The Kraft Heinz Company (KHC  -  Free Report), and others, thus making it harder for legacy brands to improve sales.In the recently reported quarter, General Mills’ adjusted earnings and revenues declined 9% and 3.5%, respectively, year over year due to weak sales across the board, barring Convenience Stores & Foodservice, and Europe & Australia segments. Its core U.S. Retail business’ sales declined 5% primarily due to double-digit declines in the domestic yogurt operating unit and a 7% decline in cereals. The company’s organic sales also declined 4%, with volumes decreasing 4%.The company also revealed a weak margin picture with adjusted gross margin declining 230 basis points (bps) due to higher input costs. Adjusted operating margin also plunged 210 bps thanks to lower adjusted gross margins and an increase in advertising and media expense.Again, fiscal 2018 guidance seems to be a shade depressing, depicting organic sales decline of 1% to 2%, segment operating profit growth of 0% to 1% (restructuring savings partly offsetting higher investments), and earnings per share growth of 1% to 2%.Management is trying to turn around the U.S. Retail business through consumer-focused innovation and marketing. However, a material improvement in the segment will take some time.Turnaround EffortsTo regain lost ground, General Mills laid out four global growth priorities for improving its top line. Growing Cereal globally, improving U.S. yogurt through innovation, investing in differential growth opportunities and managing the company’s foundation brands with appropriate investment are the key agendas. Precisely, expanding the Cereal business includes Cereal Partners Worldwide (CPW), which is the joint venture with Nestlé based in Switzerland that markets cereal in 130 countries.The company is investing in consumer-focused innovation, marketing and accelerating its organic product portfolio to boost sales in a challenging and dynamic environment.Furthermore, General Mills is on track to achieve its cost-savings target for fiscal 2018 as it forges ahead with its margin-expansion efforts. The company has plans of delivering approximately $390 million in supply chain productivity savings in fiscal 2018 through its ongoing Holistic Margin Management efforts that will more than offset input cost inflation. General Mills also expects to deliver about $160 million in incremental savings from other restructuring and cost-reduction initiatives, which equate to approximately $700 million in aggregate cost savings by fiscal 2018.The company remains optimistic about the rest of fiscal 2018 and expects retail sales to contribute positively, beginning second quarter. Although, we do not expect significant sales growth in the near term, the declines are expected to narrow down as the company focuses more on sales growth, banking on product innovations. Hence, sales are likely to strengthen and margin headwinds to diminish as we move forward through the fiscal year, driving profit growth in the second half of fiscal 2018.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.See This Ticker Free >>

217,MDLZ,"Mondelez International, Inc. (MDLZ  -  Free Report) reported fourth-quarter 2017 results, wherein earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate and revenues came in line with the consensus mark. Adjusted earnings of 57 cents per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 56 cents. Adjusted earnings grew 21%, primarily driven by operating gains.Sales DetailsNet revenues increased 2.9% year over year to $6,966 million courtesy of the Power Brands and favorable trends in emerging markets. Emerging markets’ net revenues rose 6.3%, while Power Brands witnessed a 3.7% increase in revenues.Regionally, Latin America, Asia, Middle East & Africa and Europe registered an increase of 4.2%, 2.6% and 5% in revenues, respectively. However, North America’s revenues declined 0.6%.Reported total revenues were almost on par with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6,973 million.Organic revenues increased 2.4%, softer than 2.8% in the last quarter. The improvement was primarily driven by Power Brands as well as strong performance in Latin America and Asia, Middle East & Africa.Pricing increased 2.1 percentage points (pp), more than 1.5 pp in the previous quarter. Volume/Mix had a positive impact of 0.3 pp to the revenues. In the prior quarter, it was 1.3 pp in the last quarter.MarginsAdjusted gross margin was 39.2%, which remained unchanged from the year-ago level. Higher input costs and unfavorable mix were offset by continued net productivity gains and higher pricing.However, adjusted operating margin expanded 180 basis points (bps) year over year to 15.9% on the back of lower overhead costs owing to continued cost reduction.FinancialsMondelez reported cash and cash equivalents of $761 million as on Dec 31, 2017, down from $1.74 billion at the end of 2016.The company repurchased approximately $400 million of its common stock and paid approximately $300 million in cash dividends. In 2017, Mondelez returned $3.4 billion of capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Moreover, the company has given a boost to its share repurchase authorization by $6 billion to $19.7 billion from $13.7 billion, extending the expiration date of the program to Dec 31, 2020.2017 HighlightsFull-year net revenues came in at $25.9 billion, decreasing 0.1% from 2016 level. Organically, net revenues grew 0.9%, which includes a negative impact of approximately 40 bps from the June 2017 malware incident.Adjusted earnings were $2.14 per share, an increase of 15% year over year, driven by operating efficiencies, lower interest expense and lower shares outstanding.2018 GuidanceOrganic net revenues are expected to increase between 1% and 2%. Adjusted operating margin is expected to be 17%.Management expects adjusted earnings to grow by double-digit on a constant currency basis. The company expects currency translation to increase net revenue growth by approximately 4% and adjusted EPS by approximately 12.3 cents.Also, management commented on Keurig's deal to buy soda maker Dr Pepper Snapple . Mondelez had a stake in Keurig before the deal and will now have a 13% to 14% stake in the new company, Keurig Dr Pepper, when the transaction closes next quarter.Mondelez International, Inc.

218,MDLZ,"The consumer environment looks rosy owing to favorable jobs scenario, increased consumer spending, rise in Consumer Confidence Index and an improving economy. However, shifting demographics, changing consumer preference and technology advancements continue to pose threats for the sectors where consumers’ are the main driving force.Which are the sectors that are impacted the most by this trend? Let’s find out.Well, one most prominent sector in the lot is Consumer Staples, which deals in essential and non-durable goods that form a part of our daily lives. Products ranging from everyday grocery, food items, beverages, tobacco, and other household essentials generally make up this sector’s business. Notably, highly competitive environment, shift in preference towards organic food products, new store formats and evolving business models are major challenges plaguing the sector.Consequences of These HeadwindsWhen discussing the consequences, we can rightly quote the example of the grocery industry, which is a key segment of this sector. The industry has been grappling with intense competition, highly promotional landscape and change in customers’ taste resulting in the increased demand for organic products.As we all know, competition in the traditional grocery space mainly relates to strengthening franchises and shift to low-priced private label brands. Further, the recent intrusion of e-commerce giant Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report) with the acquisition of Whole Foods Market Inc. on Aug 28 has intensified the competition. Following this, Amazon has started slashing the prices of Whole Foods’, giving its brick-and-mortar rivals goose bumps.Moreover, as quoted earlier, change in consumer tastes to healthy products has significantly altered the fate of the food industry, where the canned products and packaged goods are falling out of customers’ favor. The impact of this trend can be clearly seen in the performance of Campbell Soup Company, which is struggling to find a place in customers’ carts for its canned soup products. This is also true for other categories, including Cereal, which is also witnessing a decline.Additionally, packaged-food manufacturers are struggling to get the right promotional pacts in place with grocery retailers and other vendors. This has left them scrambling to occupy the center grocery aisle in a store. Some retailers battling for protecting shelf space are Kraft Heinz Co. (KHC  -  Free Report), General Mills Inc. (GIS  -  Free Report), Kellogg Co. (K  -  Free Report), Mondelez International Inc. (MDLZ  -  Free Report), and Campbell Soup.These challenges have left industry players scrambling for options to improve businesses. Apart from protecting shelf space, the food industry is feeling the pressures of some serious price wars, lower market share, diversifying products, and exploring acquisitions and mergers.Other headwinds like strained margins, high operating expenses, declining volumes, slowing emerging markets growth, uncertain international markets and foreign currency impacts may also hinder growth.How the Consumer Staples Sector is Placed?We note that the Consumer Staples sector has been underperforming the S&P 500 market lately. In the last six months, the sector recorded 3.2% growth, a notch below the S&P 500 Index’s growth of 5.2%. However, it carries a Zacks Sector Rank of #7 (out of 16), placing it at the top 44% of the Zacks Classified sectors.While the sector Rank is encouraging, its dismal performance relative to the S&P 500 Index makes us cautious about placing bets in the sector.Earnings Trend for Sector PlayersThe second-quarter earnings season, which marked the second straight quarter of double-digit earnings growth for the S&P 500, is well behind us.Shedding light on the Consumer Staples sector, the aforementioned challenges surely call for a tough quarterly performance for industry players. We note that many major sector participants came up with dismal earnings for the quarter and slashed their forward outlooks. Further, estimates for these companies declined considerably following the earnings.Also, as is the general case, share prices of these companies have plunged following the dismal results. These factors considerably reduce the visibility for these stocks to beat estimates in the quarter ahead.Surely, investing in companies that deliver positive surprises can fetch handsome returns for investors. On the flip side, investors prefer to sideline stocks that have a dismal surprise trend to avoid portfolio mishaps.Here is the key to any investment portfolio, picking the most lucrative stocks and doing away with stocks that have little visibility.Consumer Staples Stocks to Avoid After Earnings SlumpHence, we bring you five stocks from the Consumer Staples sector that have disappointed in the most recent quarter and witnessed decline in share price following the results. We suggest avoiding these stocks, which also carry Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell), possess a negative surprise trend and have witnessed downward estimate revisions.First on the list is Avon Products Inc. (AVP  -  Free Report), a global direct-selling beauty company offering cosmetics, fragrances, toiletries, jewelry, and accessories. The company currently has a Zacks Rank #5 and reported negative earnings surprise of 150% in second-quarter 2017. Results for the most recent quarter were primarily impacted by strong comparisons with the prior-year quarter. Another major setback for the company has been weak Active Representatives growth, which is hurting results for the past few quarters. The company has lagged earnings estimates for four consecutive quarters, with an average miss of 90.7%. Additionally, estimate for the current fiscal has declined 55% to 9 cents per share in the last 60 days. Moreover, the stock declined a solid 25.9% since reporting dismal earnings on Aug 3, underperforming the industry’s 1.7% gain.Campbell Soup Company (CPB  -  Free Report), with a Zacks Rank #4 and earnings miss of 5.5% in fourth-quarter fiscal 2017, is also in the red. This worldwide manufacturer and marketer of high-quality, branded convenience food products has lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the last two quarters, reporting an average negative surprise of 1.2% in the trailing four quarters. Much of this debacle could be attributed to a difficult packaged food industry landscape, where sales have been soft due to consumers changing food preferences, evolving shopping trends and tough retail environment. Also, the company expects a tough operating scenario in fiscal 2018, which led to a cautious view. Estimate for the current fiscal has declined 3.7% to $3.10 per share in the last 30 days. Further, the stock has fallen 5% since reporting results on Aug 31, against the industry’s 1.1% upside.Another stock to avoid is Dean Foods Company (DF  -  Free Report), a leading processor and distributor of milk and other dairy products in the United States as well as a leading manufacturer of various specialty food products. The stock has declined 26.1% since posting dismal second-quarter 2017 results on Aug 8, wider than the industry’s fall of 23.9%. Moreover, the company has reported negative earnings surprise in four of the last five quarters, with an average four-quarter miss of 15.2%. The company has been facing a tough retailing on account of fast-evolving consumer trends. Moreover, Dean Foods’ volumes have been under pressure due to stiff competition and macro factors. These factors, along with high raw milk costs led the company to post a negative surprise of 30% in the second quarter. Estimate of 85 cents per share for full-year 2017 has declined 37% in the last 60 days. The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #5.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Next is B&G Foods Inc. (BGS  -  Free Report), the manufacturer, seller and distributor a portfolio of shelf-stable, and frozen food and household products in the United States, Canada, and Puerto Rico. The company delivered a negative earnings surprise of 16.3% in second-quarter 2017, mainly hurt by industry-wide challenges. Further, it lowered adjusted earnings and adjusted EBITDA guidance for 2017. The company has an average negative surprise of 8.1% in the trailing four quarters. Further, estimates for 2017 dipped 1.9% to $2.12 per share in the last 30 days. This Zacks Rank #4 company has declined 3.4% since reporting second-quarter results on Aug 4, underperforming the industry’s 2.6% downside.Lastly, we would suggest avoiding Spectrum Brands Holdings, Inc. (SPB  -  Free Report), with a Zacks Rank #4 and a negative earnings surprise of 10.9% in third-quarter fiscal 2017. The lower-than-expected results were due to lower volumes, foreign currency headwinds and soft sales at personal care and small appliances segments. This consumer products company has reported earnings miss in the last two quarters, with an average negative surprise of 2.7% in the trailing four quarters. Moreover, estimate for the current fiscal has fallen 0.4% to $5.57 per share in the last 30 days. Further, the stock has fallen 14.5% since reporting earnings on Jul 27, compared with the industry’s 5.7% declineLooking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?  Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.     Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

219,MDLZ,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for Mondelez International, Inc. (MDLZ  -  Free Report). Shares have lost about 6.1% in that time frame, underperforming the market.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to the stock's next earnings release, or is it due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Second Quarter 2017 ResultsMondelez reported second-quarter 2017 results, with both earnings and revenues surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Second-quarter adjusted earnings of 48 cents per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 46 cents by 4.3%.Adjusted earnings grew 19%, primarily driven by operating gains and lower divestiture-related costs.Sales DetailsNet revenue declined 5% year over year to $5.99 billion due to negative currency impact and global cyber attack.

Power Brands also witnessed 3% decline in revenues.Regionally, Asia, Middle East & Africa, Europe, and North America registered a respective 3.6%, 5.3% and 8.5% decline in revenues. However, Latin America’s revenues increased 0.6%.Reported total revenues exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.95 billion.Organic revenues however declined 2.7%, softer than the 0.6% growth seen last quarter.

Volume mix decreased 3.8%, wider than the 0.5% decline in the last quarter.MarginsAdjusted gross margin decreased 10 basis points (bps) year over year to 40%, as strong net productivity and pricing gains were primarily offset by an unfavorable mix and higher input costs.However, adjusted operating margin increased 90 bps year over year to 15.8% on the back of lower selling, general and administrative costs.Category PerformanceBiscuits: Net revenues declined 3.6% year over year.Chocolate: Revenues grew 1.3% year over year.Gum and candy: Revenues declined 12.4% from the prior-year quarter.Beverages: Revenues deteriorated 15.8% compared to the prior-year quarter.Cheese & Grocery: Revenues were down 8.2% year over year.Segment DiscussionLatin America: Revenues increased 0.6% to $848 million.

Organically, revenues decreased 0.7% owing to the impact of the introduction of Goods & Service Tax (GST) in India and the malware incident. Pricing improved 1.8%.

Organically, revenues decreased 0.7% primarily due to the malware incident. Volume/mix dipped 0.8%, while Pricing declined 0.1%.Adjusted operating income margin was up 220 bps to 19%, driven by strong net productivity, lower overheads and decreased A&C costs.North America: Revenues fell 8.5% to $1.6 billion due to weak category growth. Organically, revenues decreased 8.1%, the impact of the malware incident being the highest in this region. Volume/mix declined 6.6% and pricing decreased 1.5%.Adjusted operating income margin declined 250 bps to 19.2%.FinancialsMondelez reported cash and cash equivalents of $1.4 billion as on Jun 30, 2017, down from $1.74 billion at the end of 2016.The company returned $900 million of capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends in the second quarter.Mondelez also announced a quarterly cash dividend of 22 cents per share, reflecting an increase of 16%.2017 Guidance ReaffirmedOrganic net revenue is expected to increase 1% in 2017.Adjusted operating margin is still expected in the mid 16% range.

220,MDLZ,"Shares of Campbell Soup (CPB  -  Free Report) got canned on Thursday after the company reported both fourth quarter and full-year sales declines. Campbell’s poor performance also helped send the rest of the packaged food industry lower, nearly across the board.Campbell’s fourth-quarter revenues fell by 1% from the year-ago period to $1.664 billion, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.689 billion. The company also failed to meet our earnings estimates, posting earnings of $0.52 a share against the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.55.The canned soup giant’s full-year sales dipped by 1% to $7.890 billion, based mostly on an overall drop in organic sales due to lower volume and greater promotional spending. Campbell’s now projects that full-year revenues could fall by as much as 2% next year.“The operating environment for the packaged foods industry remains challenging due to shifting demographics, changing consumer preferences for food, the adoption of new shopping behaviors and the dynamic retailer landscape,” Campbell’s President and CEO Denise Morrison said in a statement. “In these times, sales growth remains a challenge.”The CEO noted that drastically changing consumer shopping trends have greatly impacted the company’s non-refrigerated canned and bottled goods sales, which are now seemingly outdated. Morrison also pointed to the rise of self-cooking delivery companies, such as Blue Apron (APRN), as well as an increase of private label brands, as major reasons for Campbell’s poor sales.Campbell’s biggest business sector, its soup and juice division, saw its sales sink 3% in its fourth-quarter. Sales of its packaged snack segment, including Pepperidge Farm and Goldfish, were flat. On the bright side, Campbell’s Bolthouse Farms fresh food sector experienced a 1% gain.Still, Thursday’s report marked Campbell’s 11th straight quarterof falling sales. Campbell’s stock tanked by over 7% and touched a new two-year intraday trading low of $46.43 a share.Packaged Food Industry  Campbell’s rough day helped send the rest of the packaged food industry down overall, as the soup maker’s predicament is hardly unique. With companies such as Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report), Wal-Mart (WMT  -  Free Report), and Costco (COST  -  Free Report) growing larger, brands hold less and less leverage in price negotiations.“Right now, the retailers, they’re doing better in this round of the fight,” Warren Buffett said in a recent interview with CNBC.Buffett, an investor and Kraft Heinz (KHC  -  Free Report) board member, saw shares of the packaged food powerhouse fall 1.72% on Thursday. Mondelez International (MDLZ  -  Free Report) stock dropped by 2.03%, while shares of Conagra Brands (CAG  -  Free Report) dipped 0.82%.Shares of General Mills (GIS  -  Free Report) and Kellogg Company (K  -  Free Report) both sunk to new 52-week intraday   lows. B&G Foods Inc. (BGS  -  Free Report) also hit a new 52-week low, while Hormel Foods (HRL  -  Free Report) and Pinnacle Foods (PF  -  Free Report) both saw their stock prices dip marginally.One Simple Trading IdeaSince 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year.

221,MDLZ,"Shares of Mondelez International Inc. (MDLZ  -  Free Report), a U.S. food and beverage company, tumbled as much as 3.6% to $40.39 in the intraday trading on Aug 30 after billionaire investor Warren Buffett crushed rumors of The Kraft Heinz Company’s (KHC  -  Free Report) interest in acquiring Mondelez.While speaking to CNBC, when asked if Kraft Heinz, in which Buffett holds a 26.7% stake, would be interested to take over the Oreos and Triscuits maker, Buffett told CNBC, “I think the answer is no on that.”Analysts have been long speculating that Kraft Heinz would pursue another acquisition after the company’s failed $143 billion bid to take over Unilever plc (UL  -  Free Report) earlier this year. The obvious choice was Mondelez, as it was once part of Kraft until it was spun off into a separate snack food company in 2012 to focus more on international markets.Investors should note that Unilever rejected Kraft Heinz’s $143 billion merger proposal in February stating that that there is no financial or strategical merit in it. As a result, Kraft Heinz withdrew its offer. Initially, Kraft Heinz made clear its intentions of working out a deal for the Anglo-Dutch consumer goods giant Unilever.Meanwhile, Mondelez has been witnessing weak volumes since 2014 because of lower demand. In fact, Mondelez has been witnessing sluggish sales results ever since it split from Kraft Foods due to global snacking category slowdown.Mondelez’s volumes were down 0.3% in 2016 and 2.1% in the first half of 2017. The company’s net revenues declined 2.8% in the first six months of 2017. Even, Kraft Heinz has been witnessing top-line weakness for the past several quarters. Its reported sales of $13.04 billion declined 2.4% year over year in the first six months of 2017 due to soft consumer demand in North America and Canada.Mondelez and Kraft Heinz, like many other U.S. food producers, have been struggling due to the shift in consumer preference toward natural and organic ingredients over packaged and processed food. Another company, General Mills, Inc.’s (GIS  -  Free Report) sales too have declined 6.8% in fiscal 2017 and the company’s slowing organic volumes are overshadowing minor improvements in profit margins.Mondelez’s shares have lost 5.5% so far this year, compared with the 9% dip of its industry. Earnings estimates moved down 1.8% for the current quarter over the last 30 days. Meanwhile, Kraft Heinz shares have lost 6.7% year to date.Zacks RankWhile Mondelez carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), Kraft Heinz hold a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 (Strong Buy) Rank stocks here.One Simple Trading IdeaSince 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year.

222,MDLZ,"Earnings Preview 4/30/10
"
223,MDLZ,"Earnings season will be in full gear next week as 991 firms report, including 99 (1/5) of the firms in the S&P 500. The list of companies reporting includes such heavy-hitters as Kraft (KFT), Merck (MRK  -  Free Report), Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report), Time Warner (TWX) and Duke Energy (DUK).
"
224,MDLZ,"In addition to the ongoing earnings parade, there will also be a heavy calendar of economic data, with several numbers that could have a big impact on the market. We start the week with March data on Personal Income and Spending, along with data on auto sales. Along the way, we get both sets of ISM numbers as well as the productivity growth in the first quarter. This all leads up to the biggest number of all: the employment report on Friday.MondayPersonal Income is expected to have risen by 0.3% in March after having been unchanged in February. Personal income is a broad measure that not only includes wages and salaries, but government transfer payments, dividend checks and rental income. It ultimately is the chief source of fuel for consumer spending.Personal Spending is expected to rise by 0.6% in March up from 0.3% growth in February. If spending is rising faster than income, then it means that the savings rate is falling. In the short term, that is good news since a falling savings rate helps boost the economy. In the long term, it is very bad news since it starves the economy of the investment capital it needs for growth (or forces us to import the capital in the form of a higher trade deficit). Over the long term, the current U.S. savings rates, which are among the lowest in the world, are unsustainable. A core dilemma for the U.S. economy is the fact that it is impossible to move from an unsustainably low savings rate to a higher savings rates without the savings rate actually rising and thus slowing economic growth.The ISM Manufacturing survey (PMI) is expected to show growth accelerating in the manufacturing sector with a reading of 60.0, up from 59.6 in March. The index is constructed so that any reading over 50 indicates expansion, and a reading below the magic 50 level means contraction. It is a compilation of ten sub-indexes covering things like the level of production, new orders, and employment levels. An overall reading of 60.0 is a very healthy level, but there is more information to be gleaned in looking at the behavior of the sub-indexes, as well.Construction spending is expected to have contracted again in March, but at only 0.3% rather than the 1.3% decline in February. Don’t read the slower rate of decline as being all that much good news, however. The decline in February was probably exaggerated by the blizzards. Construction, both residential and commercial, continues to act as a major drag on the economic recovery.  Auto and truck sales are expected to have fallen back slightly in April, with consensus expectations of a rate of 4.2 million for autos, down from 4.3 million in March and truck sales falling to 4.6 million from 4.8 million. Personally, I think there is enough momentum that sales will surprise to the upside. On the other hand, March sales were boosted by heavy incentive spending.TuesdayFactory Orders are expected to have fallen by 0.2% in March, partly reversing a 0.6% gain in February. This report is mostly “old news, as the most volatile part of factory orders are the orders for durable goods that were already released (they were strong, with the exception of the very lumpy civilian aircraft category).Pending Home Sales are expected to have risen by 5.0% on top of a 8.2% rise in February. With the end of the homebuyer tax credit approaching, I’ll take the ""over"" on this one as well, although there will be much more of that impact in the April report, which will be coming out a month from now. The bigger question is how much of a sales hangover we have in May and June from the party in April. WednesdayThe ADP “appetizer for the big employment report main course on Friday is expected to show an increase of 30,000 private sector jobs. Last month the survey greatly undershot the “official BLS numbers by reporting a loss of 23,000 jobs while the BLS noted a gain of over 100,000 private sector jobs. The ADP survey does not include government workers at any level. With the ongoing hiring for the Census, that is a very large difference at this time.The ISM Non-Manufacturing, or Service, index is expected to show growth in the Service sector (far larger than the Manufacturing sector) accelerating with a reading of 56.1, up from 55.4. The Service index has lagged well behind the Manufacturing index for several months now, but has also been seeing steady increases. As with the Manufacturing index, it is based on a Magic 50 number and is comprised of 10 sub-indexes, each of which provides useful information in addition to the headline number.
"
225,MDLZ,"Thursday Weekly initial claims for unemployment insurance come out. They fell 11,000 in the last week to 448,000. After a huge downtrend from mid-April through the end of 2009, initial claims have become very erratic so far in 2010. Look for them to fall again next week, with the consensus looking for 440,000. Longer term, we have made good progress, but not good enough. We probably need for weekly claims (and the four-week moving average of them) to get down to closer to 400,000 to signal that the economy is on balance adding jobs. We are a lot closer now than we were last spring when they were running north of 640,000 on a consistent basis, but we still have a ways to go.Continuing claims have also been in a steep downtrend of late. However, that is in part due to people simply exhausting their regular state benefits, which run out after 26 weeks. If one factors in the extended claims paid by the Federal government as part of the Stimulus program, claims soared last week. Looking at just the regular continuing claims numbers is a serious mistake. They only include a little over half of the unemployed now given the unprecedentedly high duration of unemployment figures. Last week regular continuing claims were 4.645 million, down 18,000 from the previous week. Extended claims (paid from Federal ARRA funds) were 5.403 million, a decline of 91,000. That decline was probably as much the result of people falling off the rolls due to even the extended benefits running out, not because they all found new jobs. Make sure to look at both sets of numbers! Many of the press reports will not, but we will here at Zacks.The rate of Productivity growth is expected to have slowed to 2.4% from the breakneck pace of 6.9% it recorded in the fourth quarter. Over the very long term, productivity growth is one of the most important of all economic statistics, since it governs the growth of GDP per capita, which is really the measure of how rich the country is, more than total GDP. After all, even under Mao, China had a larger GDP than Sweden, even though no one would have thought that the Chinese were richer than the Swedes. In the short-term, though, it means that we are able to make the same amount of stuff with fewer workers, which is really not what we want when faced with persistently high unemployment. The expected rate of 2.4% is more consistent with the long-term trend. The 6.9% rate of the fourth quarter, and the even faster rate in the third quarter of 7.8%, are reflective of an economic rebound and are not sustainable over the long term. If the number comes in higher than the 2.4% rate, look for an upward revision to the 3.2% rate of GDP growth.FridayThe unemployment rate is expected to remain at 9.7% for the fourth month in a row. If this number surprises, it is likely to come in higher rather than lower, even if the economy starts to add jobs as in economic recoveries the civilian participation rate, or the percentage of the population that is either working or wants to work tends to rise. The participation rate has already started to increase, rising by 0.1% in each of the last three months, a trend that is likely to accelerate.The economy is expected to have added 187,000 more jobs in April, on top of the 162,000 it added in March. While that certainly is a massive improvement over the loss of a quarter million jobs a month that the economy was recording in late 2008 and early 2009, at that rate it will take a very long time to make up for the 8.4 million jobs that have been lost in the downturn. Of particular interest will be two types of temporary jobs. Regular temporary workers from places like Kelly Services (KELYA) are a good leading indicator of future employment trends. The other temporary jobs of note will be new Census jobs, which are a once a decade short-term boost to the employment numbers. While the jobs pay fairly well and are better than people being unemployed, growth that comes from that source will be considered low quality growth since the jobs will only last five or six months at the most.Other data to look for in the report are the unemployment duration numbers, which have been particularly awful in this downturn and hit new records in March. Check the under-employment rate (U-6), which includes the discouraged workers as well as those that are only working part time but want full-time jobs, the length of the average work week -- which is expected to remain flat at 34.0 hours -- and the employment-to-population ratio (also known as the employment rate, which measures the percentage of the population, including the very young and very old) -- that are working. Also average hourly earnings, which are expected to rise by 0.1%, would reverse a 0.1% decline in March.Consumer Credit (not including real estate backed debt like mortgages) is expected to have declined by $3.9 billion in March on top of a $11.5 billion decline in February. This downturn has been unusual in the extent that consumer credit has declined as people try to restore their personal balance sheets.Potential Positive Surprises
"
226,MDLZ,"Historically, the best indicators of firms likely to report positive surprises are a recent history of positive surprises and rising estimates going into the report. The Zacks Rank is also a good indicator of potential surprises. While normally firms that report better-than-expected earnings rise in reaction, that has not been the case so far this quarter. While pickings are getting slim, some of the companies that have these characteristics include:
"
227,MDLZ,"Drew Industries (DW) is expected to report EPS of $0.31, up from a loss of $0.34 per share a year ago.  Last time out, DW posted a positive surprise of 5.3%, and over the last month the mean estimate for its first quarter earnings is up 33.33%. DW has a Zacks #1 Rank.Perkin Elmer (PKI) is expected to post EPS of $0.28, up from $0.26 a year ago. Last time, PKI beat expectations by 4.9%, and over the last month analysts have raised their estimates for the about-to-be-reported quarter by 0.44%. PKI is a Zacks #2 Ranked stock.Sysco Systems (SYS) is expected to post EPS of $0.41, up from $0.38 a year ago. Last time out, the company beat expectations by 7.1%. Over the last month, estimates for the quarter are up 1.61%. SYS is a Zacks #2 Ranked stock.Potential Negative SurprisesCenterpoint Energy (CNP) is expected to post EPS of $0.29 a share, versus EPS of $0.19 a year ago. Last time, they reported 10.0% below expectations. For this Zacks #5 Ranked stock, analysts have cut the estimates for this quarter over the last month by 2.05%.
"
228,MDLZ,"Pepco (POM) is expected to earn $0.20 a share this quarter, up from of $0.17 a year ago. They were in line with expectations last time out. Analysts have cut the estimate for this quarter by 15.0% over the last month. The stock holds a Zacks #5 Rank.Vulcan Materials (VMC) is expected to lose $0.37, versus a loss of $0.29 a year ago. Last time out, this Zacks #5 Ranked stock disappointed, but the amount could not be calculated since the expectations were for break-even and over the last month analysts have shaved their

233,MDLZ,"The time is ripe for picking chocolate stocks as cocoa prices continue to melt down. This is primarily due to copious supply and fading demand, as growing health consciousness continues to grip consumers. As per a recent Bernstein research, the price of cocoa has plunged 37% since last summer and is expected to trickle down for the next few years.This makes The Hershey Company (HSY  -  Free Report), the largest chocolate manufacturer in North America as well as a global leader in chocolate and non-chocolate confectionery, a special treat for chocolate investors.Analyst Alexia Howard of Bernstein stated, “Easing cocoa prices could be a major tailwind as we move out into 2018, more than offsetting the relatively mild inflation in dairy prices.” This is assuming that cocoa comprises an estimated 10% to 15% of Hershey’s cost of goods sold or COGS. Also, considering that cocoa will account for 10% of Hershey COGS, Howard's estimates a 30% decline in input prices, which in turn is likely to boost gross margin to 47.8% from 46.2% in a year, thereby lifting earnings per share by 8.6% or 42 cents.Moreover, Howard’s thesis is backed by the U.S. chocolate industry’s growth prospects driven by the snacking trends among millennials and more product innovation, as Mondelez International Inc. (MDLZ  -  Free Report) increased its competition.What Hershey’s Q2 Numbers Have to SayHershey’s second-quarter 2017 earnings per share improved from the year-ago profit level by 28.2%, driven by higher sales, solid gross margin expansion and operating income improvement in the International segment.More precisely, the company’s adjusted gross margin expanded 160 basis points (bps) to 47.1%. The company stressed that this upside was driven by supply chain productivity, cost-saving initiatives and lower input costs. For the full year, the chocolate maker also expects adjusted gross margin to rise about 50 bps, buoyed by lower input costs (higher than earlier anticipated) and by productivity and cost-savings initiatives. These positives is likely to offset fixed costs volume absorption due to lower sales, unfavorable product mix and the rollout of new packaging formats.It is to be borne in mind, Hershey has been reporting weak top-line growth for the last few years due to persistent macroeconomic challenges in China as well as a shift in consumer preference toward products with less artificial sweeteners, sodium and saturated fat. As a result, Hershey, like a number of U.S. food producers such as Mondelez, B&G Foods, Inc. (BGS  -  Free Report) and General Mills, Inc. (GIS  -  Free Report), has been grappling with declining demand.That said, the company’s net sales improved 1.5% year over year in the second quarter owing to strong performance by the North America segment and the acquisition of barkTHINS brand. This marks the fifth straight quarter of sales rise after a few quarters of no growth.Again, adjusted operating profit increased about 16.9% from the year-ago period, resulting in operating profit margin of 20.8%, an increase of 270 basis points. The increase was driven by higher gross profit and lower SG&A due to productivity and cost savings.Other Relevant MetricsHershey’s shares have gained 1.7% so far this year compared with the industry’s decline of 22.5%. Estimates for 2017 and 2018 have remained stable over the last 30 days. Hershey has been able to beat earnings estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, resulting in an average positive surprise of 10.35%. The company’s productivity improvements and cost-saving initiatives should drive the stock’s performance in the upcoming quarters as well.Moreover, sales and earnings for the current year is expected to increase nearly 1.1% and 8.9%, respectively. This top-line as well as bottom-line performance is reflected in the growth style score ranked B. Overall, Hershey has a VGM Score of B.Hershey’s ROE of 119.7% compared with the industry average of 9.7% manifests the company’s efficiency in utilizing shareholder’s funds. Again, based on last day's closing price of $105.16 per share, the company's current dividend yield is 2.49%, a lot higher than the industry’s 0.00%.Hence, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company has good prospects and is expected to make value addition to your portfolio.

234,MDLZ,"Earnings Preview 7/30/10
"
235,MDLZ,"Earnings season will be still going strong next week. There will be 1,161 firms reporting, including 106 S&P 500 firms. The firms reporting are some of the biggest and most important bellwethers of the economy, and slice across a wide spectrum of industries. Included in next week's line up are: Archer Daniels Midland (ADM  -  Free Report), Dow Chemical (DOW), Duke Power (DUK), Kraft Foods (KFT), Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report), Procter & Gamble (PG  -  Free Report) and Time Warner (TWX). By the end of the week, more than seven-eighths of the earnings will be in for the S&P 500.
"
236,MDLZ,"In addition to earnings there will also be a very busy week for economic data. We start with Construction Spending and end the week with the all-important employment report on Friday. In between, we get both the ISM Manufacturing and Service surveys, personal Income and Spending and Auto Sales. More than enough data on the economic front to significantly move the markets.MondayConstruction Spending is expected to have dropped by 1.0% in June on top of a 0.2% decline in May. On the commercial side, the vacancy rate for offices and shopping centers remains very high, which limits the need to build more of them. On the residential side, new housing starts have been weak, as have building permits, indicating weak spending on that side as well.The ISM manufacturing index is expected to fall to 53.5 in July to 56.2 in June. Any reading over 50 indicates that the manufacturing sector is expanding, but a reading of 53.5 would mean a much slower rate of expansion than in June, and June was off from 59.7 in May. This spring, the manufacturing sector was the star of the recovery, but that star appears to be dimming. In addition to the main index, it is important to look at the key sub-indexes for the current level of production and the rate of new orders and employment.TuesdayPersonal Income is expected to have grown by 0.2% in June, down from 0.4% growth in May. At the same time, personal spending is expected to be up just 0.1% down from 0.2% in May. If income is rising faster than spending, it means that the savings are is going up. Over the long term that is a good thing, but in the short term it means lower economic growth. The savings rate is still very low by any historical perspective, and is also low relative to that of almost every other major economy. Unfortunately, there is no way to go from a low savings rate to a high one with out the savings rate rising. However, spending going up slower than income is less painful than income falling more slowly than spending.The Fed’s favorite measure of inflation, the Core PCE price index, is expected to have risen only 0.1% in June, down from 0.2% in May. Clearly runaway inflation is not a major threat right now. The big danger is that we might actually slip into deflation, which would be a very negative thing for the economy.Factory orders are expected to be up 0.8% in June after falling 1.4% in May. Given the weak report for new orders for durable goods, don’t be surprised if this comes in lower than the “official expectations.Detroit will release its auto sales for July. Auto sales are expected to have rebounded slightly to an annual rate of 3.9 million from 3.7 million in June. However, light truck sales, like pick ups and SUVs, are expected to have dropped to a 4.5 million rate from 4.8 million. While the sales rate on both Autos and Trucks will be higher than a year ago, they remain very depressed compared to pre-recession levels.WednesdayThe ADP employment report serves as an appetizer for the main BLS report on Friday. It focuses just on private sector payrolls, and ADP is in a good position to know, since it actually cuts the paychecks for most major corporations. It is expected to show a gain of 30,000 private sector jobs in July, up from a gain of just 13,000 in June. That, however, is not the sort of growth that is needed to put a serious dent in the unemployment rate, but it sure beats losing jobs hand over fist like we were a year ago.The ISM service index covers a much bigger part of the U.S. economy than does the ISM manufacturing survey, but does not have as long a history. Like the Manufacturing survey released on Monday, any number over 50 indicates expansion. The July number is expected to have dipped slightly to 53.2 from 53.8 in June. That means the economy is still expanding but at a somewhat slower rate.Thursday Weekly initial claims for unemployment insurance come out. They fell 11,000 in the last week, to 457,000. After a huge downtrend from mid-April through the end of 2009, initial claims have become very erratic so far in 2010. Look for them to fall modestly again next week. Longer term, we have made good progress, but not good enough. We probably need for weekly claims (and the four-week moving average of them) to get down to closer to 400,000 to signal that the economy is adding enough jobs to make a dent in the unemployment rate. We are a lot closer now than we were last spring when they were running north of 640,000 on a consistent basis, but still have a ways to go. Continuing claims have also been in a steep downtrend of late. But last week they rose by 81,000 to 4.565 million. That is still down 1.570 million from a year ago. Part of the longer-term decline is due to people simply exhausting their regular state benefits which run out after 26 weeks. Federally paid extended claims fell by 269,000 to 4.577 million. However that is due to even the extended claims running out as a bill to further extend benefits has been stalled in the Senate. The filibuster was eventually overcome two weeks ago. Given the delays in the data, next week will again show a big increase due to the people who were thrown off the benefit rolls due to the Senate delay coming back into the system. Looking at just the regular continuing claims numbers is a serious mistake. They only include a little over half of the unemployed now, given the unprecedentedly high duration of unemployment figures. A better measure is the total number of people getting unemployment benefits, currently at 8.225 million, which is down 188,000 from last week. The total number of people getting benefits is now 1.2 million below year-ago levels. Make sure to look at both sets of numbers! Many of the press reports will not, but we will here at Zacks.FridayThe biggest number of the week comes at the end of the week when the employment report comes out. It is expected to show a loss of 116,000 jobs on top of a loss of 125,000 jobs in June. However, the situation is not quite that bleak, more than all of the jobs lost in June were due to temporary Census workers completing their jobs, and the same is likely to be true in July. We will probably see a modest gain in private sector payrolls (the ADP number is a reasonable forecast).The Unemployment rate (U-3) is expected to tick up to 9.6% from 9.5% in June. That is partly due to the end of Census jobs, and partly due to people who have been out of the workforce expected to jump back into the workforce. In addition to the unemployment rate, which gets all the headlines, look at the actual employment rate, or the percentage of the population that is actually working. Unless we totally do away with the idea of retirement and scrap all child labor laws that rate will never get close to 100%. However, it has been in a steep downtrend, in recent years.Other key measures in the employment report to look at include the average work week, which is expected to be unchanged at 34.1 weeks in July, and average hourly earnings, which are expected to rise by 0.1% in July after falling 0.1% in June. While a slight increase is better than a decrease, it is not enough to give consumers that much firepower to increase spending and thus power the economy forward. Another thing to look at will be the number of long-term unemployed and the duration of unemployment metrics. In June, the median duration of unemployment was 25.5 weeks, more than twice as long as the record prior to the Great Recession. Long term unemployment is a very different experience than the “unplanned vacation that short-term unemployment represents.Even with the anemic growth in incomes (see the expectations for average hourly earnings and personal income) consumers have been trying to repair their tattered personal balance sheets. In addition to saving more, they have been paying down consumer credit (which does not include mortgages). In June, consumer credit fell by $9.1 billion. Look for another decline in July.Potential Positive Surprises

240,MDLZ,"On Aug 23, we issued an updated research report on General Mills Inc. (GIS  -  Free Report) — a global manufacturer and marketer of branded consumer food.Sales have been soft due to lower demand amid changing consumer food preferences. Sales at the North America Retail segment, accounting for 65.3% of sales in fiscal 2017, decreased 6.8% affected by declines in the U.S. Meals & Baking, U.S. Yogurt, U.S. Cereal, and Canada operating units. Volumes at the North America Retail segment dropped 11% owing to deterioration in the developed markets of North America, Europe and Australia. Like other U.S. food producers — Kellogg Company (K  -  Free Report) The Kraft Heinz Company (KHC  -  Free Report), Mondelez International, Inc. (MDLZ  -  Free Report) — General Mills has been facing the brunt of the shift in consumer preference toward natural and organic food.Notably, shares of the company have lost 19.2% in the last one year, compared with the industry’s ’s decline of 9.6%. In the last 60 days, earnings estimates have moved south by 2.5% and 1.8% for fiscal 2018 and 2019, respectively.Efforts to Counter Tepid SalesTo combat the weak sales, General Mills has outlined four key global strategies for fiscal 2018. The company plans to focus more on growing its cereal business which has been sluggish for quite some time now. Cereal sales nonetheless declined around 1% in fiscal 2016 and 3% in fiscal 2017.Also, restructuring its U.S. yogurt portfolio through fundamental innovation is a key objective as the unit has been experiencing sluggish sales over the last few quarters, declining 18% in fiscal 2017. The company’s third main strategy focuses on driving differential growth across several global platforms where it has already witnessed solid revenue momentum. Investing in its Foundation businesses (includes refrigerated dough, soup, and baking mixes etc.) is also a priority for fiscal 2018.Apart from these strategies, consumer-focused innovation, marketing initiatives and robust restructuring savings are making up for the sluggish revenue growth at General Mills. The company is investing in consumer-focused innovation, marketing and accelerating its organic product portfolio to boost sales.Also, by fiscal 2018, the company expects to achieve cost savings through increased efficiency, reduced complexity through SKU optimization, supply chain optimization and continued expansion of zero-based budgeting across the business, which will result in accelerated margin expansion. The company plans on delivering approximately $390 million in supply chain productivity savings in fiscal 2018 through its ongoing Holistic Margin Management (HMM) efforts. General Mills also expects to deliver about $160 million in incremental savings from other restructuring and cost-reduction initiatives, which is expected to rake in approximately $700 million in aggregate cost savings by fiscal 2018.The Road AheadDespite the several initiatives undertaken to boost sales, General Mills expects organic sales decline of 1%-2% year over year. The company expects earnings in the first half of fiscal 2018 to decline on lower sales, phasing of its cost savings initiatives and brand investments. However, management anticipates earnings for this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock to improve in the second half as sales pick up pace.

241,MDLZ,"On Aug 22, we issued an updated research report on Mondelez International, Inc. (MDLZ  -  Free Report) -- a leading global snacks company.Mondelez's margins have remained consistently strong backed by cost savings and productivity gains. However, weak volume, currency headwind and challenging market conditions are marring prospects.Key DriversMondelez has been focusing on driving margins through cost savings and productivity improvement. In February 2014, the company announced a $3.5-billion restructuring plan (2014-2018 Restructuring Program) which is expected to generate annualized savings of at least $1.5 billion by 2018. The savings from the program are being used to fund marketing investments and expand capacity to boost the top line and gain market share. The company is also working to drive advertising cost efficiencies by consolidating media providers, reducing non-working media costs and shifting spending to lower-cost digital media outlets.Acquisitions and divestures have been a key strategy for Mondelez for expanding and  streamlining its operations.The company regularly refreshes its brand portfolio through innovation and reaches its brands to new geographies and platforms. Mondelez’s advertisement spend is biased toward the high-margin Power Brands. It is also focused on improving its presence in high-growth channels like eCommerce, discounters, convenience stores and traditional trade.  ChallengesMondelez’s volume trend has been weak since 2014 due to higher pricing and category weakness. Volumes declined 0.3% in 2016 and 2.1% in the first half of 2017.Mondelez’s key snacks category has slowed down due to soft global retail and consumer demand. Like many other U.S. food producers, the company has been struggling with shifting consumer preference toward natural and organic ingredients over packaged and processed food.Foreign exchange is a major headwind for Mondelez with around 75% of its revenues coming from outside the United States. Foreign exchange impacted 2016 revenues by 4.6%, more than the company’s expectation of 4%. Currency headwinds are expected to hurt 2017 adjusted earnings by about a cent.Stock Price MovementNotably, Mondelez’s shares have lost 2.8% year to date, compared with the 6.1% decline of its industry. Earnings estimates have moved 1.8% down for the current quarter over the last 30 days.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderMondelez currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in this sector are Post Holdings, Inc. (POST  -  Free Report), The Chefs' Warehouse, Inc. (CHEF  -  Free Report) and Ingredion Incorporated (INGR  -  Free Report). While Post Holdings sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Chefs' Warehouse and Ingredion carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Post Holdings’ current quarter’s expected earnings growth is 41.8%.Current quarter’s expected earnings growth for Chefs' Warehouse is 50%.Ingredion projects current quarter expected earnings growth at 3.6%.Zacks' 10-Minute Stock-Picking SecretSince 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year. With compounding, rebalancing, and exclusive of fees, it can turn thousands into millions of dollars.But here's something even more remarkable: You can master this proven system without going to a single class or seminar. And then you can apply it to your portfolio in as little as 10 minutes a month.Learn the secret >>

259,MDLZ,"On Aug 18, we issued an updated research report on The Hershey Company (HSY  -  Free Report), the leading chocolate manufacturer of North America.Hershey’s second-quarter 2017 earnings and revenues surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Earnings also increased 28.2% from the year-ago level on higher sales, solid gross margin expansion and operating income improvement in the International segment. Net sales also improved 1.5% year over year owing to strong performance by the North America segment and the acquisition of barkTHINS brand. This marks the fifth straight quarter of sales improvement after a few quarters of no growth.Hershey’s shares have gained 4.3% so far this year compared to its industry’s 21.8% decline. This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s earnings estimates for 2017 remained stable over the last 30 days. Notably, Hershey has been able to beat earnings estimates in all of the past four quarters. The company’s productivity improvement and cost-saving initiatives should drive the stock’s performance as well.Key PositivesHershey regularly brings innovation to its core brands to meet consumer needs. Its initiatives have been able to drive net sales by 2.2% so far this year.The company’s new cost savings program, Margin for Growth, bodes well. As part of the multi-year program, it will reduce its global workforce outside the U.S. by 15%. It will also improve the overall operating margin through supply chain optimization, a streamlined operating model and reduced administrative expenses, with savings likely to be recorded in 2018 and 2019.These moves are anticipated to boost efficiency, leverage global shared services and common processes and increase capacity utilization. For 2017, Hershey expects $25 million in savings from the Margin for Growth program, more than $15 million anticipated earlier.ConcernsThe North American food industry has been witnessing sluggish growth and slowdown in consumption over the last few quarters. The industry is experiencing changes in consumer preference toward organic food items. As a result, Hershey, like a number of U.S. food producers like Mondelez International, Inc. (MDLZ  -  Free Report), B&G Foods, Inc. (BGS  -  Free Report) and General Mills, Inc. (GIS  -  Free Report), has been grappling with declining demand.Moreover, weak consumer shopping trends and the softening chocolate category trends have been hurting Hershey’s sales in China since 2015. China’s foreign exchange-neutral sales declined 29% in the second quarter of 2017 due to continued softness in the chocolate category throughout modern trade and select SKU rationalization.4 Surprising Tech Stocks to Keep an Eye onTech stocks have been a major force behind the market’s record highs, but picking the best ones to buy can be tough. There’s a simple way to invest in the success of the entire sector. Zacks has just released a Special Report revealing one thing tech companies literally cannot function without.

260,MDLZ,"The Kraft Heinz Company (KHC  -  Free Report) posted second-quarter 2017 results wherein earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate but missed the same on revenues. Notably, the company’s shares increased 1.14% in after-hours trading on Aug 3, in response to better-than-expected earnings results.EarningsAdjusted earnings per share of 98 cents surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 96 cents by 2.1%. Earnings grew 15.3% year over year on significant gains because of cost-savings initiatives.SalesReported sales of $6.68 billion fell shy of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.69 billion marginally by 0.2% and also declined 1.7% year over year due to soft consumer demand in North America and Canada. Notably, Kraft Heinz’s sales have now declined in five of the last six quarters and the company expects sales growth to ramp up in the second half of 2017. The reported figure includes an unfavorable 0.8% impact from currency.Organically (excluding currency), sales declined 0.9%.Volume/mix decreased 0.5% in the quarter against a 3.7% decrease in the previous quarter. The slump was due to weak demand of cheese, meats, and food services in its biggest market, the U.S. However, these were partly offset by positive contributions from condiments and sauces in all business segments. Pricing declined 0.4% in the quarter compared with 1% increase in the preceding quarter.The company has been witnessing weakness in top line for the last several quarters. Soft spending by U.S. shoppers along with rapid changes in consumer preferences and behavior are hurting the company’s categories. Kraft Heinz, like many other U.S. food producers, Mondelez International, Inc. (MDLZ  -  Free Report) and General Mills, Inc. (GIS  -  Free Report) among others, have been struggling due to the shift in consumer preference toward natural and organic ingredients over packaged and processed food.Operating HighlightsGross profit of $2.68 billion was up 5.9% year over year.Adjusted EBITDA was up 0.7% to $2.1 billion in the second quarter owing to cost initiatives. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 29.2%.Quarterly Segment DiscussionU.S.: Net sales of $4.6 billion declined 1.2% year over year. Organic sales dropped 1.2% on lower volumes. Volume/mix decreased 0.8% in the quarter comparison with 4.2% decrease in the last quarter. Pricing was down 0.4%.The downside was primarily due to select distribution losses in cheese and meats as well as lower shipments in foodservice that overshadowed the benefits from a shift in Easter-related sales as well as gains in frozen, macaroni and cheese, and condiments and sauces.Canada: Net sales of $597 million declined 6.4% year over year despite a 3.3% favorable impact from currency. Organically, its sales declined 3.1%. Volume/mix grew 0.6% attributable to growth in condiments and sauces that more than offset the discontinuation of select cheese products. Pricing decreased 3.7%.Europe: Net sales of $595 million declined 4.9% year over year due to 4.1% currency headwinds. Organically, sales fell 0.8% amid a challenging consumer and retail environment. Volume/mix was up 0.8% against 0.4% in the preceding quarter as robust consumption gains in condiments and sauces and gains in food service. Pricing declined 1.6%.Rest of World: Net sales of $851 million increased 1.6% year over year. Organically, sales grew 3% on higher pricing. While pricing increased 3.7%, volume/mix fell 0.7%.Kraft Heinz currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

265,MDLZ,"As prevention is better than cure, it is prudent to dump losing stocks at the right time than regret later. Incidentally, The Kraft Heinz Company (KHC  -  Free Report) appears to be one such stock. This Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company has seen its shares slump more than 30% in the past year, significantly wider than the industry’s 2.4% dip. This leading consumer packaged food company has been bearing the brunt of shift in consumer preference toward natural and organic ingredients over packaged and processed food, which has been denting its sales for long.What’s Affecting Kraft Heinz?The company has been seeing top-line weakness over the past several quarters. The food industry has been struggling in the face of numerous issues. Major U.S. food companies are striving to retain market share with packaged food items losing ground. A shift in consumer preference toward healthier options and a higher level of price consciousness are hurting the industry, making sales growth difficult to come by.Consumption trends in a number of its key categories like ready-to-drink beverages, frozen meals and salad dressings are on the decline.In 2017, net sales of $26.2 billion declined 1.1% year over year primarily due to soft consumer demand in the United States and Canada. Two of the four reporting segments registered year-over-year decline during this period, with the biggest decline in Canada (down 5.2%). The United States registered a decline of 1.5% in sales. Organically, sales declined 1.5% in the United States and 7% in Canada.Its flagship United States segment, accounting for more than 70% of net sales, needs sustained improvement for the company to return to healthy growth.These factors have made analysts hesitant about Kraft Heinz, as evident from the downtrend in estimates. Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the first quarter and 2018 went down from 94 cents to 84 cents and from $3.94 to $3.85, respectively, over the past 60 days. Though the company is undertaking cost savings and productivity improvements and innovating in line with consumer preference, the efforts are yet to reap significant benefits. This makes the road ahead bumpy for Kraft Heinz.Not All is Lost for the Food IndustryIn order to combat weak sales, food majors are aggressively trying to improve their products through innovation as well as by pursuing strategic acquisitions and divestitures. They are channelling funds toward product and packaging innovation as well as reformulating a number of existing products to meet rapidly changing consumer view on health and wellness. Apart from this, companies have adopted multi-year restructuring initiatives with focus on improving operational efficiency to generate cost savings.Again, some companies are also going for co-branding to boost sales. Cereal Partners Worldwide deserves special mention. General Mills (GIS  -  Free Report) formed a joint venture with Nestle called Cereal Partners Worldwide, which serves customers in more than 130 global markets. Mondelez International, Inc. (MDLZ  -  Free Report) teamed up yet again with the third-largest cereal company in the United States, Post Consumer Brands, to create two cookie-inspired breakfast cereals.Moreover, the overall economy appears to be in good shape, driven by an improved labor market, higher consumer spending, rising consumer confidence and increased business investments.4 Food Stocks That Are Better PlacedRanked among the top 40% of all Zacks industries, the Zacks Food-miscellaneous Industry space has some bright spots for investors to put their funds in. Despite the headwinds looming over the industry, several firms have managed to stay afloat, gaining from strategic endeavors to keep pace with the evolving retail trends and the improved economic scenario. Using the Zacks Stock Screener, we have zeroed in on four food stocks that have been performing well. These stocks have outpaced the industry in the past year and are well poised for the long term. Additionally, these stocks carry a favorable Zacks Rank.US Foods Holding Corp. (USFD  -  Free Report) has rallied 29.8%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 climbed 15.2% over the past 60 days. Earnings for this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock are expected to grow 48.6% in 2018. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Investors can also count on Medifast, Inc. (MED  -  Free Report), sporting a Zacks Rank #1. Estimates for 2018 improved from $2.60 to $3.25 in the past 60 days. Earnings are expected to grow 41.9% in 2018. Encouragingly, the stock has gained 112.1%, cruising ahead of the industry.We also suggest investing in Darling Ingredients Inc. (DAR  -  Free Report). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 rose 58.7% over the past 60 days. Shares have jumped 26.2% in the past year. Also, Darling Ingredients has impressive earnings per share growth rate of over 100% in 2018. The company has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Finally, we suggest investing in United Natural Foods, Inc. (UNFI  -  Free Report), sporting a Zacks Rank #1. The company has delivered positive earnings surprise in all the past four quarters. Estimates for fiscal 2018 trended upward from $2.82 to $3.06 over the past 60 days.  Earnings for fiscal 2018 are expected to grow 19.1%. Notably, the company has seen its shares rise almost 1% in the past year, faring way better than the industry.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars? Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.See This Ticker Free >>

266,MDLZ,"Mondelez International, Inc. (MDLZ  -  Free Report) is set to report second-quarter 2017 results on Aug 2 before the market opens.Last quarter, the Oreo-maker delivered a positive earnings surprise of 6.00%. Overall, the company delivered positive earnings surprises in three of the trailing four quarters, the average being 8.21%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderMondelez had earlier stated that a global cyber attack, which wreaked havoc across Europe and the U.S. at the end of June, would impact its revenues in the second quarter. Additionally, the company has been facing challenges to boost its volume since 2014, primarily due to soft consumer demand. In fact, the food industry has been performing dismally for quite some time now. Major U.S. food companies are striving to retain market share as easy-to-prepare and ready-to-eat convenience food items are gradually losing ground. A shift in consumer preference toward healthier options and higher level of price consciousness are hurting the industry, making it difficult for legacy brands like General Mills Inc. (GIS  -  Free Report), The Kraft Heinz Company (KHC  -  Free Report) and The Kellogg Company (K  -  Free Report) to boost sales.Again, foreign exchange is a major headwind for Mondelez with around 75% of its revenues coming from outside the U.S. We expect these headwinds to continue in the to-be-reported quarter as well.Meanwhile, Mondelez reaffirmed its full-year organic revenue outlook of ""at least 1% growth.""The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $5.95 billion for the second quarter, pointing at a 5.6% decline year over year.Nonetheless, effective promotional strategies, introduction of nutritious products, cost-saving and restructuring initiatives might prove beneficial for the company at large. These initiatives could offset the aforesaid adverse impact to some extent on the company’s sales growth in the second quarter. The company stated that its underlying margin progress continues to be in line with its outlook of mid-16% for the full year.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s earnings is currently pegged at 46 cents, reflecting an increase of 3.4% year over year.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Mondelez is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Mondelez is -2.17% as the Most Accurate estimate of 45 cents is below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 46 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Although Mondelez’s Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP, the company’s negative ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions.Mondelez International, Inc.

270,MDLZ,"The Hershey Company (HSY  -  Free Report) is slated to report second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 26, before the opening bell. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 3.97%.The chocolate maker surpassed earnings estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 7.65%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors to ConsiderChanges in consumer preference and consumer dynamics, demographic shifts, and also a spending shift toward lower-priced products have been a dampener for Hershey’s sales since 2014.To add to the woes, Hershey has been delivering weak performance in international markets since 2015, primarily due to soft results in China. In fact, China chocolate category sales in the first quarter was flat and also below the market.Nevertheless, Hershey regularly innovates its core brands to meet consumer demand and needs that are not addressed by its current portfolio. The company’s initiatives have been bearing fruit of late, with net sales increasing 2.8% year over year in the first quarter. This marks the fourth straight rise in quarterly sales after a few quarters of no growth.Given this changing scenario, we expect Hershey to see modest sales growth in the to-be-reported quarter.The company had earlier expressed that given the timing of Easter and the expected lower sales in China, second-quarter net sales growth is expected to be lower than full-year growth rate. For 2017, net sales are expected to be at the low end of the previously stated range of 2–3%.To counter the soft sales environment, major food companies like Mondelez International, Inc. (MDLZ  -  Free Report), Kellogg Company (K  -  Free Report), and The Kraft Heinz Company (KHC  -  Free Report) have been relying on productivity savings to boost its bottom line. Hershey too is banking on restructuring initiatives, which will likely help the company increase its EPS despite weak sales growth.Hershey’s adjusted gross margin and operating margin expanded 70 basis points (bps) and 170 bps, respectively, in the first quarter driven by favorable trade, supply chain productivity and costs-saving initiatives and lower input costs. The trend is expected in the to-be-reported quarter as well.Overall, Hershey will likely register higher quarterly EPS depending on its ability to increase prices, along with productivity and cost-cutting initiatives.For the second quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 91 cents, reflecting an increase of 6.5% year over year, while the consensus for revenues is at $1.65 billion, implying 0.9% year-over-year growth.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Hershey is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is -3.30%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is 88 cents, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 91 cents.Zacks Rank: Hershey currently carries a Zacks Rank #3. Although a Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP, a negative ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Ranks #4 and 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Hershey Company (The) Price and EPS Surprise  Hershey Company (The) Price and EPS Surprise | Hershey Company (The) QuoteMore Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

271,MDLZ,"On Jul 14, 2017, we issued an updated research report on The Hershey Company (HSY  -  Free Report), the leading chocolate manufacturer in North America.Hershey’s shares have outperformed the Zacks categorized Food-Confectionary industry year to date. The company’s shares have gained around 1.3%, while the broader industry declined 10.2%.The company’s strong brand portfolio, focus on innovation and productivity improvements and cost savings programs are encouraging. However, the changing North American food industry raises concern.Cost Saving Plans Combatting Weak SalesThe North American food industry has been witnessing sluggish growth and slowdown in consumption for the last few quarters. The industry is experiencing changes in consumer preference (for example, shift toward products with less artificial sweeteners, sodium and saturated fat), changes in consumer dynamics, demographic shifts, and also a spending shift toward lower-priced products.Given these changes, Hershey, like a number of U.S. food producers namely Mondelez International, Inc. (MDLZ  -  Free Report), ConAgra Foods Inc. (CAG  -  Free Report) and food giant General Mills, Inc. (GIS  -  Free Report), has been facing the brunt of shifting consumer preference.Hershey has been experiencing top-line pressure since 2014. In 2016, the company’s sales experienced a meager 0.7% growth. Meanwhile, the U.S. chocolate category is gradually slowing. In fact, the company is witnessing chocolate category softness in key international markets such as China. The chocolate category sales in China were flat and below the market level in first-quarter 2017.Nevertheless, Hershey regularly brings innovation to its core brands to meet consumer demand and needs that are not addressed by its current portfolio. The company’s initiatives have been bearing fruit of late with net sales increasing 2.8% year over year in the first quarter. This marks the fourth straight rise in quarterly sales after few quarters of no growth.Again, under its continuous improvement and productivity (CIP) program, management has optimized its North American manufacturing footprint, added manufacturing capabilities in international markets, increased supply chain productivity, invested in cost saving projects and improved the sales mix significantly.The productivity and cost savings from these efforts are being invested in brand building and supporting growth and gaining marketplace insights, which in turn are boosting the company’s margins.In the last reported quarter, Hershey’s adjusted gross margin expanded 70 basis points (bps) to 47.5% buoyed by favorable trade, supply chain productivity and costs-savings initiatives and lower input costs, which offset other higher supply chain costs. Operating margin also expanded 170 bps to 23.2%.Additionally, the company unveiled a new cost-savings program, Margin for Growth, to boost profitability. The international division is expected to significantly narrow its operating loss in 2018 on the back of the new cost-reduction program.As part of its Margin for Growth multi-year program, it will reduce its global workforce outside the U.S. by 15%. This multi-year program is intended to improve overall operating margin through supply chain optimization, a streamlined operating model and reduced administrative expenses, with savings primarily being achieved in 2018 and 2019. These moves are anticipated to boost efficiency, leverage global shared services and common processes and increase capacity utilization.These initiatives will enable Hershey to achieve its adjusted operating profit margin target of around 22–23% by 2019. The company will incur pre-tax charges of $375 million to $425 million, and provide benefits between $80 million and $100 million from the layoffs.Hershey holds a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

273,MDLZ,"Due to a broken wrist, I have had to type this report mostly one-handed. Thus, this week I am dispensing with my normal commentary and you will have to make due with the bullet points and tables. I would point out that this has been a great reporting season so far, especially on the bottom line. The top line also looks good especially if one excludes the financials.
"
274,MDLZ,"However, soaring net margins have been the primary driver of the earnings growth. Analysts have responded to the better-than-expected results by raising their estimates, but much more so for 2010 than for 2011. The lack of upward revisions for 2011 might be a yellow flag.Scorecard & Earnings Surprise159 firms have reported 3Q earnings. The numbers are now becoming meaningful. However don’t neglect the “expected tables, which still represent more than 2/3 of the S&P 500.We are off to a very strong start with a median surprise of 5.88%, and a 7.53 surprise ratio.Positive year-over-year growth for 130, falling EPS for 28 firms, a 4.64 ratio.Total net income up 33.8%. Pay attention to the % reported in evaluating the significance of sector growth rates and surprise medians.All sectors have more positive surprises than disappointments, eight sectors perfect.
"
275,MDLZ,"Historically, a “normal earnings season will have a surprise ratio of about 3:1 and a median surprise of about 3.0%. Thus, this is a very positive earnings season, or will be if the numbers hold up as more firms report. While the jury is still out, it seems like this is going to be another better-than-expected earnings season.

Revenue growth of 1.63% is now expected for the fourth quarter.Revenue for the financials is the principal source of the revenue slowdown. Low interest rates depress interest income, which is a major part of financials revenue, but also reduce interest expense. As a result, revenues at Financials are notoriously flakey.Excluding financials, total revenues expected to grow 8.83%, down from 12.68% in the second quarter.Seven sectors expected to post double-digit revenue growth in the third quarter, six of which also posted double-digit growth in the second quarter and are expected be among the leaders again in the fourth quarter. High revenue growth in Energy and Materials is largely a function of commodity prices.Quarterly Growth: Total Revenues Expected Sales Growth Sequential Q4/Q3 E Sequential Q3/Q2 E Year over Year3Q 10 E Year over Year4Q 10 E Year over Year2Q 10 ATransportation -1.05% 2.66% 29.99% 21.28% 36.83%Basic Materials 1.03% -4.35% 14.39% 8.54% 18.92%Oils and Energy 2.12% -0.70% 13.94% 8.61% 28.38%Industrial Products -2.95% 2.05% 13.08% 12.99% 10.91%Utilities -1.93% 22.08% 11.54% 9.77% 0.17%Computer and Tech 7.42% -0.25% 11.28% 7.24% 18.21%Medical 2.08% -0.15% 10.38% 2.32% 11.60%Business Service 4.68% 1.02% 6.21% 5.74% 7.41%Retail/Wholesale -2.02% 0.69% 5.85% -8.33% 3.36%Aerospace 6.44% 2.56% 4.05% 6.72% -0.40%Consumer Staples 4.48% 0.10% 2.75% 2.95% 4.90%Conglomerates 0.43% -2.14% 2.61% 2.86% 8.74%Consumer Discretionary 9.34% -0.06% 1.99% 3.54% 7.75%Construction -4.23% -2.74% 1.82% -3.55% 8.78%Auto 4.99% -11.99% -0.74% -7.82% 26.91%Finance -2.51% -34.17% -33.14% -36.93% 17.27%S&P 500 1.63% -2.64% 4.68% -1.23% 13.09%S&P 500 1.91% 0.61% 8.83% 1.91% 12.68%Quarterly Net Margins ReportedThis is only for the 159 firms that have already reported, calculated as total net income for the sector divided by total revenues for the sector.

282,MDLZ,"We use the convention of referring to the next full fiscal year to be completed as 2010, not all firms are on December fiscal years, this can cause discontinuities in the data, particularly around this time of year. The data is based on FY1, not based on 2010, even though I may call it 2010 in the report. All numbers, including historical ones, reflect the current composition of the S&P 500, thus some historical numbers may differ from those reported by S&P which are based on the composition of the index at the time of the reports.Dirk van Dijk, CFA is the Chief Equity Strategist for Zacks.com.
