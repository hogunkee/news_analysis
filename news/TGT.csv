0,TGT,"Despite daunting competition from Amazon.com (AMZN) and Walmart (WMT), Target (TGT) is making a pretty good case it's one of the best dividend stocks as the retailer trades near highs.A steady track record of payouts gives Target an annualized dividend growth rate of 20%.Shares have recovered nicely after the stock fell hard last month. An earnings miss and tepid guidance fueled the selling, although overall sales of $16.78 billion came in slightly better than expected. Same-store sales rose 3%, with transactions up 3.7%. Digital sales increased 28%.The company has been busy remodeling stores while expanding same-day delivery options. It recently launched its new Drive-Up service in more than 250 stores. It also expanded Target Restock nationwide, a next-day delivery option for consumers.Late last year, analysts lauded Target's acquisition of same-day delivery service Shipt. The $550 million deal was done to better compete with Walmart and Amazon.com.As a result of the deal, Target launched same-day delivery from more than 700 stores. A few months earlier, Target acquired San Francisco-based transportation technology company Grand Junction.No doubt Target has been spending money to make money, and the investments seems to be paying off.Quarterly after-tax margin has improved for two quarters in a row, from 3.3% to 4.2%.

3,TGT,"Roadie — a startup that gets everyday folks to deliver packages while on their way to wherever they're already driving — has notched a lot of oddball same-day delivery jobs that Amazon (AMZN) doesn't do. A glass aquarium from Fountain Valley to Long Beach, Calif. A set of keys to someone locked out of her house in Georgia at 2 a.m. A box of trial evidence from San Francisco to Napa in time for a panicked lawyer's court date.Around 80%-85% of its shipments are same-day affairs, fueled partly by individuals with curious packages, but mostly by bigger businesses. And Roadie, which provides Kroger (KR) grocery delivery in select areas and brings lost luggage to Delta Air Lines (DAL) customers in about 40 markets, is not alone.Roadie rivals Instacart and Deliv have separately joined forces with Walmart (WMT), Costco (COST), Kroger, Macy's (M) and Best Buy (BBY) on same-day shipping. Target (TGT) even went so far as to acquire Shipt for $550 million. The bull's-eye is ""becoming the first retailer to offer same-day delivery nationwide,"" said Target CEO Brian Cornell last month at retail conference Shoptalk.The driving force behind this latest retail trend, as ever, is Amazon. Its Prime same-day delivery service follows a free-shipping perk that is now a de facto requirement for online shopping. But after scrambling to catch up to Amazon on free shipping, these old brick-and-mortar titans are rushing to stay ahead of the e-commerce giant on same-day delivery. And this next online battleground might actually tilt in their favor, some analysts say.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseSpeedy delivery doesn't come cheap. Customers could pay anywhere from $5.99 to $9.99 per shipment for the pleasure. But demand continues to mount, which makes it ""absolutely essential"" for retailers in order to compete in this ""instant-gratification economy,"" said Retail Metrics head Ken Perkins, who thinks one-hour delivery might be the next goal. ""People want to see a package on their door when they return from work.""As President Trump continues tweeting his rage at Amazon on a near-daily basis over its use of the U.S. Postal Service, it's the Shipts and Instacarts and Delivs (not to mention the Postmates and DoorDashes in food delivery) that are harvesting this ripe market. And they may not even emerge as the biggest winners. Instead, logistics giants like UPS (UPS) and FedEx (FDX) have the scale and infrastructure to capture at least 80% of the future same-day delivery market, a 2017 McKinsey report noted.To a physical store, looking to a web-based firm to hurry along online orders might seem like hastening one's own demise.But the McKinsey report called same-day a ""$200 billion opportunity for retailers in Europe and North America over the next decade."" And it pinpointed brick-and-mortar stores as potentially recapturing turf from online pure plays.The firm said that only traditional retailers ""have the dense network of physical stores to support same-day order fulfillment and delivery.""Perhaps surprisingly, that dinosaur of retail — shopping malls! — is also poised to benefit from the interest in same-day delivery.Daphne Carmeli, CEO of delivery startup Deliv, had an aha! moment when she realized that this could offer shopping centers a ""line of sight ... into e-commerce revenue"" that they wouldn't otherwise have.If you live in Palo Alto, Calif., and place an order on Macys.com, for example, that purchase is likely to be shipped out from a nonlocal distribution center in, say, Atlanta. In that scenario, only Macy's and UPS make money off that transaction.But if you place that online order through Deliv, and the nearby Stanford Shopping Center fulfills that order (and a few dozen others) from its own in-house Macy's, then the mall owner gets some of that revenue, because of the way that leases are structured.Malls ""make money on real estate and rent,"" said Carmeli, adding, ""the more sales the actual Macy's makes, the more the actual mall operator makes.""Which is why malls are willing to carve out parts of their own budgets to hire runners to fulfill Deliv orders. Deliv has partnered exclusively with — and has strategic investments from — major operators Simon Property Group (SPG), Westfield, General Growth Properties (GGP) and Macerich.Luckily for Deliv and its rivals, the technology to make same-day drop-offs happens to have come a long way since the early dot-com days. Deliv's Carmeli, whose company serves 1,400 cities across 35 U.S. markets, was once told her idea was the ""stupidest idea ever.""""Do you remember Webvan? Do you remember Kozmo? Do you remember all the hundreds of millions, if not billions, of dollars that were deployed to build up these companies that ended up exploding in colossal fashion?"" she recalls being asked.Deliv, like many of its peers, avoids being blown up by using modern-age technology to orchestrate an algorithmic symphony of scheduled pickups and drop-offs from nearly 150 retailers — including Macy's, Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA), Sam's Club and Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google Express — straight to people's homes.Retailers nowadays have a better grip on inventory visibility, says Carmeli. And smartphones make it easy to crowdsource drivers.Her predecessors, like Leonardo da Vinci dreaming up helicopters in the early 1500s, tried to make same-day work on a mass scale before the right equipment existed.Boston Retail Partners analyst Scott Langdoc knows that serious pain. As a former C-suite exec at ""mini-Webvan"" delivery company PDQuick at the start of the new millennium, he says that Google Maps would have made all the difference.""If I had the tools that are available today, starting with Google Maps but fast-forwarding to the (artificial intelligence and machine learning) tools that are available today, it's amazing to think what I could've done at my scale or what Webvan or Kozmo could've done at their scale,"" he said.Like many of its peers of the time, PDQuick didn't survive. It was bought out and went back to its roots as a scaled-down SoCal neighborhood delivery service, Pink Dot.""What we'd intended to do before the 2001 implosion was basically do what Shipt did, which was to generalize the delivery and logistics capability for any retail platform so we could bring in inventory. A retailer brought in drivers and you would be able, based on location, to provide that capability,"" said Langdoc.""Fast forward 15 years, that is what Shipt is; that is what Instacart is.""That doesn't mean that same-day delivery is not without major challenges. It's expensive, for one. And as grocery delivery emerges as the next massive battleground, the stakes are being raised beyond mere speedy delivery of things like T-shirts, to more delicate items like yogurt and tomatoes.Even first movers are encountering issues.""It's not free and you can lose an awful lot of money trying to do it for free,"" said Moody's analyst Charlie O'Shea. ""Amazon will approach $10 billion in absorbed delivery costs this year. There aren't a lot of companies that have the ability to absorb that, either from a financial flexibility perspective or shareholder patience.""That has bestowed upon Amazon a ""fairly significant advantage,"" he said.Still, other companies have advantages too. If any physical retailer could conceivably take on same-day delivery in-house, it's Walmart, say experts.So far, Walmart's grocery-delivery pilot employs its own trucks in just one of six test markets, Denver. It relies on Deliv in San Jose and on Uber in Dallas, Orlando, Phoenix and Tampa.The Bentonville, Ark.-based mega-retailer recently declared that over 40% of American households across more than 100 cities will have access to its online grocery delivery service by year-end. That effort is expected to add thousands more to its already 18,000-strong force of personal shoppers.On Tuesday, Walmart said it enlisted courier Postmates to deliver online grocery orders starting in Charlotte, N.C., before rolling out to other cities.""We know one thing's for sure: that (customers) want a delivery option and so we're committed to that,"" Walmart spokesperson Molly Blakeman told Investor's Business Daily in late January. The company filed to trademark grocery delivery-related ""Wam! by Walmart"" earlier in the year, which Blakeman confirmed is associated with active, ongoing projects.Still, even as analysts agree that same-day shipping, including grocery delivery, has to be an option for shoppers now, some question if the effort is worth it.""In this arms race to provide faster delivery, are you providing too many resources to a very small niche product, or a small niche customer base?"" asked Moody's O'Shea.There are more households in America that make less than $30,000 a year than more than $100,000, he said. So the idea of same-day, for most products, isn't hugely compelling at current price points.""I would not say that the demand is minimal, it just has a definite ceiling — at least as far as the pricing stays where it is,"" echoed Euromonitor analyst Tim Barrett.And if you're wondering whether same-day delivery could ever scale up and reach rural settings, the answer is: ""No way,"" he said, laughing.""Simply put, that's not going to happen,"" said Barrett. ""We have seen traditional grocery stores struggle to sustain enough traffic to justify real estate and actual brick and mortar, let alone expensive delivery, let alone even more expensive same-day delivery.""YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Amazon Vs.

8,TGT,"Walmart (WMT) struck a blow against rival Amazon (AMZN) by finally sealing a $16 billion deal for Indian e-commerce firm Flipkart.The retail giant is taking an initial stake of around 77% in Flipkart, which was founded by ex-Amazon employees. The deal, which is Walmart's largest-ever acquisition, requires regulatory approval in India.""India is one of the most attractive retail markets in the world, given its size and growth rate, and our investment is an opportunity to partner with the company that is leading transformation of e-commerce in the market,"" Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said in a press release.

Privacy Policy & Terms of UseDow Jones component Walmart fell 3.1% on the stock market today, hitting a seven-month low. Amazon was up 1%.In a research note, J.P. Morgan analyst Christopher Horvers said Walmart believed the deal offered a ""unique, moment-in-time opportunity"" to get in early in a potentially huge market. However he believes the capital may have been better allocated at home, especially as Uber will halt Walmart grocery deliveries next month.""With the Uber test reported to have ended, and AMZN in relentless pursuit, TGT already buying Shipt for $550MM in December, and COST and others partnering with Instacart, we'd prefer large capital deployments in fighting the last mile battle here,"" Horvers said.Baird Equity Research senior analyst lowered his price target on Walmart stock by $10 following the move.""Given pending EPS dilution, we are lowering our price target to $95 (from $105), or ~20x prospective FY19E EPS in the $4.60-$4.80 range,"" he said in a research note. ""That said, WMT's improving omni-channel relevance adds durability to the company's longer-term growth opportunity.""He also said the deal is CEO McMillon's ""boldest move yet as he continues to transform the company to compete/succeed in the future of retail.""Walmart and Flipkart will maintain distinct brands and operating structures. According to Euromonitor, online sales in the world's second most-populous nation are growing about 35% per year. Morgan Stanley sees India's e-commerce market growing to $200 billion in around a decade.Walmart's investment includes $2 billion of new equity funding. The aim is to aid Flipkart in accelerating future growth.Walmart expects a negative impact to fiscal 2019 EPS of around 25 to 30 cents, including an incremental interest expense related to the investment.For fiscal 2020 the company anticipates an EPS headwind in total of around 60 cents per share. This is comprised of an operating losses of approximately 40-45 cents per share. It also expects an interest expense of approximately 15 cents per share.The retail giant has not given a specific timetable on profitability.Walmart and Amazon had both reportedly bid for a controlling stake in India's leading e-commerce company, at a valuation of about $20 billion.Flipkart, founded in 2007, is India's most valuable startup. But it's not profitable. India is rapidly growing but it still has a relatively small middle class. Poor infrastructure complicates home delivery.Former Amazon employees founded Flipkart, and SoftBank reportedly had favored a sale to Amazon. But Flipkart's board reportedly believes Walmart could close a deal more quickly and smoothly. An Amazon-Flipkart pact would have faced regulatory hurdles, because Amazon is already India's No. 2 online retailer. Another point in discount giant Walmart's favor is its apparent willingness to let Flipkart founders Sachin and Binny Bansal continue to help lead the business.Amazon has committed $5.5 billion to India. Founder Jeff Bezos is keen to become the leader in the market of 1.3 billion people. The giant has already lost the Chinese market to Alibaba (BABA) and JD.com (JD).Amazon and Walmart are in a knockdown, drag-out clash, trading punches in an escalating retail war with the lines blurring between online and offline.YOU MAY ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Heading For The Checkout?

9,TGT,"Department store stocks like Macy's (M) and JCPenney (JCP) sank after a Deutsche Bank analyst warned of ""limited upside"" in the space despite a sales bump from the holidays late last year.The analyst, Paul Trussell, in a report on Monday, said the valuation of those and other deapartmen has gotten ""ahead of itself."" Since early December, he said, shares of the department stores he covers had charged roughly 24% higher — excluding JCPenney — compared to a roughly 1% gain for the S&P 500.And he said that first-quarter same-store sales might have been weak due to bad weather in March and April and an earlier Easter holiday. Macy's and several other retailers report earnings next week.JCPenney slid 3.5% in the stock market today. Macy's stock retreated 3.9%, undercutting a recent buy point, but finding support at its 50-day line.Dillard's (DDS) and Kohl's (KSS) sank 4% and 4.3%, respectively. Kohl's stock hit resistance at its 50-day line while Dillard's is at its lowest levels since late February.Nordstrom (JWN) dropped 1.9%, falling below its 50-day as it forms the handle of a cup base. Trussell said that Nordstrom ""could surprise to the upside as its business is more insulated from weather patterns.""Overall, the Retail-Department Store group fell 3.6% on Monday, by far the worst performer out of 197 industries tracked by IBD. But retail groups accounted for six of the day's biggest losers, including Retail-Major Discount ChainsAs for big-box discounters, Walmart (WMT) and Target (TGT) lost 2.4%. Sears Holdings (SHLD) tumbled 9.4%. Walmart and Target are hitting resistance at the 50-day line. Sears is still above that support area, but the stock is in an 11-year downtrend.The assessment comes as department stores continue to struggle to compete vs. online retailer Amazon (AMZN) and off-price chains.Trussell continues to have ""favorable view"" of off-price apparel chains Burlington Stores (BURL) and Ross Stores (ROST). And he said he preferred global brands — like PVH Corp.

10,TGT,"Goldilocks has left the building. For proof, just look at interest rates. The 10-year Treasury yield eclipsed 3% in late April for the first time in four years, hitting the S&P 500, Dow Jones and Nasdaq. Clearly, the not-too-hot/not- too-cold economy that supported the nine-year bull market for stocks has fundamentally changed. On Wednesday, the 10-year yield again hit 3%.To some extent, that's good: Higher interest rates largely reflect faster economic growth, unemployment headed to a multidecade low and wage gains that are slowly picking up.Yet financial markets are sending the message that this good news comes with a growing risk of a squeeze on the economy from several directions. First, higher goods and wage costs will squeeze corporate profits. Caterpillar (CAT) warned recently that the first quarter was the ""high-water mark"" for operating margins, and profit pressures already are hitting other companies ranging from airlines to packaged food. Second, higher interest rates will squeeze corporate and household borrowers. Rising rates also could squeeze stock prices as investors opt for higher returns from risk-free short-term government bonds.Yet by far the biggest risk is that policymakers will go overboard. Fed rate hikes to counteract a temporary growth spurt from new tax cuts and government spending could push the economy into a recession if they go too far.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseFor the stock market, the most obvious sign of peril is the hit to the S&P 500 index, Nasdaq composite and Dow Jones industrial average since late January. But worrisome signs lurk in the details. Both homebuilders, which thrive on low interest rates, and banks, which can benefit from rising rates, are among the market's biggest laggards.IBD's Building-Residential/Commercial industry group has sunk to 176 out of 197 industries based on stock performance. Shares of Lennar (LEN), the largest U.S. homebuilder, have tumbled from their January high. Meanwhile, the Banks-Money Center group, which includes JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup (C) and more, has slid to No. 158.While the latest data point to a robust housing market, there's no mystery about why housing stocks have tumbled as the 10-year Treasury yield pushes up mortgage rates. But what about the recent underperformance vs. the S&P 500 from banks such as JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America? While higher interest rates have grabbed the headlines, the more ominous signal is the flattening Treasury yield curve. Over the past year, the gap between the 2-year Treasury yield and 10-year Treasury yield has been cut by more than half. The yield curve is at its flattest levels since the lead-up to the 2007 recession.Higher interest rates boost profits for Bank of America, Citigroup and others when the longer-term rates at which they lend increase more than the short-term rates at which they borrow. But the opposite has been happening, so even bank profits are getting squeezed. Two-year yields have climbed with the Fed's overnight rate and expectations of future hikes. But the 10-year yield's rise has lagged. Investors aren't demanding a big long-term premium, which suggests mild growth expectations beyond two years. The 2-year yield has hit its highest rates since August 2008, squeezing the spread between the 2- and 10-year yields.By the second half of 2019, an economy that the Fed worries is at risk of overheating could hit a soft patch as stimulus levels off. Overly tight Fed policy that raises borrowing costs could turn that soft patch into a ditch.Fed policymakers today are focused on overheating risks, while overlooking the likely slowdown. The Fed's latest projections, issued when the Fed hiked rates in March for the first time this year, penciled in two more rate hikes in 2018, three in 2019 and still two more in 2020. That would lift the Fed's benchmark rate from 1.62% now all the way to 3.375%. If that happens, the 10-year yield could head for 4% and the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage might near 6%.The bond market's reaction to the more hawkish Fed outlook was swift. Within a week, the spread between the 2- and 10-year Treasury yield narrowed to less than 50 basis points, then fell to as little as 40 basis points in mid-April. The spread is around 47 basis points in the stock market today, with the 2-year yield at 2.53% and the 10-year at 3%.Neel Kashkari, the dovish president of the Minneapolis Federal Reserve, called the flatter yield curve a ""yellow light flashing"" a heightened risk of a recession. His take-away: The Fed ""may not be that far away from neutral,"" a rate that neither boosts nor restrains economic growth.""We are clearly more concerned than the Fed"" about the economic outlook for 2019, wrote Harm Bandholz, chief U.S. economist at UniCredit Bank. ""As the impact of the (tax cut and spending) stimuli fades, growth rates should begin to slow perceptibly around the middle of the year, before slowing further into 2020.""Dec Mullarkey, managing director of investment research at Sun Life Investment Management, told IBD that he expects the 10-year Treasury yield to rise to 3.5% within a year as the Fed follows a path of accelerated tightening. He predicts one rate hike per quarter through 2019, ""which ultimately will lead to recession"" in 2020.To be fair, new Fed Chairman Jerome Powell faces an unprecedented policy challenge. Fiscal stimulus has always been ordered up during a recession or at the start of a recovery. This time, President Trump and Congress are delivering a double dose deep into the expansion, when growth is firm and labor markets tight. To top it off, the deficit financing used to pay for stimulus, which will exacerbate what most economists see as an unsustainable fiscal path, has added to upward pressure on interest rates.Now the Fed's challenge just got even harder. Core consumer price inflation ticked up to 2.1% in March. The Fed's preferred inflation gauge, the core personal consumption price index, rose to 1.9% in March. That's just below the central bank's 2% target.Average hourly wage growth ticked up to 2.7% in March and will likely head higher in the next few months. CVS Health (CVS), Starbucks (SBUX) and Target (TGT) all announced pay hikes effective this spring. CVS raised its minimum wage to $11 an hour and Target to $12. They are among dozens of major companies that announced wage increases in the wake of corporate tax cuts passed in December.As core inflation edges past the Fed's target and the jobless rate falls below 4%, standing pat would go against policymakers' deepest instincts.Bandholz expects cooler heads to prevail, with the Fed hiking rates just once in 2019 as data point to a slowdown. But Mullarkey notes that the data ""feedback loop is not instantaneous."" By the time the Fed recognizes that a soft patch has arrived, a recession may be a fait accompli.Even if the Fed does shift gears a year from now, false expectations come at a cost today. If policymakers are determined to stick to a path of steady Fed rate hikes, they could dampen the dynamic impact of lower taxes by adding to the growing and unsustainable federal debt burden.The more future Fed rate hikes that markets price in, the more federal borrowing costs will rise. As the government borrows more to service debt with higher interest rates, borrowing costs for businesses and individuals will face more upward pressure.Deutsche Bank estimates that U.S. Treasury issuance will soar from $1 trillion in 2017 to $1.5 trillion this year and $2.3 trillion next. The surging federal deficit is the main culprit. The Fed will add to the debt pileup as it offloads about $180 billion in government bonds this fiscal year.The Fed set its plan last fall for quantitative tightening, reversing bond buys made to aid the tepid recovery from the financial crisis. Newly passed tax cuts and spending hikes make those balance sheet reductions look like ""bad timing,"" Mullarkey says.Corporations carry a record $8.8 trillion in debt that will be more costly to refinance, working at cross-purposes with the tax-cut stimulus.Meanwhile, higher U.S. interest rates have begun to push up the dollar. That acts to tighten financial conditions not only at home but in developing economies where companies often borrow in dollars.""The risk in all this is a scenario where economic growth doesn't pick up as the supply-siders expect it to but interest rates move higher as a result of the larger federal deficits and the perception that Trump's fiscal stimulus might boost inflation,"" wrote Ed Yardeni, the veteran Wall Street economist who now runs Yardeni Research.That may not happen, but Yardeni sees little evidence that corporations are putting their tax windfalls to work in the real economy: ""We are waiting to see some signs that the supply-siders are on the right track. We aren't seeing any yet, though it has been only four months into the Trump tax cuts.""Stock market history suggests investors shouldn't worry right away about a flatter yield curve, LPL Financial strategists John Lynch and Ryan Detrick write. ""When looking back at the previous five recessions, once the yield curve hit 0.50%, it took a median of nearly a year before the curve inverted,"" they note.An inverted yield curve, meaning long-term bond yields fall below short-term yields, is a reliable predictor of recession. Yet recessions typically haven't begun until 20 months after the yield curve inverts.Also, Lynch and Detrick note, the S&P 500 has enjoyed a median 21.5% gain after the Treasury yield spread narrows to 50 basis points.The problem with counting on that history is that the Fed faces unusual late-cycle stimulus at a time that federal debt has begun an unprecedented spiral upward.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:What Is Inflation, And Why Does It Matter To The Fed — And You?Amazon, These 5 IBD 50 Stocks Share This Winning Growth TraitHere's Why Anyone Can Time The Stock Market BottomLooking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch?

The U.S. dollar index hit a new high for the year on Wednesday, continuing its recent resurgence against other major currencies. The greenback's roughly 3% rise since the end of March will have a dampening effect on earnings for U.S. multinationals with broad international exposure like Dow Jones stocks Caterpillar (CAT), Boeing (BA) and Merck (MRK). Earnings in foreign currencies are worth less in dollar terms when the dollar strengthens.The dollar's strength stems from the pickup in inflation and growing expectations that the Fed will hike rates four times this year. Meanwhile, central banks in Europe and Japan are in no rush to tighten. The widening gap between interest rates in the U.S. and overseas has made the dollar more of a draw.Higher interest rates and inflation also could squeeze earnings in coming quarters. Higher interest rates also raise borrowing costs for consumers and businesses and can crimp the affordability of major purchases like autos and housing. Further, two-year Treasury yields have climbed more than 10-year yields, and the flatter yield curve pinches net interest margins for the likes of JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Bank of America (BAC).After the Fed meeting, the 10-year yield was at 2.972%, while the two-year was at 2.496%.

35,TGT,"Wall Street expects the April jobs report to show the economy added 191,000 new jobs last month as the unemployment rate fell to 4% for the first time since 2000. Yet for stock market investors on edge over Fed rate-hike plans, wage growth is the key number. There's a good chance it will surprise on the upside.Economists expect average hourly wage growth of 2.7% from a year earlier, same as in March. Yet a host of large companies including CVS Health (CVS), Starbucks (SBUX) and Target (TGT) have announced wage hikes rolling out this spring that may start to show up in Friday's report.This year is beginning to look lot like 2016, when wage gains accelerated into summer after Walmart (WMT) hiked its base wage to $10 an hour. Then Target, Costco (COST) and others followed. Walmart's minimum wage hike to $11 an hour has contributed to the same kind of dynamic early this year. Target subsequently hiked its base pay to $12 an hour and CVS to $11 an hour.And as those companies hike wages, their competitors are being pressured to do the same. In March, Kroger (KR), Dollar Tree (DLTR) and Ross Stores (ROST) all said they're raising wages for employees, and their stocks sold off amid worries about profit margins.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

On top of that, numerous companies announced wage hikes in the wake of tax reform.The likely combination of low and falling unemployment with accelerating wage gains would fit perfectly with the Phillips curve theory that has long guided Federal Reserve policy. For investors, the key point is that most Fed policymakers still seem confident that inflation pressures won't lag too far behind wage pressures, as businesses pass along a portion of their higher wage bills.To some extent, it's already happening as the Fed's favored gauge of core inflation hit 1.9% in March.

43,TGT,"The economy added 164,000 jobs in April as the jobless rate fell to 3.9%, the lowest since 2000. Yet wage growth, the key number for stock market investors on edge about more Fed rate hikes, surprised on the downside, coming in at 2.6%.The jobs and wage data slightly lowered odds of four Fed interest-rate hikes in 2018, which should be positive for the stock market. The data didn't initially provide much of a boost. The Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite opened moderately lower after the jobs data, but the major market indexes staged a midmorning rally, fueled by Apple (AAPL). The Nasdaq led the way into positive territory, soon followed by the Dow Jones and S&P 500.Wall Street expected 191,000 new jobs, 4.0% unemployment and a 2.7% annual rise in average hourly wages. Yet the undershooting on two of three key jobs metrics may make the job market look less robust than it is.First, job gains in the prior two months were revised up by a combined 30,000, leaving the 3-month average at a rock-solid 208,000.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseFurther, Jefferies economist Thomas Simons noted that wage growth is sometimes depressed in months that the Labor Department's survey of businesses doesn't include the 15th of the month, which occurred in April. If that's the case, wage growth could take a leap in May. However, March's wage gain was also revised down, from 2.7% to 2.6%.Jim Baird, chief investment officer for Plante Moran Financial Advisors, noted that other gauges of wage growth have pointed to stronger gains. The Employment Cost Index released last week showed that private-sector wages and salaries grew 2.9% from a year ago in March.After the jobs data, the 10-year Treasury yield eased to 2.935% while the 2-year yield, which more closely tracks Fed rate expectations, held around 2.49%. The narrow spread between long-term and short-term interest rates may reflect concerns that the Fed will hike rates too much in the near term as the economy gets a boost from tax-cut and spending stimulus, leading to an economic letdown.The stakes have increased for each jobs report as inflation has picked up close to the Fed's target 2% and interest rates have hit multiyear highs. The combination of low and falling unemployment with accelerating wage gains would fit perfectly with the Phillips curve theory that has long guided Federal Reserve policy. For investors, the key point is that most Fed policymakers still seem confident that inflation pressures won't lag too far behind wage pressures, as businesses pass along a portion of their higher wage bills.To some extent, it's already happening as the Fed's favored gauge of core inflation hit 1.9% in March. Meanwhile, Wall Street has bumped up odds for a fourth rate hike this year to about 40%. Still, the Fed signaled on Wednesday that it won't be overly concerned if inflation rises a bit above 2% for a few months.There's good reason to expect a further pickup in wage growth in coming months. A host of large companies including CVS Health (CVS), Starbucks (SBUX) and Target (TGT) have announced wage hikes rolling out this spring that may start to show up in Friday's report.This year is beginning to look lot like 2016, when wage gains accelerated into summer after Walmart (WMT) hiked its base wage to $10 an hour. Then Target, Costco (COST) and others followed. Walmart's minimum wage hike to $11 an hour has contributed to the same kind of dynamic early this year. Target subsequently hiked its base pay to $12 an hour and CVS to $11 an hour.And as those companies hike wages, their competitors are being pressured to do the same. In March, Kroger (KR), Dollar Tree (DLTR) and Ross Stores (ROST) all said they're raising wages for employees, and their stocks sold off amid worries about profit margins.What's different from 2016 is that now the jobless rate is nearly a percentage point lower, meaning more competition for workers. On top of that, numerous companies announced wage hikes in the wake of tax reform.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:No Fed Rate Hike, But Here's Why The Dow Jones Can't Get A Head Of SteamIf You Like Apple, You'll Love These 6 Market-Beating Stock PlaysThe 'Apple Of Oil' Near Buy Point Ahead Of Earnings After The CloseAmazon, These 5 IBD 50 Stocks Share This Winning Growth TraitHere's Why Anyone Can Time The Stock Market BottomLooking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch?

It also has products for kitchens and dining rooms, mirrors, clocks, artwork and items for patio and garden. The retailer says it has developed a loyal band of enthusiastic and diverse customers who are passionate about decorating their homes.""They're running a very efficient retail business, making investments in the right space and not overbuilding,"" said Greg Portell, partner at management consulting firm A.T. Kearney. ""That runs counter to what often happens in retail, when companies overbuild and lose sight of what they do.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

For its fiscal fourth-quarter ended Jan. 27, At Home reported revenue of $294 million, up 25% from the year-ago quarter.It was driven by record first-year performance from new stores and a 5.7% increase in comparable store sales.

It also delivered 24% net sales growth, and grew same-store sales by 6.5%.The company opened 26 new stores in fiscal 2018 and plans another 31 in fiscal 2019. It expects annual store growth of about 15% to 20% for the foreseeable future.At Home believes it has the potential to expand to at least 600 stores in the U.S.""At Home stands out in the home furnishing space with high unit growth, healthy same-store sales and strong new store productivity, reflecting improved merchandising and brand awareness, as well as better inventory management,"" Jefferies analyst Daniel Binder wrote in a recent note to clients. He has a price target on the company of 35.Shares were up 1.3% near 35.80 on the stock market today.At Home was founded in 1979 with the store name of Garden Ridge and remains headquartered in Plano, Texas. The company was acquired in 2011 for $715 million by AEA Investors, in a leveraged buyout.In June 2014 the company changed its name to At Home. It spent $20 million to convert its then-70 stores to a new format and name. Then it held an initial public offering in August 2016, pricing shares at 15.Goldman Sachs analyst Matthew Fassler has a neutral rating on At Home and price target of 36.""At Home continues to generate one of the more dependable growth stories in hardlines retail,"" Fassler wrote in a note to clients. ""At Home delivered another top-line beat, and has established a consistent cadence of growth in merchandise, sales and delivery and same-store sales growth for the past number of quarters.""A lot of retailers only dabble in the home décor and furnishing space, including Walmart (WMT), Costco (COST), and Target (TGT), said Portell. At Home is all in, he said, as they stick to just home furnishings and décor.At Home is different from the likes of Walmart, Costco and Target in that it does not sell products online. It believes that, for the category of goods it sells, consumers prefer an in-store shopping experience. That's where they can touch, feel and take what they want home that day.Compare that with one of its closest competitors, Wayfair (W), which sells products only through its online platform.Wayfair announced its first-quarter results on May 2. Revenue rose 46% to $1.4 billion, but it reported a loss of 91 cents per share and has yet to show a profit.Portell wouldn't say specifically which one had the better strategy — online or brick and mortar.He added, though: ""When you compare the two, At Home has a profitable history and Wayfair does not.

Fed policymakers expect that wage pressures will rise as unemployment falls, with companies on passing some of their higher labor costs via price increases.Last week, the Labor Department reported that average hourly wage inflation ticked up to 2.7% in March after February's surprisingly soft reading. Faster wage growth is just beginning to show up after recent wage hikes from Walmart (WMT), Target (TGT), CVS Health (CVS) and Starbucks (SBUX), Bank of America (BAC) and dozens of others.Kroger (KR) from Walmart and Amazon (AMZN) via its Whole Foods face fierce competition.

48,TGT,"The favored Fed inflation gauge, the core personal consumption expenditures price index, rose 0.2% on the month and 1.6% from a year ago in February, the Commerce Department reported Thursday.Core inflation came in a tad hotter than the 1.5% annual rate expected. Including food and energy prices, the PCE price index rose 0.2% on the month and 1.8% from a year ago vs. expectations of 0.2% and 1.7% increases.After the report, Dow Jones industrial average and S&P 500 index futures rose a little more, while the 10-year Treasury yield was little changed around 2.77%.If the inflation data stay tame, and core PCE inflation remains well below the Fed's 2% inflation target, the U.S. central bank probably won't hike its key interest rate four times this year. At last week's Fed meeting, policymakers' projections saw core inflation rising to 1.9% this year as the Fed hikes three times.Policymakers are getting more confident that inflation will start to firm. Their projections point to 2.1% core inflation in 2019, just above their target.The Fed still believes in the Phillips curve, which predicts rising wage growth as unemployment falls. Before too long, wage pressures put upward pressure on consumer prices.So far, official measures haven't detected a pickup in wages. The Labor Department reported weaker-than-expected 2.6% annual average hourly wage inflation in February. But faster wage growth should begin to show up this spring, reflecting recently announced wage hikes from Walmart (WMT), Target (TGT), CVS Health (CVS) and Starbucks (SBUX) that didn't happen soon enough for the latest jobs report.As those companies hike wages, their competitors are being pressured to do the same. Earlier this month, Kroger (KR), Dollar Tree (DLTR) and Ross Stores (ROST) all said they're raising wages for employees, and their stocks sold off amid worries about profit margins.The competitive environment facing Kroger from Walmart and Amazon (AMZN) via its Whole Foods division, among others, offers at least some reason to doubt whether wage pressure will feed through to higher prices. Kroger said on Thursday that it will use one-third of its tax cut to boost shareholder returns, but the other two-thirds will go to higher wages and lower prices.Still, inflation is likely to remain near the top of investors' concerns this year. Fed policymakers expect to hike rates another three times in 2019 and two more in 2020, which is far more than financial markets think can or should happen.YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Inflation And The Fed Rate-Hike Outlook: What You Need To KnowStock Market Today: Track Market Trends And The Best Stocks To WatchWill Techs Drive Stock Market Into Bear Territory?

49,TGT,"Wage growth will likely accelerate in the March jobs report and beyond, with hawkish implications for the Fed interest-rate outlook. Goldilocks is on her way out.Wall Street economists expect the monthly employment report out at 8:30 a.m. ET to show a gain of 175,000 jobs. The unemployment rate should dip to 4%, the lowest since December 2000. Average hourly wage growth should tick up to 2.7% on an annual basis from a so-so 2.6% in February.Expect the improvement in wage growth to be the start of a trend for two reasons.First, dozens of major employers announced wage hikes over the past few months, but few came early enough to show up in February's jobs report. Walmart (WMT) and CVS Health (CVS) hiked their minimum wages to $11 an hour. Six months after raising its minimum wage to $11, Target (TGT) said last month that it will pay all current associates at least $12 an hour starting this spring.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseSecond, wage growth receded in the spring of 2017, rising just 2.2% at an annual rate from March through June. As those months that saw depressed pay gains drop off, replaced by months with firmer growth this year, the annual rate will trend higher.Take a closer look at Walmart's wage changes. Before its pay hike announced in January 2018, Walmart hadn't raised its base wage in nearly three years. That's a big deal. When Walmart hiked its minimum wage for all current associates to $10 an hour in February 2016, that wage hike was contagious.Walmart is big enough to put upward pressure on wages for other employers. Target and Costco (COST) were among those who quickly hiked pay shortly after that 2016 move. Average hourly earnings growth rose to 2.8% that July before momentum flagged.Walmart's 2016 wage hike came when the jobless rate was nearly 5%. Now it's around 4%, so competition for workers has intensified. At least for workers on the lower end of the wage spectrum, pay hikes appear to be broad-based. Starbucks (SBUX), Kroger (KR), Dollar Tree (DLTR) and Ross Stores (ROST) all have said they're raising pay. Meanwhile, dozens of banks, including Bank of America (BAC) and Wells Fargo (WFC) hiked their minimum wage to $15 an hour for tellers.As wage gains accelerate and the jobless rate moves below 4% in coming months, Fed policymakers may lean toward four interest-rate hikes in 2018, not just three. Fed models assume that inflation will follow wage growth higher. There's reason to be skeptical. For example, Kroger said last month that it will use the bulk of its tax cut to offset the cost of higher wages and lower prices.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN: Check Out These 4 Dow Jones Stocks; One Is Near A Buy PointBoeing, GE, United Tech Fall As China Hits Aviation But 737 Orders Roll InHow To Invest In A Late-Stage Bull Market As FANG Stocks SlumpStocks To Watch: These Stocks Just Got Added To IBD 50, IPO LeadersTop Stock LGI Homes Breaks Out To Buy Zone On Strong Growth

55,TGT,"Amazon (AMZN) vs. Walmart (WMT): It's a knock-down, drag-out clash of the new retail titans, with no end in sight. Walmart, the venerable emperor of brick-and-mortar discount stores, is dueling Amazon, the nouveau riche king of online shopping, trading punches in an escalating retail war that could determine the future of the industry — and crush smaller players who fall behind.X Hostilities sparked when Walmart and Chief Executive Doug McMillon invaded the e-commerce space, forging a $3.3 billion deal to acquire startup Jet.com in August 2016. Jet became the platform for Walmart's online shopping strategy. Then Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos did some encroaching of his own in June 2017 when his company snapped up Whole Foods Market for $13.7 billion, its boldest entry into the brick-and-mortar retail business.From that point on it was clear: The lines separating traditional from online retail are disappearing — and the two are up against new challenges unlike anything they've seen before. It's been a long time since Walmart shared the stage with a retailer of its caliber, while Amazon faces its biggest fight since it started wooing shoppers with cheaper prices and delivery conveniences more than two decades ago.""There's a real big debate about who will win out between Amazon and Walmart,"" said Tim Barrett, a retailing consultant at Euromonitor. ""It does seem like Amazon has more momentum but it also seems like it would be easier for Walmart to expand its online business than for Amazon to expand its presence in physical stores.""Amazon vs. Walmart has been a topsy-turvy war, and the advantage can change with each passing day.Take last Tuesday. Shares plunged 10% after Walmart reported fourth-quarter earnings that missed expectations and revealed some struggles in its online shopping business. E-commerce sales rose 23% in the quarter from the year-ago period, but growth slowed from 50% in the previous quarter.The slowdown was somewhat expected, as it was the first time e-commerce revenue included Jet.com sales in the year-ago period. But the drop was bigger than Walmart had forecast.""A smaller portion of the slowdown was unexpected, as we experienced some operational challenges that negatively impacted growth,"" Walmart CEO McMillon said in the company's earnings conference call. He cited operational issues ""from an inventory replenishment perspective.""Management expects online shopping sales to rise 40% this year. Last year, Walmart's U.S. e-commerce sales grew 44%, reaching $11.5 billion.As Walmart feels its way into online shopping, Amazon is working to up its game in retailing at the physical store level. After its successful experiment with a cashier-free convenience store in Seattle, reports said this week it was considering opening six more outlets known as Amazon Go.""Both will be going through growing pains,"" said Barrett.This month, Walmart stock was upgraded to a buy from neutral at Goldman Sachs, which added the stock to its ""conviction"" list and said the retailer is ""still very much in control of its own destiny."" But the Goldman Sachs report said the competitive threat from Amazon ""remains significant.""Walmart has one advantage — it's much larger than Amazon by revenue. Walmart's 2017 sales surpassed $500 billion for the first time, making it almost three times bigger than Amazon. That size enables Walmart to put a much bigger price squeeze on suppliers than Amazon in online shopping, Barrett says.But Amazon's embrace of Whole Foods put Walmart on notice that it intends to take a bigger piece of Walmart's retail pie. Walmart gets more than half of its sales from the $700 billion U.S. grocery sector.Amazon has a few tricks up its sleeve as well. Amazon is undergoing a major expansion into apparel, with several of its own private labels. Earlier this month, Amazon announced the launch of two premium, private-label denim brands.On Tuesday, Walmart announced it is launching four private-label apparel brands as it beefs up its clothing offerings. And it will launch its first ever digital-only brand, a line of bedding that will be available on a separate website.Walmart also said its subsidiary Sam's Club has teamed up with Instacart to provide same-day delivery of groceries, initially in Dallas and Austin, Texas, as well as St. Louis. While Amazon is the market leader in grocery delivery, Instacart is the most popular alternative for supermarket orders in the U.S.For Amazon to go all-in with Walmart, says Barrett, it must excel in food and clothing, not just online shopping.""Those are the two big categories,"" he said.Another muscle Amazon will flex is its strength in home delivery. This month Amazon announced that subscribers to its Prime membership program can now get groceries from Whole Foods delivered to their front door in two hours or less, for orders of $35 or more. The service currently is limited to just four cities — in Texas, Ohio and Virginia — but will expand this year.The transformation of the two companies is still in its early stages. Analysts believe the battle for the future of retailing will play out for years. Amazon's Bezos needs to figure out how best to operate and grow beyond the 468 Whole Foods stores it acquired, just as Walmart's McMillon needs to expand online operations while handling 11,500 stores across 28 countries.Outside this battleground, the prospects are getting dimmer, not only for existing retailers trying to compete with these two behemoths, but for those who were hoping to get their foot in the door.""The competitive barriers just continue to get higher and higher,"" said Jared Wiesel, a partner at consulting firm Revenue Analytics. ""Unless you have a really unique, differentiated business model, it will become more and more difficult to justify why someone would not shop at Amazon or Walmart.""The trend pulling Amazon and Walmart closer and closer in combat is a concept called omni-channel retailing. The strategy is shared by all the large players in retailing today. The goal is to allow customers  to easily shop with the same retailer in an integrated manner both offline and online, including mobile. Consumers can buy groceries online and arrange to have them delivered or picked up. Mobile phones can be used as a payment device in the store.Among the most aggressive developers of the omni-channel strategy is China e-commerce leader Alibaba Group (BABA). About two years ago, the company launched the Hema line of supermarkets as part of  Alibaba's ""New Retail"" strategy.Target (TGT) has also made omni-channel retailing a major focus. In December, Target acquired Shipt, an online, same-day delivery platform, for $550 million in cash. With the help of Shipt, same-day delivery, including groceries, will soon be available at half of Target stores. Other retailers pushing in that direction include department store giant Macy's (M) and consumer-electronics retailer Best Buy (BBY).Get IBD's Market Prep And Tech Report Newsletters — For Free!This shift in retailing, mostly from Amazon, has inflicted serious damage on traditional brick-and-mortar retailers that haven't kept pace. Casualties include timeworn department stores J.C. Penney (JCP),  Sears Holdings (SHLD) and Kmart, all of which announced sweeping store closures in 2017. In all, nearly 7,000 store closures were announced last year, according to FRGT. That's three times the number announced the year before.Macy's has posted 11 straight quarters of declining revenue, year over year. Shares of J.C. Penney and Sears have been cascading for years.Walmart is a different story. Unlike so many brick-and-mortar chains, Walmart stock traded at an all-time high with a 12-month gain of more than 60% in late January just before the stock market fell into a correction. Walmart shares' drop on the recent quarterly earnings disappointment, however, trimmed the stock's 12-month gain to below 30%. Shares were down 1.7% in Tuesday trading to close at 91.52.Over the past year, Amazon stock is up more than 70% and have scaled the 1,500 level. On Tuesday, shares were off 0.7% to finish at 1,511.98.For now, investors seem to be placing their bets on Amazon. Though it has much less revenue than Walmart, Amazon has a higher market cap, at $700 billion vs. $310 billion for Walmart. In addition to its double-digit growth, Amazon's competitive advantages include online shopping, its Amazon Prime membership program, its network of fulfillment centers and Amazon Web Services, its highly profitable cloud-computing division. But the biggest fights may lie ahead.The retail battle extends to international markets. Walmart is in talks to buy a 40%-plus  stake in Indian e-commerce leader and Amazon rival Flipkart, according to Reuters. Flipkart is engaged in a head-to-head competition with Amazon in India.""Several years ago, Walmart was on the defense and reacting to Amazon, but now they're playing offense,"" said Brian Yarbrough, an analyst at Edward Jones. ""After buying Jet.com, everything changed and Amazon is now reacting to some of the things Walmart does.""With its Jet.com acquisition, Walmart reorganized its e-commerce business and appointed Jet.com founder Marc Lore to be president of its U.S. e-commerce business. On Wednesday Lore shot down rumors he might be leaving Walmart.Lore has sharply expanded the number of items available at Walmart's online business. Walmart also introduced free two-day shipping on orders of $35 or more, and has plans to double its online grocery pickup locations to about 2,100. It partnered with Google for voice shopping using Google Home. Consumers will be able to buy ""hundreds of thousands of items"" on the Google smart speaker, striking a Walmart blow against Amazon and its voice-commanded Echo device.""I think Walmart is a worthy competitor but at end of day Amazon will be just fine,"" said Josh Olson, an analyst who covers Amazon for Edward Jones. ""We see Walmart as the only true competitor for Amazon, but their brick-and-mortar footprint is enormous and that's a big cost.""Walmart claims there's a Walmart store within five miles of 70% of the U.S. population. That store network could give Walmart an advantage over Amazon with services like grocery pickup, in addition to e-commerce pickup and support services.""It will be good for consumers as price wars are expected to continue,"" said Revenue Analytics' Wiesel. ""I think that price wars will probably continue to play out, because there are not a whole lot of other mechanisms on which to compete.""YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Warren Buffett's Annual Berkshire Letter: Here's What To ExpectWhich Stocks Make This List Of The Fastest-Growing Companies?A Stock Breakout Specialty Tool: The Relative Strength LineAs Walmart Gets Whacked By Amazon, This Retailer May Fashion New BreakoutDollar Stores In Expansion Mode As Amazon Launches 'Under $10' Category

56,TGT,"Despite a New York Post report that Jet.com founder and Walmart (WMT) online head Marc Lore was thinking about leaving the big-box retailer, Lore told CNBC Wednesday that he is ""absolutely not"" making an exit.X ""If anything, trust is building more between me and Doug (McMillon) and the board, and we have a lot of work to do and a lot of things to be really excited about in the future,"" he told the business news network.The Post had pointed out that Lore was absent from Walmart's post-earnings call Tuesday, and that the retailer is changing its approach to Jet's growth.""The cost to acquire a new customer on a nationwide basis is cheaper with the Walmart brand so we've been investing more in Walmart.com on a national basis and reducing marketing investment in Jet, except in certain urban markets,"" said Walmart CEO Doug McMillon on the call.The speculation about Lore came after Walmart reported slowing e-commerce growth in the U.S., although it notably still logged 23% in online sales growth during the fourth quarter after spiking 50% in Q3. The nation's largest brick-and-mortar retailer missed on earnings and fell short of guidance consensus, triggering a sell-off in the prior session.Get IBD's Market Prep And Tech Report Newsletters — For Free!McMillon also said that Jet.com, which Walmart acquired in 2016, ""will go through a period of adjustment and then it'll start to grow again in the future but focused on specific markets and opportunities, whereas (Walmart.com) will be the broad-based, big part of the business, and growing it will be a priority.""Walmart was down 2.75% at 91.52 on the stock market today, continuing its slide after breaching support at its 50-day moving average on Tuesday, when the stock plunged 10.2%.

69,TGT,"Walmart's (WMT) decision to aggressively expand its grocery delivery from just six markets to over 100 cities by the end of the year closely follows Kroger's (KR) announcement earlier in the week to team up with Instacart. Both are indications that the option to shop for groceries online and have them delivered is now a must-have amid the ongoing footrace with Amazon (AMZN).Bentonville, Ark.-based Walmart, the country's largest brick-and-mortar retailer, said late Tuesday that 40% of Americans would have access to its delivery service at the end of calendar 2018 through its website or the Walmart Grocery app. And the megachain plans to add thousands to its workforce of over 18,000 personal shoppers to aid the effort.""Ninety percent of Americans live within 10 miles of a Walmart store, and we serve more than 150 million customers a week, which gives us a unique opportunity to make every day a little easier for busy families,"" said Walmart U.S. Digital Operations VP Tom Ward in a statement.And in addition to the 1,200 Walmart stores that currently offer online grocery curbside pickup, the retailer is adding 1,000 more locations to the service in 2018.It's not clear how soon Walmart could bring same-day grocery delivery to all of its markets.

70,TGT,"A Federal Reserve rate hike on Wednesday is a near certainty, so the focus will be on Fed policymakers' projections of future policy, especially whether they see a fourth hike in the cards in 2018.If Fed members don't step up their expectation for three quarter-point hikes on Wednesday, they're very likely to by June — even if inflation remains tame.The Fed's most influential dove in 2017 explained earlier this month why low inflation won't prevent a more hawkish policy turn: Policymakers need to stay ""vigilant"" to contain any financial-system excesses.Unemployment appears on course to fall to rarely-seen levels that tend to come with ""elevated risks of imbalances, whether in the form of high inflation in earlier decades or of financial imbalances in recent decades,"" Fed Governor Lael Brainard said, alluding to the dot-com and housing bubbles.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseBrainard echoed new Fed Chair Jerome Powell's congressional testimony last month that economic headwinds have turned to tailwinds. Powell said there was still no evidence in the data that stronger growth has led to an acceleration in wage gains, which Fed theory sees as a precursor of upward price inflation.Yet once a pickup in wage growth materializes — and it's very likely to this spring after wage hikes by Walmart (WMT), Target (TGT), CVS Health (CVS), Starbucks (SBUX), FedEx (FDX), Bank of America (BAC), Wells Fargo (WFC) and others — Fed members will adjust rate-hike expectations upward, if they don't do so on Wednesday.Stocks overall have paused in recent weeks, with the Nasdaq composite, S&P 500 index and Dow Jones industrial average all falling more than 1% Monday as Facebook (FB) triggered selling. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones are both below their 50-day moving averages. But the major averages have rallied sharply over the last several years. The major averages rose modestly on Tuesday.Brainard noted, ""While asset valuations appear to be elevated, overall risks to the financial system remain moderate because household borrowing is moderate"" and the banking system is ""well capitalized"" after financial reforms. Still, she said, ""We will need to be vigilant"" because a booming economy can lead to a relaxation in lending standards.Vigilance is code for being proactive, raising rates if the economy runs hot, even before any acceleration of inflation. Yet there's a risk that the Fed will overreact to faster growth this year and into 2019 which is fueled by a one-time fiscal boost from tax cuts and a big increase in federal spending.

71,TGT,"Walmart (WMT) and Target (TGT) are growing their private label brands at a quick clip, but new research shows that Amazon's (AMZN) number of house brands has skyrocketed in the last year alone.XAccording to research firm L2 Gartner, 66 of Amazon's 80 private label brands came to life between March of 2017 and 2018, a real ramp-up from prior years.By contrast, the e-commerce behemoth introduced its first three exclusive brands in 2009, followed by a period of quiet until 2014, when it rolled out 11 more labels over the next two years.AmazonBasics and Amazon Elements are two of the company's most successful private labels, as items such as batteries, USB cables and baby wipes sell well.But analysts expect apparel to be a major growth category for the company this year.""Legacy brands and retailers should expect to see more private label brands from Amazon in the near future,"" warned L2 researchers.Instinet analyst Simeon Siegel estimated in December that Amazon was ""already one of, if not the, largest apparel retailers,"" and should see double-digit growth in the category, partly driven by its own brands. And Euromonitor data says Amazon beats Walmart's (WMT) online sales of clothes and shoes five-fold.In fact, most of Amazon's new exclusive brands are things you can wear: L2 says 86% of the company's private labels fall under the clothes, shoes and jewelry category.""Like AmazonBasics in Electronics Accessories, it will likely take years before Amazon private label brands become true leaders in these categories,"" said L2 researchers.

The June jobs report, often a stock market mover, could take a back seat to big news of the day — possibly the first big shots in the China trade war as Trump tariffs are set to hit at the stroke of midnight.If the Trump tariffs do kick in at midnight Eastern Time, adding 25% to $34 billion worth of high-tech Chinese imports, Beijing is set to immediately retaliate — dollar for dollar — with tariffs on U.S. autos and agriculture.Stocks have fallen in recent weeks on Trump trade war fears. So it's unclear how the major averages and key sectors will react if the China tariffs go into effect, or not.But the broader implications are huge. If the tariffs take effect, then the U.S. will be at the outset of a technological cold war with Beijing from which there may be no turning back. If they're off the table or on hold, then Wall Street will heave a sigh of relief, knowing that Trump's trade threats will prove to be mostly bark, not bite.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

Germany's Daimler (DDAIF) already warned that profits on Alabama-built SUVs will suffer. Chinese tariffs on U.S. agriculture, including soybeans, would indirectly hit Deere (DE), which thrives when American farmers rake in profits.LED maker Cree will be among the U.S. companies hit by the Trump tariffs after the Trump administration turned down its request for an exemption. Cree (CREE) warned that the tariffs would limit its R&D spending and planned manufacturing expansion.Trump tariffs hitting U.S. semiconductor makers will come in the next batch of $16 billion worth of goods targeted.

76,TGT,"New Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell told Congress that he sees ""at most modest risk"" from high asset prices, despite the generally buoyant stock market. But investors sold shares on concerns that Powell and fellow policymakers will raise interest rates more than three times in 2018 due to stepped-up economic growth forecasts.Asked whether low interest rates have fueled ""dangerous risk-taking,"" Powell noted no real build-up of leverage among households or the emergence of other significant risks to financial stability.Wall Street reacted somewhat negatively to Powell's first monetary policy testimony to Congress since taking the helm of the U.S. central bank, focusing on his outlook for stronger economic growth and what that might mean for the number of Fed rate hikes in 2018.Yet the overall tenor of his testimony probably should be taken as positive, because it suggests a lack of urgency to raise interest rates. The Fed, in other words, remains data-dependent and won't move to tighten policy more quickly due to tax cuts and fiscal stimulus unless inflation gathers momentum. On the stock market today, the Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite closed at session lows, down more than 1%.Bank stocks fell somewhat amid the broad sell-off. Shares of Bank of America (BAC) and Morgan Stanley (MS) lost a fraction, though JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Wells Fargo (WFC) and PNC Financial Services (PNC) were down 1% or more. Banks can reap higher net interest margins as interest rates rise, especially when the long-term yields rise more than short-term yields.Get IBD's Market Prep And Tech Report Newsletters — For Free!The 10-year Treasury yield rose 3 basis points to 2.90%, off session peaks but not far off last week's four-year high of 2.95%.""At the December meeting, the median participant called for three rate increases in 2018,"" Powell said in response to a question over what it would take for the Fed to hike rates more than three times this year. ""Now since then — we will submit another projection, all of us, in three weeks  — but since then, what we've seen is incoming data that suggests that strengthening in the economy. We've seen continuing strength in the labor market. We've seen some data that will, in my case, add some confidence to my view that inflation is moving up to target. We've also seen continued strength around the globe, and we've seen fiscal policy become more stimulative. So I think each of us is going to be taking the developments since the December meeting into account and writing down our new rate paths as we go into the March meeting.""Powell added that it was his ""personal outlook"" as well as the overall committee that ""the economy has strengthened since December,"" when Fed policymakers last offered their economic and policy projections for 2018.Powell's upgrading of the outlook is hardly a surprise, coming after Congress backed a $300-billion-plus increase in federal spending earlier in February. Even before that, some Fed policymakers had been marking up their economic projections, as noted in the minutes from their Jan. 30-31 meeting.Asked about whether ""profligate fiscal policy"" might require higher interest rates than otherwise by a Democratic committee member, Powell said that the Fed will keep its on eye on the economy, not on the actions of Congress, but he allowed that ""all things equal,"" the appropriate interest rate would be higher when fiscal policy becomes more stimulative.The Q&A seemed to cancel out the seemingly positive reaction to his published testimony. In prepared remarks released before the market open, Powell said that the Fed policymaking committee sees the risks to the economy as balanced between upside and downside risks, even as ""some of the headwinds the U.S. economy faced in previous years have turned into tailwinds,"" especially fiscal policy.The takeaway from the Q&A is that the assessment of balanced risks might date back to the January meeting, before the latest fiscal stimulus.Yet in discussing a possibility that the Fed might discuss adopting an inflation range, instead of its specific 2% target, as a guide for policy, Powell underscored that there's not much reason to worry about an upsurge in inflation.""Generally speaking inflation has been low or stable for 15 years now,"" Powell said.IBD'S TAKE: Stock market volatility has returned, so it's more important than ever to read The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines. Indeed, core inflation, as measured by the Fed's favored personal consumption expenditures price index, hasn't touched 2.5% since 1995. The past two economic expansions weren't tripped up by the Fed having to tamp down an inflation outbreak, but by the bursting of the dot-com and housing bubbles.So when Powell expresses confidence that few troubling signs of excess have emerged, as well as confidence about a stable inflation outlook, investors should see the potential for this economic expansion running for several more years.In prepared testimony, Powell said, ""In gauging the appropriate path for monetary policy over the next few years, the FOMC will continue to strike a balance between avoiding an overheated economy and bringing PCE price inflation to 2 percent on a sustained basis.""Powell's testimony comes as firms including Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan are predicting one more rate hike this year than the Fed's own policymakers projected in December. Passage of a $310 billion budget deal in early February, after the Fed's last meeting, also has led economists to mark up their GDP growth estimates and added to concerns that inflation could make a comeback.Inflation and the risk of a hawkish Fed has come back on the radar of investors after the January jobs report showed average hourly wages growing 2.9% from a year ago, up from the Goldilocks readings near 2.5% that persisted in 2017.Walmart (WMT) announced in January that it was hiking base pay to $11 an hour, three years after it last announced a boost in starting pay to $9 an hour. On Thursday, CVS Health (CVS) said it will adopt an $11 minimum wage in April. Both companies tied their wage hikes to their tax cuts, saying they would spend part of their tax windfall on higher compensation, but that's only part of the story. Competition for quality workers led Target (TGT) to boost its wage to $11 starting last October, when tax reform was still up in the air. At the time, Target made a commitment to raise its base wage to $15 an hour by the end of 2020. Starbucks (SBUX), JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo also are among the dozens of big employers who have hiked wages in the wake of tax cuts.While details of the January employment report suggested that the reported acceleration in wage gains was misleading, it does appear that faster wage growth is on the way.Although a faster pace of rate hikes can't be ruled out if wage gains and inflation exhibit momentum, Powell's remarks suggest that the Fed isn't predisposed to a faster pace of rate hikes and will continue to give the economy some running room.Arguably, financial markets are leading the Fed and not the other way around. The 10-year Treasury yield touched a four-year high last week after the Fed minutes from the January meeting noted that ""a stronger outlook for economic growth raised the likelihood that further gradual policy firming would be appropriate.""YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:What Is Inflation, And Why Does It Matter To The Fed — And You?LGI Homes, Toll Bros.

78,TGT,"The Phillips curve theory at the heart of the Federal Reserve's approach to raising interest rates as the economic expansion marches ahead is that lower unemployment gives rise to faster wage growth.X Fed policymakers figure that inflation pressures won't follow too far behind wage pressures, as businesses pass along a portion of their higher wage bills.Yet those assumptions central to proactive monetary policy — the steady diet of Fed rate hikes even when inflation remains below the Fed's 2% target — have taken some knocks lately.With the jobless rate expected to sink below 4% this year and fall to 3.5% or lower in 2019, one of the biggest questions for financial markets is how much the link between unemployment, wages and inflation will finally assert itself?Soon after tax reform passed in December, dozens of major companies — including Walmart (WMT), CVS Health (CVS), Bank of America (BAC) and Starbucks (SBUX) — announced wage hikes, a reflection of a tightening labor market. It's a good bet that wage growth is heading higher, but how much pricing power will companies really have?Here are five keys to understanding the outlook for inflation and Fed rate-hike policy:To understand why the link between wages and inflation isn't as clear as it once was, Target (TGT) is a good place to start. In September 2017, the discount retailer announced a big wage hike and broad-based price cuts just three weeks apart.The price cuts on thousands of items came shortly after Amazon.com (AMZN) celebrated the close of its Whole Foods acquisition by cutting the upscale natural foods grocer's prices as much as 43% on select items like avocados and kale.Then, in a bid to limit employee turnover and attract 100,000 seasonal workers in a tight labor market, Target hiked its minimum wage from $10 to $11 an hour and committed to a $15 hourly wage by the end of 2020.Higher wages may not feed through to higher prices in the near term when a few huge companies have significant market power and incentives to put market share over profit. Amazon has been rewarded with a massive valuation because of sales growth and the growing reach of its Prime membership, even when its profits disappointed.Internet-enabled transparency also keeps a lid on prices, and that's not just true of retail. Marriott International (MAR) CEO Arne Sorenson has explained that the hotel group doesn't have as much ability to raise prices as it had in past cycles. While home-sharing via Airbnb has some impact on leisure travelers, he sees the bigger issue as ""radical transparency in pricing.""IBD'S TAKE: Stock market volatility has returned, so it's more important than ever to read The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines. With just a few relatively modest trend reversals, inflation has been moving in only one direction since 1980: lower.After sinking from more than 10% in 1980, core consumer price inflation, which excludes the sometimes-volatile food and energy categories, hasn't touched 3% since 1995. Aggressive Fed rate hikes under Paul Volcker pushed back inflation in the early 1980s, while pre-emptive Fed rate increases in the mid-1990s under Alan Greenspan ushered in the current low-inflation environment.Amid technological advances that empower the consumer and the globalization of manufacturing supply chains, in part to capitalize on lower-wage labor, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, the core personal consumption expenditures price index hasn't even touched 2.5% in decades and sat at 1.5% at the end of 2017.Even if tight labor markets and near-3% GDP growth foster a bit more inflation, perspective is in order: Neither investors nor Fed policymakers are likely to get overly concerned.You might guess that the Apple (AAPL) iPhone X, which raised eyebrows with its near-$1,000 starting price when it was released in November 2017, sent the price index for phone equipment surging after its release, and you'd be right — to a point. The Labor Department, which adjusts price changes to account for technological advances, said that phone equipment costs fell 2.6% in January 2018 vs. a year earlier, which was the smallest decline since 2011.The combination of quality improvements, productivity gains in manufacturing and global competition goes a long way to explaining why most inflation is in services. In the year through January, services inflation was running at 2.6%, while goods inflation was just 1.2%. Excluding food and energy, goods inflation was -0.7%.An exception in the goods category is prescription drugs, whose prices always rise, bringing political scrutiny. But prescription-drug prices rose just 2.4% in January vs. a year earlier, roughly half the increase seen in the prior three years. Prescription benefit manager Express Scripts (ESRX) said average per-member prescription costs of the employer plans it serves rose 1.5%, the lowest since 1993. One key: Generic fill rates rose 86% over the prior year. That likely reflects, in part, the FDA's new expedited generics approval approach, so the gains may be sustained.Likewise, health care services prices rose a historically tame 2% in January. In regulated industries like health care, where prices are rarely transparent and government plays an especially large role, the power to raise prices is limited by the regulator.The Fed's favored PCE price index, unlike the CPI, reflects prices that individuals pay, both directly and indirectly, such as for health care that is subsidized by government and employers. Health care accounts for just over 20% of the PCE index vs. about 9% of the CPI's weight. Meanwhile, housing accounts for a similar 20% of the PCE index, but more than 30% of the CPI. With shelter costs rising 3.2% from a year ago in January, that difference goes a long way to explaining why core CPI inflation typically exceeds core PCE inflation.As labor markets tighten and workers have more opportunity to quit and find greener pastures, companies pressured to raise wages have three possibilities for dealing with their higher compensation costs: increase prices, accept lower profits or offset the higher wage bill by increasing worker output or finding other efficiencies.To some extent, the earnings boost from the Trump tax cuts, which slashed the corporate tax rate to 21%, could make companies more willing to swallow higher wages without passing those costs on to customers. Incentives in the tax bill allowing for immediate expensing of equipment purchases could increase investment to make workers more productive.A key question will be whether heightened wage pressures and bigger investment incentives can combine to get the U.S. out of the productivity rut it's been in for much of the past decade. If so, that could raise the growth ceiling on the economy without stoking inflation.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:This Shock Economic Outlook May Keep Stock Market On EdgeChart-Reading Basics: How To Find The Correct Buy Point For Leading StocksBitcoin, Blockchain And Private Industry: You Ain't Seen Nothing YetWhy A Bull Market Rally Is The Time To Review Your Stock-Selling SmartsAI News: Artificial Intelligence Trends And Leading Stocks

79,TGT,"Walmart (WMT) is reportedly rolling out several new in-house apparel brands as it aims to expand its fashion cred. The news comes as Amazon is said to be grabbing more apparel market share from the country's biggest brick-and-mortar retailer and its peers.X Bloomberg, which acquired presentation material that Walmart provided to suppliers, said the new store brands include womenswear label Time and Tru, plus-size brand Terra & Sky and kids line Wonder Nation.The new low-cost clothing brands follow last year's acquisitions of online apparel sellers ModCloth and Bonobos, as well as a recently inked partnership with department store Lord & Taylor, indicating that Walmart is looking to broaden its appeal as a fashion and apparel destination.Amazon has launched a number of private-label clothing brands of its own, such as men's line Goodthreads and shoe brand Franklin & Freeman, while Target (TGT) is in the midst of a mega-rollout of about a dozen or so store brands across its apparel and home decor segments.Store brands generally mean higher margins for retailers at competitive prices, and if done well, can translate to brand loyalty for customers who won't be able to find the labels anywhere else.IBD'S TAKE: Private-label, or in-house, brands could be the next big cash cow for Target and Amazon. Here's how. Meanwhile, Walmart's assertive moves on the digital front point to a growing offensive online. The company is in discussions to buy a more-than-40% stake in Indian e-commerce leader (and Amazon rival) Flipkart, according to a Reuters report Friday. And a Walmart spokesperson confirmed to Investor's Business Daily earlier this month that its grocery delivery-related trademark filings point to active, ongoing projects.Walmart rose 1.5% to 104.78 in the stock market today, and it remains in buy range with a 100.23 entry — modestly above its 50-day moving average as well — despite briefly dipping out of the buy zone.

81,TGT,"Donald Trump's presidency has been pretty great for stock investors, but it carries three big risks that all are in focus this week: The Fed, a trade war and the investigation into Russia's role in the 2016 election.XThe Trump wall of worry helped get stocks off to a poor start on Monday, as Facebook (FB) led markets lower over how the social network permitted a third party to access user data that helped the Trump campaign. The Dow Jones industrial average and S&P 500 index fell 1.3% and 1.4%, respectively, on the stock market today. The Nasdaq slid 1.8%, but off intraday lows of more than 2%.All the fiscal stimulation from tax cuts and a big spending increase raises the risk of a more hawkish Fed. Federal Reserve policymakers are virtually certain to announce a 25-basis-point hike in the key overnight lending rate to banks on Wednesday at 2 p.m. ET. The risk this week is that they'll pencil in a tighter path for future policy than markets currently expect.Meanwhile, President Trump's 15-day grace period for trading partners to negotiate their way out of tariffs comes to an end on Friday, when levies of 25% on steel imports and 10% on aluminum imports go into effect.The White House said last week that it's negotiating with a number of countries, but provided no detail. The European Union said last week that it's not negotiating, but making a case that the tariffs are a poor way to treat a security partner, even as it detailed a list of $3.4 billion worth of American products that could face retaliatory tariffs, including Harley-Davidson (HOG) motorcycles, Jack Daniels whiskey and Florida orange juice.The third risk hanging over stocks as the week starts comes from the broadening Russia probe, which has now expanded to cover Trump Organization business deals before the election. Trump amped up his Twitter attacks on Special Counsel Robert Mueller's probe over the weekend, calling it a witch hunt, while his attorney John Dowd called for an end to the investigation that he said was ""manufactured"" by ex-FBI Director James Comey based on ""a fraudulent and corrupt dossier.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseNone of these three risk hanging over stocks will come to a head this week, but all three risks are growing and are likely to occupy investors for months to come.The Mueller investigation ""appears to be on the verge of a major inflection point,"" wrote Greg Valliere, chief global strategist at Horizon Investments. Mueller reportedly has submitted some of the questions he would like Trump to answer under oath. There's speculation that more indictments could be coming soon and major uncertainty over how Congress would react if Trump engineers Mueller's firing as GOP lawmakers have shown a tepid response to proposed legislation that would protect Mueller.At the Fed, inflation concerns haven't gone away, even with some favorable recent data. Despite expectations of faster economic growth this year, the tame consumer price index reading for February makes it an even bet whether Fed policymakers will pencil in a fourth rate hike in 2018, up from three, in their economic projections that are released at the same time as the policy statement.Yet as wage growth accelerates in coming months — and there's every reason to expect it will after wage hikes from Walmart (WMT), Target (TGT), CVS Health (CVS), Starbucks (SBUX), Bank of America (BAC) and dozens of other big employers — a more hawkish Fed is likely.On trade, Trump's indefinite exemptions for Canada and Mexico from tariffs have contained the potential fallout from his duties on steel and aluminum, and the White House may be open to other approaches to reducing global steel overcapacity that comes mainly from China, even though China accounts for just 2% of U.S. steel imports.Still, the risk of a trade war is rising. If steel and aluminum tariffs don't spark one, it may come from a U.S. crackdown on China's intellectual property practices. On Monday, Reuters reported that Walmart, Target, Best Buy (BBY) and other retailers sent a letter to Trump asking him to reconsider an emerging plan to hit Beijing with $60 billion in tariffs on American imports of apparel, electronics and other goods. Boeing (BA) and Apple (AAPL) are seen as likely targets for reprisal by China if a trade war erupts.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Inflation And The Fed Rate-Hike Outlook: What You Need To KnowWhy Steel Stocks May Not Be Big Winners From Trump TariffsThese 5 Stocks Have Dipped Below Buy Points, But Don't Give Up On ThemThese 5 Hot Stocks Are Simmering Just Below Buy Points Nike, Oracle, Micron, Fed Rate Hike, Trump Tariffs: Investing Action Plan

83,TGT,"If the February jobs report out Friday morning comes in as strong as Wall Street expects, it will set financial markets up for another Fed interest-rate scare later this spring.X Here's the reason: Economists expect the new jobs data to match January's 2.9% hourly annual wage gain — the best since 2009. That's even though that surprising data point appeared inflated by a dive in the work week that disproportionately reduced hours for low-wage workers. But even bigger pay gains are likely coming this spring, reflecting recently announced wage hikes from Walmart (WMT), Target (TGT), CVS Health (CVS) and Starbucks (SBUX), which won't show up yet in the February jobs report.And as those companies hike wages, their competitors are being pressured to do the same. This week, Kroger (KR), Dollar Tree (DLTR) and Ross Stores (ROST) all said they're raising wages for employees, and their stocks sold off amid worries about profit margins.Wall Street also expects that the jobless rate dipped to 4.0% in February for the first time since 2000, as the economy added a robust 205,000 jobs.Use IBD's MarketSmith For Free Until March 11

84,TGT,"See stocks near a buy point, get chart pattern recognition and run custom screens. Start NowThe combination of low and falling unemployment with accelerating wage gains fits perfectly with the Phillips curve theory that has long guided Federal Reserve policy. As far as investors are concerned, the key point is that most Fed policymakers still seem pretty confident that inflation pressures won't follow too far behind wage pressures, as businesses pass along a portion of their higher wage bills.That's why an interest-rate scare is looking increasingly likely, even if a legitimate inflation scare doesn't materialize.Yet the competitive environment facing Kroger from Walmart and Amazon.com (AMZN) via its Whole Foods division, among others, offers at least some reason to doubt whether wage pressure will feed through to higher prices. Kroger said on Thursday that it will use one-third of its tax cut to boost shareholder returns, but the other two-thirds will go to higher wages and lower prices.Kroger gave weak profit guidance as it forecast smaller profit margins, sending shares crashing 12% on Thursday.Walmart's minimum-wage hike to $11 an hour was its first for new, entry-level workers since 2015, when it raised its minimum wage to $9 an hour. Then, in early 2016, Walmart hiked pay for all current associates to a minimum of $10 an hour, leading Target, Costco (COST) and others to raise their own wages. The point is that wage hikes can come in bunches. It didn't really happen last year, when wage growth hit a bit of a lull. But it does appear to be happening in 2018.If it does, Wall Street will continue to bump up odds for a fourth rate hike in 2018. Already those odds are about 1 in 3, up from about 20% a month ago, according to the CME Group's FedWatch tool.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:These Three Dow Jones Stocks Are Near Buy Points As 2 FANGs Make Bullish MoveThe Big Picture: This Is The Real News For InvestorsHere Are 10 Chip Stocks Breaking Out, Hitting New Highs Or Setting UpWhat Do Facebook, Grubhub, Salesforce And Epam Have In Common?

86,TGT,"Deep discount retailer Dollar Tree (DLTR) fell short of fourth-quarter forecasts across the board and gave weak guidance, sinking shares Wednesday. The dollar store is the latest discount chain to sell off after reporting earnings. Costco (COST), meanwhile, pulled ahead of revenue expectations in the afternoon.X Estimates: Profit to grow 37% to $1.90 per share in Q4 as revenue rises 14% to $6.4 billion. Consensus Metrix expects 2.8% same-store sales growth, including 4% comps from flagship Dollar Tree stores and 1.5% comps from Family Dollar locations.Results: EPS of $1.89 on revenue of $6.36 billion. Same-store sales increased 2.4%, including 3.8% growth at Dollar Tree and a 1% gain at Family Dollar.Outlook: Q1 EPS of $1.18 to $1.25, below consensus for $1.32, on revenue of $5.53 billion-$5.63 billion, below consensus of $5.65 billion, with combined same-store sales up by low single digits.

Heading into earnings, the stock had hit resistance at its 50-day moving average after breaching the key level in early February. Dollar General (DG) fell 4.3% Wednesday and Five Below (FIVE) dropped 3.6%.Analysts have pointed to dollar stores' resilience against online stores of Amazon's ilk, thanks to their reach into more rural areas and potential consumer benefits from tax reform.But several discount retailers have had a rough earnings season. Off-price apparel retailer Ross Stores (ROST) plunged 6.4% as a cautious outlook overshadowed solid fourth-quarter EPS and sales. Target (TGT) sold off Tuesday after reporting weak holiday earnings and profit guidance, not long after Walmart (WMT) crashed in late February for the same miss-and-warn report.IBD'S TAKE: Buying or holding a stock can be risky heading into an earnings report. Here's an earnings options strategy that can help you cash in on post-earnings stock gains, while minimizing the risk from a weak quarter.Estimates: Earnings to rise 24% to $1.45 per share on 10% sales growth to $32.71 billion. Core same-store sales, minus gas and the impact of foreign exchange, are expected to rise 5.5%, per Consensus Metrix. Including those elements, analysts are expecting comp growth of 7.5% globally.Results: Diluted earnings of of $1.59 a share on $32.995 billion in revenue, including membership fees. But minus a 17-cent per-share benefit from changes in the tax laws, Costco earned $1.42 per share, short of views.Excluding gas and foreign exchange, comps grew 5.4%.  Including gas and foreign exchange, comps rose 8.4%.Stock: Costco initially rallied, but then turned fractionally lower. The stock closed down 2.1% to 187.36 during the regular session. The stock has a flat base with a 199.98 buy point as it bobs around its 50-day line.Results from the membership-based wholesaler come amid a backdrop of battling among the major retailers: namely, Walmart and Amazon.

89,TGT,"Don't be fooled by the weak job growth or higher-than-expected unemployment in March. Better wage growth and less labor-market slack mean the stock market won't get much of a reprieve from Fed rate-hike fears.The good news: The surprisingly weak 103,000 job gain throws a bit of cold water on the notion that the economy is overheating. Yet a hawkish shift by the data-dependent Federal Reserve will continue to remain a risk for investors with every wage and inflation report. The consumer price index coming out on Wednesday is the next one to watch. UniCredit Research expects the core CPI, excluding food and energy, to rise 2% from a year ago vs. 1.8% in February.Following the report, Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite initially moved higher, then relapsed in late morning trade on the stock market today. The Dow Jones, S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite were all down 1% or more.Before the report, stock market futures were deep in the red in reaction to President Trump's threat to strike back at China even harder, with tariffs on an additional $100 billion in imports.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe 10-year Treasury yield slipped about 5 basis points to 2.78% as stocks fell and the jobs and unemployment data surprised on the soft side. Odds of four Federal Reserve rate hikes this year, one more than expected, eased to about 26% after the report, according to CME Group's FedWatch tool.Average hourly wages rose 8 cents to $26.82 an hour, lifting the annual gain to 2.7%, in line with expectations.Wall Street economists expected a 175,000 job gain, 4.0% unemployment and 2.7% average wage growth.Still, job growth has averaged a solid 202,000 the past three months, including revisions. A balmy February likely shifted some seasonal job employment forward, depressing March job creation.Harm Bandholz, chief U.S. economist at UniCredit, pointed out that jobless rate actually did decline in March — if you don't round to the tenths — from 4.14% to 4.07%. Over the past 12 months, the labor force has increased by 125,000 per month, on average, well below the pace of job creation. ""Looking forward, we continue to expect the jobless rate to fall towards 3.5% by the end of the year.""Employers also have been increasing work hours, further evidence of less slack. On a weekly basis, the average wage rose 3.3% from a year ago in March, the best gain in seven years.Investors should expect the improvement in hourly wage growth to be the start of a trend for two reasons.First, dozens of major employers announced wage hikes over the past few months, but few came early enough to show up in February's jobs report. Walmart (WMT) and CVS Health (CVS) hiked their minimum wages to $11 an hour. Six months after raising its minimum wage to $11, Target (TGT) said last month that it will pay all current associates at least $12 an hour starting this spring.Second, wage growth receded in the spring of 2017, rising just 2.2% at an annual rate from March through June. As those months that saw depressed pay gains drop off, replaced by months with firmer growth this year, the annual rate will trend higher.Take a closer look at Walmart's wage changes. Before its pay hike announced in January 2018, Walmart hadn't raised its base wage in nearly three years. That's a big deal. When Walmart hiked its minimum wage for all current associates to $10 an hour in February 2016, that wage hike was contagious.Walmart is big enough to put upward pressure on wages for other employers. Target and Costco (COST) were among those who quickly hiked pay shortly after that 2016 move. Average hourly earnings growth rose to 2.8% that July before momentum flagged.Walmart's 2016 wage hike came when the jobless rate was nearly 5%. Now it's around 4%, so competition for workers has intensified. At least for workers on the lower end of the wage spectrum, pay hikes appear to be broad-based. Starbucks (SBUX), Kroger (KR), Dollar Tree (DLTR) and Ross Stores (ROST) all have said they're raising pay. Meanwhile, dozens of banks, including Bank of America (BAC) and Wells Fargo (WFC) hiked their minimum wage to $15 an hour for tellers.As wage gains accelerate and the jobless rate moves below 4% in coming months, Fed policymakers may lean toward four interest-rate hikes in 2018, not just three. Fed models assume that inflation will follow wage growth higher. There's reason to be skeptical. For example, Kroger said last month that it will use the bulk of its tax cut to offset the cost of higher wages and lower prices. The competitive environment facing Kroger from Walmart and Amazon (AMZN) via its Whole Foods division offers at least some reason to doubt whether wage pressure will feed through to higher prices.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN: The Big Picture: Here's The Problem With The Stock Market RallyThis Defense Giant Breaks Out As 4 Peers Target Buy Points: Investing Action PlanHow To Invest In A Late-Stage Bull Market As FANG Stocks SlumpStocks To Watch: These Stocks Just Got Added To IBD 50, IPO LeadersTop Stock LGI Homes Breaks Out To Buy Zone On Strong Growth

90,TGT,"After a year of scorching revenue gains, teen-centric retailer Five Below (FIVE) now faces questions on whether there's life after fidget spinners.XThe small, propeller-like toys, held between one's thumb and finger and spun for enticingly long periods of time, met a hyperactive nation's fidgety needs last year. They also jolted Five Below's sales higher.When Wall Street sensed last spring and summer that the trend had reached its limit, the company's stock wavered during that time. But the good news for Five Below is that children also like fake slime. And they like foam toys called squishies, and things with mermaids on them, and grips that stick onto the backs of smartphones.They might also appreciate, as investors do, that the company plans to open around 125 U.S. stores this year, and could open hundreds more in the years ahead.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of Use""Fads are important to Five Below,"" Dougherty analyst Jeremy Hamblin said. ""But they're not the be-all, end-all.""Those items — spinners, squishies and a broad supporting cast of other items sold for $5 or less — have made Five Below one of the few standouts in a retail industry grappling with an e-commerce upheaval. Its $5 price range has kept Amazon (AMZN) at bay, for now.Annual same-store sales have come in positive since 2007. The company's stock has sprinted 70% higher over the past 12 months. The stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 97 out of a best-possible 99. Five Below also is targeting at least 20% net income and sales growth through 2020, which some analysts say is attainable. Shares were down 1.8% Friday afternoon amid a broad market sell-off to near 71.25.And as toy-store chain Toys R Us prepares to liquidate its U.S. stores, their loss could be Five Below's gain.""The company today represents kind of a rare breed in retail, and that's a young, fast-growing, dynamic company that has lots of room to grow,"" BTIG analyst Alan Rifkin said. ""Growth in retail is so rare that investors are grabbing stories like this and really running with it.""Other discount retail chains, like Burlington Stores (BURL) and TJX Cos. (TJX), have tried to Amazon-proof themselves by using low-priced clothes and home products as a reason to actually go to stores. Once customers are in, they might find a marked-down item they like — and didn't know they wanted — and buy it. The retail industry calls that experience the ""treasure hunt.""Five Below's stores aim to do the same thing, but for a younger crowd.""Consumers want experiences, and kids can be turned loose in the stores and it's a treasure hunt,"" Rifkin said of Five Below. ""They can go around the store and put (items) in their basket that they want that they didn't really realize that they wanted before. It's tough to get that on the internet.""Five Below's products are organized into eight different ""worlds,"" or categories, like Room, Style, Sports, Tech and a section called Now, for trendy or seasonal items. The store offers headphones, phone cases, fitness gear, blankets and pillows. There's also heli balls — a ball with helicopter propellers attached to it — themed after Marvel superheroes. That wide array, Hamblin said, allows it to compete with a variety of different brick-and-mortar and online retailers.A KeyBanc analysis of products at Five Below and similar products at Amazon last year found that overall, Five Below's products were 53% less expensive. They offer ""value that is not replicated"" at the online retailer, KeyBanc said in a note to clients.""We think that's a winning formula in the retail world,"" said KeyBanc analyst Brad Thomas. Thomas was among those who sensed the fidget spinner trend might have been ending last spring.That formula also includes plans to open up a whole lot more stores, following expansions into big states like Texas and Florida. The company opened 15 of them in California last year, with plenty of room to advance into San Francisco and San Diego. The company, which already has some 650 stores in 32 states, plans to open 125 stores this year, and says its store count could eventually reach 2,500.Further, Chief Executive Joel Anderson is a veteran of Toys R Us and Walmart (WMT). Its merchandising chief, Michael Romanko, has a team that has been able to sniff out trends early. The company also plans to open more distribution centers, including one in the Midwest in 2021.""Which, to me, I interpreted as them saying 'We're gonna continue that 20% growth for even longer than what most investors had expected,'"" Hamblin said. ""And I think what's why you've seen the stock rally even though the market has come in.""The analyst praise for Five Below comes as Toys R Us plans to shut down operations in the U.S. and liquidate its 735 U.S. stores. The company filed for bankruptcy protection last year, following mounting debt and competition from companies like Walmart and Amazon.""We think in a world where Toys R Us no longer exists, or is soon to no longer exist, that brands will increasingly be looking to Five Below to grow their own revenue,"" Thomas said.But Hamblin notes that the fallout from big retail bankruptcies can be ""notoriously difficult"" to predict. The Toys R Us implosion could lead to a discount frenzy, pulling in bargain-seeking customers before the stores are vacated, temporarily thinning customer traffic at Five Below.As Five Below's stock climbs, analyst expectations have climbed with it. During fiscal 2017, the company delivered same-store sales gains that were as high as 9.3%. That number could be difficult to top this year. Analysts also worry the stock is getting expensive.The company, when it reported fourth-quarter earnings last month, also offered a tempered outlook for the year ahead, with full-year earnings-per-share and revenue forecasts coming in below expectations.As the company expands at a brisk pace, attracting qualified people to fill management and staff positions will remain a challenge. Hamblin said the company plans to have five distribution centers in 2021, up from two today. Growing such operations over a relatively short period of time could also be a challenge.RBC also notes that Five Below ""sells predominantly 'discretionary' goods ('wants' vs. 'needs') and by extension is susceptible to risk of a protracted economic downturn"" as customers spend more on the things they need. Any downturn could make a dramatic expansion plan look like a bad idea in hindsight.Even as the company grows, it isn't as ubiquitous as Walmart, Target (TGT) or Toys R Us. The company has launched an e-commerce segment that, while comprising a fraction of sales, could make it more recognizable.""The e-commerce is helping increase the awareness of this company. That's a challenge too,"" Rifkin said.

91,TGT,"Core consumer prices, excluding food and energy, rose a faster-than-expected 0.3% in January and 1.8% from a year ago, the Labor Department reported on Wednesday, raising the odds of Federal Reserve interest rate hikes.X The overall consumer price index rose 0.5% on the month and 2.1% from a year ago, amid higher energy prices.Food at home prices rose 0.1% on the month as Amazon.com (AMZN) continues to inject even more intensive competition into the grocery business since closing its acquisition of Whole Foods last summer.Wall Street expected the core CPI to rise 0.2% on the month and 1.7% from a year ago. The consensus called for a 0.3% monthly and 2.0% annual rise in the broad CPI.After the report, futures for the Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite reversed from solid gains to down more than 1% at one point. The major averages fell modestly at the open but the Nasdaq led an upside reversal.Menawhile, the 10-year Treasury yield was at 2.88%, back at four-year highs.

Make sure to read The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market's prevailing trend, so you'll know when will make sense to get aggressive again.Thanks to a just-arriving fiscal boost from tax cuts and more stimulus coming from last week's $320 billion deficit-hiking spending deal, the balance of economic risks has shifted to the upside. JPMorgan economists are now expecting the jobless rate to fall to 3.2% by the end of 2019, and they think the Fed could raise rates eight times by then.After January's jobs report showed that average hourly wage growth accelerated to 2.9% in January from a year ago, after being stuck around 2.5% for most of 2017, markets suddenly started to price in a risk that dormant wage and price inflation may shift into higher gear.Wage growth is seen a prelude to higher inflation, and there is reason to expect better wage gains, even if the wage acceleration that showed up in January's employment report was a misleading product of a shorter workweek.Walmart (WMT) announced in January that it was hiking base pay to $11 an hour, three years after it last announced a boost in starting pay to $9 an hour. Last week, CVS Health (CVS) said it also will adopt an $11 minimum wage in April. Both companies tied their wage hikes at least loosely to their tax cuts, but that's only part of the story. Competition for quality workers led Target (TGT) to boost its wage to $11 starting last October, when tax reform was still up in the air. At the time, Target made a commitment to raise its base wage to $15 an hour by the end of 2020. Starbucks (SBUX), JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Wells Fargo (WFC) also are among the dozens of big employers who have hiked wages in the wake of tax cuts.Even with tax cuts, the risk that wage growth will feed through to higher inflation had appeared modest enough for investors to mostly discount, as consumers have grown to expect internet price transparency and the ever-expanding reach of Amazon to keep inflation in check.Those competitive dynamics and the need to boost productivity help explain why Walmart, even as it hiked its minimum wage in January, also shut dozens of Sam's Clubs employing about 10,000 workers, cut 3,500 store co-manager positions and thinned the ranks at its headquarters.If companies don't have the luxury of raising prices to offset higher wages, pay hikes stand to cut into profits, which is among the reasons that CVS shares traded lower after announcing wage increases.YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Why The Stock Market Sold Off, And What You Should Do NowThis Shock Economic Outlook May Keep Stock Market On EdgeHow Do You Spot A Major Stock Market Top?

97,TGT,"IBD'S TAKE: Buying or holding a stock can be risky heading into an earnings report. Here's an earnings options strategy that can help you cash in on post-earnings stock gains, while minimizing the risk from a weak quarter.American Eagle's rival Abercrombie & Fitch on Wednesday beat profit and revenue views, with fourth-quarter comps up a strong 9%. Same-store sales for its Hollister chain jumped 11%.Shares shot up 12% on Wednesday to 23.89, blasting out past a short consolidation to a 22-month high. But A&F sank 6.45% to 22.35.Despite the strong results, Abercrombie & Fitch will close another 60 stores later this year. As part of a turnaround plan, the retailer has cut back on racy advertisements and is also offering more merchandise without flashy logos.Late Tuesday Urban Outfitters (URBN) announced EPS had swelled to 69 cents a share with revenue up 5.7 to $1.089 billion. Same-store sales also rose 8% at Free People, 5% at the Anthropologie Group and 2% at Urban Outfitters.Urban Outfitters shares were up and down Wednesday, but closed 0.2% higher at 37.07, holding above a 36.20 entry point.Urban Outfitters lost 5.2% to 35.13, undercutting that buy point.Even as trendy apparel retailers have found their footing, several discounters have sold off following their earnings reports, including Dollar Tree (DLTR), Target (TGT) and Walmart (WMT).YOU MAY ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Bullish Chart Patterns II: How To Find The Exact Buy PointRetail & E-Commerce Stocks And Industry NewsStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth Stocks

98,TGT,"The U.S. economy added 313,000 jobs in February, while the unemployment rate held at 4.1%, the Labor Department said on Friday.X Average hourly wages rose 4 cents to $26.75 an hour, up a tame 2.6% from a year earlier. That missed consensus expectations of 2.9% rise. January's wage gain, originally reported as a 2.9% rise, was revised down to 2.8%.Wall Street expected a gain of 205,000 jobs and 4.0% jobless rate.December and January payrolls were revised up by a combined 54,000.After the jobs report, the Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq 100 futures moved significantly higher on the stock market today. The S&P 500 index, which closed a point below its 50-day moving average on Thursday, reclaimed that key level at Friday's open.The 10-year Treasury yield rose a few basis points to 2.9% but the jobs and wage data didn't substantially bolster the case for the Federal Reserve to add an extra interest-rate hike in 2018.Despite the blowout jobs number, the data may give stocks a tad more running room before Fed hike expectations begin to bite, but investors shouldn't take too much comfort.While the data don't show that Goldilocks-type wage gains are history, bigger pay gains are likely coming this spring, reflecting recently announced wage hikes from Walmart (WMT), Target (TGT), CVS Health (CVS) and Starbucks (SBUX), which don't show up yet in the February jobs report.And as those companies hike wages, their competitors are being pressured to do the same. This week, Kroger (KR), Dollar Tree (DLTR) and Ross Stores (ROST) all said they're raising wages for employees, and their stocks sold off amid worries about profit margins.The retail sector added 50,000 jobs, while construction employment surged 61,000 and manufacturers hired a net 31,000.The likely combination of low and falling unemployment with accelerating wage gains would fit perfectly with the Phillips curve theory that has long guided Federal Reserve policy. As far as investors are concerned, the key point is that most Fed policymakers still seem pretty confident that inflation pressures won't follow too far behind wage pressures, as businesses pass along a portion of their higher wage bills.Use IBD's MarketSmith For Free Until March 11

99,TGT,"See stocks near a buy point, get chart pattern recognition and run custom screens. Start NowThat's why an interest-rate scare is looking possible, even if a legitimate inflation scare doesn't materialize.The competitive environment facing Kroger from Walmart and Amazon.com (AMZN) via its Whole Foods division, among others, offers at least some reason to doubt whether wage pressure will feed through to higher prices. Kroger said on Thursday that it will use one-third of its tax cut to boost shareholder returns, but the other two-thirds will go to higher wages and lower prices.Kroger gave weak profit guidance as it forecast smaller profit margins, sending shares crashing 12% on Thursday.Walmart's minimum-wage hike to $11 an hour was its first for new, entry-level workers since 2015, when it raised its minimum wage to $9 an hour. Then, in early 2016, Walmart hiked pay for all current associates to a minimum of $10 an hour, leading Target, Costco (COST) and others to raise their own wages. The point is that wage hikes can come in bunches. It didn't really happen last year, when wage growth hit a bit of a lull. But it does appear to be happening in 2018.If it does, Wall Street will continue to bump up odds for a fourth rate hike in 2018. Already those odds are about 1 in 3, up from about 20% a month ago, according to the CME Group's FedWatch tool.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:These Three Dow Jones Stocks Are Near Buy Points As 2 FANGs Make Bullish MoveThe Big Picture: This Is The Real News For InvestorsHere Are 10 Chip Stocks Breaking Out, Hitting New Highs Or Setting UpWhat Do Facebook, Grubhub, Salesforce And Epam Have In Common?

See if Costco Wholesale can continue to show renewed price strength and hit that benchmark. Looking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch? Start HereCostco Wholesale broke out earlier, but is now around 4% below the prior 195.45 entry from a flat base. In the case where a stock breaks out then falls 7% or more below the entry price, it's considered a failed breakout. If that happens, it's best to wait for a new pattern to form. Also understand that the latest consolidation is a later-stage base, which makes it riskier to establish a new position or add shares to an existing one.

103,TGT,"Sharing his boldest prediction for 2018, venture capitalist Gene Munster on Tuesday said he thinks e-commerce leader Amazon (AMZN) will acquire retail giant Target (TGT).X ""Getting the timing on this is difficult, but seeing the value of the combination is easy,"" wrote Munster, who is managing partner at Loup Ventures. Before that, he'd worked as an analyst at Piper Jaffray for 21 years.Amazon believes the future of retail is a mix of mostly online and some offline, brick-and-mortar retailing, wrote Munster, in his list of predictions. An example of that is Amazon's acquisition of Whole Foods Market and its 470 supermarkets. If Amazon acquires Target that would jump its store count to about 2,300.""Target is the ideal offline partner for Amazon for two reasons: shared demographic and manageable but comprehensive store count,"" Munster wrote. He said Target's focus on moms is a match with Amazon aggressively targeting moms through promotions around its Prime membership program.Speaking of Prime, Amazon on Tuesday announced its ""Best of Prime 2017,"" saying it shipped more than 5 billion items through Prime this past year. Amazon also said it now provides free, one-day delivery in more than 8,000 U.S. cities and towns, and two-hour delivery with Prime Now in more than 30 major cities.There are an estimated 88 million Prime customers, who pay $99 a year and receive free shipping, free music and video and other perks.IBD'S TAKE: Amazon has been a big winner, with the stock up 56% in 2017.

105,TGT,"Wal-Mart (WMT) said it will raise its starting wage to $11 an hour as part of an initial plan to ""share in tax savings"" with 1 million employees.X The retail giant said the wage hike will cost it $300 million in the coming fiscal year, beyond its already-planned wage increases. Wal-Mart also said it will spend another $400 million in the current year ending Jan. 31 on one-time bonuses ranging from $200 to $1,000 based on length of service.As the nation's largest private employer, Wal-Mart has a big influence on working-class wages, so its pay hike could result in increases for many other workers in modest-pay industries.Shares of Wal-Mart fell 1 cent to 99.66 on the stock market today. Wal-Mart has been flirting with a 100.23 flat-base buy point, but the stock's relative strength line has been lagging while the major averages continue to climb.The Dow Jones industrial average, Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 index all were up about 0.2%-0.3% in the early going after the Nasdaq and S&P 500 suffered their first loss of 2018 on Wednesday.On Wednesday, Waste Management (WM) joined the parade of companies providing bonuses or wage hikes on the heels of tax cuts, saying up to 34,000 employees would get a $2,000 bonus. With Wal-Mart's moves, companies are crediting the tax cuts for providing additional pay to more than 2 million workers.Among the biggest announcements have been $1,000 bonus awards by American Airlines (AAL) (127,000 employees); AT&T (T) (200,000); Bank of America (BAC) (145,000); and Comcast (CMCSA) (100,000). The generosity of those announcements was undercut somewhat by reports that AT&T and Comcast were in the midst of layoffs.In addition, utilities are implementing modest cuts to the power bills of millions of customers.IBD'S TAKE: Wal-Mart is ranked No. 2 by IBD in the Retail-Major Discount Chains industry group, based on earnings, sales, margin and stock performance trends. Visit IBD Stock Checkup to see how other retailers stack up. The Retail-Major Discount Chains group is ranked No. 41 of 197 industry groups based on stock performance.  As long as the current ""confirmed uptrend"" — the equivalent of a green light — stays in place, leading stocks breaking above a buy point are more likely than not to have the wind at their backs. Here's a good place to start looking for stocks that may be poised to move higher.Wal-Mart also announced additional benefits for full-time hourly associates, including 10 weeks of paid maternity leave and six weeks of paid parental leave, as well as adoption assistance of $5,000.Wal-Mart's wage hike follows one by Target (TGT), which increased its minimum wage to $11 an hour starting last October. At the same time, Target made a commitment to raise its base wage to $15 an hour by the end of 2020.In January 2016, Wal-Mart said it would hike its minimum wage for nearly all employees to $10 an hour, but it kept its starting wage at $9 an hour for employees in their first six months.YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Here Comes A $1 Trillion — Scratch That — $2 Trillion U.S. Federal DeficitFederal Reserve Gives Trump Tax Cuts A Green LightThese Five Top Stocks Hit Buy Points; Why This One Stands OutHow To Invest In Stocks For Free: New Apps Aim For BeginnersLooking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch?

106,TGT,"Sprouts Farmers Market (SFM) initially moved into a buy zone after delivering some pleasing preliminary earnings results. But shares reversed to close lower.X The natural foods grocery-store chain said late Monday that it expects to report per-share earnings ""slightly above its previously announced guidance"" of 98-99 cents, as well as a 15.3% net sales gains and 2.9% in full-year same-store sales growth.That compares to current analyst estimates for 99 cents EPS and 14.9% in sales growth for the year, according to Zacks Investment Research.Shares rose as high as 35.50 in the stock market today, crossing a 25.10 entry point from a stage-one bottoming base. But Sprouts reversed, closing down 1.5% to 24.39.In the release, Sprouts CEO Amin Maredia called the performance ""a direct result of our unique model offering health and value across the store, consistent execution and focus against our strategic initiatives.""For Q4, Sprouts said it sees 4.6% same-store sales growth. The announcement preceded a presentation Tuesday morning by Sprouts' CEO and CFO at the yearly ICR Conference, a key retail and restaurant-industry event.But Morningstar analyst John Brick remained cautious.""We believe the announcement shows the benefits of Sprouts' differentiated model and value proposition to its customers, but we aren't wavering from our no-moat rating, as we fear the intense competitive environment will constrain profitability, as well as the firm's ability to generate excess returns on invested capital over time,"" he wrote.IBD's TAKE: What is a ""bottoming base""? Here's how to spot one.Sprouts, Kroger (KR) and other grocer stocks faced pressure last June after Amazon first shocked the market with news that it was acquiring Whole Foods market. Then soon after the deal closed, Amazon cut prices on certain items at Whole Foods, pressuring shares of its rivals further.And now, Whole Foods products are available via Amazon, as major grocery players like Target (TGT), Wal-Mart (WMT) and Kroger work on developing their own grocery delivery capabilities.With Tuesday's move, shares of Sprouts have finally recovered above the 25 price point, a level not seen since the days before Amazon's bombshell announcement.Separately, Sprouts announced Tuesday a new partnership with Instacart, a move that will help the grocery store to expand home delivery service to major markets beyond the eight cities that Sprouts currently services.Phoenix and Tucson, Ariz. will be the first cities to benefit from the deal, with more cities to be announced at a later date, said the company.""Home delivery is a natural way for Sprouts to engage with our customers on their healthy living journey, and our partnership with Instacart allows us to quickly scale for growth,"" said Maredia in a release on the partnership.Target said last month that it was acquiring Instacart rival Shipt, axing its relationship with Instacart.Shares of Amazon rose 0.5%, and Kroger lost 0.7%.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Here's How Target, Amazon Are Expanding Same-Day ShippingKroger Earnings Unexpectedly Rise Despite Amazon CompetitionHere's Everything That's Changed At Whole Foods After The Amazon TakeoverRetail & E-Commerce Stocks And Industry News

108,TGT,"Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) ended months of back and forth with regulators over its buyout of Rite Aid (RAD) by scrapping the deal Thursday and instead announcing a new one for just half of Rite Aid's stores.XWalgreens will pay $5.18 billion for 2,186 stores plus a $325 million termination fee to Rite Aid, which pulled out of a separate deal with Fred's (FRED), the pharmacy chain that would've received 865 Rite Aid's stores under the prior deal with Walgreens. Fred's will get a $25 million termination fee.Under the new deal, which is expected to close within six months, Walgreens sees the Rite Aid stores adding to adjusted earnings in the first year and creating $400 million in synergiesMeanwhile, Walgreens reported fiscal Q3 results that topped views. Adjusted earnings per share of $1.33 beat consensus forecasts by 2 cents, and sales of $30.1 billion topped estimates of $29.68 billion.The company raised the low end of its 2017 EPS outlook and now sees $4.98-$5.08, up from a prior view of $4.90-$5.08. Wall Street sees $5.00.Rite Aid also reported quarterly results, swinging to an adjusted Q1 loss of 5 cents a share, as revenue fell 4.9% to $7.8 billion. Same-store sales dropped 3.9%, with pharmacy sales down 5% and front-end sales down 1.5%.Walgreens shares closed up 1.7% at 78.37 in the stock market today after hitting 81.55 in the morning. Rite Aid sank 26.5% to 2.89, hitting their worst levels in nearly four years. Fred's collapsed 23% to 9.51. CVS Health (CVS) retreated 1.2%.The new deal follows nearly two years of will-they, won't-they drama surrounding the initial merger agreement, which was first announced in October 2015.More recently, Rite Aid shares vaulted 30% on Monday on a report that the Federal Trade Commission was ""more likely than not"" to approve the merger. But earlier this month, Rite Aid stock crashed on reports the FTC was preparing ""advice"" to block the merger with Walgreens.The FTC had until July 7 to approve or deny the merger. The combination would've fuse together the second and third largest drugstore chains to create a massive rival to CVS Health.Zacks, in a research note this month, said that Rite Aid has focused more on making over its wellness stores, which feature things like vision and diabetic diagnostic centers, and growing its clinical and pharmacy offerings.Both Rite Aid and Walgreens also face growing competition from Wal-Mart (WMT) and Target (TGT), which have broadened their pharmacy businesses, Zacks said.RELATED:Rite Aid Stock Just Had Its Best Gain In 20 Months As Walgreens Deadline NearsAre These Amazon's Next Five Targets?

109,TGT,"XAmazon.com (AMZN) said Tuesday that customers who receive government assistance in the U.S. can now sign up for Prime membership for the discounted price of $5.99 a month, presenting another head-on challenge to Wal-Mart (WMT).At least 1 in 5 Wal-Mart customers uses food stamps at the big-box retailer, according to Reuters. Amazon's announced Prime fee represents a steep cut to its usual price of $10.99 a month ($99 for annual memberships). The program not only includes free two-day shipping — a front on which Wal-Mart has been studiously fighting — but also free two-hour and same-day delivery, plus a vast library of movies, shows and music.Those with valid Electronic Benefits Transfer (EBT) cards are eligible for the discount, said Amazon in a release, and customers can qualify every year up to four times. The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and Women, Infants, and Children Nutrition (WIC) are among the programs that distribute funds using EBT cards.The e-commerce giant said it will add more ways to qualify, including for customers who receive non-EBT government assistance.""We designed this membership option for customers receiving government assistance to make our everyday selection and savings more accessible, including the many conveniences and entertainment benefits of Prime,"" said Amazon Prime VP Greg Greeley in the release.Amazon is one of seven e-grocers participating in a USDA pilot program that allows online use of food stamps, according to a CBS News report from January.Shares of Wal-Mart sold off 1.7% to 78.93 on the stock market today.

110,TGT,"Shares of Sears Canada (SRSC) crashed Wednesday following reports that the ailing retailer could be headed for liquidation after moving to seek protection from creditors, deepening the wounds suffered by brick-and-mortar chains as Amazon.com (AMZN) continues to pluck customers from malls.Sears Canada could have trouble selling off its locations to a single purchaser, as many of those locations are in lower-tier shopping centers, Bloomberg said.Sears Canada earlier this month raised ""significant doubt"" over its ability to continue operating after struggling to obtain sufficient financing. Meanwhile, Sears Holdings (SHLD), which owns 12% of Sears Canada, warned in March that ""substantial doubt"" existed over whether it could survive.Sears Canada shares tumbled nearly 20% to 47 cents on the stock market today. Sears Holdings dropped 5.4% to 6.43. J.C. Penney (JCP) fell 5.7%, Dillard's (DDS) dropped 2.3% and Kohl's (KSS) lost 1.3%. Mid-tier Macy's (M) slid 2.3% while upscale Nordstrom (JWN) edged down 0.3% after both sold off Tuesday on news that Amazon will start a service that allows customers to receive clothes at home and try them on before buying them.IBD'S TAKE: Running a retailer in recent years has become a lot more about managing real estate. Macy's is even looking at how to rework its parking lots.A liquidation of Sears Canada would follow Target's (TGT) plans, announced in 2015, to exit Canada, and it would join a growing list of retailers in bankruptcy or on the brink.In March, discount department-store chain Gordmans Stores filed for bankruptcy with plans to liquidate. Wet Seal, BCBG Maxzria and Payless ShoeSource have filed for bankruptcy in recent months as well.In April, women's apparel chain Bebe (BEBE) said it would close all its stores by the end of May to become an online-only retailer, and Vince (VNCE) said it had ""substantial doubt about the company's ability to continue"" over leverage debt ratio concerns.Sears Canada's potential move toward creditor protection would also come as Sears' legal disputes with suppliers increasingly occur out in the open.Sears Holdings has sued two suppliers of Craftsman tools in the past two months over their agreements to deliver products to the retailer. Sears this month settled with the first of those companies, One World, which Sears CEO Eddie Lampert said had tried to ""embarrass us in the media to force us to let them out of their contract.""RELATED:Amazon-Whole Foods Merger Could Be 'Category Killer' For Food, EateriesWhat Amazon's Whole Foods Deal Means For RetailMacy's Doesn't Know How To Fix Its Stores, Hopes Something Will Work

111,TGT,"Stock futures rose solidly Monday morning, suggesting a positive start to the week after a volatile, split market over the last several sessions. Techs were leading the way, but the Dow Jones industrial average may open at a record high.A U.S. Boeing (BA) F/A-18E Super Hornet on Sunday shot down a Syrian government bomber, a day ahead of the Paris Air Show. Meanwhile, Apple (AAPL) starts the week under heavy pressure even as Facebook, Amazon (AMZN) and Alphabet (GOOGL) find key support. Markets are still digesting Amazon's $13.7 billion deal to buy Whole Foods Market (WFM), which may yet get a rival bid.Boeing and Apple are both members of the Dow Jones industrial average. Boeing is now the top-performing Dow stock in 2017, up 26%. Apple has fallen to third, up 23%, with McDonald's (MCD) now second.Futures for the Dow Jones industrial average and S&P 500 rose 0.35% above fair value. Nasdaq 100 futures advanced 0.65%.Stocks also were gaining overseas. In Asia, Japan's Nikkei climbed 0.6% and China's Shanghai composite 0.7%. In Europe, the major averages rose as Brexit talks were set to begin and after new French President Macron's centrist party decisively won parliamentary elections. The U.K.'s FTSE climbed 0.55%, Germany's Dax 0.85% and France's CAC-40 0.9%.X The Pentagon said Sunday that a U.S.-flown Boeing F/A-18E brought down a Syrian regime SU-22 bomber jet that was attacking anti-regime, American-allied fighters. It's the first time the U.S. has shot down a Syrian jet during its civil war.That comes a day ahead of the start of the Paris Air Show, where Boeing, Lockheed Martin (LMT) and other makers of civilian and military aircraft will show off their wares and announce big orders. Lockheed Martin's F-35 stealth fighter is expected to display high-G maneuvers and fancy flying to wow that crowd.IBD'S TAKE: For more chart analysis of Facebook, Amazon and Google parent Alphabet, check out IBD's latest Stocks To Watch column.It's an important time for defense spending. European leaders are stepping up defense spending amid pressure from President Trump to live up to NATO commitments. Meanwhile, Trump has hinted at giving a new contract for more F/A-18 fighters, which are cheaper than the cutting-edge F-35.Boeing's Paris Air Show is likely to focus on orders for its new 737 Max 10 stretch passenger jet as well as any buzz about a new, midrange airliner to compete with Airbus (EADSY) and its A321neo jet.Boeing announced a SpiceJet order early Monday for 40 new 737 Max 10 planes, including 20 new orders and 20 converted from 737 Max 8 orders.Boeing shares are at record levels, now slightly extended from an 185.81 flat base entry after spending several weeks in buying zone. Boeing shares edged higher in premarket trading on the stock market today.Lockheed Martin is in buy range from 270 entry initially cleared on March 17 but only decisively cleared a month ago. Raytheon (RTN), General Dynamics (GD) and Northrop Grumman (NOC) are all in buy zones as well.Apple has now flashed several sell signals over the past several sessions. Apple shares fell 4.5% last week in the heaviest weekly volume in two months and the heaviest weekly volume in a down week in 13 months. Apple is now 9% below its mid-March record high and is starting to lose sight of its 50-day moving average.Apple was up about 1% in premarket trade.Meanwhile, Alphabet, Facebook and Google parent Alphabet have all found support at the 50-day moving average. Amazon, an IBD Leaderboard stock briefly undercut that level on June 9, but has held above that level since then and never closed below that level. Facebook dropped below the 50-day several times over the prior six sessions, but always closed higher. Alphabet tested but never dropped below that key support line.The rebounds, which generally came on higher volume, offer a chance for follow-on buys or an initial positive. Keep in mind that the uptrend is under pressure, so investors should be cautious about many any purchase.As for Netflix (NFLX), the fourth member of the ""FANG"" internet group, that stock is hovering below its 50-day line, though it's showing a little better action than Apple.Whole Foods shot up 29% to 42.68 on Friday, above Amazon's 42-a-share offer. Some investors and analysts see a higher bid as possible, with pure-play grocers Kroger (KR) and private-equity backed Albertsons cited as possible suitors. But Wal-Mart (WMT) and Target (TGT) also suggested. Wal-Mart is the No. 1 grocer seller in the U.S., with Target also a big player.No doubt many grocery sellers' top executives and boards were mulling their next moves over the weekend.Shares of Kroger and other grocery sellers were big losers last week, amid concerns about the impact of an Amazon-Whole Foods deal and Kroger's big profit warning.RELATED:Why Lockheed's F-35 Could Stun Crowds At The Paris Air ShowParis Air Show Preview: This Will Be 'The Big Thing'Paris Air Show 2017: Latest Defense And Aerospace News And DealsThat's No Moon: Boeing, Apple Could Build This Disrupter In Space

112,TGT,"Now that Amazon.com (AMZN) has swallowed troubled food chain Whole Foods Market (WFM), other brick-and-mortar grocers need to act to avoid becoming industry leftovers destined for the trash bin.So says Lindsay Sakraida, director of content marketing with DealNews. ""Grocers should invest heavily in building out better, easier-to-use loyalty programs with very clear value propositions,"" she said. ""They should also remove all friction and pain points in their online ordering systems and improve the quality of customer service. Uber easily wounded cab services in many cities because taxis were often inconvenient and the organizations were overtly bad at customer care. Grocers need to make sure they aren't caught in a similar position when Amazon starts rolling out its services.""In the wake of the takeover's announcement on Friday, internet retail and web services titan Amazon is doing just fine. It is up 3% on the stock market today on news about — and market reaction to — its takeover of the grocery chain often derided as Whole Paycheck.The $13.7 billion deal is Amazon's biggest acquisition of all time and the 11th biggest global-retail deal ever, Thomson Reuters said.Observers said Amazon should be able to spice up Whole Foods. Sakraida said, ""Yes, it's extremely likely that Amazon will sweeten Whole Foods revenue and earnings over time.""Greg Wank, chairman of the food-and-beverage services group at Anchin, Block & Anchin, says the deal makes the combined entity the seventh largest food retailer in the U.S., just ahead of Ahold, based on 2016 U.S. market share data. ""This makes them a major player in grocery and just adds more pressure on Wal-Mart (WMT), Target (TGT) and Costco (COST) to not continue to lose share,"" Wank added via email.Anchin, Block & Anchin is a financial advisory firm that serves businesses, high-net-worth families and investment funds. It has clients in the food and beverage industry.""This could be the tipping point of the food tech movement, merging a sizable 440-store chain with the leading online retailer,"" Wank said. ""This could revolutionize the food retail business.""He added that Whole Foods was faced with same-store sales declines for six straight quarters and ""must have concluded that this is the best chance to turn that around.""He also added, ""Amazon, after announcing Amazon Fresh pickup locations on a test basis, (acquired) incredible reach to expand that program immediately while greatly expanding the product offerings"" through this takeover.RELATED:These Leading Stocks Fuel This Hot Janus Henderson Mutual FundWhat Amazon's Whole Foods Deal Means For Retail

117,TGT,"That $320 billion, two-year budget deal signed by President Trump on Friday will speed up economic growth and push the jobless rate to 3.2% by the end of 2019, an updated forecast from JPMorgan estimates. That's the kind of fiscal jolt that could keep stock markets jittery for an extended period.X By the end of next year, JPMorgan Chase economists expect the Federal Reserve to hike its key interest rate a whopping eight times — three more than Fed policymakers projected in December. As far as unemployment, Fed projections see it stabilizing at 3.9% next year vs. the current 4.1%JPMorgan's Fed forecast is an outlier, at least for now, but it highlights why stock markets have entered a new phase that may not quickly be left in the rearview mirror.The Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite sold off sharply on Thursday as the 10-year Treasury yield jumped all the way back to 2.88%, within a whisker of last week's four-year high. That triggered a move to a stock market correction. On Friday, the major averages tumbled on the stock market today until the S&P 500 briefly undercut its 200-day moving average. That trigger a sharp rebound, with the Dow, S&P and Nasdaq closing up 1.4%-1.5%.Bond and stock markets are suddenly concerned that interest rates will vault higher as the Fed gradually reverses government bond purchases it made to aid recovery from the financial crisis, Treasury issuance balloons to fund the return of trillion-dollar deficits, and the economy shifts into overdrive. It's no help that the deficit outlook will continue to worsen, with $2 trillion annual deficits on their way within a decade.IBD'S TAKE: The stock market is now in a correction. Read our weekly cover story on why stocks sold off and what you should do now.On Friday, Moody's said that the ""pre-eminent"" financial and economic position of the U.S. will preserve its triple-A credit. But Moody hinted that its deteriorating fiscal position could jeopardize the U.S. rating amid evidence of ""declining growth potential, coupled with emerging aversion to open trade and foreign labor.""One interesting aspect of JPMorgan's forecast is that even after the bank's economists boosted their forecast of GDP growth by 0.4 percentage point this year to reflect the budget deal, they're still expecting less-than-stellar 2.6% growth this year. In 2019, they see the budget deal lifting growth by 0.3 percentage point above their earlier forecast, but still only to 2.2%.In other words, they suspect that the economy may not have to grow all that fast to generate the kind of wage and inflationary pressures which haven't been seen since before the last recession and which most financial market participants seemed to think were history.It's possible that JPMorgan will be proved wrong by faster productivity growth and labor force growth than it expects. Yet the bank's forecast highlights why Wall Street may no longer be comfortable counting on benign economic outcomes.After Friday's jobs report showed that average hourly wage growth accelerated to 2.9% in January from a year ago, markets suddenly started to price in a risk that dormant wage and price inflation may shift into higher gear, fueled by the Trump tax cuts.Now, after the latest budget deal, the balance of economic risks has pretty clearly shifted to the upside, meaning the risk is that growth will come in too hot.While details of the January employment report suggested that the reported acceleration in wage gains was misleading, it does appear that faster wage growth is on the way.Walmart (WMT) announced in January that it was hiking base pay to $11 an hour, three years after it last announced a boost in starting pay to $9 an hour. On Thursday, CVS Health (CVS) said it also will adopt an $11 minimum wage in April. Both companies tied their wage hikes to their tax cuts, but that's only part of the story. Competition for quality workers led Target (TGT) to boost its wage to $11 starting last October, when tax reform was still up in the air. At the time, Target made a commitment to raise its base wage to $15 an hour by the end of 2020. Starbucks (SBUX), JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Wells Fargo (WFC) also are among the dozens of big employers who have hiked wages in the wake of tax cuts.Even with tax cuts, the risk that wage growth will feed through to higher inflation had appeared modest enough for investors to mostly discount, as consumers have grown to expect internet price transparency and the ever-expanding reach of Amazon.com (AMZN) to keep inflation in check.Those competitive dynamics help explain why Walmart, even as it hiked its minimum wage in January, also shut dozens of Sam's Clubs employing about 10,000 workers, cut 3,500 store co-manager positions and thinned the ranks at its headquarters.Yet now the risk of investors being caught flat-footed by a rise in inflation is growing as Washington prepares to unleash a second dose of fiscal firepower.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Did Congress, Trump Just Crush The Stock Market Rebound?Market Outlook Changes AgainAmazon Ready To Move On UPS And FedEx

118,TGT,"Just about the last thing the stock market needed as it tries to recover from the Dow Jones industrial average's 4.6% plunge to start the week was a $300 billion deficit-boosting budget deal.X The Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite sold off sharply as the 10-year Treasury yield jumped all the way back to 2.88%, within a whisker of last week's four-year high. By the close on the stock market today, the Dow sank 4.15%, the S&P 500 3.75% and the Nasdaq 3.9%. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq undercut Tuesday's intraday lows. Yet the renewed weakness in the stock market only dragged the 10-year Treasury yield moderately lower to 2.83%.The S&P 500 and other major averages had already reversed lower Wednesday in part as the increased spending agreement took hold, lifting yields.The trading action makes it look as if the stock market isn't just climbing a wall of worry, it's climbing a wall of debt, and that wall just got steeper. Already, Wall Street had been expecting $1 trillion in Treasury issuance in 2018, nearly double last year's total. Now, the deal to boost spending on defense and domestic programs, while sending more money to hurricane-hit regions, could raise that total by $150 billion or more, with no letup in years to come.IBD'S TAKE: After the Thursday, Feb. 1, market action — and before Friday's and Monday's market drubbings — IBD changed its market outlook to ""uptrend under pressure"" from ""confirmed uptrend,"" the equivalent of a green light turning yellow. Make sure to read The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market's prevailing trend, so you'll know when it makes sense to be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.The heavier load of Treasury debt that needs to be issued to fund widening deficits comes as the Federal Reserve has begun gradually reversing government bond purchases it made to aid recovery from the financial crisis. The rise in Treasury yields needed to clear all of the new supply is generally seen as a negative for stocks, because higher interest rates can curb borrowing appetites and make stocks look like less of a bargain.After Friday's jobs report showed that average hourly wage growth accelerated to 2.9% in January from a year ago, markets suddenly started to price in a risk that dormant wage and price inflation may shift into higher gear, fueled by the Trump tax cuts.Now, after the Senate budget deal that got a stamp of approval from House Speaker Paul Ryan, markets have reason to double down on those concerns. Whether or not Fed policymakers come right out and say it when they next meet in March, and New York Fed President William Dudley's comments on Thursday suggest they probably will,  the balance of economic risks has now clearly shifted to the upside, meaning the risk is that growth will come in too hot.While details of the monthly employment report suggested the concern about accelerating wage gains was premature, it does appear that faster wage growth is coming. Walmart (WMT) announced in January that it was hiking base pay to $11 an hour, three years after it last announced a boost in starting pay to $9 an hour. On Thursday, CVS Health (CVS) said it also will adopt an $11 minimum wage in April. Both companies credited the tax cuts for their decision, though the competition for quality workers led Target (TGT) to boost its wage to $11 starting last October, when tax reform was still up in the air. At the time, Target made a commitment to raise its base wage to $15 an hour by the end of 2020. Starbucks (SBUX), JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Wells Fargo (WFC) also are among the dozens of big employers who have hiked wages in the wake of tax cuts.Even with tax cuts, the risk that wage growth will feed through to higher inflation has appeared modest enough for investors to mostly discount, as consumers have grown to expect internet price transparency and the ever-expanding reach of Amazon.com (AMZN) to keep inflation in check.Those competitive dynamics help explain why Walmart, even as it hiked its minimum wage in January, also shut dozens of Sam's Clubs employing about 10,000 workers, cut 3,500 store co-manager positions and thinned the ranks at its headquarters.Yet now the risk of investors being caught flat-footed by a rise in inflation is growing as Washington prepares to unleash a second dose of fiscal firepower.YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Why The Stock Market Sold Off, And What You Should Do NowHow Do You Spot A Major Stock Market Top?

119,TGT,"Futures for the S&P 500 index, Dow Jones industrial average and Nasdaq 100 rose solidly Tuesday morning as North Korea offered to denuclearize. Meanwhile, tariff and trade war fears continued to eased after the major averages rebounded strongly Monday to close with gains of 1% or more.X Investors hoped that public opposition from House Speaker Paul Ryan and other congressional Republicans could help stock, delay or modify President Trump's steel and aluminum tariffs. Meanwhile, multiple reports late Tuesday said Trump economic adviser Gary Cohn is organizing a meeting between Trump and steel-using manufacturers later this week in a last-ditch effort to convince the president to back off.North Korea has agreed to denuclearize if the regime's safety is guaranteed, according to South Korean negotiators returning to Seoul.

120,TGT,"See stocks near a buy point, get chart pattern recognition and run custom screens. Start NowBank of America, Visa, Morgan Stanley, American Express and SVB Financial all are in second-stage bases. First- and second-stage bases are more likely to be big winners and less likely to fail than late-stage patterns, though it's no guarantee.All but American Express are showing strong relative strength lines, which track stocks' performance vs. the S&P 500 index. Keep in mind that bank stocks tend to track the S&P 500 index over time, as their flattish RS lines indicate. But with interest rates trending higher, rate-sensitive financials may outperform.Bank of America rose 1.6% to 32.13 in Monday's stock market trading, finding 50-day line support for a second straight session. The stock is 2% below a 32.77 buy point. The stock twice hit or topped that level last week, but reversed lower in both sessions, meaning the flat base was still valid as of Friday's close. BofA's RS line is holding at highs and has been trending gradually higher over the last six months.Bank of America has had two straight quarters of accelerating earnings growth.Visa rose 0.9% to 121.88 in Monday's trading, continuing to find 50-day-line support. Visa is working on a 127.98 buy point, though an aggressive trader could look at 125.40 as an alternative, early entry.Visa's RS line is near a record high.The Dow Jones component does not benefit from higher interest rates, unlike the other financials on this list, including fellow Dow Jones card giant American Express. That's because Visa does not carry the balances on Visa-branded cards, but makes money on transaction fees.IBD'S TAKE: Flat bases require a minimum of five weeks and typically the stock's decline is no more than 15% from the high to low of the consolidation.

122,TGT,"Wal-Mart Stores (WMT) is ""still very much in control of its own destiny,"" says Goldman Sachs, which upgraded the nation's largest brick-and-mortar retailer to a buy from neutral on Thursday, adding the stock to its ""conviction"" list.X For the last decade or so, retailers have been wrapping their heads around the increasingly digital-first consumer landscape with varying degrees of success, particularly as the act of shopping has evolved from mall strolls and mail-order catalogs to a high-tech logistics battle to be the first to shoppers' doorsteps.But Goldman analysts have faith in Wal-Mart's longtime retail strategy, i.e. ""selling consumables to middle-income consumers in small markets,"" even as other retailers face such uncertainty. They boosted their price target on the stock to 117 from 115.Tax reform and stronger income growth will benefit the mass market, they said, prompting them to edge up their same-store sales and earnings estimates for the company. They also expect the big-box retailer to raise its dividend amid the redeployment of cash from tax savings. A chunk of those savings should go toward Wal-Mart's decision last week to raise its minimum wage to $11 an hour and dole out bonuses.But Goldman Sachs analysts noted that Amazon (AMZN), among other things, remains a potential risk, saying ""the potential for incremental competition from AMZN, hard discounters, and traditional grocers remains significant.""Shares of Wal-Mart rose 1.6% to 104.30 on the stock market today, remaining in buy range. Solid holiday figures have been lifting some retail stocks, such as Kohl's (KSS), although it's uncertain whether strong sales in November and December will carry over through the new year.

Read our comprehensive outlook for the year. Wal-Mart's wage-hike announcement, however, was overshadowed by the sudden closure of 63 Sam's Clubs, which it owns, a move that caused a stir, since employees were reportedly not given any notice prior to the closings.In addition to the thousands of layoffs that would produce, the company also plans to cut more than 1,000 corporate-level jobs.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Wal-Mart Trademarks 'Wam!

The digital payments expert got as high as 80.39 intraday before gains melted to just 0.4%. But the stock gave follow-on entry points in December as it rebounded back above the 50-day moving average.Meanwhile, Bitcoin-related ETFs traded rather calmly.The Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC) lost just 1.5% to 2,172.60.

Here's a big one: Prime members who live in Austin, Texas, Cincinnati, Dallas and Virginia Beach, Va., can now get Whole Foods Market groceries delivered to their doors in just two hours.X The e-commerce behemoth, which announced the rollout Wednesday night, said fresh produce, meat, dairy, seafood, certain alcohol products and other Whole Foods items are available for home delivery — for free — through Prime Now's site and app. (For a fee of $7.99, on orders of $35 or more, one-hour delivery is available.) The service will expand to more American cities this year.Not long after its $13.7 billion takeover of the high-end grocer last June, Amazon was quick to cut product prices and erect Echo sales displays in Whole Foods stores. It is currently working on integrating Prime into Whole Foods' point-of-sale system; the membership program will become Whole Foods' rewards system.Supermarket giant Kroger (KR) delivers groceries through Instacart, ClickList and other services. Walmart (WMT) is pilot-testing fresh grocery delivery in six markets, including Dallas, using Deliv, Uber and its own trucks. While both brick-and-mortar chains enjoy large store counts in the thousands, the threat that Amazon and its fewer-than-500 Whole Foods stores represent has weighed on grocery stocks.Shares of Amazon fell 4.7% to close at 1,350.50 on the stock market today. Walmart retreated 2.8% to finish at 100.02, trying to hold its 50-day line. Kroger fell 4.6% to close at 27.57 and Target (TGT), which also sells groceries, lost 2.9% to 71.11.IBD's TAKE: As the grocery giants take to the streets, Walmart confirmed to Investor's Business Daily that its grocery delivery-related trademark filing ""Wam! by Walmart"" is related to active, ongoing projects. Read on for more; we did point out Amazon's hunger for groceries a year before the Whole Foods acquisition, after all. Piper Jaffray predicted in August, just a few months after the Whole Foods acquisition, that Amazon was ""well-positioned"" to capture grocery market share, particularly as people get more comfortable with the idea of shopping for food online.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN: Are Kroger And Alibaba Teaming Up To Challenge Amazon?Retail And E-Commerce News And Stocks To Watch How Private Labels Could Be Amazon, Target's Next Cash Cow

127,TGT,"In Wall Street's eyes, retailers not named Amazon (AMZN) stunk in 2017, until they didn't, buoyed toward the end of the year by holiday hopes and anticipated corporate tax-cut benefits.X Now that the eggnog and bubbly have worn off and we're beginning to see which stores really felt the Christmas spirit, what can we expect from a sector challenged by a massive cultural shift in the way people shop? Does 2018 spell more doom for your neighborhood mall, or a turning point for brick-and-mortar shops?The ""retail Armageddon narrative can moderate in 2018 as better holiday season results demonstrate that a good balance of bricks & clicks can yield growth,"" wrote Baird analysts.But if Macy's (M) and J.C. Penney's (JCP) solid November-December results – but crummy stock reaction – tell us anything, it's that not everyone has faith that one good retail Christmas can translate into continued momentum through the brand new year.""It's amazing – everybody is so short-sighted,"" NPD Group retail analyst Marshal Cohen told IBD, adding that the holidays have ""nothing to do with the success of 2018. (It's) a statement into the consumer psyche at the time.""The key festive season can account for up to 30% of some retailers' revenue for the entire year, per National Retail Federation calculations. Retail Metrics says December same-store sales are up 10.3% as of Monday, better than consensus for 7.2% comps.But thanks to aggressive discounting and year-round promotions, selling a lot of goods doesn't necessarily translate to a lot of profit for stores.And that ""false read on good news"" could lead to a ""lot of bad news and challenging news come February,"" said Cohen, as shoppers close up their wallets after chucking out the tree and taking down the lights.""Nowadays, you could be so far in the hole that a good holiday is just going to basically break you even,"" he told IBD. ""And does it mean good momentum going into the next? No. You're as good as your last sale was.""Expect more consolidation and store closures. In fact, commercial real estate services giant Cushman & Wakefield estimates more than 11,000 closures this year, a jump from last year's 9,000 shuttered storefronts.So far in 2018, Macy's has already named 11 more of the 100 stores it's in the process of closing. And Sears Holding (SHLD) on Thursday announced a deathblow to over 100 Kmart and Sears stores, as the storied department store chain, once the nation's largest retailer, continues to cling on for life.But closing a few doors isn't a bad thing, per se, in this ""over-stored"" America filled with dead malls and an abundance of shops and half-hearted foot traffic. Savvy brick-and-mortar retailers are instead beefing up their digital side in order to take on Amazon, as well as each other.""The market shouldn't ignore all traditional retailers and fawn all over Amazon and other digitally native companies,"" wrote Jefferies retail analyst Randal Konik in a Tuesday report. He said that brick-and-mortar stores' efforts to shutter stores and improve their e-commerce operations ""should lead to profit margin stabilization and improving (free cash flow) over the next 12 months.""Even department stores, despite all the murmurs about the death of the mall, should be fine.Konik sees potential headwinds for Macy's and J.C. Penney this year, ""given the success click-to-brick players have had in apparel/accessories,"" but also highlighted the steps department stores have taken to adapt, such as Kohl's (KSS) partnership with Amazon.""We keep waiting for the shoe to drop on a couple of retailers, the J.C. Penneys and the Sears,"" Cohen said. ""But you know, again, if they can make it through '15 and '16, they can certainly make it through '17.""But there's a lot of debt coming due in the next two to three years, Retail Metrics head Ken Perkins told IBD in December. It's ""hard to imagine a retailer being able to grow their business enough to grow a cash flow strong enough to pay off high debt levels.""Who's most likely to run into trouble this year? Mid-size specialty chains, predicts Cohen.Wal-Mart (WMT) gets its fair share of kudos for focusing on its digital operations, starting with the acquisition of Jet.com in 2016 and continuing with the pickup of a handful of online players such as ModCloth, Bonobos, Moosejaw and ShoeBuy last year. That, combined with its forward-looking tests – in-fridge delivery, anyone? – and competitive measures have given it decent Street cred against Amazon.Off-price retailers such as TJX (TJX) should do well, say experts, who mostly still have faith in the ""treasure hunt"" vibe that stores like Ross Stores (ROST) and Burlington Stores (BURL) emanate. In the clothing space, few things appear more Amazon-proof to research firm Cowen than a bargain bin filled with the promise of discounted brand names.Cowen analyst Oliver Chen hails T.J. Maxx and Marshalls parent TJX as his ""best idea"" for the year, and believes off-pricers as a whole will continue to grab market share from department stores and other full-price peers. He holds an outperform rating and recently increased price target of 88 on TJX.""In a challenging retail environment where most retailers are seeing traffic declines, off-price is driving traffic gains,"" wrote Jefferies' Konik, who has a hold rating on TJX and Ross Stores. ""This has led to strong, consistent comparable sales performance and well-controlled inventories in the channel, as their wide and shallow inventories rapidly turn to give shoppers something new and fresh to discover with every visit.""But Konik offers a word of caution. He sees an ""imminent"" threat in Amazon, and says off-price retailers' lack of a proper online presence – irregular inventory and e-commerce listings don't exactly go hand in hand – ""will eventually take a toll.""Smart-speaker/AI technology could be the next big thing to upend regular old commerce.Research firm Magid says voice-enabled commerce and artificial intelligence tools have ""the potential to disrupt and disintermediate retail and manufacturing.""That may leave retailers out in the cold if manufacturers go directly to consumers. In fact, packaged goods companies ""will either merge or forward integrate and acquire retail, as they realize a voice-controlled world is really, really bad for them,"" predicted L2's Scott Galloway in late December.Cowen's Chen believes voice recognition, which should reach 25%-30% penetration, will be the next mobile phone. ""Retailers will need to interject themselves into the smart and connected home and find ways to make their brands relevant to frequent audio interaction despite the challenges of lack of visual cues,"" he said in a Dec. 26 note to clients.Chen also predicts that ""previously unlikely consolidation will occur,"" and that Wal-Mart and Target (TGT) ""will undergo a cycle of M&A in order to develop customer capabilities similar to AMZN.""Loup Ventures even believes Amazon will acquire Target, calling it the ""ideal offline partner for Amazon"" because of its ""shared demographic and manageable but comprehensive store count.""Analysts tend to have mixed emotions about Target, pegging it either as a distant third wheel in the Amazon-Wal-Mart war, or a contender making some smart moves. NPD's Cohen falls into the latter camp, highlighting Target's recent acquisition of same-day delivery company Shipt, its holiday performance and private-label successes in apparel.""I think Target is going to be a huge winner,"" he said.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:How Private Labels Could Be Amazon, Target's Next Cash CowRetail And E-Commerce News And Stocks To WatchAmazon Holds Prime Position With Record 60 Million Subscribers

128,TGT,"The U.S. economy added 148,000 jobs in December, while the unemployment rate held at 4.1%, the Labor Department said on Friday.Wall Street economists expected a gain of 190,000 jobs and steady 4.1% jobless rate.X Average hourly wages rose 9 cents to $26.63 an hour, up 2.5% from a year earlier. That was in line with the expected 2.5%, still the Goldilocks reading markets enjoyed throughout 2017.Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq futures moved higher after the jobs report, with the major indexes hitting record highs early Friday. The 10-year Treasury yield slipped after the jobs and wage data that bolstered the case for the Federal Reserve to go slow in hiking its key interest rate.The continuation of tepid average wage gains comes amid a recent surge in federal withheld employment and income taxes. Over the last couple of months, Americans' paychecks have been growing at nearly the best rate in a decade.The stronger tax receipts may reflect a sugar high padded by early Christmas bonuses — AT&T (T) and Comcast (CMCSA) were among the companies pledging $1,000 bonuses for hundreds of thousands of employees as tax legislation crossed the finish line.Meanwhile, a host of big banks including Wells Fargo (WFC), PNC Financial Services (PNC) and Fifth Third Bank (FITB) have announced a $15 minimum wage since tax cuts passed. Wells Fargo is hiking its base wage from $13.50 an hour, but those won't show up until later this year.To help boost recruitment in a tight job market, Target (TGT) hiked its minimum wage to $11 an hour from $10 in October, with plans to get to $15 an hour by the end of 2020. Target announced 100,000 seasonal hires, up from 70,000, while Amazon.com (AMZN) planned to add 120,000 seasonal jobs, same as a year ago.IBD'S TAKE: The surest way to keep from missing out if this bull market still has legs and to avoid piling up losses should a bear market take hold is to read IBD's The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market trend, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.

Here's a good place to start looking for stocks that may be poised to move higher.For the second straight year, Wal-Mart (WMT) said it would give employees more hours rather than hire seasonal workers, so longer workweeks on top of solid payroll gains could be padding paychecks. Wal-Mart last raised its base wage to $10 an hour in February 2016.Labor Department data showed that the retail sector shed 20,000 jobs in December. Nonstore retailers such as Amazon added just 200 jobs.The ADP employment report out Thursday indicated that 250,000 private-sector jobs were added in December. Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, which helps produce the ADP report, credited a strong Christmas selling season. ""Robust Christmas sales prompted retailers and delivery services to add to their payrolls.""October and November job gains were revised own by a combined 9,000, leaving the average monthly job gain at 204,000 over the past three months, the government said.YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Wal-Mart Near Possible Buy PointCongress OKs Trump Tax Cuts; These Companies Are Celebrating The MostFederal Reserve Gives Trump Tax Cuts A Green LightHow To Invest In Stocks For Free: New Apps Aim For BeginnersLooking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch?

129,TGT,"As President Trump and the GOP celebrate their $1.5-trillion-tax-cut victory, Americans' paychecks are growing like they haven't for a decade.X The big question is whether this is a sugar high padded by early Christmas bonuses — AT&T (T) and Comcast (CMCSA) were among the companies pledging $1,000 bonuses for hundreds of thousands of employees as tax legislation crossed the finish line — or the start of a sustainable pickup for wage growth and the economy, and Friday's jobs data may start to provide some early hints.Wall Street expects another solid payroll reading — thought not as robust as Thursday's ADP report showing a 250,000 rise in private-sector payrolls — with 190,000 nonfarm jobs added in December and the unemployment rate holding at a 17-year-low of 4.1%. Still, forecasters expect Labor Department data to show that the tepid 2.5% annual gain in average hourly wages continued last month.Yet federal employment and income taxes withheld from worker paychecks are telling a merrier story. Over the past 10 weeks, federal withheld taxes have surged 6.8% from the same period a year ago, an IBD analysis of Daily Treasury Statements finds. That's far faster than the 5% growth in tax receipts implied by 2.5% average wage gains and the roughly 2% growth trend in aggregate hours worked in the economy.A multitude of factors is likely contributing to the faster rise in aggregate pay. Faster wage growth, spurred by the tightening labor market, could be among them. Target (TGT) hiked its minimum wage to $11 an hour from $10 in October. A host of big banks including Wells Fargo (WFC), PNC Financial Services (PNC) and Fifth Third Bank (FITB) announced a $15 minimum wage after tax cuts passed, but those didn't take effect in time for December's jump in tax receipts. Wells Fargo hiked its base wage from $13.50 an hour.IBD'S TAKE: Read IBD's The Big Picture column every day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.

Here's a good place to start looking for stocks that may be poised to move higher.Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody's Analytics, which helps produce the ADP employment report, attributed its strength to a strong Christmas selling season. ""Robust Christmas sales prompted retailers and delivery services to add to their payrolls.""Target's wage hike came as it was seeking to recruit 100,000 workers for the holidays. Meanwhile, for the second straight year, Wal-Mart (WMT) said it would give employees more hours rather than hire seasonal workers, so longer workweeks on top of solid payroll gains could be padding paychecks. Wal-Mart last raised its base wage to $10 an hour in February 2016.A bigger Christmas bonus season is likely part of the story. After a year of huge stock gains and in anticipation of tax cuts in 2018, it wouldn't be surprising if bonuses were running ahead of the prior year's pace. The year-end bonus season runs through March 31, the deadline for deducting them from the prior year's pretax profits. And tax receipts spiked at the end of bonus season last March, briefly sending the growth in tax receipts to levels not seen since 2007.Now tax receipts are again breaking above the trend that has prevailed for a decade. Yet, given the individual and corporate tax cuts, the logical time for companies to pay bonuses will be early in 2018. That will allow corporations to deduct them against 2017 profits, when they'll face a higher tax rate, yet allow individuals to recognize the income in 2018, when they'll face a lower tax rate.YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Wal-Mart Near Possible Buy PointCongress OKs Trump Tax Cuts; These Companies Are Celebrating The MostFederal Reserve Gives Trump Tax Cuts A Green LightHow To Invest In Stocks For Free: New Apps Aim For BeginnersLooking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch?

131,TGT,"E-commerce leader Amazon (AMZN) has significant momentum heading into 2018 and could beat fourth-quarter revenue estimates if the expectations of a Wall Street analyst prove accurate.X GBH Insights analyst Daniel Ives estimated Amazon received between 45% and 50% of holiday online retail sales this year, up from 38% during the same period last year. The sales gains came despite a strong online performance by Wal-Mart Stores (WMT), and with Target (TGT) and Best Buy (BBY) also holding their own, Ives said in a research note to clients.Wal-Mart has stepped up its game and is on pace to significantly increase its market share online this holiday season, Ives said. But Amazon holds an advantage with its Prime membership program, where customers pay $99 a year and receive free shipping and numerous other perks, turning them into loyal Amazon fans and shoppers. Ives estimates that there are 88 million Prime customers, up about 40% from last year. The average Prime customer spent 22% more this holiday season than the year-ago period, he estimates, ""which speaks to the pure power of the Amazon consumer model,"" Ives wrote.""While Walmart is emerging as Amazon's biggest sole competitor online, we believe customer overlap remains small today as Prime membership growth and Amazon's stronghold on e-commerce remain hard to penetrate as we expect this trend to continue to play out in the near-term heading into 2018,"" Ives wrote.IBD'S TAKE: Amazon is on the exclusive IBD Leaderboard list of top stocks. Amazon shares are currently extended from a 1,083.41 buy point. The latest breakout was from a late-stage base, and the stock broke out in a sudden rush of buying from near the base's lows, both negatives.Amazon on Tuesday touted its biggest holiday sales season ever. Among its success stories, in one week alone more than 4 million people joined its Prime service, either through free trials or paid memberships. Amazon does not reveal total Prime customers.Amazon scored record sales on Cyber Monday and Black Friday as consumers responded to a raft of promotions.""The ring-fence that Amazon has built around its Prime customer base has significantly benefited the company in a fiercely competitive pricing environment with much more competitive prices and inventory from Wal-Mart in particular seen over the last month, (and) with Target and Best Buy also holding their own based on our analysis and retail tracking,"" Ives wrote.He maintained a rating of highly attractive for Amazon, with a price target of 1,350 and calling it a top pick for 2018.Amazon shares rose 0.5% to 1,182.26 on the stock market today. Amazon shares hit a record high of 1,213.41 on Nov. 27.Ives projects Amazon can beat fourth-quarter revenue estimates by 4% to 5% if his holiday sales estimates are accurate.The retail sector has been showing strength recently, from long-ailing department-store titans like Macy's (M) to discount chains like Wal-Mart. Also stepping up its game against Amazon, Target recently announced that it would buy an online delivery company to expand its same-day delivery services to shoppers.In terms of Amazon's next strategic move, wrote Ives, ""We believe pharmacy and health care is the natural logical next step to take in 2018 as the company looks to further expand its consumer stronghold.""Early this month Amazon received two price-target hikes, following a five-day conference on cloud computing that demonstrated its growing strength in artificial intelligence.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Retail And E-Commerce News And Stocks To WatchAmazon's Booming Apparel Business In Position To Pass Macy's, TJXLooking For The Next Big Thing?

132,TGT,"As the price wars rage on, the store wars might just be getting started.X Wal-Mart Stores (WMT), the world's biggest brick-and-mortar retailer, is developing an Amazon (AMZN) Go-like store concept that would have no cashiers or checkout lines, according to Recode, citing people familiar with the project.The store would reportedly rely on computer vision and other technological advances to facilitate transactions. Amazon Go, a test store in Seattle that's currently only open to Amazon employees, uses computer vision and machine learning to allow shoppers to take products off shelves and leave the store without going through a formal checkout process. They are automatically charged for purchases through their Amazon accounts.The Walmart version of a cashier-less store, Project Kepler, is reportedly being developed through its Store No. 8 tech incubator and shopping startup Code Eight, which launched in the spring. Since Walmart acquired e-commerce site Jet.com in 2016, Jet.com founder Marc Lore has been tasked with turning the big-box retailer into a digital player.Walmart's e-commerce acquisitions in 2017 have included apparel retailers ModCloth and Bonobos, footwear seller ShoeBuy and outdoor gear store Moosejaw. Other future-looking concepts include its ""in-fridge delivery,"" in partnership with smart-lock maker August, in which couriers are allowed to let themselves into shoppers' homes to drop off groceries.One Code Eight initiative in the works is a text message-based personal shopping service for ""busy NYC moms,"" said Recode.IBD'S TAKE: With thousands of publicly traded companies to choose from, how can you quickly find the best stocks to buy right now? A good starting point is to regularly review screens that highlight the top-rated equities.On Wednesday, Wolfe Research said it sees ""enormous challenges"" for Walmart ""given the drift from the company's strategy of re-establishing its historical price gaps and not letting the deep discounters under-cut it on price.""And Walmart likely has a ""very difficult road ahead,"" wrote analysts at the firm, citing the ""multi-front war with Amazon, the deep discounters, and traditional staples retailers ... coupled with the sheer size of its supercenter stores and mix which doesn't align well with consumer trends.""Still, last month the company topped fourth-quarter views, reporting a 50% jump in e-commerce sales as same-store sales rose 2.7%.Walmart, which bought same-day and last-mile delivery company Parcel in October, isn't the only brick-and-mortar store trying to keep up with Amazon. Target (TGT) said last week that it was acquiring online same-day delivery platform Shipt for $550 million in cash.Walmart shares were down 0.7% at 98.06 on the stock market today but still extended above buy range.

133,TGT,"What kind of person is most likely to shop at Amazon's (AMZN) new cashierless, cashless convenience-store concept, Amazon Go? The same kind of shopper who already makes frequent pit stops at BJ's Wholesale, Trader Joe's and Wal-Mart (WMT)-owned Sam's Club, according to research and consulting firm Magid.X ""These three stores should be looking at what Amazon is doing as the overall concept provides the greatest opportunity, or threat, to their business,"" said analysts in a release.The first Amazon Go, located in Seattle, flung open its doors Monday, finally inviting everyday shoppers to peruse aisles powered by computer vision and deep-learning algorithms, and walk out the door without having to line up at a cash register. (The app automatically charges your Amazon account for whatever you take.) The store had, before that, only been open to employees as part of a beta rollout.IBD'S TAKE: Amazon isn't the only major retailer furiously developing tech-forward grocery concepts. As Investor's Business Daily previously reported, Wal-Mart recently trademarked ""Wam! by Walmart,"" a concept that relates to ""retail and online grocery store services featuring home delivery service.""Target (TGT), Kroger (KR) and Costco Wholesale (COST) should also be concerned, said Magid, since more than half of Target and Kroger customers, as well as 44% of Costco shoppers, said they would consider shopping at an Amazon Go-style store.Traditional grocery stores are also at risk of losing shoppers to Amazon's concept, said the firm.Amazon hasn't indicated what its plans are for scaling up the concept, but it wouldn't be a stretch to imagine the e-commerce behemoth trying to incorporate the technology into its Whole Foods Market locations, or Whole Foods' millennial-focused ""365 by Whole Foods"" stores.After acquiring the upscale grocer for $13.7 billion last year, Amazon quickly began offering its smart-speaker devices at Whole Foods, and says it is working on integrating Amazon Prime into Whole Foods' point-of-sale system, intending for the online retailer's membership service to act as the grocery store's customer rewards program.Magid says Amazon Go's largest potential market consists of millennials and households with kids, with more than three in five of either category likely to shop there.""The implication is clear for retailers that desire to appeal to the growing millennials subset, which is becoming more and more comfortable with an online, on-demand world: Amazon will play large in the mindset of these customers and it is imperative that they catch up,"" said the firm.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN: FANG Stocks News & Quotes Apple (AAPL) Stock Quotes, Company News And Chart AnalysisBitcoin And Cryptocurrency News And TrendsRetail & E-Commerce Stocks And Industry News

134,TGT,"X Amazon (AMZN) is acquiring upscale grocer Whole Foods Market (WFM) for $42 per share in an all-cash deal worth $13.7 billion, including the grocer's net debt, the companies announced Friday. The deal makes Amazon a huge player in the brick-and-mortar grocery business, sending shares of grocers and other big food sellers down sharply.Whole Foods Market will continue to operate stores under its brand, and CEO John Mackey will stay on in the top spot, according to the official statement from Amazon. The company's headquarters will remain in Austin, Texas.""This partnership presents an opportunity to maximize value for Whole Foods Market's shareholders, while at the same time extending our mission and bringing the highest quality, experience, convenience and innovation to our customers,"" said Mackey.Amazon shares rose 2.4% to 987.71 on the stock market today. Whole Foods shares rose 29.1% to 42.68, slightly above the offer price. Several big Whole Foods investors said Amazon's bid was too low and looked for another buyer to swoop in.The deal is expected to close in the latter half of the year.Grocery-store operators Kroger (KR) and Albertsons were other names speculated to be mulling a bid.Jana Partners disclosed an 8.3% stake in Whole Foods in April, calling shares ""undervalued and represent an attractive investment opportunity,"" and was said to be nudging the grocer toward the exploration of a sale.Amazon already controls an estimated 1.1% of the $795 billion food and beverage business through various Prime offerings, including Pantry and its fresh-grocery delivery service, Fresh. Wal-Mart (WMT), including Sam's Club, leads with 21%, according to a March 2016 analysis from Cowen analysts John Blackledge and Oliver Chen.IBD's TAKE: As we said a year ago, Amazon's next big growth play would surprise you. Even before the Whole Foods acquisition, Cowen estimated that Amazon's grocery volume would rocket to $23.2 billion five years from now, up from an estimated $8.7 billion in 2016.Kroger, the largest pure-play grocer, is a distant second with a 9% market share. Albertson's/Safeway, Costco (COST) and Publix round out the top five with low- to mid-single-digit shares apiece.Kroger, which crashed 19% Thursday after slashing its full-year profit guidance, tumbled 9.2% on Friday, hitting a three-year low. Grocery sellers have come under heavy pressure as Amazon and Wal-Mart (WMT) have helped suppress prices.Sprouts Farmers Market (SFM), a natural foods rival to Whole Foods, fell 6.3% after losing more than 9% on Thursday. Sprouts said Thursday that it has been ""significantly impacted by deflation.""Wal-Mart shares fell 4.6%, gapping below its 50-day moving average. Wal-Mart has been stepping up its online efforts, as well as introducing curbside online grocery order pick up and an automated grocery store kiosk.Grocery rival SuperValu (SVU) and Target (TGT), another big grocery seller, were selling off, down 14% and 5%, respectively. Both SuperValu and Target suffered big losses Thursday on Kroger's warning.Costco, CVS Health (CVS) and Dollar Tree (DLTR) were among the many other retailers hit.RELATED:What Amazon's Whole Foods Deal Means For RetailAmazon-Whole Foods Merger Could Be 'Category Killer' For Food, EateriesAmazon's Next 5 Targets?Kroger Trashed, Rival Grocers Spoiled On Earnings Warning Amazon's Next Big Growth Play Will Surprise You 
"
135,TGT,"X Amazon.com's (AMZN) planned $13.7 billion purchase of Whole Foods Market (WFM) would put the resources of a $470 billion company with a massive delivery infrastructure behind the growing demand for better, fresher ingredients and seems likely to upend the way Wall Street thinks about companies that have anything to do with food.The planned merger marks a ""seminal moment in the world of eating,"" RBC analyst David Palmer said in a research note, calling the combined company a potential ""category killer"" in home meals.""Virtually all of the companies in coverage — both in the food and the restaurant space — should be huddling up about the long-term implications,"" he wrote.Prior to the deal, some eateries were making moves in e-commerce. Domino's Pizza (DPZ) and Papa John's (PZZA) have already worked digital ordering into deliveries, while fast-food giants like McDonald's (MCD) have also made a push into delivery and mobile ordering.The merger seems almost certain to deepen the bruising price war between chains like Kroger (KR), Wal-Mart Stores (WMT) and Target (TGT) as an oversupply steers supermarkets toward discounts.Weaker demand in Asia and Europe has in recent years contributed to an oversupply of dairy, while cyclicality has pushed beef prices lower, spurring price cuts to move items off shelves more quickly.Meanwhile, discount European grocers like Aldi and Lidl plan to expand in the U.S., which could bring lower prices for shoppers but also lower profits for the industry.But in Amazon, the industry now faces a retailer that can ""price aggressively, and the smaller regional supermarket chains and independents will bear the most pain,"" Moody's Vice President Mickey Chadha said in a statement.Amazon's move also seems likely to hasten consolidation in the industry, Chadha added. Rumors have persisted through the year that Whole Foods or Sprouts Farmers Market (SFM) were possible takeover targets by Albertsons.For now, news of Amazon's plans to barrel into the grocery business proved merciless to shares of many of its rivals-to-be.Shares of Kroger tumbled 9.2% to finish at 22.29 on the stock market today, but closed well off intraday lows. On Thursday, the stock sank nearly 19% after Kroger slashed earnings guidance but vowed not to ""lose on price."" Target fell 5%, and Wal-Mart, whose own discounts have escalated the price war in supermarket aisles, dropped 4.7%. Sprouts sank 6.3%. Grocery store operator and distributor SuperValu (SVU) crashed 14%, and distributor United Natural Foods (UNFI) lost 11%.The Amazon-Whole Foods deal would create a top-five grocer in the U.S., but it wouldn't be without challenges. Fresh groceries are lower-margin and require more work to handle.UBS analyst Michael Lasser said in a research note that wholesaler Costco (COST) could be protected from Amazon's move. He added that dollar stores Dollar General (DG) and Dollar Tree (DLTR) serve rural areas, where consumers have limited resources or are just looking for quick, fill-in trips.""Thus, those models may not see as much change as is feared,"" he said. ""We would use this as a chance to parse through the noise.""Cowen analysts in March said the intersection of food sales and digital technology could drive U.S. e-commerce growth over the next five years. Their survey data said that younger consumers, who do more through their smartphones, were ""leading the U.S. shift"" and that U.K. survey data suggested ""3x more online grocery purchasers than the U.S., a positive indicator for U.S. adoption.""As more analysts speculate about retail's connected future — with the store perhaps not vanishing completely but sharing more space with online and mobile shopping — an Amazon-Whole Foods tie-up could help normalize a kind of shopping that bounces data from the price-tags in the store to the device in your pocket.""Amazon now has a high-end retail space where they can truly experiment with IoT, retail analytics, behavioral management, and consumer tracking techniques,"" Stephen DiFranco, an investment advisor to Silicon Valley venture capital firms, said in an emailed statement.As also stated in that email: ""You will never be alone in aisle 6 again.""RELATED:What Amazon's Whole Foods Deal Means For RetailCould Trump-Bezos Tension Imperil Amazon-Whole Foods Deal?Wal-Mart Beefs Up Online Ops With $310 Million Bonobos Deal

140,TGT,"XA massive beat on profit, revenue and comparable-store sales estimates would normally elicit delight from the Street, but against the backdrop of a retail existential crisis, Target's (TGT) first-quarter results produced more of a cautious sigh of relief.""Overall we believe the result is better than feared, particularly given worsening trends across the majority of retailers,"" wrote Stifel analyst Mark Astrachan, who rates the stock a hold with 58 price target. ""That said, the ongoing and increasingly rapid shift of consumer spending away from traditional retail channels remains a significant watchpoint for all retailers.""For the quarter, Target's per-share profit slid 6% to $1.21 as sales dipped about 1% to $16.017 billion, well above consensus for 91 cents a share on $15.62 billion in revenue.

142,TGT,"Walmart (WMT) remains tight-lipped about its recent grocery- and home delivery-related trademark, ""Wam! by Walmart,"" but the active application is associated with ongoing projects, Investor's Business Daily learned from a Walmart spokesperson.X ""Wam!"" is described in the mega-retailer's U.S. Patent and Trademark Office filing as ""retail and online grocery store services featuring home delivery service."" Though Walmart would not say more at this time, the trademark comes as Amazon (AMZN), Kroger (KR) and Target (TGT) are all hustling to innovate on the grocery front, and as a growing number of shoppers take interest in home delivery of fresh food and consumables.Walmart is currently pilot-testing fresh grocery delivery in six markets, via several couriers: Deliv in San Jose; Uber in Phoenix, Tampa, Orlando and Dallas; and in-house trucks in Denver. (The company no longer works with Lyft on grocery delivery, it said.) The pilot program is meant to provide insights into the process — presumably so Walmart can later figure out how to best scale up operations.""We know one thing's for sure, that (customers) want a delivery option and so we're committed to that,"" said Walmart spokesperson Molly Blakeman. ""And you're going to hear more from us this year on delivery.""In those half dozen cities, Walmart shoppers can have groceries dropped off at their doorstep in as soon as four hours, or as far away as six days in the future. More than 1,100 Walmart locations across the country also offer online grocery pickup.Battling for customer dollars isn't easy. The already-low-margin supermarket sector now has to contend with a click-happy consumer environment in which speedy delivery and in-store tech savvy is increasingly an expectation, and not a bonus feature.A not-insignificant part of Walmart's recent progress in the e-commerce space has come through acquisition, most notably its 2016 buyout of Jet.com, a smaller Amazon rival that sells food and household products. In October, New York-based same-day grocery delivery startup Parcel became part of Walmart, the nation's biggest retail chain.Walmart also has an active job listing for a Design Director, Grocery, a senior-level role that ""establishes and drives the overall strategy for design and execution of our e-commerce properties,"" per the posting.Kroger, which delivers groceries through services such as Instacart, said Wednesday that it is rolling out a ""Scan, Bag, Go"" feature at 400 locations. The technology, which allows in-store customers to scan and bag products using an app or wireless scanner in order to expedite the shopping and checkout process, sounds similar to Walmart's version of the feature.Walmart said just a few weeks ago that it is expanding its test of the ""Scan & Go"" app to 100 more stores, on top of the Dallas-Fort Worth, Orlando and Northwest Arkansas markets it is already available in.And Amazon, of course, debuted its cashierless, cash-free Amazon Go store last week to much fanfare. Amazon's Whole Foods acquisition last year adds fewer than 500 physical grocery stores to its arsenal, a small presence compared to Walmart and Kroger, but the integration has meant that Amazon Prime members can order Whole Foods products through the e-commerce titan. On the flip side, the company has reportedly scaled back its Amazon Fresh grocery delivery presence.Target, which delivers groceries via Instacart, announced last month the acquisition of grocery delivery service Shipt. The big-box retailer plans to roll out same-day delivery to half of Target stores — an effort that will include groceries — this calendar year.Walmart slipped 1% in the stock market today. Kroger dipped 0.5%.

The S&P 500 index and other major averages, after initially extending modest pre-announcement gains, then weakened as Jerome Powell held his first post-meeting news conference as Federal Reserve chairman.The initial market focus was on the Fed's near-term policy trajectory, but the takeaway may not be quite so positive once investors digest the more hawkish long-term outlook which hints at concern that there's greater risk of the economy overheating.As in December, the quarterly economic projections reflecting the individual views of each Federal Reserve policymaker pointed to a likelihood of three quarter-point rate hikes in 2018, not four, as Goldman Sachs and some other Wall Street firms anticipate. But the Fed did step up its rate-hike outlook for 2019.Fed policymakers now expect three quarter-point rate hikes in 2019, up from two in December, as the jobless rate falls to 3.6% in 2019 and core inflation rises to 2.1%, just above the Fed's target.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe Fed's patience could give stocks a bit of running room as policymakers await evidence that faster economic growth, fueled by the big Trump tax cut and spending increases that have yet to hit, will boost wage growth and inflation.Powell said that if the Fed hikes too fast, ""inflation doesn't get up to 2%.""The Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite initially extended moderate gains following the 2 p.m. ET policy statement. But after Powell began speaking at 2:30 p.m. ET, the Nasdaq  led the averages into negative territory in the stock market today. The Dow Jones and S&P 500 fell 0.2% while the Nasdaq lost 0.3%. However, the small-cap Russell 2000 managed to climb 0.6%.The S&P 500 and Dow Jones remain below their 50-day moving averages, while the Nasdaq recently found support at that key level. Bank stocks were among the gainers after the Fed meeting, thanks to signals that policymakers are willing to let the economy run at least a little hotter.The 10-year Treasury yield initially slipped after the announcement, then turned higher to about 2.92%, before backtracking as stocks weakened. The yield is not too far off the key 3% threshold that hasn't been breached in more than four years.If there's one reason why stocks turned lower as Powell spoke, it could be because of his discussion of the significance of the Fed, for the first time, expecting above-target core inflation of 2.1%. The forecast raises the question of whether the Fed may really think of the 2% inflation target as symmetric — meaning that the current undershoot should be balanced out by a future overshoot.Yet Powell, in his press conference, said policymakers will aim to avoid any ""sustained or persistent deviations.""""We're always going to be seeking 2%.""Investors probably shouldn't be too reassured by a largely status-quo announcement on 2018 policy from the Fed. There's good reason to expect policymakers to step up their expectations to four 2018 Fed rate hikes by June — even if inflation remains tame.Once a pickup in wage growth materializes — and it's very likely to this spring after wage hikes by Walmart (WMT), Target (TGT), CVS Health (CVS), Starbucks (SBUX), FedEx (FDX), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), Wells Fargo (WFC) and others — Fed members will likely adjust rate-hike expectations upward.The Fed's most influential dove, Lael Brainard, in 2017 explained earlier this month why low inflation won't prevent a more hawkish policy turn: Policymakers need to stay ""vigilant"" to contain any financial-system excesses.Unemployment appears on course to fall to rarely seen levels that tend to come with ""elevated risks of imbalances, whether in the form of high inflation in earlier decades or of financial imbalances in recent decades,"" Fed Governor Brainard said, alluding to the dot-com and housing bubbles.Brainard echoed new Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's congressional testimony last month that economic headwinds have turned to tailwinds. Powell said there was still no evidence in the data that stronger growth has led to an acceleration in wage gains, which Fed theory sees as a precursor of upward price inflation.Brainard noted, ""While asset valuations appear to be elevated, overall risks to the financial system remain moderate because household borrowing is moderate"" and the banking system is ""well-capitalized"" after financial reforms. Still, she said, ""We will need to be vigilant"" because a booming economy can lead to a relaxation in lending standards.Vigilance is code for being proactive, raising rates if the economy runs hot, even before any acceleration of inflation. Yet there's a risk that the Fed will overreact to faster growth this year and into 2019, which is fueled by a one-time fiscal boost from tax cuts and a big increase in federal spending. That's the recipe for a big economic slowdown late next year or in the first half of 2020.Bank of America, Wells Fargo and other bank stocks, which can benefit from higher short-term rates, especially when long-term interest rates rise even more, were only slightly higher before the Fed meeting statement on Wednesday, though JPMorgan Chase saw healthier gains. Bank of America and JPMorgan rose a little more after the announcement.Even though the 10-year yield was slightly lower, the 2-year yield fell a little more. A wider yield spread is good for bank profits.E-brokers are among financial stocks that benefit from a higher Fed interest rate, in part because  floating-rate margin loans for trading accounts are based on short-term rates that move in tandem with Fed policy. TD Ameritrade (AMTD) CFO Stephen Boyle said on the Jan. 23 earnings call that the next 25-basis-point increase to the Fed's target rate could yield an estimated $60 million to $110 million in pretax income. Shares of Ameritrade were up slightly ahead of the Fed announcement and rose a little more later.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Inflation And The Fed Rate-Hike Outlook: What You Need To KnowTrump's China Trade War Could Start To Get Real ThursdayForget Facebook: Why These 5 Chip Stocks Are Stock Market Bullish'China's Amazon' JD.com Has These Futuristic Projects In The Works

Five Below (FIVE), which reports next week, was up 0.45%.In a pre-earnings research note Oppenheimer senior analyst Rupesh Parikh said he was not overly concerned at the stock's recent price drops, though he also highlighted worries consumer stimulus due to lower taxes may not offset wage cost pressures, while also warning about rising freight costs.""We believe the pullback reflects a combination of profit taking following meaningful rallies and increasing concerns regarding wage/freight pressures,"" Parikh said.He added that he continues to ""look very favorably"" on the chain's prospects. However he expects the volatile trade to persist and advised investors to take advantage of pullbacks.It has been a tough earnings season for discount retailers, with group leader Dollar Tree selling off after falling short of Q4 forecasts and on weak guidance.Off-price apparel giant Ross Stores (ROST) stock plunged even though it had a solid Q4, while Target (TGT) reported weak holiday earnings.

147,TGT,"Credit-card giant Visa (V) on Thursday reported fiscal first-quarter results after the close that beat estimates, helped by solid holiday spending and e-commerce. The company also OK'd a $7.5 billion buyback, after some rivals said they would cut or suspend theirs.Earlier in the day, Mastercard (MA) also reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings as holiday shoppers spent more on their credit and debit cards.Visa earned $1.08 a share, a 26% jump, beating estimates for 90 cents. Revenue of $4.86 billion, a 9% increase, topped forecasts for $4.815 billion.Payments volume for the quarter jumped 10%, with cross-border volume up 9% and processed transactions up 12%.CEO Alfred Kelly said in a statement that in the wake of President Trump's tax bill signed into law in December, the company was ""evaulating ways"" to invest more in its business in part to digitize payments.Visa also said it expects an effective tax rate of roughly 23%, with a six percentage point reduction due to the tax cuts, and it said the legislation would would add to EPS.But it kept its revenue growth outlook for the year to the ""high single digits"" on a nominal dollar basis. And the company forecast operating expense growth to come in at the ""high end of mid-single digits"". In October, Visa said it expected operating expenses to grow in the ""mid-single digits.""Operating margin dipped 1 percentage point during the quarter, while operating expenses rose 13%.Shares were down 1.6% after hours in the stock market today. Visa had closed up 1.2% to 125.72.X Mastercard, meanwhile, said EPS rose to $1.14 a share, beating expectations for $1.12, while revenue rose 20% to $3.31 billion.Switched transactions rose 17% to 17.7 billion.

A good starting point is to regularly review screens that highlight the top-rated equities.The results arrive after some department stores, like Macy's (M) and JCPenney (JCP), and other big-box retailers like Target (TGT), turned out encouraging holiday-period sales.Amazon (AMZN), meanwhile, has fattened its share of online retail sales during the holidays, according to GBH Insights figures cited by MarketWatch. Amazon reported earnings after Thursday's closing bell.But Nomura analyst Bill Carcache said the GOP's new tax legislation would create ""noise"" due to one-time impacts that the law — be it a benefit or a hit to earnings — will have on the credit-card companies' profit.Analysts generally expect the economy and finance industry to benefit from the GOP's new tax legislation once the sector digests write-downs, taxes on foreign earnings and other effects.American Express (AXP) — which issues credit cards directly, unlike card networks Visa and Mastercard — this month said it would suspend share buybacks for the first half of this year after a one-time, $2.6 billion charge related to the law chewed up a big part of its fourth-quarter profit.AmEx said it would halt repurchasing shares to gather up more capital after sustaining that charge, which stemmed largely from a repatriation tax on some foreign earnings and a lower value of deferred tax assets and liabilities. Companies can accumulate deferred tax assets during losses and use them to ease their tax burden.American Express stock crept up 0.25% on Thursday. Visa and American Express are members of the Dow Jones industrial average.In December, Capital One Financial said it would cut its buyback due to similar charges.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:PayPal Shares Plunge On eBay Contract Exit; Adyen Moves In For DealAlibaba Falls Short On Earnings, Takes 33% Stake In Ant FinancialAmazon Health Care Disruption Fears Clash With This RealityToronto Dominion Bank Trying To Close In On Key Technical Measure

148,TGT,"Kroger (KR) is said to be considering a bid to acquire Overstock (OSTK), a move that would put America's largest supermarket chain squarely in the home decor business and expand its digital footprint.X The New York Post, citing a source, reported the possibility Friday. Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne told CNBC in December that he was looking to ""walk away"" from the e-commerce company's retail business in 60 to 90 days amid a pivot to blockchain technology. He floated, as one option, the possibility of selling the retail unit to a traditional brick-and-mortar.Kroger currently hawks home fashions and home decor through its Kroger Marketplace locations, but an Overstock deal would expand its presence. It might also give the supermarket chain some breathing room from the low-margin grocery business amid an ongoing price war with the likes of Wal-Mart (WMT), Target (TGT) and Amazon.com (AMZN).IBD'S TAKE: Everyone's getting in on the online grocery action. As Investor's Business Daily reported Thursday, Wal-Mart has trademarked ""Wam! by Walmart,"" described as ""retail and online grocery store services featuring home delivery service."" The move comes as the nation's largest retailer competes with Kroger and Amazon for shopper dollars. Overstock shares spiked 9% in the stock market today. Kroger shares rose 2.3%. Amazon climbed 0.1%.Such a deal would also give Kroger a bigger footprint online, as brick-and-mortar retailers continue to seek out ways to fend off Amazon and other online shops. Amazon's $13.7 billion acquisition of Whole Foods Market last year has also put it more squarely in competition with traditional grocery stores.Kroger has reportedly been in advanced talks to acquire digital wholesaler Boxed.com, dubbed ""Costco for millennials,"" a company that the Post says has also gotten investment interest from General Mills (GIS) and Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY).

152,TGT,"The age of Big Data is opening up a whole new world of opportunities, and by fusing the concepts of personal shopping with data analysis, newly public Stitch Fix (SFIX) has seen its value shoot up.X Just ask Loup Ventures managing partner Gene Munster, formerly a senior analyst for Piper Jaffray. Munster believes Stitch Fix's initial public offering has been ""a success, after a rocky start.""""It's rare that an IPO breaks its IPO price the first day then turns around and climbs higher for the next five trading days,"" Munster told Investor's Business Daily. ""Usually when an IPO breaks its IPO price investors get nervous and sell their stock. That did not happen here.""Munster added, ""Investors looked past the negative for breaking its IPO price and focused on the long term opportunity and that's rare.""San Francisco-based Stitch Fix, founded in 2011, has seen its share value rocket by more than 50% in the space of a few weeks since the market launch. After a string of steady gains, shares dipped Friday, down roughly 3% in midday action.Stitch Fix originally planned to sell 10 million shares in the offering, but ended up selling 8 million. After a slow start, which saw it dip slightly below the initial price of $15 per share, shares rebounded and soared past the $18 to $22 pricing target. The lead underwriters in the IPO were banking powerhouses Goldman Sachs (GS) and JPMorgan (JPM).Stitch Fix is an idea that certainly has broad popular appeal. TV shows in years past such as ""Queer Eye For The Straight Guy"" and ""What Not to Wear"" became pop culture touchstones. It's all inspired a number of firms to tread into the space, including e-commerce behemoth Amazon (AMZN).Stitch Fix works by having male or female customers supply size and style preferences by filling out an online profile. The data is then analyzed to determine clothing options, with a human stylist deciding which items should be sent to the customer in the form of a package dubbed a 'fix.'After the user receives the clothes, they have three days to choose whether to keep or return some or all of them. A $20 styling fee is charged for each fix, which can be ordered on demand or set to be shipped at automatic intervals, and it is applied to any items kept. A 25% discount is given if all five items are retained.IBD'S TAKE: Though still in its public-market infancy, Stitch Fix ranks sixth among companies in IBD's Retail-Apparel/Shoes/Accessories Group and holds a Composite Rating of 90. Tops on the list is Boot Barn Holdings (BOOT), with a Composite Rating of 98.In addition the stylist sends a personal note with each package, and this 'high touch' approach is different from services such as Amazon's, which doesn't offer personal service.""Stitch Fix is in the right spot long term. The basic concept is e-commerce will evolve to add a human element to it,"" Munster said, ""Today Stitch Fix uses humans to recommend combinations, and will increasingly use AI.""But the future of user experience will be higher touch,"" he said. ""Another company that is leading in this high touch e-commerce field is Enjoy. Robots will streamline many industries, but will never replace empathy. That's at the core of what Stitch Fix and Enjoy offer.""NPD Group retail industry analyst Marshal Cohen also sees a lot of potential in the model adopted by the California company.""There is a great deal of room to grow within the subscription model, and the competitive field will continue to expand as online retailers develop subscription services and options for auto-replenishment of fashion basics,"" Cohen said in a research note to clients. ""This kind of innovation, delivering personalization and convenience, will continue to change the face of retail for fashion.""The approach has led to consistent growth in each of the last four years, with the number of users shooting up from 261,000 in 2014 to just shy of 2.2 million in 2017. In addition revenue has also increased, from $73.2 million in 2014 to $977.1 million in 2017. It also has an impressive rate of retention, with 86% of customers going on to reuse the service.""Every day we help millions of people find what they love, and our success is inextricably linked to our personalization capabilities, enabled by a unique combination of data science and human judgment."" Katrina Lake, Stitch Fix's founder and chief executive, said in a recent news release.She also insisted the funding round, ""is just the beginning for Stitch Fix; we have so much opportunity ahead.""The Harvard Business School graduate, who owns 16.6% of the company, has reversed plans to sell 1 million shares as she believed the IPO per share price was too low. Despite the share issue, Lake and early investors retain control of the company.However there are threats, with industry behemoth Amazon unveiling Prime Wardrobe in the summer. This service lets subscribers try on clothes at home and send back items they don't want at no charge. Stitch Fix argues Amazon lacks the personalization that has won over their customer base.While the threat from Amazon has been cited as an issue for the company going forward, a more dangerous problem could be the emergence of a prestige brand rival.""Amazon is always a threat, but a bigger risk is if Amazon, Target (TGT) or Walmart (WMT) acquires a Stitch Fix competitor and aggressively funds it,"" Munster said.Stitch Fix's pre-IPO investors have a storied pedigree. Baseline Ventures, the first seed investor in Instagram and an early backer of Twitter (TWTR), was the biggest outside investor going into the IPO with a 28% stake in the company.Following just behind was Benchmark Capital with a 25.6% stake. Other businesses the venture capital firm was an early supporter of include Twitter, Snap (SNAP), Uber and Dropbox.Stitch Fix is currently working on preparing its first earnings call as a listed company on Dec. 19. So far it has not been consistently profitable, losing $6.3 million in 2014 and $594,000 in 2017. However, it had income of $20.9 million in 2015 and $33.2 million in 2016.But growth is being touted as being more important than profits at this stage.""It is not as important as new users and average revenue per user growth. This is a long-term story, and profit is not as important in the near term,"" Munster said.

153,TGT,"Shares of iRobot (IRBT) have fallen on investor concerns that the home robot leader is offering steeper-than-usual discounts for its Roomba vacuum cleaners over the Thanksgiving holiday weekend.IRobot stock tumbled 6.3% on Wednesday after Black Friday discounts were announced. IRobot slipped another 0.2% to close at 68.37 on the stock market today.Bedford, Mass.-based iRobot is running a special this week for $100 off regular prices on four Roomba models compared with two models that saw the same discount last year.A USA Today article on the best Black Friday deals noted that the iRobot Roomba 690 robot vacuum is marked down $100 to $274.99, ""the lowest price we've ever seen.""In a report Friday, Needham analyst James Ricchiuti said he believes the stock decline is being driven by short sellers.IBD'S TAKE: IRobot stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 24 out of 99 and ranks No. 8 in IBD's Household Appliances and Wares industry group. To see which stocks lead the group, visit the IBD Stock Checkup.The holiday deals for iRobot products ""do not appear out of the ordinary,"" Ricchiuti said. The Roomba discounts are ""normal promotional pricing associated with the kickoff of the traditional holiday selling season.""Ricchiuti rates iRobot stock as hold.""Whether the discounts extend to a larger number of models than last year is irrelevant, in our view, particularly given the success of last year's promotions,"" Ricchuiti said. ""There appears to be a healthy appetite from retailers to promote the Roomba, including chains like Best Buy (BBY) and Target (TGT), which are featuring Roombas in holiday TV commercials. We do not believe the promotional campaigns signal a demand issue in the market.""While iRobot is facing more competition in the robotic vacuum cleaner market, it appears to be holding its own, he said. The new Shark Ion Robot from SharkNinja does not seem to be having much of an impact on the market, he said.RELATED:Roomba Maker iRobot Tumbles After Third-Quarter Report

154,TGT,"X Target's (TGT) logo may be the bull's-eye, but it's Wal-Mart (WMT) that has painted a target on Amazon's (AMZN) back.The big-box retailer's first quarter came with a hefty 63% power-up in U.S. online sales. Management downplayed how much of that benefit came from the acquisitions of Moosejaw and ModCloth during the quarter, saying most of that was organic growth at Walmart.com.""The acquisitions have received a lot of attention, but our plan in e-commerce is not to buy our way to success,"" said Wal-Mart CEO Doug McMillon on the earnings call. ""The majority of our growth is and will be organic. The acquisitions are helping us speed some things up.""CFO Brett Biggs later added that plans were in the works to ramp up online-segment growth and drive in-store traffic. Gross merchandise volume rose about 69%, including acquisitions, he said, calling it ""extraordinary growth.""Globally, Wal-Mart's e-commerce growth had already accelerated to 29% in Q4 from 20.6% in Q3, 11.8% in Q2 and 7% in Q1 a year ago.As rival Target is in the midst of revving up its own digital engine, Wal-Mart has moved aggressively, acquiring Jet.com last year as well as Shoebuy this year, in addition to Moosejaw and ModCloth. It is also reportedly in talks to acquire menswear label Bonobos.""The positive impact of Jet.com on the online business is significant, with our view that the level of acceleration will continue to widen the gap between Wal-Mart and its brick-and-mortar competitors,"" said Moody's Lead Analyst Charlie O'Shea via email.And Cowen's Oliver Chen sees Wal-Mart, which now offers two-day shipping for $35 purchases and discounts for picking up online items in store, gnashing its teeth to gain turf online.""Competitive weapons vs. Amazon should include training and development of 225,000 associates and 100 training academies, 90% of the United States is within 10 miles of a store, and online grocery is available at 670 locations,"" he wrote. Chen has an outperform rating and 83 price target on the stock.Shares of Wal-Mart rallied 3.2% to a two-year high of 77.54 on the stock market today. But would-be buyers might want to wait, wrote Buckingham Group's John Zolidis, who advocated waiting for a more attractive entry as Wal-Mart shares are already above historical valuation levels.Shares of Target rose 1.4%, and Amazon added 1.45%.In Q1, Wal-Mart's profit edged up 2% to $1 a share, surprising Street forecasts for a 2% dip, but revenue notched up 1.4% to $117.54 billion, just missing views for $117.74 billion. U.S. same-store sales rose 1.4%, better than consensus views for a 1.3% gain, as traffic grew 1.5%.For the current quarter, Wal-Mart sees EPS of $1 to $1.08, though the midpoint is below consensus views for $1.07, with U.S. Wal-Mart same-store sales up 1.5% to 2%.On Wednesday, Target's report provided a bit of a bright spot in a retail landscape that turned especially bleak last week when department stores reported grim results or guidance.

155,TGT,"In the wake of disastrous earnings results last week from Macy's (M) and other department stores, big-box discounters, home improvement stores and off-price apparel chains are now slated to disclose how they're faring against the ""Amazon (AMZN) effect"" and ever-shifting consumer shopping habits.When Target (TGT) reports Wednesday, analysts expect a 29.5% drop in per-share earnings to 91 cents on a 3.5% revenue decline to $15.63 billion. Target has missed revenue expectations in four of the last five quarters.Meanwhile, Wall Street is looking for a 2% earnings dip to 96 cents a share on nearly 2% sales growth to $117.74 billion from Wal-Mart (WMT) when it reports results on Thursday.Shares of Target fell 0.8% to 55.35 in the stock market today, slightly above a 50-day moving average that undercut its 200-day level — a bearish sign — in early February. Shares are down about 23% this calendar year.By contrast, shares of Wal-Mart, a member of the Dow Jones industrial average, gained 0.8% to 76.29 Monday. Wal-Mart hit a 23-month high last week.Amazon fell 0.35% to 957.97 after hitting an all-time high of 963.15 intraday on its 20th anniversary of its IPO pricing.Wal-Mart has been on something of an e-commerce buyout spree in recent months, after acquiring Jet.com last year for $3 billion. This year alone, the big-box chain has announced the acquisitions of shoe seller ShoeBuy, outdoor retailer Moosejaw and popular women's apparel and accessories site, ModCloth. All three are online retailers.The company doesn't appear to be done shopping. Last month, reports emerged that Wal-Mart was in late-stage talks to acquire men's apparel retailers Bonobos.""Looking ahead, you'll continue to see us make investments in e-commerce to drive traffic and improve the customer value proposition,"" said Wal-Mart Chief Financial Officer Brett Biggs on February's earnings call.Target, for its part, is reportedly not in an acquisitive mood. Wall Street Journal sources say the company has foregone potential acquisitions in favor of investing in its own in-house initiatives.In February, the company announced that it is dedicating more than $7 billion in capital over the next three years to ""grow sales faster, gain market share, adapt to guests' rapidly changing preferences and give them even more reasons to choose Target.""That investment includes about $1 billion in operating profits this year as it aims to put e-commerce at the forefront and revamp more than 600 of its stores.But the concern is that Target's efforts are coming too late in the game.IBD's TAKE: Despite Macy's best efforts at becoming an omnichannel retailer that can take on Amazon, the nation's largest department store has been challenged, and its results last week sent retail stocks into a tizzy.Gordon Haskett analyst Charles Grom last week initiated coverage on Target with a sell rating and 47 price target as he sees ""significant challenges ahead"" for the company from Wal-Mart, Amazon and ""structural issues"" in the apparel space.""All in, Target is doing the right things ... we just question the velocity of change by the team given how quickly its peers (and its core consumers) are moving at the same time,"" wrote Grom on May 8.Meanwhile, he started Wal-Mart at a buy with a 90 price target on the strength of its investments and reinvigorated traffic.""Equally important, WMT is not backing down against Amazon,"" he wrote. ""Instead, it's building a digital ecosystem that should have tangible benefits across the enterprise.""Wal-Mart is now offering discounts for picking up online orders in store, though the price gains are small except for bulky, heavy items. Wal-Mart earlier this year cut its minimum order for free shipping to $35. Amazon, which had hiked its non-Prime minimum order for free shipping to $50, brought that down to $35 and then last week reduced it to $25.Cowen analyst Oliver Chen offered up similar sentiments, praising Wal-Mart's investments in employee training, grocery, price-cutting and e-commerce. Target's online efforts remain ""a good work in progress.""Chen has an outperform rating and 77 price target on Wal-Mart, and a market perform and 58 goal on Target.RELATED:Macy's Shocker, Other Results Trigger Broad Retail RoutIs Amazon Killing Inflation As It Decimates The Retail Sector?Death Stalks Retail Stocks, But Hope Lives OnNordstrom Beats Earnings Views But Comps Miss After Macy's DisasterThese 3 Retailers Could Reap $1 Billion From J.C.

156,TGT,"Workday's (WDAY) international business is booming heading into fiscal first-quarter earnings, says a William Blair analyst, who expects the provider of human resources software to announce a new deal with French manufacturer Michelin.Workday, recently added to the IBD Leaderboard, is set to report earnings for the quarter ended April 30 on June 1.""International has been accelerating for Workday over the last several quarters (international revenue increased 60% in fourth quarter 2017), and we believe Europe again had a very solid bookings, including a first-quarter human resources win at Michelin,"" said Justin Furby, a William Blair analyst in a report published Wednesday.Pleasanton, Calif.-based Workday sells cloud-based software for human relations, payroll and other business functions. Workday has expanded from human capital management software into financial management software.Workday has announced contract wins with Wal-Mart Stores (WMT), Amazon.com (AMZN) and Target (TGT). A partnership with IBM (IBM) is expected to boost sales.Workday stock closed down 2.9% at 93.75 on the stock market today.IBD'S TAKE: Workday stock has shot up 46% in 2017 as of Tuesday's market close, boosted by new customer wins. Workday stock is still nominally in buy range from a 92.56 buy point.  Workday has met resistance at this trading level.

157,TGT,"Target (TGT) reported much-better-than-expected earnings and sales early Wednesday and gave upbeat guidance, a rare positive report from the retail sector ahead of Wal-Mart's (WMT) quarterly numbers Thursday.Estimates: Profit to drop 29.5% to 91 cents a share as revenue slips 3.6% to $15.62 billion.Results: Earnings fell 6% to $1.21 a share with revenue down about 1% to $16.017 billion. Same-store sales slid 1.3%, but that was far less than the 3.7% drop expected.Outlook: Q2 EPS of 95 cents-$1.15, with the midpoint above views for $1.00, on a same-store sales decline in the low single digits. Target did not formally revise its full-year guidance, but noted that the strong Q1 performance suggests that the retailer will top the midpoint of its prior targets.""After starting the quarter with very soft trends, we saw improvement later in the quarter, particularly in March,"" said Chairman and CEO Brian Cornell in a statement. ""We are in the early stage of a multiyear effort to position Target for profitable, consistent long-term growth, and while we are confident in our plans, we are facing multiple headwinds in the current landscape. As a result, we will continue to plan our business prudently while preparing our team to chase business when we have an opportunity.""Stock: Shares rose 3.3% to 56.33 soon after the opening bell in the stock market today. The stock is not in a great place, with a Relative Strength rating of 8 (a sign of underperformance vs. the S&P 500) and a 50-day moving average that undercut the 200-day back in February. Since December, shares have only come up for air above their 50-day line for about two weeks, total. Wal-Mart shares rose 0.9%.As retail stocks suffer one devastating blow after another (even off-price chain TJX (TJX) got munched on earnings results), Target's shares have resembled those of department stores, which had a disastrous week last week, rather than big-box counterpart Wal-Mart.Target's online strategy is notably behind that of Wal-Mart, which is broadly credited as being in better shape to fight off Amazon's (AMZN) march down the retail war path.Wal-Mart has already bought Jet.com, and so far in 2017 alone, it has announced deals to buy e-commerce properties ModCloth, Shoebuy and Moosejaw.

158,TGT,"After years of strong revenue growth and hefty losses, Workday (WDAY) has reached a major milestone. The cloud-based enterprise software firm unexpectedly reported its second straight quarter of positive earnings in its fiscal fourth quarter. Wall Street now sees increasing profitability as the company grabs market share from giants Oracle (ORCL) and SAP (SAP).X On June 1, analysts expect Workday to report that fiscal Q1 earnings surged 220% to 16 cents a share excluding various items. Revenue likely rose 35% to $467.33 million. After a 12-cent profit in fiscal 2017, the company's first year in the black, analysts project EPS to accelerate to 51 cents, 81 cents, and $1.32 over the next three years.Workday provides human capital management and payroll software and has recently expanded into financial applications. Its investment in new products and features and its ability to maintain a high customer-satisfaction rate bodes well, according to Credit Suisse analyst Michael Nemeroff.""Our subscription revenue estimates imply continued market-share gains in both the HCM and Financial applications markets due to WDAY's best-of-breed capabilities and competitive advantages in its large and growing total addressable market,"" Nemeroff said in an April report.
"
159,TGT,"Workday mostly targets larger companies, boasting FANG stocks Amazon (AMZN) and Netflix (NFLX) as two premier clients. But it also serves retail giants Wal-Mart (WMT) and Target (TGT) as well as big biotech Amgen (AMGN).
"
160,TGT,"Workday finished January with 1,528 human capital management customers, including 136 Fortune 500 companies.
"
161,TGT,"Existing top-tier customers are contributing to Workday's growth as many are signing contracts for additional product offerings.""There are many cases in the first several years of (our human-resources product) where we won the HR deal, but they don't want to touch payroll and now our payroll attach rate is over 60%,"" CEO Aneel Bhusri said on Workday's fiscal Q4 conference call on Feb. 27.Bhusri noted on that call that Netflix is one of five Fortune 500 companies that has signed up for Workday's new financial performance management software.""We are really well-positioned to run the tables within that enterprise (client) when they do move their transactional platform as well,"" he said.Credit Suisse calls Workday the leading vendor in cloud HCM applications ""for upper midmarket and large enterprises.""
"
162,TGT,"Workday has reorganized to better accommodate companies of different sizes. The company has divided its North America business into two groups — large enterprise and medium enterprise — from the account executive level to the sales and services levels.IBD'S TAKE: Workday is a member of Leaderboard, a list of top growth stocks at or near buy points curated by our markets team. To find more fast-growing names with actionable trading opportunities, take a free trial.After hitting a nine-month low of 65.79 on Dec. 30, shares closed Friday at 99.99, near their best levels since their early-2014 all-time high. Workday shares cleared a cup-with-handle base with a 92.56 buy point in heavy volume on May 15. The stock is now extended from the 5% buy range, but if it pulls back in light volume — as some leaders do — it could provide investors with another chance to purchase shares.The Pleasanton, Calif.-based company has a strong IBD Composite Rating of 95 out of 99, yet it's still ranked seventh in the highly rated enterprise software industry group.Workday says that continued into the most recently reported quarter. ""The win rates against SAP and Oracle were as high as they have been in recent memory,"" CEO Bhusri said on the Q4 call.Despite expectations for strong revenue growth and margin expansion over the next few years, Credit Suisse and Benchmark both initiated coverage on Workday's stock in April with a neutral, or hold, rating.""We are wary of intense competition in its core target Human Capital Management (HCM) market, which continues to drive pricing pressure, unfavorable billings terms and lengthening sales cycle,"" Benchmark analyst Yun Kim said in an April 26 report. But Kim did highlight Workday's successful execution, citing ""strong product positioning and superior customer references.""Meanwhile, Nemeroff said there are not yet signs of ""accelerated momentum"" in large clients for Workday's financial management software, due to the risk and complexity of switching core financial applications to the cloud.But he notes that IDC projects the cloud-based financial applications software market will reach $9.5 billion in 2020, representing a compound annual growth rate of 12%.Workday could adjust its outlook on the next quarterly call, but last forecast fiscal 2018 revenue of $2.005 billion to $2.025 billion, or growth of 27% to 29%. That would make it the second pure-play software-as-a-service provider to top $2 billion in annual revenue, only after Salesforce (CRM).

Top holdings included AT&T, Tanger Factory Outlet Centers (SKT), Target (TGT), IBM and Chevron.Because the fund is made up of high-yielding dividend payers, its annualized yield doesn't disappoint at 2.3%, well above the S&P 500's average payout of 1.8%. On an individual stock basis, AT&T's annual payout is 5.1%, Tanger 5.4%, Target 3.8%, IBM 3.9% and Chevron 3.5%.IBD'S TAKE: AT&T pays a dividend that's nearly triple that of the S&P 500, but how are its fundamental ratings?

It also offered Apple gift cards worth up to $150 with the purchase of select Mac computers.Apple wasn't discounting its latest devices, namely the iPhone 8 series and iPhone X smartphones and Apple Watch Series 3 smartwatches with cellular capability. But several retailers offered deals on those devices.Wal-Mart Stores (WMT) on Friday offered a $300 Wal-Mart gift card with the purchase of iPhone 8 and iPhone X handsets with wireless contracts from AT&T (T) and Verizon (VZ). Target (TGT) was offering $250 gift cards for iPhone 8 purchases with qualifying service plans.Kohl's (KSS) was offering $90 store credit with the purchase of the Apple Watch Series 3.IBD'S TAKE: Apple stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 91, meaning it has outperformed 91% of stocks in key metrics over the past 12 months.

165,TGT,"Republicans got an unexpected boost of good publicity after Congress sent the $1.5 trillion package of tax cuts to President Trump's desk on Wednesday. Within hours, Wells Fargo (WFC) and Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB) both announced an increase in their minimum wages to $15 an hour, which seemed to provide immediate evidence that the tax cuts would be good for workers.Those announcements came as Comcast (CMCSA) and AT&T (T) each said they'll pay out $1,000-apiece bonuses to employees. Trump heaped praise on AT&T in his tax-cut victory speech, and the company may be looking to earn some goodwill as it faces a legal challenge over its proposed acquisition of Time Warner (TWX).The surprise is that the potential gain to workers from corporate tax cuts is supposed to materialize over time, as companies boost productivity-enhancing investment and a more attractive business climate encourages more U.S.-based production. Those supply-side increases, along with lower individual taxes that boost demand, should intensify the bidding war for labor and push wages higher. But none of that stuff has happened yet.So do tax cuts really deserve the credit for wage hikes? Probably at least a little, because they're giving companies an extra shot of confidence about the strength of the economy and a profitable future, but there are other catalysts that may be more important.IBD'S TAKE: Read IBD's The Big Picture column every day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines. As long as the current ""confirmed uptrend"" — the equivalent of a green light — stays in place, leading stocks breaking above a buy point are more likely than not to have the wind at their backs. Here's a good place to start looking for stocks that may be poised to move higher.Take Wells Fargo, which is trying to turn over a new leaf after having its reputation bruised and battered by the disclosure of improper sales practices. What better publicity opportunity than immediately turning corporate tax cuts into employee wage hikes?The biggest reason Wells Fargo is hiking its minimum wage is likely the current state of the labor market, with unemployment at a 17-year-low of 4.1%, which is putting upward pressure on wages and making it harder to find and retain qualified workers. Wells Fargo previously hiked its minimum wage to a range of $12 to $16 an hour, depending on location, in March 2016. Then, after Bank of America (BAC) said it would raise its minimum wage to $15 an hour in December 2016, Wells Fargo followed the next month by lifting its base wage to a range of $13.50 to $17.It's not clear whether the latest increase to $15 an hour, which will take effect in March, will be accompanied by much of a boost to entry-level workers whose hourly pay already exceeds $15.The focus of the announcements on a $15 minimum wage suggests that part of the credit likely goes to the $15 wage movement and its success in spurring a number of states and cities, as well as private employers like Target (TGT), to hike their minimum wages. In January, California's minimum wage will rise to $11 an hour and $12 a year later, on the way to $15 by 2022. New York City's minimum wage will hit $15 at the end of 2018. Since the minimum wage applies to the lowest-skilled work, bank tellers expect to make well above the minimum wage.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Congress OKs Trump Tax Cuts; These Companies Are Celebrating The Most6 Big Rule Changes For Individuals In The New Tax BillTrump Tax Package Seen Boosting These Players In Info TechFive Reasons Why JPMorgan, Citigroup, Other Financials Are Seizing Market LeadershipHow To Invest In Stocks For Free: New Apps Aim For Beginners

166,TGT,"Weakness in Asia and Europe overnight spilled into the U.S. stock market Wednesday.The session was shaping up to be a carbon copy of Tuesday's, which saw indexes recover well off lows. But sellers today came in late, resulting in a weak close. Some attributed the late selling to news that Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., will oppose the current GOP tax bill.XThe Nasdaq composite, S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average ended with losses of around 0.5% to 0.6%. Chipmakers were a drag on the Nasdaq, while Caterpillar (CAT) lagged in the Dow, falling 2.5%. Preliminary data showed volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq coming in just below Tuesday's levels.Airline stocks and department stores outperformed, along with several retail-related groups.In economic news, October retail sales were a mixed a bag, but there was arguably more good news than bad. Overall, sales rose 0.2%, just above the consensus estimate for a 0.1% gain. Excluding autos, sales rose 0.1%, just below the consensus estimate of 0.2%. An additional bright spot was that September sales were revised higher to a gain of 1.9% vs. an initially reported rise of 1.6%.In the stock market today, apparel retailer Children's Place (PLCE) shot up 6% to 120.65, helped by a solid earnings report and news that same-store sales rose 5.1%. Children's Place is near the top of a consolidation that shows a conventional entry at 125.40, but an earlier entry of 119.55 also looks valid.On the downside, Target (TGT) crashed 10% despite reporting better-than-expected earnings, sales and same-store sales. The outlook was the problem as Target cited a ""highly competitive holiday quarter.""Target is often mentioned as a retail bellwether alongside Wal-Mart (WMT), but it's Wal-Mart that seems to be executing better at this point. After a recent breakout over an 82.09 buy point, Wal-Mart is holding near highs ahead of its earnings report Thursday before the open.Inside the IBD 50, YY Inc. (YY) was a huge gainer, up 25%, on strong earnings. Early Wednesday, the China internet name reported a 42% rise in quarterly profit and 49% jump in sales.Also in the IBD 50, Essent Group (ESNT) continued to show good action after a recent trip to the 50-day moving average. Shares rose nearly 4% to 43.92. It's slightly extended after reclaiming a 41.54 buy point.RELATED:Square Rises On Bitcoin Buy And Sell Option For Mobile App Users Warren Buffett, Other Big Investors Clash On Apple, Tech Stocks

168,TGT,"The U.S. economy appears to be shifting into gear after a grindingly slow first eight years of the recovery, but Americans aren't feeling it at the moment.In October, the IBD/TIPP Economic Optimism Index slid 3.1 points to 50.3, remaining in optimistic territory for a 13th straight month, but only barely above the neutral 50 level.The downshift in sentiment about the economy seems to run counter to most incoming economic news. The stock market keeps setting new records. The jobless rate just fell to 4.2%, the lowest in 16 years. Average hourly wage gains have begun to accelerate and Target (TGT) said last month that it's voluntarily raising its minimum wage, first to $11 an hour, then to $15 by 2020.The apparent good news about Americans' mood turning lukewarm is that polling details suggest it is likely just a blip.By far the biggest drop came in the South, which turned slightly pessimistic (49.8) in October, after exhibiting impressive optimism in September (59.8).The poll, which included 887 respondents, was conducted Sept. 29-Oct. 8. Polling for the September IBD/TIPP Poll began before Hurricane Harvey made landfall in Texas on Aug. 25 and ended before Irma came ashore in Florida on Sept. 10.While self-identified Republicans nationwide remained solidly optimistic (70.6 vs. 71.4 in September), pessimism deepened among Democrats (35.6 vs. 38.8 in September) and took root among independents (48.8 vs. 52.7 in September).The partisan divergence may have widened because the polling period closely followed another big GOP push to kill ObamaCare and curb Medicaid spending. Although the effort once again failed, it appears to have once again undercut confidence in federal economic policies, one of three components that factor into the IBD/TIPP Poll.IBD'S TAKE: The stock market's surge to record heights over the past month seemed to come out of nowhere, but IBD readers were ready to seize the moment. On Aug. 22, IBD shifted its market trend gauge to ""confirmed uptrend"" from ""uptrend under pressure,"" the equivalent of a flashing yellow light turning green. Read IBD's The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.The Economic Optimism Index is a composite of three major subindexes that track views of near-term economic prospects, the outlook for personal finances over the coming six months, and views of how well government economic policies are working.The gauge of the six-month economic outlook slipped 2.4 points to 48.7.The six-month personal financial outlook index eased 2.5 points — to 59.5 from September's 62.0, which was just below February's 12-year high of 62.8.The measure of confidence in federal economic policies sank 4.3 points to 42.8. The index had crept into optimistic territory for the first time in a decade in February, before the GOP spent months trying to repeal and replace ObamaCare with nothing to show for it.Meanwhile, the National Federation of Independent Business said early Tuesday that its Small Business Optimism Index fell 2.3 points to 103.0 in September, adding that more than hurricanes were to blame.""The drop-off was consistent around the country regardless of region,"" said NFIB Chief Economist Bill Dunkelberg.Still, the pullback comes after the index reached ""frothy"" levels, and it ""remains very high by historical standards.""Among companies looking to add workers, 86% said they found few or no qualified applicants.RELATED:Hurricanes Hit Payrolls, But Wage Gains May Speed Up Fed Rate HikesDid Target's Wage Hike Just Prove Fed Hawks Right — Or Wrong?Stocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth Stocks

Automaker Ford (F) surged nearly 6% to top the S&P 500, rising on an upgrade from J.P.Morgan.Keep in mind, stocks rose for the first half hour of trade on Tuesday, then pulled back sharply. Wednesday's action could very well continue to test the market's still-young uptrend. The Dow has been unable to decisively retake its 10-week moving average since early February. The S&P 500 has managed to hold above its 50-day for the past three sessions, but has faced clear resistance at the 2,800 level. The Nasdaq is in the best technical shape, tapping out a new high Tuesday, then pulling back just enough to test support at its prior peak, around 7,500.Markets in Asia traded lower, reacting to Tuesday's U.S. market weakness. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index ended down 0.5% and the Nikkei 225 in Tokyo fell 0.9%. In Europe, stocks maintained moderate gains in afternoon trade, as data showing a surge in January and February steel production in China drove mining issues higher.Early economic news was mixed. Retail sales slipped 0.1% in February, the Commerce Department reported, better than January's 0.3% decline but well below economist estimates for a 0.4% advance. Producer price data from the Labor Department was more positive, up 0.2% in February, half of January's 0.4% gain and in line with expectations. Core prices, minus energy and food, also rose 0.2% and met economists' targets.The Energy Information Administration delivers its weekly oil inventories update at 10:30 a.m. ET.On the Dow, Nike swung out to an early lead, rising in strong trade as the stock looked to break free of its recently stick 50-day moving average.Ford roared to the top of teh S&P 500, rising more than 4% after J.P.Morgan upgraded the stock to overweight, from underweight, and hoisted the price target 50%, to 15.

173,TGT,"Core consumer prices, excluding food and energy, rose 0.2% in February, but the annual inflation rate held steady at 1.8%, undershooting expectations, the Labor Department reported on Tuesday.X The soft inflation reading could slightly lower odds of a fourth Fed interest-rate hike in 2018. After the report, Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures extended gains, with the major averages opening modestly higher on the stock market today. The 10-year Treasury yield pointed lower.The overall consumer price index rose 0.2% on the month and 2.2% from a year ago, matching expectations.The Fed is expected to hike rates three times this year, with quarter-point moves, as the economy looks headed for relatively strong growth and the jobless rate could sink to a multidecade low. Fed policymakers expect that wage pressures will rise as unemployment falls, leading companies to pass on some of their higher wage bills in the form of price increases.So far, official measures haven't detected a pickup in wages. The Labor Department reported weaker-than-expected 2.6% annual average hourly wage inflation in February. But faster wage growth should begin to show up this spring, reflecting recently announced wage hikes from Walmart (WMT), Target (TGT), CVS Health (CVS) and Starbucks (SBUX) that didn't happen soon enough for the latest jobs report.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseAs those companies hike wages, their competitors are being pressured to do the same. Last week, Kroger (KR), Dollar Tree (DLTR) and Ross Stores (ROST) all said they're raising wages for employees, and their stocks sold off amid worries about profit margins.The competitive environment facing Kroger from Walmart and Amazon.com (AMZN) via its Whole Foods division, among others, offers at least some reason to doubt whether wage pressure will feed through to higher prices. Kroger said on Thursday that it will use one-third of its tax cut to boost shareholder returns, but the other two-thirds will go to higher wages and lower prices.Yet even doves on the Fed are beginning to sound more hawkish. ""Although last year we faced a disconnect between the continued strengthening in the labor market and the step-down in inflation, mounting tailwinds at a time of full employment and above-trend growth tip the balance of considerations in my view,"" Fed Governor Lael Brainard said last week.Bottom line: Inflation is going to remain a concern for Wall Street throughout 2018.The soft inflation reading came as medical care services inflation was unchanged in February, after January's 0.6% monthly gain, and prices for medical care commodities including prescription drugs slipped 0.3%.Meanwhile, prices for food away from home rose 0.2%, while the cost of food consumed at home fell 0.2%, more evidence of the competition from Amazon in the grocery arena.Outside of energy, inflation is showing up in transportation services, whose prices rose 1.0% on the month and 4.5% from a year ago.

174,TGT,"Justin Gold is not your typical corporate founder type. Long, tight curls spill out from under his baseball cap as he throws his head back and howls delightedly in selfies with nut-butter enthusiasts who approach him in a steady stream. One woman stops to tell Justin that her mother is a big fan.At food trade show Natural Products Expo West, where alternative meats and other health-conscious products reign supreme, everyone wants to say hi to the creator of Justin's Nut Butter. You probably can't say the same about the makers of Skippy.Such is the marketplace for natural foods now. Once the hippy-dippy niche of places like Whole Foods, the arena in 2018 is stacked with players hawking Greek yogurt and kale chips and high-protein everything on shelves at Walmart (WMT) and Kroger (KR).""It's a lot more competitive, but now there's more (shelf) space that's available,"" said Gold of the changes to the industry over the years. Larger retailers like Kroger, Target (TGT) and Walmart are looking to put more organic products on their shelves, he said.The interest means that Big Food heavyweights — such as General Mills (GIS), Nestle and PepsiCo (PEP) — have been snapping up natural and organic food startups, a trend that NPD's food and beverage industry analyst, Darren Seifer, does not see stopping.Acquisitions give legacy packaged-food companies entry to the natural and organics market with a brand that has ""believability,"" said Seifer.Sign Up For Free IBD Newsletters: Market Prep | Tech ReportJustin's Nut Butter, for its part, was acquired by Hormel (HRL) in 2016. That brought the almond- and cashew-butter company under the same umbrella as Spam, Hormel Chili and peanut butter stalwart Skippy.The added resources of a food titan like Hormel gave Justin's the fuel to ensure that all of its products' secondary ingredients could also be organic, something that Justin's could ""probably not"" have accomplished by itself, said Gold.But that doesn't mean every new food company out there is looking to ultimately be acquired.The idea of being acquired ""would worry me, at this stage,"" said Snow Monkey co-founder Rachel Geicke. Snow Monkey, a plant-based, nut-free, vegan ""superfood ice treat,"" lists banana puree as its first ingredient. It is sold in about 300 stores across a dozen states and comes in flavors such as passion fruit, goji berry and cacao.""We've technically only been on the market for about 14 months, so it's still very new, and I think what's really important for a young company is ensuring we're shaping culture and as we grow we never forget why we started,"" she said.Better-for-you ice creams were popular at this year's Expo West. Not surprising, given that indie brand and Expo alum Halo Top managed to outsell freezer staples Ben & Jerry's (owned by Unilever (UN)) and Haagen-Dazs (owned by Nestle) in the supermarket pint category last year.""Companies like Halo Top are sort of what the industry needed,"" Snow Monkey co-founder Mariana Ferreira told Investor's Business Daily at the expo. ""It needed a little bit of a shake, to show the big guys you can't be comfortable. You can't put out the same thing all the time.""Smaller brands are the ones bringing the innovation, she added, something that ""isn't fast enough with these big companies.""Nevertheless, they aren't ruling out the possibility of M&A down the road. An acquisition could provide strategic advantages, and ""there could be some really great big partner for us to do that with,"" said Geicke.Either way, the current eating trends are good for business.""What's really promising for us to see is that health has never been so mainstream, and it continues to be,"" said Geicke. ""When you walk into Costco and you're seeing products that you would usually only find at Whole Foods, that's amazing to see the industry shift.""

175,TGT,"Amazon (AMZN) Prime members can now get their organic and antibiotic-free Thanksgiving turkey at Whole Foods for a little bit cheaper than everyone else.XThe massive e-commerce company, which bought Whole Foods in August, is offering a discount on organic and no-antibiotic turkeys for anyone who enters one of the upscale grocer's airy, lushly stocked stores. But Prime members can buy organic turkeys for $2.99 a pound and antibiotic-free ones for $1.99 a pound — that's 50 cents cheaper than the discount for people who aren't Prime members.The discount is the latest attempt by Amazon to draw more customers into its Prime membership program. The move could also help Whole Foods compete for a customer it hasn't always been successful at attracting — that is, the many who don't have $10-$20 to blow on, say, a sampling of Robusto and a bottle of Saison Dupont.""This offer is a sneak preview of the special savings and in-store benefits Prime members can expect when Prime becomes the official rewards program of Whole Foods Market,"" the companies said in a release.Other items will have their prices trimmed starting Wednesday as well. Those items include some boneless skinless chicken breasts, raw peeled shrimp, potatoes, Chobani yogurt, pasture-raised eggs, canned pumpkin and salad mixes.The companies said those price cuts were ""in addition to the reduced prices that customers are already enjoying."" After Amazon bought Whole Foods, the grocer slashed prices on beef, eggs, bananas, fish and other items.Amazon closed down 0.9% at 1,126.69 in the stock market today. The stock is still within range of a 1,083.41 buy point of a late-stage base. Grocery-store operator Kroger (KR), seen as a potentially big loser in Amazon's foray into groceries, fell 1.9%. Sprouts Farmers Market (SFM), which turned out strong Q3 results despite Whole Foods' earlier price cuts, lost 1.8%. Supervalu (SVU) edged up 0.2%.Big-box chains that also sell groceries like Target (TGT) and Wal-Mart (WMT) dropped 10% and 1.4%, respectively, after Target gave a disappointing earnings outlook and warned of a ""highly competitive"" holiday quarter.IBD'S TAKE: In a discount world, companies like Amazon and Target are looking to private labels to make a bit more money. Grocery stores over the past year have struggled with lower prices due to a glut of certain types of goods. Consumer preferences have also shifted to the fresher items often found on the perimeter of the store, rather than the prepackaged goods in the center aisles.While Amazon's deep pockets give Whole Foods more room to cut prices, Target and other grocers, whose value game is stronger, have also tried to be a little bit more like Whole Foods.But while Target has tested a few new grocery strategies, the results have been ""underwhelming,"" an Edward Jones research note said Wednesday.""We expect the issues within the grocery business will continue to negatively impact results for the next few years because the company lacks a clear, defined strategy to improve the business,"" it warned.RELATED:Kroger Surges As It Considers Selling Its Convenience StoresThe Huge News Wal-Mart Didn't Make About WagesKroger's Hurricane-Less Outlook Adds To Amazon, Wal-Mart Fears

181,TGT,"Target (TGT) plans to test a next-day home-delivery service that sends ""essentials"" such as ground coffee and laundry detergent to customers' doorsteps. But whether that will be enough to catch up with Wal-Mart (WMT) and Amazon's (AMZN) advancements in the delivery space is an uncertainty.The ""Target Restock"" pilot service, which rolls out this summer in the Minneapolis area for REDcard users, will offer ""thousands of household essentials"" for an unspecified flat fee, according to the retailer on Monday.Competition is fiercer than ever, though. Amazon just reduced its free-shipping minimum to $25 from $35. Amazon had cut that to $35 in February from $49 following Wal-Mart's move to a $35 minimum.Wal-Mart and Amazon already each offer free two-day shipping, and Amazon's Prime Now service ensures same-day delivery of over 25,000 items. No additional fee is charged to existing Prime members for two-hour delivery; one-hour Prime Now delivery costs $7.99.IBD'S TAKE: Wal-Mart-owned Jet.com is, in some analysts' eyes, helping the mega-retailer to become a credible rival to Amazon. The big-box chain also offers discounts for picking up online orders in-store.Target said last week that it will begin testing same-day delivery for in-store purchases form its Tribeca location in Manhattan. The developments are part of its announcement in February to invest more than $7 billion over the next three years on stores and its online experience.""All in, Target is doing the right things ... we just question the velocity of change by the team given how quickly its peers (and its core consumers) are moving at the same time,"" wrote Gordon Haskett analyst Charles Grom in a Tuesday report, initiating coverage of the company with a sell rating and 47 price target.Target shares rose 1.4% to 58.09 in the stock market today. Target has rallied modestly from early April's five-year low and recently retook its 50-day moving average, but is well off its 52-week high of 79.86.Meanwhile, Amazon climbed 0.4% to 952.82, hitting a fresh all-time high of 957.89 earlier. Wal-Mart climbed 0.8% to 76.72, trading at a two-year best.Though he didn't offer commentary on Target's new Restock service, Grom said he sees ""significant challenges ahead"" for the big-box retailer from several fronts, as it faces a ""more formidable Wal-Mart"" and is ""in the cross hairs"" of Amazon, adding that there are also structural issues to contend with in the apparel space.And as Jet.com parent Wal-Mart snaps up e-commerce properties such as Shoebuy.com, Moosejaw and Modcloth, those acquisitions, he said, give the company a boost with customer data and millennial shoppers, among other things.Target's online sales have more than doubled in recent years.""Despite all of these efforts, the company still lags many of its peers by a significant margin, which we think puts the company at a disadvantage,"" wrote Grom.Target and Wal-Mart will report fiscal first-quarter earnings next week.RELATED:Why Buffett Still Isn't Sure If He'd Buy Amazon, Alphabet Stock Now

182,TGT,"X A brutal retail earnings season walloped department stores and knocked around the shares of all but a few major names, such as Wal-Mart (WMT) and Target (TGT), as retail's ongoing existential crisis flails on.Ulta Beauty (ULTA), which reports late Thursday, is something of an outlier, with consistent quarterly beats and double-digit same-store sales growth at a time when other stores are posting declines or mild single-digit gains.Shares have generally made modest moves, with the stock rising in line with the S&P 500 over the last nine months. But Ulta has had big swings in the session following after-the-close earnings reports, with shares getting punished for two of the last three quarters, even when the retailer has posted a beat-and-raise quarter.Investors are extra jittery this time around: Ahead of Thursday's results, shares fell 3.5% to 280.51 in the stock market today on a downgrade to hold from buy from Edward Jones, diving below their 289.37 buy point. Before Wednesday's tumble, Ulta stock has nearly doubled since February of last year to an all-time high of 301.40 in early May, with shares testing the 300 price mark in recent weeks.""While we expect profit margins still have some room to expand, we do believe it will become more difficult over the longer term as more business shifts to online,"" wrote Brian Yarbrough of Edward Jones. ""Online sales have lower profit margins than sales in the stores.""He otherwise sounded positive on the company, calling it ""one of the most compelling growth stories in the retail landscape due to its store-growth opportunity and because it operates in an attractive industry and has the potential to realize further profit expansion.""For Q1, profit is expected to rise 24% to $1.80 a share on a 19% revenue rise to $1.27 billion. Expect laser-focus on same-store sales growth, a closely watched metric in the retail space.Piper Jaffray analyst Erinn Murphy, who rates the stock overweight, expects 11.5% in comparable-sales growth, a tick higher than Street views.IBD'S TAKE: Need a refresher? Ulta Beauty has reported same-store sales growth of 16.6%, 16.7%, 14.4% and 15.2% in the most recent four quarters. Consensus is for 11% comp growth in Q1, says Piper Jaffray. There are reasons why Ulta and other specialty beauty retailers haven't succumbed to the Amazon Effect.Like off-price stores, the beauty sector frequently gets a call-out for being impervious to Amazon's (AMZN) offensive tactics in the retail sphere. Experts chalk it up to the in-store experience, the test-and-trial nature of beauty products and robust rewards programs, among other factors.Murphy cited confidence in Ulta's loyalty program and indicated that Ulta is likely to benefit from the decline of department stores, noting that only J.C. Penney (JCP) and Nordstrom (JWN) are notching cosmetic sales gains. Plus, the firm's biannual teen survey revealed that Ulta was gaining ""considerable share"" as a go-to shopping hot spot.J.C. Penney in particular has benefited from its Sephora shops-in-shops, and said earlier in the month that it will open another 16 in-store Sephoras in June, with plans to open 70 new locations of the upscale makeup retailer in 2017. That will bring its end-of-year total to 650 shops, in 75% of all J.C. Penney stores.Ulta Beauty offered up light Q1 guidance in March. But that doesn't worry some analysts.""Ulta has beaten its sales guidance in all but one quarter since (the first quarter of 2010) as one of the best guiders we cover,"" wrote Instinet analyst Simeon Siegel in March, following the company's most recent earnings report. ""We expect this to prove conservative yet again.""RELATED:Why Ulta Beauty Shares Are Sinking Out Of Buy Range Ahead Of EarningsUlta Beauty Shares Break Out As Estee Lauder Pops On EarningsOPEC Meeting, Ulta Beauty, Best Buy, Momo Lead Investing Action PlanIs Ulta Beauty Too Good To Be True?Ulta Beauty Earnings, Sales Strong, But Guidance Isn't Pretty

183,TGT,"David Green, CEO of Hobby Lobby, does everything wrong, according to retail conventional wisdom.His stores close at 8 p.m., and don't open at all on Sundays to allow employees to be with their families and attend a house of worship.Full-time workers start at more than twice the federal minimum wage and have generous benefits.Hobby Lobby specializes in arts, crafts, hobby, and home decor, yet each outlet carries a vast inventory of 100,000 items.These are distributed across the country from a central warehouse, rather than using regional depots or having suppliers ship directly to stores, as other retailers do.There are no bar code scanners at the registers to track inventory.Yet Green's results have proved the cynical critics dead wrong. The privately held company brings in $4.3 billion a year from its 750 stores. And according to Forbes, Green's net worth is $6.4 billion (though he is actively giving away much of it).""There is nothing negative in the Bible about running a business and it has everything one needs to know about good leadership,"" Green told IBD from his office in Oklahoma City. ""But we're not just trying to make money, we want to do it in a way that puts a high value on caring for our employees and their families. And the opportunity to work reasonable hours helps us attract good managers from other retailers.""Green, 75, grew up in Altus, Okla., a county seat of 20,000 amid ranches and cotton fields. His father was a pastor with just 35 church members, so the family didn't have a car and couldn't spare a quarter to shop at the general store in town, McClellan's. But after struggling in high school, Green signed up for a program that gave him credit for working there, mentored by the owner.""To succeed in retail, you have to love it,"" Green wrote in ""More Than a Hobby."" ""The process of bringing items in, displaying them attractively, and seeing them miraculously change into actual cash in the drawer has to get your blood racing.""After graduation, a stint in the Air Force Reserve, and marriage to a McClellan's clerk, Barbara, he switched to managing a store in the five-and-dime chain TG&Y. While keeping his day job, in 1970 he, Barbara and a friend borrowed $600 to make and wholesale miniature wooden picture frames.Two years later, they opened the first Hobby Lobby in a 300-square-foot space in Oklahoma City, soon moving into one that was more than triple in size. By 1982, they had seven shops and within a decade 50 in seven states. Growth skyrocketed to 200 by the end of the 1990s and to over 300 four years later. Hobby Lobby then doubled by April 2015. It plans to add about 50 stores a year, while much of the rest of the retail industry is shrinking dramatically. Staffing is made easier by the fact that its 35,000 employees tend to remain for a long time, while turnover among retail hourly workers was 65% in 2016.Their children would play important roles in the family business, starting with earning 7 cents for each mini-frame glued together. Oldest son Mart Green now heads Mardel Christian & Educational Supply — stores carrying religious and educational materials. Steve Green is president of Hobby Lobby, while daughter Darsee Letts is the chief creative officer. The family also launched Hemispheres, a retail chain with fine home furnishings.The central warehouse, manufacturing, and office complex has over 9 million square feet. David Green argues that it is more cost-effective and causes less chaos to distribute almost everything from one location, rather than to have manufacturers send orders directly to stores or to stock regional distributors with the entire inventory. The exceptions are greeting cards, posters, and sewing patterns, which are continuously replenished by suppliers. The unique approach is made possible in large part because the stores carry the same merchandise, just in different quantities, based on a simple formula that requires reordering when stock for an item falls to a certain number.Each store carries about 75,000 regular items and 25,000 seasonal or special products (about 25,000 items each year are new or one-time seasonal). Beyond the framing department which has an enormous variety of frames and the ability to produce custom versions, the typical 55,000-square-foot store carries a wide variety of supplies that go far beyond arts, crafts, and hobbies. These include a wide selection of artificial flowers and greenery, furniture, bird cages, clocks, inspirational books, party and wedding supplies and storage options.""Customers just love coming here,"" said William Castro, a senior assistant manager at the 72,500-square-foot location in Burbank, Calif., who formerly was a manager at Target (TGT) and has been with Hobby Lobby 17 years. ""It's like a retail Disneyland and they can browse for hours. Employees are trained to always leave a positive impression and we're treated like a tight-knit family, so there is very low turnover.""While managers can't change what is stocked, they do have discretion on how it is displayed (a big deal in retailing), as well as on hiring, promotion and raises.Amazingly, considering the extensive inventory, the company has no long-term debt. ""The Bible warns against becoming a slave to debt, so we just have a credit line we use for seasonal merchandise in the fall and we pay that off by the end of the year,"" said Green.A supreme test of adhering to fundamental beliefs came when the Affordable Care Act (ObamaCare) mandated that companies pay for 20 methods of contraception. The Greens were opposed to four of these, including Plan B, aka the ""morning-after pill,"" charging that they induced abortions. They were threatened with fines of $1.3 million a day for being in violation and so they sued for what they argued was a violation of their constitutional right to exercise their religion and invoked the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. The case, known as Burwell v. Hobby Lobby, went to the Supreme Court, resulting in a 2014 decision 5-4 that closely-held companies could choose to be exempt.In his new book, ""Giving It All Away … And Getting It Back Again,"" Green discusses the family's dedication to be a positive force in the world. About half of Hobby Lobby's pretax earnings have been given to charities, especially those that support evangelical work and help the poor. The Greens are also financing an eight-story Museum of the Bible set to open in Washington, D.C., in November. Green has joined Warren Buffett and Bill Gates in the Giving Pledge, a commitment to donate half his wealth to good causes in his lifetime.And having watched how other family empires lost their way due to squabbling and self-indulgence, the Greens have put everything into a trust that guarantees that spiritual and ethical principles will continue to guide their companies. If a member of the extended clan wants to make money from the family enterprise, they will have to get a job, David Green says.""We believe that God is the owner of everything, so we are just stewards for our business,"" said Green.

184,TGT,"Foot Locker (FL) blamed delayed income tax returns for sluggish sales early in Q1 that weren't made up later in the quarter and reported results that missed forecasts.Estimates: EPS virtually unchanged at $1.38, with revenue edging up 1.4% to $2.015 billion.Results: EPS of $1.36 on revenue of $2.00 billion. Same-store sales rose 0.5%, below consensus views.""The slow start we experienced in February, which we believe was largely due to the delay in income tax refunds, was unfortunately not fully offset by much stronger sales in March and April,"" said CEO Richard Johnson said in a statement.Stock: Shares sank 16.7% to 58.72 in the stock market today, hitting a nine-month low. After building a cup-with-handle base through April, the stock failed to clear a 77.80 entry point, ultimately wilting past its 50-day moving average this week.On Thursday, Hibbett Sports (HIBB) topped earnings forecasts though same-store sales sank 4.9%. On Tuesday, Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS) plunged after missing sales estimates.Aside from a few choice retailers — namely, Wal-Mart (WMT) — the entire sector has been getting battered in recent weeks on weak earnings results. Even those that topped views, such as Target (TGT), still recorded year-over-year declines.Foot Locker results also provide a glimpse into how Nike (NKE), Adidas (ADDYY) and Under Armour (UAA) are performing at the retail level.Nike shares reversed an earlier sell-off to rise 0.2%, while Under Armour bounced back to gain 1.1%. Adidas dipped 0.55%.RELATED:These 5 Retailers Topped Earnings Views, But Their Stocks ...Target's Big Q1 Beat Offers Some Hope, But There's Still This Scary ThingEarnings Distractions Before Next Trump Bombshell: Investing Action PlanThis Is Keeping TJX Bullish Amid The Broader Retail MeltdownTJX Makes Surprise Appearance With Dick's, Staples In Bargain Bin

185,TGT,"As retailers brace for what has been seen as a losing holiday-season battle with Amazon (AMZN), Wal-Mart (WMT) is trying to steer more customers toward its website and get more of them to pick up orders in-store.XThe big-box retailer and recent acquirer of boutique e-commerce firms on Wednesday said it will broaden its in-store and online product selection for the holiday season, with more than triple the items available online compared with last holiday season.Wal-Mart said it expects its Pickup Discount service, which discounts items bought online and picked up in-store, to play a ""big role"" during the holiday season. The company also said that the number of stores offering its online grocery pickup service have doubled since last year's holiday season.The company also noted this is the first holiday season when shopper can get free two-day shipping without a membership fee on $35-plus orders for more than 2 million items.The holiday savings start this weekend, the company said, affecting thousands of items over the holiday season.Wal-Mart's announcement follows a similar one from Target (TGT) last month. Target said then that it would offer free shipping starting today, and said most of its roughly 1,700 ""curated"" gift selections were available for under $15.Eight of the 12 exclusive brands it plans to introduce by the end of next year will be made available for the first time over the holidays, the company said. More retailers have banked on those offerings to unlock sales.Shares of Wal-Mart were up 0.7% at 87.94 in the stock market today, rising further above buy range. Target eased 0.3%, and Amazon dipped 0.1% but remains in buy range.IBD'S TAKE: As brick-and-mortar retailers navigate the online era, many brands are going on offense with private labels.Wal-Mart has made some of the retail sector's bolder attempts to offer more connected shopping, snapping up hipster-leaning e-commerce apparel shops like Bonobos and ModCloth and testing out a service that allows a delivery driver to access their home.Meanwhile, Wal-Mart is also enhancing its in-store shopping experience with events like ""Toys That Rock,"" ""Parties That Rock"" and ""Gifts That Rock,"" where customers can get curated gift guides.RELATED:This Could Become Wal-Mart's Newest Weapon Against AmazonHere's Why Retail Stocks Crashed Today — But Not Amazon, Wal-MartAmazon, Like Wal-Mart, Thinks You'll Be OK Letting Strangers In Your HomeWal-Mart Tests 'In-Fridge Delivery' With Smart Lock Maker August

186,TGT,"The S&P 500 index was slightly lower for the week even as Dow components Wal-Mart (WMT) and Cisco Systems (CSCO) skyrocketed on strong earnings and hopes that the titans will continue to transition into faster-growth markets. The Dow's General Electric (GE) tumbled as Wall Street isn't sold on its turnaround plan. Tesla (TSLA) unveiled new future vehicles even as it struggles to get the Model 3 out the door and General Motors (GM) ramps up its electric car goals. Chinese internet leaders Tencent (TCEHY), JD.com (JD), YY (YY) and NetEase (NTES) all had strong earnings reports.The S&P 500 index fell 0.1% for the week while the Dow lost 0.3%. The Nasdaq composite climbed 0.5% after hitting an all-time high Thursday. Wal-Mart, Cisco, NetApp (NTAP), Applied Materials (AMAT) and several Chinese internets helped, along with some up-and-down movement on tax cuts. General Electric was a disappointment.Wal-Mart per-share earnings unexpectedly rose 2% to $1 a share on 4% sales growth to $123.18 billion, including e-commerce growth of 50%. Investors were pleased, sending shares up 10.9% on Thursday to a record high. On Wednesday, Target (TGT) offered up weak guidance for the ""highly competitive"" holiday quarter. The discounter did top Q3 forecasts with a 12.5% EPS fall to 91 cents and 1.4% sales rise to $16.67 billion. Shares tumbled below their 200-day line on Wednesday but regained that key level by the end of the week.New General Electric (GE) CEO John Flannery offered up a plan to turn around the troubled industrial giant, but Wall Street found GE's strategic vision held little that was new or bold. GE will reduce its footprint to just three key divisions — aviation, power and health care. Flannery also halved the profit outlook for 2018 and GE's rich dividends. Investors sent GE shares to a nearly six-year low.Cisco Systems (CSCO) surged to a 17-year high after the computer networking giant said it expects December-quarter revenue to rise 1%-3%, the first year-over-year gain in nearly two years. Cisco forecast earnings of 59 cents a share at its midpoint of guidance vs. estimates of 58 cents. Cisco reported strong demand for its new Catalyst 9000 network switches. The new switches are part of Cisco's plan to grow recurring subscription revenue. Deferred revenue rose 10% in the latest quarter.NetApp (NTAP) reported revenue of $1.42 billion, beating the consensus estimate of $1.38 billion. Adjusted earnings came in at 81 cents per share, ahead of views for 69 cents. The data storage and networking company also raised its outlook for the December quarter. Shares soared.T.J. Maxx parent TJX fell short of revenue estimates with sales of $8.76 billion but met EPS views with a 10% rise to $1 a share. The midpoint of Q4 profit guidance fell short of current forecasts, sending shares lower. Off-price peer Ross Stores, meanwhile, easily topped views with 16% profit gains to 72 cents a share as revenue grew 8% to $3.33 billion. Comps of 4% beat views for 2%, and Ross raised Q4 comp outlook. Ross shares surged Friday.Gap (GPS) and Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF) rallied Friday on well-received Q3 reports from the apparel chains.Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) bought more Apple (AAPL) shares in the third quarter and sold a huge share of its IBM (IBM) holdings, regulatory filings showed. The big investors clashed on the iPhone maker, which hit a record high in Q3. George Soros' Soros Fund Management dumped his entire stake, while David Einhorn's Greenlight Capital slashed its stake nearly in half, and David Tepper's Appaloosa doubled its stake. Outside tech, Berkshire kept faith with airlines. Soros loaded up consumer stocks.It was a good week or China internet companies as five of them reported quarterly results that all topped estimates. The big winner was YY (YY), a provider of livestreaming services. YY reported revenue of $464.8 million, smashing the consensus estimate of $423 million. Shares soared more than 20%. Tencent Holdings (TCEHY), a leader in gaming and messaging, saw its shares approach a new high on its quarterly results. China e-commerce company JD.com (JD) got a boost as well, as did 58.com (WUBA), called the Craigslist of China. Mobile gaming specialist NetEase (NTES) trounced earnings views, sending shares surging nearly 8% Thursday and almost 13% on Friday.Consumer electronics retailer Best Buy (BBY)  earned an adjusted 78 cents a share in its third quarter, up 30% year over year, on sales of $9.32 billion, up 4%. But analysts expected 79 cents and $9.35 billion. Best Buy blamed the delayed launch of the Apple (AAPL) iPhone X and hurricanes in Texas and Florida for the Q3 disappointment. For the holiday quarter, Best Buy expects to earn $1.94 a share on sales of $14.35 billion, based on the midpoint of its guidance. Analysts were modeling for EPS of $2.03 on sales of $14.36 billion.Semiconductor-equipment giant Applied Materials (AMAT) beat fiscal fourth quarter sales and earnings targets and guided higher for the current quarter. Its stock climbed to a record high on the news, finally eclipsing its previous record reached in April 2000 during the dot-com bubble. Another chip-gear stock getting a lift from a positive earnings report was Kulicke & Soffa Industries (KLIC). Also, semiconductor-equipment firm Lam Research (LRCX) got a boost after announcing a $2.3 billion capital return program.Biotechs were relatively beat up last week with a few key exceptions. Five Prime Therapeutics (FPRX) continued taking hits Monday, diving nearly 10% on data in a pancreatic cancer trial using its drug, cabiralizumab, with Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) blockbuster Opdivo. Pacira Pharmaceuticals (PCRX) lost 6.6% Tuesday after the Food and Drug Administration set a date for an advisory committee to discuss its drug, Exparel, as a regional anesthetic. Also Tuesday, Loxo Oncology (LOXO) led a biotech deluge as stocks broadly lost 1.9% after it agreed to codevelop two cancer drugs with Bayer (BAYRY) in a $1.55 billion deal. On Wednesday, Acorda Therapeutics (ACOR) dipped to a five-month low after reporting five deaths in its late-stage Parkinson's disease studies. Nektar Therapeutics (NKTR) defied the trend, though, and rose to a nearly 17-year high Monday on a promising trial of its drug, NKTR-214, with Bristol's Opdivo in skin, kidney and lung cancers.Tesla (TSLA) unveiled an all-electric Semi truck with a higher-than-expected 500-mile battery range as well as a next-generation Roadster sports car. CEO Elon Musk said the new truck will start production in 2019, though Tesla has struggled with deadlines. In the meantime, JB Hunt (JBHT) and others plunked down $5,000 reservations, offering cash-burning Tesla more capital for its Model 3 rollout. Tesla shares rose a fraction Friday. Meanwhile, General Motors (GM) plans to sell 1 million electric vehicles a year by 2026. That aggressive new target hinges on a next-gen EV platform by 2021, with less costly batteries.Inflation appears to be firming, but hurricane recovery may be playing a role, new Labor Department data suggested. Core consumer prices, excluding food and energy, rose 1.8% from a year ago, with an annualized 2.4% gain over the past three months. Rent inflation has been behind the recent strength, but used car prices also bounced in October, likely a temporary effect of demand created when hurricanes Harvey and Irma destroyed hundreds of thousands of vehicles.While all evidence suggests the economy is on something of a roll, retail sales moderated after surging an upwardly revised 1.9% in September. The overall 0.2% gain edged past expectations, but came in on the weak side outside of autos with a 0.1% rise.Emirates announced an order for 40 Boeing (BA) 787-10s, valued at $15.1 billion at list prices, instead of the expected Airbus (EADSY) A380 order. Boeing also inked an order for 175 737 Max jets from discount carrier FlyDubai. Airbus had a surprise of its own, shocking industry watchers with a $49.5 billion order for 273 A320neo jets and 157 A321neos from U.S. investor Indigo Partners, the largest in Airbus' history. Even Bombardier (BDRBF) signed an order for its struggling CSeries line at the show. Boeing said the Middle East will need 3,350 new airplanes over the next 20 years, valued at $730 billion, up from its 2015 market outlook of 3,180 new planes.Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS) reported third-quarter earnings and sales that beat estimates. But the struggling retailer said earnings per share next year could fall by as much as 20%, citing flat same-store sales and plans to spend money on e-commerce, private brands and other investments. Dick's shares fell Tuesday but rose for teh week. However, Foot Locker (FL) and Hibbett Sports (HIBB) reported better-than-expected earnings, sending their shares soaring Friday. Mall-based Foot Locker said inventories are falling, good news for Nike (NKE). Hibbett Sports cited strong online sales, and raised full-year guidance.U.S. crude output hit a new high of 9.645 million barrels per day from a 9.62 million bpd in the week-ago report, the Energy Information Administration said. Stockpiles increased by 1.9 million barrels. Analysts expected a drop of 1 million barrels. In its World Energy Outlook, the International Energy Agency estimated that U.S. output would jump 25% — to 30 million barrels of oil equivalent per day from 24 million currently. But the IEA also cut its 2017 and 2018 oil demand forecast by 100,000 barrels per day. U.S. crude futures fell slightly for the week.RH (RH), the upscale furniture retailer formerly known as Restoration Hardware gave preliminary Q3 earnings figures that were well above estimates and other guided 2018 revenue estimates higher. Shares soared 26% on Thursday. But upscale home furnishings chain Williams-Sonoma (WSM) tumbled 13% Friday on weak earnings.Data services provider Splunk (SPLK) reported third-quarter results that beat estimates on the top and bottom lines, with a revenue forecast above expectations, sending shares up 18% on Friday.Buffalo Wild Wings (BWLD) shares zoomed nearly 24% on Tuesday on the previous evening's after-hours Wall Street Journal report that private-equity firm Roark Capital had offered over $2.3 billion, or $150 a share, for the restaurant chain.Wireless-chip maker Qualcomm (QCOM) rejected an unsolicited acquisition offer by Broadcom (AVGO), saying the proposed $130 billion deal undervalues the company. Broadcom was undeterred and indicated it could take its proposal directly to shareholders.Square (SQ) said it's in trials with a Bitcoin service that lets users of its Square Cash money-transfer app buy and sell the digital currency via an exchange.

187,TGT,"The major market indexes posted heavy losses through Wednesday morning trade. The tech-heavy Nasdaq lagged with a 0.7% loss, weighed down by Apple's (AAPL) fall. The Dow Jones industrial average and S&P 500 declined 0.6% apiece.X Among the Dow Jones Industrial components, only a few names were trading in the green early Wednesday. Nike (NKE) moved up 0.7%, as it builds a cup-with-handle base with a 57.35 entry.Elsewhere in the Dow, Apple dropped 1.1%, on pace to extend a losing streak to five trading sessions, but recovered to just above the buy range from a 160.97 cup-with-handle entry. Key iPhone supplier Foxconn announced weaker-than-expected profit in the third quarter.

189,TGT,"The consumer price index rose 0.5% in September and 2.2% vs. a year earlier, the Labor Department reported on Friday. Core prices, which exclude food and energy, rose 0.1% on the month and 1.7% from a year ago.Wall Street expected the headline CPI to rise 0.6% on the month and 2.3% from a year ago, thanks to a hurricane-inflicted boost in energy prices. The core CPI was expected to rise 0.2% and 1.8% from a year ago. Hurricane effects also raised the risk of an uptick in core inflation, as the owners of damaged homes and destroyed vehicles began repairs and shopped for replacements, but new and used vehicle prices fell.After the report, the 10-year Treasury yield moved lower. The CPI data likely doesn't change the near-term outlook for Federal Reserve policy, with markets expecting a December rate hike, but it could lower the odds that the Fed will stick to its plan of three rate hikes in 2018.Futures for the S&P 500 index, Nasdaq 100 and Dow industrials held onto gains on the stock market today after the inflation report. JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC) and other financials lost ground as the data dampened prospects for wider net interest margins that can come from higher long-term interest rates. BofA reported better-than-expected earnings early Friday, while Wells Fargo missed on revenue.Prices for food consumed at home didn't budge in September after a 0.2% drop in August that may have partly reflected price cuts at Whole Foods after Amazon.com (AMZN) closed its acquisition. Target (TGT) announced price cuts in early September. Prices for food consumed away from home rose 0.4%.Prices for telephone hardware and related consumer information gear fell 1.2%, showing no obvious shift from its steady downward trend after Apple (AAPL) released its pricey iPhone 8.IBD'S TAKE: Shares of major banks including JPMorgan and Bank of America are in buy range, less than 5% above buy points cleared in recent weeks. A buy point is the point when an investor has the best chance of near-term gains. If firmer inflation readings send long-term interest rates higher, the stocks are likely to continue their ascent. To find other stocks poised for gains, start with these IBD lists.The Fed has given mixed signals about the inflation outlook and what it means for policy. Despite members' hawkish rate projections, minutes from the Sept. 19-20 meeting reflected an extensive discussion of factors that will likely keep a lid on inflation going forward, including the impact of technological innovation on business pricing.Marriott International (MAR) CEO Arne Sorenson explained on an earnings call last month that the hotel group doesn't have as much ability to raise prices as it had in past cycles. While home-sharing via Airbnb has some impact on leisure travelers and business travel is pretty good, not great, he sees the bigger issue as ""radical transparency in pricing.""""It's not particularly focused on home sharing or the disrupters in the space,"" Sorenson said. ""It's much more about just the ubiquity of information. And I think with each passing year, it becomes simpler and simpler to know the rates at every single hotel.""Fed members also suggested that government health care policies might continue to hold down medical care inflation, which hit a new 50-year low annual rate of 1.6% in September. Prescription drug prices fell 0.6% on the month.CVS Health (CVS) said in August that it saw flat same-store prescription volumes in the second quarter, but pharmacy same-store sales fell 2.8%, dragged down by recent generic introductions. While drug pricing moderation from generic competition often comes in waves, this wave is likely to be more sustained amid the FDA's new plan to expedite review of generic drug applications.""We're already seeing results, as May and June of this year have seen the most generic drug approvals since the FDA began tallying its monthly approvals,"" CVS CEO Larry Merlo said on an August 8 conference call.RELATED:GM, Ford Soar As U.S. Auto Sales Get Post-Hurricane Surge 5 Reasons The Bond Market May Throw Another Fed TantrumBank of America Tops Q3 Earnings ViewsStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth Stocks

190,TGT,"The news that Wall Street analysts, bond investors and Wal-Mart's (WMT) competitors all feared on Tuesday didn't happen.XShares of Wal-Mart had underperformed in the two weeks leading up to Tuesday's annual investor day, ever since rival Target (TGT) announced that it was hiking its minimum wage from $10 an hour to $11, with a commitment to hit $15 by 2020.The worry was that Wal-Mart, facing the same kind of wage pressures as Target amid 4.2% unemployment, would have to embark on a new round of pay increases. While Wal-Mart unquestionably enhanced its competitive position by investing an additional $2.7 billion in employee compensation in 2015 and 2016, while also investing heavily in e-commerce capabilities, the combination has been tough on profitability.Even as Wal-Mart's U.S. sales, excluding Sam's Club, rose nearly $20 billion, or 6.9%, from its January 2015 fiscal year through January 2017, operating income slid by $3.6 billion, or 16.8%.Wal-Mart signaled on Tuesday that those days of shrinking profits to secure its competitive position may be behind it. The company stood by guidance that earnings per share would grow 5% in the fiscal year starting February 2018.While Wal-Mart investors cheered the news, the whole retail sector likely breathed a sigh of relief. AutoZone (AZO) CEO William Rhodes said on an earnings call last month that wage pressures had accelerated ""significantly more than I have experienced in my nearly 23 years of AutoZone.""Rhodes said minimum wage laws explain only part of the pressure. ""Probably the larger portion is being driven by general market pressures with lower unemployment and some specific actions taken in recent years by other retailers.""""Other retailers"" surely referred to Wal-Mart, which bumped up its base wage to $9 an hour in 2015 and $10 in 2016. A host of other retailers, including Costco (COST) and Target, responded with their own wage hikes in the spring of 2016. Kroger (KR) and Target were among the best performing S&P 500 stocks on Wednesday. (Kroger also said Wednesday it is considering selling its convenience stores.)IBD'S TAKE: Shares of Wal-Mart cleared a buy point of 82.09 on its welcome guidance. A buy point is the point when an investor has the best chance of near-term gains. So far, Wal-Mart's stock has been a case in point, rising to 85.73. The stock is barely still within the 5% chase zone, above which it  is considered extended. To find other stocks poised for gains, start with these IBD lists.A new round of wage hikes by Wal-Mart, which has 1.5 million U.S. employees, would have put pressure on other modest-wage employers to match, and hawkish Federal Reserve policymakers keeping a close eye on wage growth as a precursor of rising inflation would have surely taken note.Because Wal-Mart's wage outlook has pretty sizable implications for the U.S. economy, the big question is why Wal-Mart doesn't think it will need to match Target's wage hike, at least in the near term. It's now been 20 months since Wal-Mart implemented its last big wage increase. Wal-Mart said at the time that the $10 minimum only applied to associates hired by Jan. 1, 2016, and that new entry-level hires would get a $9 starting wage. That will pale compared with Target's $11 an hour and the $12 starting wage that Amazon.com (AMZN) offered as it tried to recruit 50,000 workers during a one-day hiring spree in August.While Wal-Mart hasn't precisely spelled out its reasoning, here are some of the factors likely at play.One of Target's reasons for hiking its minimum wage to $11 right now is to help it attract 100,000 seasonal employees. Wal-Mart, on the other hand, which hired 60,000 seasonal workers back in 2015, has said it will get by without seasonal workers for the second straight holiday season. Instead, it plans to offer current associates additional hours.That potential for more hours is one of the ways Wal-Mart can deepen its relationship with its workers, while providing them with more income, even if it's not necessarily coming from higher wages. Under another new Wal-Mart program, associates can earn extra cash by delivering packages on their drive home from work, while helping to speed delivery to customers. Increased sales at Wal-Mart also have led to performance bonuses. In March, the company said that 850,000 associates shared $157 million in cash bonuses based on their stores' fourth-quarter performance.After Wal-Mart's first big minimum-wage hike in 2015, there were concerns that the morale of more experienced workers just up the pay ladder might suffer if they were left out. That explains, in part, why Wal-Mart broadened out the pay hike in 2016 to include 1.2 million workers. It's easy to see why Wal-Mart wouldn't want a repeat, if it can avoid it.At Wal-Mart's investor day, management said that the company has continued to increase pay, as needed, though on a market-by-market basis, depending on local conditions. The company also stressed, though not specifically with regard to wages, that it was more focused on having a performance-based culture after previously having ""set the bar too low.""By rewarding workers with promotions — 200,000 in fiscal 2017 — more hours and incentive pay, it's possible Wal-Mart may be able to defer another minimum-wage hike for some time without experiencing a troubling increase in turnover.Still, Wal-Mart's profit outlook doesn't look quite as impressive once you consider that the company also plans to buy back $20 billion in shares over two years. Buying $10 billion worth would shrink the share count by nearly 4% in the coming year at current prices, so 5% EPS growth might only translate to a 1% to 2% earnings rise, unadjusted for share count.RELATED:Wal-Mart Breaks Out On Buyback, Bullish Online Sales ForecastHurricanes Hit Payrolls, But Wage Gains May Speed Up Fed Rate HikesDid Target's Wage Hike Just Prove Fed Hawks Right — Or Wrong? Stocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth Stocks

191,TGT,"Costco (COST) topped fiscal fourth-quarter estimates on the top line, bottom line and key same-store sales metrics late Thursday, but one metric still fell short.XEstimates: Analysts expect a 14% increase in EPS to $2.02 on revenue of $41.74 billion, also up 14%, according to Zacks Investment Research. Core same-store sales excluding gas and foreign exchange trading are expected to rise 5.1%, according to Consensus Metrix. U.S. same-store sales are seen up 5.1% too.Results: EPS of $2.08 on revenue of $42.3 billion, as adjusted total comp sales rose 5.7% and U.S. comps climbed 5.8%. But net sales, which exclude membership fees, came in at $41.36 billion, missing Factset's forecast for $41.6 billion.Stock: Costco fell 1.7% late. Shares closed up 1.1% at 167.07 on the stock market today, carving out a first-stage cup base with a 183.28 buy point. Amazon (AMZN) added 1.6%, Wal-Mart (WMT) advanced 0.4% within a flat base with an 82.09 buy point. Target (TGT) slipped 0.5% as the stock meets resistance at the 200-day line.IBD'S TAKE: Buying or holding a stock can be risky heading into an earnings report. Here's an earnings options strategy that can help you cash in on post-earnings stock gains, while minimizing the risk from a weak quarter.Meanwhile, investors worry about the long-term impact of Amazon on Costco's business, despite its strong e-commerce performance.A recent study by BMO Capital Markets found that when it comes to the best prices and speediest shipping, Costco actually beats Amazon.The Amazon effect could, however, ""continue to create an overhang on COST shares and limit valuation upside,"" BMO's Kelly Bania wrote in a report last month.Wal-Mart also has been investing heavily in e-commerce, intensifying rivalries in the online retail sector. On top of that, retailers have been waging a wage war for years.Wal-Mart boosted its base wage to $9 an hour in 2015 and $10 in 2016, leading Costco and a host of other retailers to respond with wage hikes of their own. Target recently announced it will raise its hourly minimum wage to $11, promising $15 an hour by 2020.RELATED:Did Target's Wage Hike Just Prove Fed Hawks Right — Or Wrong?Retail And E-Commerce News And Stocks To WatchTarget's New Exclusive Brand?

192,TGT,"The economy shed jobs last month for the first time since 2010, as hurricanes Harvey and Irma blew the job market temporarily off course. Yet September's jobs report may prove to be a significant turning point for the economy and Federal Reserve policy because of its surprising underlying strength.XThe jobless rate fell to 4.2%, the lowest since early 2001, while yearly growth in average hourly wages accelerated to 2.9%, matching the best gain since 2009.Wall Street had expected a steady 4.4% jobless rate and 2.6% wage growth. Those upside surprises trumped the 33,000 drop in payrolls, which was a far cry from the 100,000 gain expected, but not entirely surprising. After hurricanes Katrina and Rita, which covered a much smaller area than this year's storms, the Labor Department initially reported a loss of 35,000 jobs in September 2005.Following the report, the 10-year Treasury yield hit a five-month high of 2.39%. While tame inflation will allow the Federal Reserve to move gradually as it tightens policy, investors may have been a little too complacent about the interest-rate outlook.Odds that the Fed will hike its key interest rate in December were already nearly 90% before the jobs data, but markets didn't expect a subsequent hike until September 2018. Friday's report showing faster wage growth and a tighter job market moved up that timetable. Markets are now pricing in a nearly 60% chance of a June 2018 hike.After the jobs report, the S&P 500 index, Dow Jones industrial average and Nasdaq composite pulled back from record highs, but pared losses with the Nasdaq even closing up on the stock market today.Wall Street expected just a 2.6% year-over-year rise in average hourly wages, after wage gains had been stuck at 2.5% for the prior five months. But it turns out that the Labor Department had somewhat understated wage growth, as IBD has been saying based on the rise in federal income and employment taxes withheld from worker paychecks.Friday's data showed that wage growth was revised up to 2.6% in July and 2.7% in August. The acceleration to 2.9% in September matched the gain in December 2016 for the best since June 2009.It's possible, though, that the hurricane gave average wages the appearance of a bump, because temporary job losses were focused on lower-wage industries. Payrolls at food services and drinking places were 105,000 lower in September. If one assumes that the hurricanes cut 200,000 such modest-wage jobs, that would have dropped the average wage gain to 2.8%.Still, increasing evidence of wage pressures is emerging. The Aug. 2 Amazon (AMZN) jobs day during which the online retailer aimed to hire 50,000 people for jobs starting at $12 an hour drew massive lines of people, many likely looking for greener pastures.Last month, Target (TGT) said it will boost its starting wage from $10 to $11 an hour in October and continue to raise it until it reaches $15 in 2020. And after Wal-Mart (WMT) hiked its base wage to $10 an hour in February 2016, a host of retailers, including Costco (COST) and Target, responded with their own wage hikes last year.IBD'S TAKE: IBD readers may not have expected the market's melt-up over the past month, but they were ready to take advantage of it. On Aug. 22, IBD shifted its market-trend gauge to ""confirmed uptrend"" from ""uptrend under pressure,"" the equivalent of a flashing yellow light turning green. The Big Picture daily update of the underlying market trend is among IBD's premium features accessible for free through Oct. 8. Also see IBD's exclusive stock lists and IBD Stock Checkup, which ranks the leaders in 197 industry groups based on earnings, sales, margins and stock performance.On a Sept. 19 call, AutoZone (AZO) CEO William Rhodes said the auto parts retailer, with 5,300 stores across the U.S., has ""experienced accelerated pressure on wages significantly more than I have experienced in my nearly 23 years of AutoZone,"" according to a Seeking Alpha transcript.Rhodes said minimum wage laws explain only part of the pressure. ""Probably the larger portion is being driven by general market pressures with lower unemployment and some specific actions taken in recent years by other retailers.""The employment report's household survey data also showed pretty dramatic strength, though the survey can be volatile from month to month and carries a wider margin of error than the establishment survey that yields payrolls and wages. The data showed that the employed population spiked by 906,000 last month, after falling by 74,000 in August, while the ranks of the unemployed fell by 331,000.RELATED:Did Target's Wage Hike Just Prove Fed Hawks Right — Or Wrong? The Job Market Is Getting Too Strong For The Federal ReserveStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth Stocks

193,TGT,"Retail investors turned more leery in a volatile February — yet they used the stock market pullback as an opportunity to buy Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN) and General Electric (GE) rather than flee.X Customers at online brokerage TD Ameritrade (AMTD) were net buyers of those stocks in a month that saw each of the Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite fall more than 10% below recent highs. Worries about rising bond yields and inflation sparked a sharp sell-off in stocks, leading to a brief market correction. Stocks bottomed on Feb. 9, when the S&P 500 index rebounded from its 200-day moving average. The major averages did fall in February, breaking long monthly winning streaks.Meanwhile, volatility of the S&P 500, as measured by the Cboe Volatility Index, or VIX, spiked during the period. As the VIX rose above 50 for the first time since August 2015, it decreased the relative volatility of many widely held stocks, including GE, Apple and Facebook (FB), according to a new TD Ameritrade report. That led investors to ""significantly limit their volatility risk in the market, changing their game plan from less speculative to more of a low beta weighted one,"" said JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade, noting the rocky start to 2018 came after a tame 2017.Use IBD's MarketSmith For Free Until March 11

195,TGT,"Grocery giant Kroger (KR) and China e-commerce heavyweight Alibaba (BABA) have recently chatted about potentially working together, according to multiple reports. The talks are happening as stores continue to eye Amazon's (AMZN) moves in the food space following its multibillion-dollar acquisition of Whole Foods Markets last year and its debut this week of cashier-less convenience-store concept Amazon Go.X The discussions were in the early stage, said Reuters, and will not necessarily result in a deal. According to the New York Post, which first reported the news, senior execs on both sides met in China last month. Alibaba has reportedly been expanding the store count of its Hema supermarkets in the country.The Kroger-Alibaba news follows last week's report that Kroger was mulling a bid to acquire online home goods seller Overstock (OSTK), which would bolster its e-commerce operations and expand its presence in the home-furnishings market.Kroger, which operates 2,790 stores under the Food4less, Fred Meyer, Harris Teeter and Ralphs names among others, is also said to be in advanced talks to acquire Boxed.com, a wholesale e-tailer that has earned the moniker ""Costco for millennials.""Despite Amazon's smaller presence on the grocery front — there are fewer than 500 Whole Foods stores and only one Amazon Go — Wall Street is keenly aware of the online retailer's disruptive potential. After the takeover, Amazon was quick to cut prices at the upscale grocery store, offer Whole Foods products on Amazon.com and install Echo displays in Whole Foods stores.Kroger shares closed up 2.65% at 30.26 in the stock market today, finally retaking the 30 price level for the first time since Amazon first made its bombshell acquisition announcement last June. Alibaba rallied 1.4%, and Amazon added 1.5%.IBD'S TAKE: With thousands of publicly traded companies to choose from, how can you quickly find the best stocks to buy right now?

Amazon announced that purchase in June, completed it in August, and began cutting prices on ground beef, eggs, fish and other items at the upscale grocery chain.BMO analyst Kelly Bania said in a research note last week that ""food retailers are likely to continue experiencing heightened volatility during this period of Whole Foods transformation under Amazon. We estimate price cuts of this magnitude, if they continue, could put prices on par to slightly below Kroger.""Amazon's acquisition also came as grocery chains were already mired in a discount battle after an oversupply of some goods lowered prices. Kroger, in reporting first-quarter earnings in June, said that the so-called food deflation was ""less severe"" during that quarter than in the prior one.But Amazon, in August, said it intended to make Whole Foods' ""high-quality, natural and organic food affordable for everyone"" and that this was ""just the beginning"" — words that probably delighted some shoppers but sent chills through grocery-chain investors.

Sprouts Farmers Market (SFM), a rival natural foods grocer, was among the biggest losers.Amazon also said it would make Amazon Prime the rewards program for Whole Foods and make some of Whole Foods' private label products available via Amazon.com.Prior the Amazon acquisition, Kroger had enjoyed strong growth in natural and organic foods, grabbing market share from high-priced Whole Foods.Wal-Mart, the largest grocery seller in the U.S., has fared better than most grocers and retailers competing against Amazon, with shares trading just below a buy zone.Moody's Vice President Mickey Chadha said in a statement on Friday that even as deflation eases, the competition made passing on any price improvements to customers difficult.He added that the price war among grocery chains will stay competitive this year as discount German chains like Aldi and Lidl advance in the U.S. and Wal-Mart and Amazon continue to keep their weight on prices.""This will result in Kroger's profitability to remain pressured in the second half of the of the fiscal year,"" he said, ""however Kroger's scale, diverse store base, high private label penetration and strong execution ability is a distinct competitive advantage.""RELATED:Amazon To Cut Whole Foods Prices Monday; Grocery Stocks SlammedHow Wal-Mart, Google Are Taking On A Common Internet FoeRetail And E-Commerce News And Stocks To Watch

208,TGT,"Buying stocks has never been easier, cheaper or more accessible, as new investment apps target millennials and beginning investors with deep interest in the stock market — but not-so-deep pockets.Robinhood promotes ""free stock trading."" Stash lets you ""start investing with just $5."" Acorns will ""invest spare change from every purchase."" And Stockpile offers ""your favorite stock by the dollar"" — so you can buy fractions of Alphabet (GOOGL) or Amazon.com (AMZN) shares, which are nearly a thousand dollars each.""Micro-investing apps have 'gameified' investing,"" said Lex Sokolin, fintech strategy director at Autonomous Research, in an interview. ""They are more about incentivizing participation in the financial markets — any participation by the younger generation — and making applications engaging and in some ways addictive.""The expansion of micro-investing apps will force the financial establishment to adapt — and could even disrupt traditional brokerages, say fintech and investing experts. But first these startups must show they can hang on to the customers they have acquired and turn a profit. That's no easy matter when incumbents such as Vanguard, Charles Schwab (SCHW), TD Ameritrade (AMTD) and E-Trade Financial (ETFC) have steadily lowered fees or removed minimums to trade stocks and ETFs, and have improved their digital platforms for a new generation of investors to boot.But in one early sign that these fintech startups are winning over established giants, as well as beginner investors, Stockpile said Thursday it has raised $30 million in its latest round of fundraising, led by a venture capital fund backed by global asset manager Fidelity International, bringing the total it's raised to more than $45 million.In just a few years of existence, micro-investing apps have built a core audience among millennial investors with not much in the way of investable assets.And the generation that came of age with the minimalist simplicity of Apple's iPhone doesn't want to look at screens overflowing with headlines, numbers and scrolling tickers.On Robinhood, which allows people to trade stocks for free and does away with investment minimums, there's no short interest data, analyst ratings or options information. The app is stripped of the bells and whistles found on TD Ameritrade or other fully featured brokerage apps, and doesn't even have ads that clutter the screen. Its design is carefully crafted to inspire — rather than overwhelm — the first-time investor, Robinhood says.Punch a stock ticker into the app, and you see little besides price action, a chart and a buy button. To buy the stock, enter the number of shares, preview the cost, swipe up — and you're done.""Interactions must be small, fun and easy"" for first-time investors, Sokolin said. ""Micro-investing apps nailed it better than online brokers or robo-advisors.""On Stash, you can build portfolios around investment themes like ""Clean And Green"" or ""American Innovators,"" rather than try to choose between less descriptive names like the T. Rowe Price Global Technology Fund or the Red Oak Technology Select Fund.Marie Thomasson, a 37-year-old financial planner in Los Angeles and self-described app junkie, recommends Stash to beginning investors.The app explains ""just what you need to know about investing and no more,"" she said, contrasting it to mainstream brokers' ""white papers"" that are dry, boring, outdated or overwhelming.The average age for Robinhood's 2 million users is 28, and a third of them use the app to make their first-ever stock purchase. If you think that's young, consider Stockpile: 60% of its user base is under 30 and 30% are children, who can get set up with custodial accounts.Stockpile has no account minimums and no monthly fees. And even a high-priced growth stock like Amazon can be bought for $25 or $50 or any dollar amount an investor chooses. Stockpile makes money in part by charging a flat fee of 99 cents a trade.For that amount, investors get fractional shares in the company and, often, their first taste of stock ownership, Stockpile CEO Avi Lele said in a phone call. The brokerage also offers gift cards that can be redeemed for stock, sold online and through outlets such as Target (TGT) and Safeway.But the stock ""gift card fee"" of $2.99 online ($4.95 and up in a store) — another way Stockpile makes money — has drawn flak as a hefty commission. Stockpile argues that it ensures the gift recipient gets the full stock-gift value.Lele said the app was inspired by his own struggles to scrape together a $5,000 minimum investment required by a brokerage firm. Lele was 25 before he had the money he needed to buy the Microsoft (MSFT) stock he badly wanted.""You can buy quality stocks even when you are starting out"" on Stockpile, he added. ""You can't do much with 50 bucks at a traditional brokerage.""And for those old enough to have credit cards, the Acorns app rounds up purchases to the nearest dollar and invests the change in ETF portfolios.University of Wisconsin student James Koenig, 22, estimates that his day-to-day spending nets him a $35-$50 investment every month.""Acorns is hands-down my favorite investing app,"" he said. ""I like the idea of being able to do small amounts that eventually add up to something bigger. You don't need to make a huge commitment.""There are trade-offs, of course. Robinhood, for example, offers fewer investment choices, less robust research tools, and a mobile-only trading platform. Micro-investing apps also get knocked for making stock trading much too easy.Acorns' and Stash's $1 monthly fees sound small, but could erase the yearly gains of a beginning investor who may have a couple hundred dollars or less in the apps, critics note. Jason Kirsch, a fee-only financial planner in California, argues that users have an incentive to overtrade, which can lead to huge losses, especially for novice investors.While apps such as Acorns offer some basic portfolio tracking, Kirsch finds that in more-complex situations — such as tracking individual securities for tax-loss harvesting — ""none of these apps has built-in software that makes this easy.""And Tastyworks, a new platform that enables self-directed investors to trade any investment strategy, be it stocks, options or futures, dings such apps for doing little to build either a robust technological platform or strategic know-how for investing in the stock market.""They may have captured a nice share of the business, but they may as well be selling hot dogs,"" sniffed Tastyworks co-founder Tom Sosnoff.Meanwhile, Charles Schwab, TD Ameritrade and E-Trade have slashed trading commissions from $8-$10 per trade to $5-$7, narrowing the advantage that the new apps have on that score. And the incumbents have minimum balances that range from zero at TD Ameritrade to $1,000 at Schwab.In addition to questions about how much money the apps can make for their users, there is the question of how they can make money for themselves while charging nominal fees, or none at all in Robinhood's case.But in September of last year, the company launched Robinhood Gold, a premium product charging $6-$200 a month for added services like buying on margin and extended-hours trading. The service is attracting high-net-worth, active investors and becoming a major revenue driver, spokesman Jack Randall said, with some Robinhood accounts now running into millions of dollars. Robinhood also earns revenue by collecting interest on the cash and securities in user accounts.As for zero-fee trades, the company says it is able to offer this benefit because its all-electronic, tech-driven brokerage platform has slashed overhead costs. Randall dismisses trading fees as arbitrary markups with no place in the digital age, when ""executing a trade is the same as sending an email.""Robinhood is adding 140,000 accounts every month to its 2 million-strong user base, which has made $75 billion in transactions since the app's 2014 launch. But Randall could not say how many accounts are actually funded or used for trading and wouldn't share data on average account size or typical starting balance.The economics of micro-investing apps are extremely challenged, Sokolin acknowledged, while arguing that their true value lies in the opportunity to leverage the attention of audiences they have acquired.""They may offer automated savings, but then up-sell into financial planning, or provide financial literacy, or create video content and add lead-generation into other categories, or sell customer data to other parties,"" he said. ""There are lots of things you can do with a big audience other than getting them to buy funds.""Robinhood says its users check the app 10 times a day on average. That kind of engagement among a highly coveted demographic whose brand loyalties are still up for grabs could be made lucrative, for example, by monetizing users' data or up-selling premium services to them.Robinhood has won $176 million in venture capital funding since its 2012 launch and is now valued at $1.3 billion, PitchBook fintech analyst Evan Morris wrote in a recent report. Stash has raised more than $79 million since its October 2015 launch and has a $264 million valuation.

215,TGT,"Wall Street doesn't expect much from Friday's jobs report — just 100,000 new jobs, a steady 4.4% unemployment rate and a tame annual wage gain of 2.6% — so there is plenty of scope for surprise. Here are four reasons why the report may come in notably stronger than expected and one reason why it might be the worst report since 2010.XThe August employment report showed that non-store retailers added just 700 jobs on a seasonally adjusted basis, the weakest month of hiring by the group since September 2016.So what happened to those 50,000 people Amazon.com (AMZN) supposedly hired at its one-day national job fair on Aug. 2? Amazon's one-day hiring binge didn't show up because the Labor Department conducted its survey of employers in the week starting Sunday, Aug. 6. That means few, if any, of those workers had clocked in for the first time.Expect an unusually big gain in non-store retail employment in the September report.Job growth appeared to take a step back in August, with the economy adding 156,000 jobs vs. expectations of a 180,000 increase. But economists suspect the data were skewed because the survey was conducted early in the month and potentially missed some hiring and wage gains that would've been seen when paychecks went out later that month.Ian Shepherdson of Pantheon Macroeconomics has noted that average hourly earnings tend to be underreported when the 15th pay period for the year falls after the survey week. On top of that, a number of economists have noted a tendency for August payrolls to be revised up substantially in subsequent months when the survey week lands as early as it did in August. That's why IHS Markit economists wrote last month that the Federal Reserve's reaction to August's softer report would be to ""discount it fully.""IBD'S TAKE: IBD readers may not have expected the market's melt-up over the past month, but they were ready to take advantage of it. On Aug. 22, IBD shifted its market-trend gauge to ""confirmed uptrend"" from ""uptrend under pressure,"" the equivalent of a flashing yellow light turning green. The Big Picture daily update of the underlying market trend is among IBD's premium features accessible for free through Oct. 8. Also see IBD's exclusive stock lists and IBD Stock Checkup, which ranks the leaders in 197 industry groups based on earnings, sales, margins and stock performance.Over the 10 weeks through Sept. 22, federal income and employment taxes withheld from paychecks have shown solid growth, rising 5.8% from a year ago after adjusting for calendar effects, an IBD analysis of Treasury data found. That's a notable improvement over the same period in 2016, when withheld taxes rose 4.5% from a year earlier.The data reflect aggregate economywide pay, which is a function of hours, wages and employment levels, along with incentive pay. Since Labor Department data show total hours worked growing about 2% a year, the data appear to indicate that wage growth is closer to 3% than the 2.5% trend reported by the Labor Department in recent months.Anecdotal evidence of wage pressure has been popping up in earnings calls, with AutoZone (AZO) a particularly notable example.On a Sept. 19 call, CEO William Rhodes said the auto parts retailer, with 5,300 stores across the U.S., has ""experienced accelerated pressure on wages significantly more than I have experienced in my nearly 23 years of AutoZone,"" according to a Seeking Alpha transcript.Rhodes said minimum wage laws explain only part of the pressure. ""Probably the larger portion is being driven by general market pressures with lower unemployment and some specific actions taken in recent years by other retailers.""""Other retailers"" surely refers to Wal-Mart (WMT), which bumped up its base wage to $9 an hour in 2015 and $10 in 2016. A host of other retailers, including Costco (COST) and Target (TGT), responded with their own wage hikes in the spring of 2016.Now Target is upping the ante, announcing an $11-an-hour starting wage that will take effect in October and plans to get to $15 an hour by the end of 2020.While Wall Street expects a big hit to payrolls in hurricane-hit areas, Ward McCarthy, chief financial economist at Jefferies, is expecting a much bigger wallop. He notes that hurricanes Harvey and Irma affected a much larger area than Katrina and Rita did in 2005. Further, the initial release of the September 2005 payrolls showed a loss of 35,000 jobs.That lousy report was eventually revised to show a gain of 67,000 jobs, but McCarthy expects Friday's report to show a net loss of 45,000 jobs, even if its subsequent revisions show a less-severe hit.RELATED:Did Target's Wage Hike Just Prove Fed Hawks Right — Or Wrong? The Job Market Is Getting Too Strong For The Federal ReserveStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth Stocks

217,TGT,"Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF) stock soared by more than 10% after the young-adult apparel chain forecast better-than-expected quarterly sales and profits on Monday.X The trendy casualwear retailer said comparable sales in the January-ending quarter are going to be up by high single digits, compared with the previous outlook of up low single digits. In addition, net sales growth will be in the low teens, compared with the previous outlook of up mid- to high single digits.Operating expense is expected to be up slightly from $553.7 million last year, but primarily due to the higher-than-anticipated net sales.""We are pleased by our performance across all brands and channels during the holiday season, with continued strength at Hollister, and the Abercrombie brand on track to deliver positive comparable sales for the quarter,"" CEO Fran Horowitz said in a press release.The results are ""generally consistent with the better trends we've seen this holiday season,"" RBC Capital Markets analyst Brian Tunick said in a research note, but added that the return to positive comps are ""worth a mic drop.""Abercrombie also said in its forecast that it expects to take a significant income-tax charge in the fourth quarter, mainly related to the one-time deemed repatriation tax on accumulated foreign earnings following the Trump administration's tax overhaul.The firm also announced on Monday that Executive Chairman Arthur Martinez is to step down on Feb. 3. He will be replaced by lead director Terry Burman, who will assume the role of non-executive chairman.Abercrombie has seen a positive improvement to its Relative Strength Rating compared with December, rising from 92 to 96.Abercrombie & Fitch shares rose 12.3% to 22.37 just before the closing bell on the stock market today, surging to their best levels in more than 16 months.

218,TGT,"The U.S. economy added 228,000 jobs in November, while the unemployment rate held at 4.1%, the Labor Department said on Friday.X Wall Street economists expected a gain of 190,000 jobs and steady 4.1% jobless rate.Average hourly wages rose 5 cents to $26.55 an hour, up 2.5% from a year earlier, which was below the 2.6% Wall Street expected.While Amazon.com (AMZN) planned to add 120,000 seasonal jobs, same as a year ago, and Target (TGT) announced 100,000 seasonal hires, up from 70,000. Although overall seasonal hiring plans were modestly lower overall, Labor Department data showed a 19,000 rise in retail payrolls.Meanwhile, health care added 30,000 jobs, food services and drinking places 19,000, manufacturing 31,000 and construction 24,000.From the broadest perspective, November's report was the strongest in nearly two years. Aggregate weekly payrolls, factoring in total number of hours worked and total pay at private-sector employers, rose 4.8% from a year ago, the best since January 2015.November's jobs report won't alter near-certain expectations for a Federal Reserve rate hike next Wednesday. But it could influence expectations for monetary policy in 2018. Goldman Sachs is among the firms expecting four additional rate hikes next year, but financial markets have been pricing in just two, even though the economy seems to have hit its stride and tax cuts are on the way.Stock futures gained after the report, while the 10-year Treasury yield moved lower.IBD'S TAKE: The bull market won't go on forever, so read IBD's The Big Picture column every day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines. As long as the current ""confirmed uptrend"" — the equivalent of a green light — stays in place, leading stocks breaking above a buy point are more likely than not to have the wind at their backs. Here's a good place to start looking for stocks that may be poised to move higher.With the jobless rate already at a level that Federal Reserve policymakers see as consistent with full employment, wages may be the key number going forward. As annual wage growth perks up to 3%, the Fed will gain confidence that inflation will firm up over time, as employers aim to offset wage hikes by raising prices.In the near term, though, there's a big question about how much pricing power companies have to push through price increases and offset higher wages. Target is a prime example. The retailer announced an increase in its minimum wage to $11 an hour starting October, up from $10, just weeks after announcing broad price cuts on the heels of Whole Foods price cuts when Amazon closed its acquisition of the grocer. Target says it will keep hiking its base wage to $15 an hour over the next three years.Limited pricing power may ramp up pressure on companies to increase productivity growth, and that appears to already be underway, with productivity snapping out of a long slump as growth picked up in the past two quarters.RELATED:Trump Tax Cuts Will Fuel Economic Growth At The Right TimeGOP Mulls 22% Corporate Tax Rate To Offset These 2 Key ChangesThese 4 Big Caps Are Closing On Buy Points: Investing Action PlanStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth Stocks

219,TGT,"China e-commerce leader Alibaba (BABA) is continuing a major push into brick-and-mortar retailing with plans to add 30 supermarkets in Beijing, more than doubling its current store count.X The supermarkets, under the brand name Hema, are part of Alibaba's ""New Retail"" strategy that integrates online e-commerce and brick-and-mortar retailing in an effort to boost sales and convenience. Alibaba launched its Hema supermarkets chain two years ago, of which there are now 25. Five of them are in Beijing.Hema is designed as a chain of digitized physical supermarkets. Users with a Hema app hook up to Alibaba's e-commerce platform and payment system. They can then shop for groceries online and have them delivered or pick them up. Or they can order fresh food and have it prepared by Hema chefs. Further, they can pay for any of it using the Alibaba online payment platform Alipay.The idea is to draw customers deeper into Alibaba's consumer-facing ecosystem. It's a strategy comparable to what e-commerce leader Amazon (AMZN) is doing with its $113.7 billion acquisition of Whole Foods Markets.Alibaba shares climbed 2.7% to close at 190.70 on the stock market today.Amazon also believes the future of retail is a mix of mostly online retail and some offline brick-and-mortar retailing, wrote venture capitalist Gene Munster, in his list of predictions this week.

China-based companies have risen to the international stage and become more appealing to investors,  as China has become increasingly integrated within global marketsAmazon shares were up 0.6%, near 1,217.65.Alibaba has been aggressively expanding investments in physical stores.

The chart action of these top stocks offers an answer.Optimism about Wal-Mart comes from its moves in the e-commerce space. Its 2016 acquisition of Jet.com has bolstered its online capabilities, and a slew of buys in 2017 (ModCloth, Bonobos, Moosejaw, etc.) are helping the megastore to build its indie and fashion cred.This week Wal-Mart made official its rumored plans to bring Lord & Taylor's department store products to Walmart.com, broadening its assortment of products and fashionable apparel.On Wednesday, Target beat Q3 forecasts but said it sees a ""highly competitive"" holiday quarter and predicted Q4 EPS of $1.05-$1.25, below the consensus of $1.27, with same-store sales flat to up 2%.Edward Jones analyst Brian Yarbrough warned Target is facing more competitive pressure from online retailers and Wal-Mart, adding that online sales aren't as profitable for Target vs. its in-stores sales due to shipping costs.RELATED:Wal-Mart Hopes These Enticements Will Steer You Away From AmazonWal-Mart Tests 'In-Fridge Delivery' With Smart Lock Maker AugustWal-Mart Tests Futuristic Online Grocery Pickup KioskTarget May Get Squeezed By Amazon, Wal-Mart; Q4 Profit View Weak

224,TGT,"X Wal-Mart (WMT) next week will begin offering price discounts for 10,000 goods picked up at a store location, expanding to one million items by the end of June. It's the latest evidence that the Dow Jones industrial average component is driving e-commerce innovation under new online chief Marc Lore, leveraging its brick-and-mortar locations vs. Amazon.com (AMZN).Wal-Mart will offer varying discounts, using technology developed by Jet.com, which Lore sold to Wal-Mart last year for $3.3 billion. Heavy but inexpensive items will get bigger price cuts.Online shipping costs, especially the ""last mile"" of delivery to customers, are incredibly expensive. Wal-Mart and other traditional retailers have encouraged in-store pickup, waiving shipping fees. But many customers have preferred to wait for online delivery, with Amazon investing heavily to speed up deliveries and giving Amazon Prime members free two-day shipping. Amazon, with its massive size, gets huge discounts from UPS (UPS) and FedEx (FDX) over even large brick-and-mortar retailers.Now Wal-Mart is giving shoppers a clear incentive to make in-store pickups, turning their brick-and-mortar locations into a virtue.Amazon isn't oblivious to the multichannel threat. It's opened a handful of physical bookstores. It's also testing a grocery store in Seattle that features automated checkout.Amazon reportedly mulled buying Whole Foods Stores (WFM) last year, Bloomberg reported.Wal-Mart shares rose 1 cent to 73.44 in the stock market today. On Tuesday, Wal-Mart rose 0.5% to 73.43, in range from a 72.90 buy point taken on Friday.Amazon slid 0.7% to 896.23 after dipping 0.5% to 902.36 on Tuesday. Amazon is still in range from an 860.96 four-weeks-tight buy point.Wal-Mart's holiday quarter U.S. online sales surged 29%, but the retailer has been even more aggressive in 2017.Earlier this year, Wal-Mart dropped its ShippingPass subscription alternative to Amazon Prime, announcing free two-day shipping for online orders of at $35 or more. Amazon, which had raised its non-Prime free-shipping threshold to $50, brought that back to $35, but with a longer delivery span.Walmart.com shoppers can now set a pickup time to have their groceries loaded into the cars, helping to explain why Amazon is testing its own grocery stores and considering a Whole Foods takeover.Wal-Mart also has continued to make online acquisitions, including niche retailers ModCloth, Moosejaw and Shoebuy. It's also opened an online innovation center.Wal-Mart's in-store pickup discounts could show a path for Target (TGT), Macy's (M) and other traditional retailers to make an omnichannel strategy work. But it's also a threat. Target and others seeking to turn physical locations into giant online lockers may find they have to pass on the shipping savings to customers.Target and many other retailers already are being squeezed by Wal-Mart's renewed push to lower prices generally.Wal-Mart has been a reliable dividend stock, having raised the payout every year since 1974.

225,TGT,"The retail industry is facing an existential crisis — and not while mired in the depths of recession, but as the economy notches its eighth year of expansion.XIn March alone, Sears Holdings (SHLD), the parent of Sears and Kmart stores, said ""substantial doubt"" exists about its survival prospects after losing more than $10 billion over six years and watching sales fall for even longer. Urban Outfitters (URBN) likened the troubled industry to a housing bubble that has popped. And Bloomberg reported that women's apparel chain Bebe Stores (BEBE) plans to close all its 168 stores and go online only. (On Wednesday, it said it will close 21 stores and explore options for the rest.)As retailers take a hard look at the future in the age of Amazon.com (AMZN), investors face a big question of their own: Are retail stocks just flat-out doomed?No analyst interviewed for this story was ready to declare the physical store dead. But retail's wounds still run deep, and there are almost certainly too many stores in the U.S. Many stocks of top chains, while not as low as during the Great Recession, are rolling over into pronounced downtrends. The weak stock action creates short-selling opportunities for investors who believe the worst for retail is yet to come.A Yardeni Research report estimated that online shopping has grown to 29.1% of retail sales of items like general merchandise, apparel and accessories, and furniture — but not autos and fuel. That's up from less than 10% in the late 1990s. Over the same period, department stores' share of sales withered to 12.6% from around 30%.Still, companies that sell things within walls, floors and ceilings still have options in a $4 trillion market.""There's no way Amazon becomes a $4 trillion e-tailer in 10 years,"" said Jeff Roster, vice president of retail strategy at IHL Group. ""That's just not going to happen.""Analysts say physical stores can still be vital in a connected, buy-anywhere, retail-everywhere world, with chains experimenting with new uses for their locations and even e-commerce companies seeing the value of in-store experiences.""There's plenty they can do,"" Roster said of retailers. ""The question is: Will they do it?""Meanwhile, the weight has accumulated on retail stocks. Take Macy's (M), which earlier had been praised for its aggressive efforts to integrate online and in-store operations. The department store's shares have lost more than half their value since July 2015. Earnings and sales have fallen for eight consecutive quarters.L Brands (LB), whose Victoria's Secret brand ought to be more insulated from e-commerce, has seen its stock halved since late 2015. The SPDR Retail ETF (XRT) has fallen some 20% over the past two years.IBD'S TAKE: Retail stocks trending below their declining 200-day moving averages offer shorting opportunities. For example, Macy's is struggling to get back in the 30s, but that would set up yet another test of the 50-day average and a possible short entry. Dillard's has stumbled this year, down as much as 25%, and just got turned away from its 50-day. See if it can hold support at 46.56.As those trends have solidified, Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) CEO Warren Buffett, who prides himself on being a long-term investor, divested almost all his stake in Wal-Mart (WMT) in Q4. He told CNBC in February that ""the online thing is very hard to figure out, you know?""Amazon, Buffett said, was a company ""that's gonna have everybody in their sights. And they've got delighted customers.""""Now, Wal-Mart's pushing forward online themselves and they've got all kinds of strengths,"" he later added. ""But I just decided that I'd look for a little easier game.""For much of the past 60 years, retail was an easier game. The postwar population explosion held consumerism aloft for years, says Doug Stephens, founder and CEO of retail advisory service Retail Prophet. When baby boomers' spending slowed as they reached their 50s, growth in personal credit — spurred by financial deregulation — helped pick up the slack, or at least masked weaker trends, he says.""It allowed a lot of retailers to get away with being pretty average,"" Stephens said. ""The average American aspired to be average. They aspired to the middle-class average lifestyle, and retailers like JCPenney (JCP) and Sears and others were happy to accommodate them by selling average goods and average prices with average experiences.""Then the financial crisis and recession hit. The resulting consumer flight to either luxury or deep discounting hollowed out retail's middle-of-the-road set, he added.That has left the retail industry with too many stores, not enough shoppers, and more bankruptcies. Sports Authority was liquidated last year. Payless ShoeSource filed for bankruptcy on Tuesday and disclosed plans to close 400 stores. Markets are wondering if Sears and JCPenney are next.U.S. retail square footage per capita is more than six times that in Europe or Japan, Urban Outfitters CEO Richard Hayne said in March. Deutsche Bank in February estimated that among the retailers it follows, more than 13,100 stores will have closed during the decade ending this year. The analysis indicated that 6,400-plus locations could still be pruned from those companies' store counts.With more companies clearing out of their store space, malls can try to re-anchor their properties with grocery stores and fill in other spots with restaurants and fitness centers. The anchor stores tend to draw foot traffic, but their long stretches of square footage make those spaces hard to fill, Deutsche Bank analysts say.""Fewer retail stores should translate into a direct decline in the number of viable retail properties, including malls,"" Deutsche Bank analysts Ed Reardon and Simon Mui wrote in February. ""An enclosed mall can quickly reach a 'tipping point' where a decline in foot traffic leads to further closures and rent declines (aka the mall death spiral).""And yet the store persists, with even e-commerce companies recognizing its value. In fact, the physical store is still an efficient way to grab customers, especially as the cost of acquiring them online has gone up, Cowen analyst Oliver Chen said.Nordstrom's (JWN) Trunk Club, an e-commerce site that delivers clothing according to the wearer's tastes, has opened physical stores in recent years. Amazon has opened pop-up stores and plans to launch grocery stores.The pop-up, often backed by heavy online promotion, can also lend brick-and-mortar retailers flexibility and intrigue.""When you start to see a pop-up store by Amazon, that to me validates (the idea) that there is still a place for a brick-and-mortar, touch-and-feel type of retail experience,"" said Tom Caporaso, CEO of Clarus Commerce.Newcomers to the business, particularly in clothing, also found different ways to retail, like using real-time data and greasing their supply chains to respond more quickly to fashion trends, said Peter Dixon, who runs a number of consumer discretionary-focused funds at Fidelity, noting that it was shortsighted for some retailers to blame their problems solely on the rise of e-commerce.""Hiring star merchants to forecast fashion trends 12 months ahead of time and then commit to inventory orders nine months in advance of a season?"" he said. ""It just doesn't seem to work on a consistent basis anymore.""IBD'S TAKE: Other potential shorts include Ralph Lauren, whose stock is bumping up against its 50-day moving average. A decisive move below 75 would dump it at the lowest levels in nearly seven years. And L Brands last touched its 10-week moving average in December. Wait for an attempted rebound to that line before betting on another plunge.What may work, after retailers shrink their real-estate footprint, is a hybrid approach to stores that accommodates online orders and has more attractive floor space.Analysts say vacant stores could be used as warehouses and pickup spots for online orders. Or, in existing stores, a smaller floor space might be used to display merchandise, while a larger back area would serve the e-commerce end.Macy's and Target (TGT) are already considering such a store layout. Target has said 55% of online orders are completed at its stores, potentially strengthening the case for the strategy.Wal-Mart, meanwhile, has tried to stay digitally relevant through acquisitions. The company last year shelled out $3 billion for online discounter Jet.com. In March, Wal-Mart acquired ModCloth, which sells indie-and-retro-leaning women's apparel. Wal-Mart in February also bought online outdoor-gear retailer Moosejaw.Long-term, the ratio of apparel retailers' physical-store and online purchases could reach 50/50, Morningstar analyst Bridget Weishaar says. Along with a bigger focus on e-commerce, analysts stress the importance of shrinking store-counts and using the remaining stores as areas that are more ""experiential.""Several chains are trying different things along those lines, though their ability to replicate such formats on a large scale is questionable:""Specialty stores often know their customers on a personal level more closely than big-box stores do, but retailers like Target, Sears, and Wal-Mart also break up their stores into departments,"" Caporaso said over email. ""They can therefore create experiential services in those areas that target specific subsections of their customer bases.""Stephens, of the Retail Prophet, said stores could apply the pop-up approach to the way they handle in-store experiences, replenishing them several times a year to give consumers a reason to return.Such experiential offerings also speak to one of Amazon's weaknesses, especially as it picks up more merchants.""If you want a white T-shirt, and you search for a white T-shirt, you're going to get thousands of results at all different price points, and no one wants to weed through that,"" Weishaar said.She and others say that retailers that can both build out their online infrastructure and maintain a unique identity are the most likely to weather the current storm of falling sales and fleeing investors.""They'll be fine as long as they have a coolness to them,"" said Ross Gerber, CEO of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth & Investment Management. ""Amazon will never be cool. It's just efficient and easy.""

226,TGT,"XFutures for the Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq 100 signaled modest gains early Monday.Dow component Wal-Mart Stores (WMT) is back in buying range as the world's largest retailer appears to be a rare brick-and-mortar operator holding its ground against e-commerce giant Amazon.com (AMZN). Meanwhile, Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) faces a new issue that could tarnish its brand.The Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite suffered slim losses last week. The Dow industrials and S&P 500 index are once again trading right at their 50-day moving averages.Dow Jones industrial average futures rose about 0.2% vs. fair value. So did S&P 500 index and Nasdaq 100 futures. U.S. crude oil futures extended gains above $52 a barrel, rising 0.5% overnight after last week's 3.2% gain amid America's military strike in Syria.Wal-Mart rose 2.1% to 72.90 in Friday stock market trading, rising to its best level since last September. The Dow industrials stock also retook a 72.58 buy point briefly cleared in late February. That comes as many major retailers, including Macy's (M), Kohl's (KSS) and Target (TGT), have been falling near multiyear lows.IBD'S TAKE: The retail industry is facing an existential crisis, and not in the depths of the recession. Amid brutal competition and a massive shift online, death stalks retail, but hope lives on.Wal-Mart has revitalized its e-commerce efforts, helped by a series of acquisitions, including Jet.com last year. Wal-Mart put Jet.com founder Marc Lore in charge of all its online efforts.Fourth-quarter online sales surged 29%. But Wal-Mart is doing more than holding its own. It's actually forced Amazon to adapt.In late January, Wal-Mart ended its ShippingPass subscription program, its attempt to imitate Amazon Prime. Instead, Wal-Mart announced that it would offer free two-day shipping for online orders of at least $35. Amazon soon cut its non-Prime free shipping to $35, though its deliveries will take five to eight days.Separately, Alphabet's Google denied Labor Department claims of widespread pay disparity between men and women. ""Every year, we do a comprehensive and robust analysis of pay across genders and we have found no gender pay gap,"" Google said in an emailed statement Sunday.A Labor Department official reportedly testified Friday that the government found women being paid less ""pretty much across the entire workforce.""Alphabet has been trying to deal with an uproar from advertisers for their Google YouTube ads being placed against racist or other objectionable videos. Many top advertisers have suspended YouTube spending in recent weeks.Alphabet fell fractionally on Friday to 842.10, closing below its 50-day line for a second straight session.Asian MarketsAsian markets were mixed, with Japan's Nikkei up 0.6% intraday, Hong Kong's Hang Seng flat and China's Shanghai composite off 0.2%.RELATED:Wal-Mart Gives Strong Revenue Guidance As Q4 Online Sales Soar 29%These 3 Banking Giants Kick Off Earnings Season: Investing Action PlanThese 4 Dow Stocks, 3 Big-Name Techs Should Be On Your Trading Radar

227,TGT,"With a common foe in Amazon.com (AMZN), Google and Wal-Mart Stores (WMT) are partnering in online shopping using voice-activated Google Home speakers.By the end of September, Wal-Mart customers will be able to link their store accounts to the  Google Express shopping service and use voice commands to order hundreds of thousands of items for delivery.Google, meanwhile, is dropping its membership fee for its shopping service. The company had charged $10 monthly or $95 annually for Google Express. Google Express already works with Target (TGT), Costco and some other retailers.Amazon has a big lead over Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL) in voice activated devices while Wal-Mart is playing catch-up in e-commerce. IBD'S TAKE: Amazon -- along with Grubhub, Arista Networks and Netflix -- is on IBD's Leaderboard, which follows top stocks from their work on forming bases, through their breakouts, to their post-breakout action, up to the point where they start topping.Amazon has sold 10.7 million Amazon Echo devices since it began shipping in June 2015.  A report from eMarketer estimates that Amazon has about 70% of the market for voice-activated speaker systems, followed by Google Home at 24%.Voice-activated search is viewed as one of the primary threats to Google's internet dominance. RELATED:Is Winter Coming For Amazon Shareholders Amid Big Investments?Wal-Mart Q2 Earnings Top, Online Sales Jump 60%, But Guidance WeakIt's Like Wal-Mart Is On A Quest To Get Every Hipster In Brooklyn

232,TGT,"Federal Reserve policymakers convinced that low unemployment will feed through to higher wage gains will take comfort from Monday's big announcement that Target (TGT) will hike its minimum wage from $10 an hour to $11 next month, reaching $15 by 2020.Target seems to be proving the Fed hawks right: The retailer's move is, first and foremost, a bid to limit employee turnover and attract 100,000 seasonal workers in a tight labor market. It follows last month's Amazon.com (AMZN) jobs day, recruiting 50,000 people to work for $12 an hour or more, which attracted huge crowds of people.By telegraphing wage hikes for the next few years, Target is making a long-term bet that by becoming an employer of choice, it will make both employees and customers happy and allow it to thrive — not just survive — amid a battle for domination between Wal-Mart (WMT) and Amazon.Target's impact on the labor market is significant, with its 330,000 employees, though it doesn't approach that of Wal-Mart, whose base wage hike to $10 an hour last spring led Target, Costco (COST) and a host of other retailers to respond with wage hikes. ""I think it will be a game where other retailers are going to have to match,"" Edward Jones analyst Brian Yarbrough told Minnesota Public Radio. ""Now you're going to have wage pressure for the next several years.""IBD'S TAKE: Try out premium IBD features for free through Oct. 8. Popular features include exclusive stock lists, IBD Stock Checkup, which ranks the leaders in 197 industry groups based on earnings, sales, margins and stock performance; and The Big Picture daily update of the underlying market trend. On Aug. 22, IBD shifted its market trend gauge to ""confirmed uptrend"" from ""uptrend under pressure,"" the equivalent of a flashing yellow light turning green.  The big question for the Fed is whether better wage gains will necessarily lead to higher inflation. The answer: Probably not any time soon. Just ask Target, which announced three weeks ago that it was cutting prices on thousands of items. That came shortly after Amazon celebrated the close of its Whole Foods acquisition by cutting the upscale natural foods grocer's prices as much as 43% on items like avocados and kale.Higher wages may not feed through to higher prices in the near-term especially when a few huge companies have significant market power and incentives to put market share over profit. Amazon has been rewarded with a massive valuation because of sales growth and the growing reach of its Prime membership, even as profits have disappointed.Internet-enabled price transparency also keeps a lid on prices, and that's not just true of retail. Marriott International (MAR) CEO Arne Sorenson explained last month that the hotel group doesn't have as much ability to raise prices as it had in past cycles. While home-sharing via Airbnb has some impact on leisure travelers and business travel is pretty good, not great, he sees the bigger issue as ""radical transparency in pricing.""""It's not particularly focused on home sharing or the disrupters in the space,"" Sorenson said on an earnings call. ""It's much more about just the ubiquity of information. And I think with each passing year, it becomes simpler and simpler to know the rates at every single hotel.""Yarbrough notes that Wal-Mart saw better employee retention and higher sales after its wage hikes, but the higher sales weren't enough to offset the extra costs. While Wal-Mart obviously has the financial strength to hike wages, the question is whether retail-sector laggards will be able to follow suit. If not, will the inability to hang onto quality workers hasten their demise?At some point, the strong retailers that emerge from this hypercompetitive period may be able to raise prices, but who knows when?Federal Reserve chief Janet Yellen, in a Tuesday afternoon speech, conceded that structural shifts may be affecting price rises, but still says that recent low inflation is ""probably temporary."" But she stressed that it would be imprudent to wait until inflation hits 2% before tightening.RELATED:Target Lifts Minimum Wage To $11 Per Hour, Aims For $15 By 2020The Fed Doubles Down: Reverses QE, Keeps Hawkish TiltHere's What Is Eating At Inflation — And The Fed's ConsensusStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth Stocks

233,TGT,"Couch potato's dream or privacy nut's nightmare?Wal-Mart (WMT) said Friday that it's testing something it calls ""in-fridge delivery"" with smart lock maker August, in which shoppers can order items from Walmart.com and give a Deliv driver access to their home, so that groceries can be put in the refrigerator. August's smart-home technology provides shoppers the ability to watch the delivery unfold in real time from their phones via home security cameras.XCertain August customers in Silicon Valley are testing the concept, said Wal-Mart in a corporate blog post. The service doesn't just apply to groceries — orders can be placed in shoppers' homes or garages, if needed — but appears aimed primarily at those who want fresh food not only delivered but stored properly while they're not at home, so that their groceries are ""nice and cool in the fridge, as if they never left their display in the store.""Wal-Mart acknowledged that the service ""may not be for everyone,"" but that it is part of a ""natural evolution"" for the company.""What might seem novel today could be the standard tomorrow,"" it said.IBD'S TAKE: Read IBD's The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.The move comes amid a price war with Amazon (AMZN) and Target (TGT), one that has seen Wal-Mart and Amazon continually slash shipping prices for online orders.

234,TGT,"Stocks wrapped up Wednesday's session with slender gains, leaving the Dow and the S&P 500 tracking toward their fifth straight weekly advance.XMinutes from the September FOMC meeting released midafternoon had little impact on trade, but investors responded strongly to analyst actions and earnings news, as well as the small number of early third quarter earnings reports.The Dow Jones industrial average managed to scratch off a new closing high, rising 0.2% as Wal-Mart (WMT) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) each soared to gains of better than 2%.The Nasdaq Composite ticked up 0.3%, also to a new closing high, as PayPal (PYPL), Liberty Global (LBTYK) and Dollar Tree (DLTR) headed the Nasdaq 100. Apple (AAPL) rose 0.4% and Alphabet (GOOGL) led the FANG stocks, jumping 1.8% after Credit Suisse boosted is price target on the stock to 1350, from 1100.

Unlike some other designer collaborations, this collection is not a limited-time-only offering; it will last ""multiple years.""Creating exclusivity has mounted in importance for retailers looking to set themselves apart from one another — and from Amazon (AMZN) — and build loyalty among customers. (Amazon, incidentally, has a slew of its own private-label brands.)""In a retail environment where differentiation has never been more important, we're doubling down and introducing more than a dozen new brands to provide guests with even more reasons to choose Target,"" said Target's merchandising head, Mark Tritton, in the corporate blog post Wednesday.Shares of Target rose 2.8% to 59.52 in the stock market today, closing just below the 200-day moving average after crossing above that support level for the first time since Jan. 4. Target slashed prices on ""thousands"" of items last week, sending shares downward and taking Wal-Mart (WMT) and Costco (COST) with it.IBD'S TAKE: Buying or holding a stock can be risky heading into an earnings report. Here's an earnings options strategy that can help you cash in on post-earnings stock gains, while minimizing the risk from a weak quarter.Women's apparel collection A New Day and menswear line Goodfellow recently hit Target shelves, and midcentury modern home-furnishings line Project 62 is slated to debut next week.Obvious Foods, Universal Thread Goods, United Thread, Blue & Other and Opalhouse are a few of the other trademarks that have been filed by Target in recent months.RELATED:EXCLUSIVE: Will These Trademarks Be Target's New Private-Label Brands?Target Cheerfully Slashes 'Thousands' Of Prices — And Investors FretRetail And E-Commerce News And Stocks To Watch

236,TGT,"Consumer prices rose 0.4% in August and 1.9% from a year ago, lifted by a rise in energy prices, the Labor Department reported on Thursday.The core consumer price index, excluding food and energy, rose 0.2%, while the annual rate of inflation held at 1.7%.XWall Street expected the headline CPI to rise 0.3% on the month and 1.9% from a year ago, with the core CPI up 0.2% and 1.6%.The monthly gain was the biggest since January.The 10-year Treasury yield continued to rebound higher before the CPI release, then added to the gain after the report. Futures for the s&P 500 index, Nasdaq 100 and Dow industrials retreated on the stock market today after trading little changed before the 8:30 a.m. ET inflation data.Investors may see Federal Reserve interest rate hikes as somewhat more likely sooner, though that no change is expected in the near term. The Fed is seen beginning to curb its massive balance sheet at next week's policy meeting.Food at home prices fell 0.2% on the month, which saw Amazon.com (AMZN) complete its Whole Foods Markets acquisition and immediately cut prices on items like kale and avocados by up to 43%. It's not clear if the Bureau of Labor Statistics picked up those price cuts that didn't hit until Aug. 28. Target (TGT) followed last week by announcing it's own plan to slash prices. Prices for food away from home rose 0.3%.Higher energy prices, even before Hurricane Harvey disrupted gasoline output, fueled the overall CPI gain, rising 2.8%.IBD'S TAKE: IBD readers were ready for the stock market's push to record heights this month. On Aug. 22, IBD shifted its market trend gauge to ""confirmed uptrend"" from ""uptrend under pressure,"" the equivalent of a flashing yellow light turning green. Read IBD's The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.Inflation readings remain well below the Federal Reserve's target amid competitive pressures in a broad range of industries.CVS Health (CVS) said last month that it saw flat same-store prescription volumes in the second quarter, but pharmacy same-store sales fell 2.8%, dragged down by recent generic introductions.While drug pricing moderation from generic competition often comes in waves, this wave is likely to be more sustained amid the FDA's new plan to expedite review of generic drug applications.""We're already seeing results, as May and June of this year have seen the most generic drug approvals since the FDA began tallying its monthly approvals,"" CVS CEO Larry Merlo said on an August 8 conference call.Marriott International (MAR) CEO Arne Sorenson explained on an earnings call last month that the hotel group doesn't have as much ability to raise prices as it had in past cycles. While home-sharing via Airbnb has some impact on leisure travelers and business travel is pretty good, not great, he sees the bigger issue as ""radical transparency in pricing.""""It's not particularly focused on home sharing or the disrupters in the space,"" Sorenson said. ""It's much more about just the ubiquity of information. And I think with each passing year, it becomes simpler and simpler to know the rates at every single hotel.""After two years of resisting price increases, Wendy's (WEN) said it raised prices a slim 1% this spring quarter, even as it faces 4% wage inflation and higher commodity costs. Even with the price increase, margins at company-operated restaurants fell to 19.6% in the second quarter from 21.9% a year ago.""Our biggest competitor is food at home,"" said CEO Todd Penegor, which helps explain why Wendy's has remained so conservative on pricing.RELATED:Stock Futures Weak After Data; Big Techs DragAmazon The Inflation Killer Will Lower Grocery Prices With Whole FoodsThe Amazon Monopoly Problem: Prime Time For Antitrust ActionStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth StocksFlood Warning: Federal Reserve, Treasury Both Set To Unload Debt

237,TGT,"Vantiv (VNTV) will reap benefits in 2018 from its acquisition of U.K.-based Worldpay Group, one analyst said Thursday as he upgraded the credit-card and payment-processing company to buy.X Ramsey El-Assal, a Jefferies analyst, set a price target of 94 on Vantiv stock. Shares in Vantiv climbed 1.8% to close at 74.88 on the stock market today. Vantiv is up 23% in 2017, trading just above a buy point of 73.24 and has been consolidating.""The Worldpay merger should drive multiple expansion as the deal adds high-growth digital revenue to Vantiv's mix"" El-Assal said in a note to clients. ""We view synergy guidance as conservative and see upside from tax reform.""Vantiv generates the bulk of its revenue from fees associated with payment-processing services for merchants. Among its national retailer clients are Wal-Mart Stores (WMT), Target (TGT) and Macy's (M)""Worldpay finally puts Vantiv into non-U.S. markets, bringing additional revenue diversification,"" added El-Assal.IBD'S TAKE: Read IBD's The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.Josh Beck, a Keybanc Capital Markets analyst, called Vantiv and PayPal Holdings (PYPL) the most attractive payment stocks in 2018.""Vantiv is a key idea as we see room for cost synergies to come in ahead of expectations and also expect the company to plant seeds to possibly win substantial new U.S. e-commerce clients,"" Beck said in his note to clients.RELATED:Why You Could Soon Have Your Chance To Get In On High-Flying PayPalPayPal Bolsters Acquisition War Chest With This MoveAI News: Artificial Intelligence Trends And Leading Stocks

238,TGT,"Target (TGT) sees a ""highly competitive"" holiday quarter and gave weak earnings guidance Wednesday, as an analyst warned it may get squeezed further by rivals like Amazon (AMZN) and Wal-Mart (WMT).XThe big-box retailer's earnings per share fell 12.5% to 91 cents, but beat by a nickel, as revenue rose 1.4% to $16.67 billion, better than forecasts for $16.61 billion.Same-store sales rose 0.9%, more than double estimates for a 0.4% gain. Comparable traffic grew 1.4%, and comparable digital sales jumped 24%.But Target expects Q4 EPS of $1.05-$1.25, below the consensus of $1.27, with same-store sales flat to up 2%.""While we expect the fourth-quarter environment to be highly competitive, we are very confident in our holiday season plans,"" said Chairman and CEO Brian Cornell in a statement.Edward Jones analyst Brian Yarbrough warned Target is facing more competitive pressure from online retailers and Wal-Mart, adding that online sales aren't as profitable for Target vs. its in-stores sales due to shipping costs.""We believe both of these competitive issues will pressure profit margins and thus limit earnings growth moving forward,"" Yarbrough wrote in a note.Shares tumbled 10% to close at 54.16 on the stock market today, diving below their 50- and 200-day averages. Wal-Mart, which reports Thursday, fell 1.4%.IBD'S TAKE: With thousands of publicly traded companies to choose from, how can you quickly find the best stocks to buy right now? A good starting point is to regularly review screens that highlight the top-rated equities.Target appears to be lagging behind Amazon's e-commerce muscle and Wal-Mart's online strategy that has included acquiring small online shops and Jet.com, as well as allotting space on its site for Lord & Taylor's higher end offerings.As Target sticks closely to its ""signature"" categories in the home, apparel, baby and wellness space, much of its success has been found in its private label brands, including kids apparel line Cat & Jack, which raked in $2 billion in its first year on the market.Another headwind against Target's earnings are the investments it has been making in such private label brands as well as logistics, wage hikes and store remodeling.""These investments are absolutely essential for Target's long-term growth and viability but are a short term drag on the retailer's bottom line,"" analyst Ken Perkins at Retail Metrics wrote.Meanwhile, as retailers get ready for the crucial shopping season, Target is offering free shipping of its roughly 1,700 ""curated"" gift selections available for under $15.Wal-Mart said early this month that the number of stores offering its online grocery pickup service have doubled since last year's holiday season.The company also noted that this is the first holiday season when shoppers can get free two-day shipping without a membership fee on $35-plus orders for more than 2 million items.RELATED:Cisco, Tencent, NetApp, NetEase And Target Lead Investing Action PlanHow Private Labels Could Be Amazon, Target's Next Cash CowRetail And E-Commerce News And Stocks To WatchTJX, Dick's Sporting Goods Sink; Advance Auto Parts Soars On Q3

239,TGT,"Stocks remained broadly lower Wednesday afternoon, while new woes for Target (TGT) contributed to some weakness in the retail sector.XThe Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 fell 0.3%, while the Dow Jones industrial average dropped 0.4%. Indexes, however, pared losses after hitting session lows in the initial minutes of trading. The main indexes have had a tendency to close high in their daily price ranges in the past few weeks.Dow component General Electric (GE) rose nearly 2% as it struggles to recover from two days of severe selling that followed the company's restructuring blueprint. In a more noteworthy move, JPMorgan Chase (JPM) rose as it found support at the 50-day moving average.The small-cap Russell 2000 was off 0.2%. The index remains below the 50-day moving average.Volume was tracking higher on the Nasdaq and lower on the NYSE compared with the same time Tuesday. Breadth was weak, with losers over winners by a 3-2 ratio on the NYSE and by 9-to-7 on the Nasdaq.Discount retailers were the worst-performing industry group after Target gapped down more than 8% in huge volume, falling below the long-term 200-day moving average. The company beat quarterly expectations but warned of a ""highly competitive"" holiday quarter.Apparel, auto and mail-order retailers were higher, however.Semiconductor, chemical, trucking, building and energy industry groups were among the weakest in today's trading.Kulicke & Soffa (KLIC) tumbled nearly 9% in heavy volume, trimming much of Tuesday's 20% post-earnings gap-up. The semiconductor equipment supplier remains extended from a 23.10 buy point of a breakout Nov. 6.Investment firm Blackstone Group (BX) fell nearly 2% but trimmed an earlier loss of more than 5%. The stock, seeing some of the highest relative volume today, has already triggered the 7%-8% sell rule after a breakout from a 33.93 buy point on Oct. 19 failed.RELATED:Target May Get Squeezed By Amazon, Wal-Mart; Q4 Profit View Weak

240,TGT,"Stocks dove lower at Wednesday's open, with a sell-off in Asia and mixed U.S. earnings news helping to propel early declines.XThe Dow Jones industrial average shed 0.5%, with Wal-Mart (WMT), Goldman Sachs (GS) and JPMorgan (JPM) opening at the bottom of the index.The S&P 500 also dropped 0.5%, while the Nasdaq Composite dug in 0.7%, as Apple (AAPL) and Tesla (TSLA) each posted early declines of more than 1%.Markets in China and Japan tumbled in broad-based selling Wednesday, with Hong Kong's Hang Seng index down 1% and Tokyo's Nikkei 225 faltering 1.6%. The latter pointed the Nikkei toward its first weekly loss since the first week of September. The benchmark gained 23.1% from Sept. 8 through an intraday high on Tuesday.The selling carried over into European trade, where Frankfurt's DAX dived 1.1%, while the CAC-40 in Paris slumped 0.7% and London's FTSE 100 was down 0.5% during their afternoon sessions.Blackstone Group (BX) President and Chief Executive Hamilton James told Politico that stocks have built in some expectation for tax cuts included in the federal tax package heading toward a vote in the House on Thursday. But he called a potential failure of the effort a ""modest negative"" for the market: ""I don't think it's a huge driver for the market. I don't think the market is going to tank by any means."" Blackstone shares traded down 4% in early action.Wal-Mart led the Dow's declines, feeling some early pull following Target's (TGT) third-quarter report. Target opened 9% lower after reporting a smaller-than-expected third-quarter earnings decline and revenue growth in line with analyst forecasts. But management warned of a ""highly competitive"" holiday season. Shares ended up 15% from a June low, attempting to climb out of an 18-month consolidation.Apple posted an early 1.5% loss, possibly due to quarterly results reported in Taiwan Wednesday by Hon Hai Precision, also known as FoxConn, which assembles Apple's iPhones and other products. Hon Hai earnings fell 39%, almost to half of analyst expectations, largely owing to iPhone X production problems.The decline put Apple's shares less than 5% above the 160.97 buy point cleared on OCt. 27. Investors may want to review rules for stocks that give up gains above buy points. Oil-related names posted some of the S&P 500's biggest early declines, as oil prices backed off 1% and threatened a second day of declines. Drilling contractors Ensco (ESV), Transocean (RIG) and Diamond Offshore (DO) all dropped more than 4%.Sorl Auto Parts (SORL) rocketed 36% higher after reporting a 159% earnings gain and a 59% advance in revenue for its third quarter. The move follows Tuesday's 16% gain by rival Advanced Auto Parts (AAP), following its third-quarter results. Advanced Auto dipped 2% at the open.Car lot operator CarGurus (CARG) drove ahead 7% in opening trade after reporting a 56% sales gain and earnings of two cents a share in its third quarter, and raising its fourth-quarter revenue guidance above consensus views. The new issue ended Tuesday 86% above its October 12 IPO price.IBD 50 stock YY (YY) swung up 7%, as Jefferies upgraded shares to buy from hold. YY reported a healthy third-quarter beat late Tuesday. The gain put the stock in a buy range, on a rebound from support at its 10-week moving average.Consumer price data were mixed for October, with the Labor Department putting its Consumer Price Index up 0.1%, for the month — down from September's 0.5% gain, but in line with estimates. Core prices, minus energy and food, rose 0.2%, above the prior month's 0.1% gain and also in line with forecasts.Manufacturing growth slowed sharply in November, leaving the New York Federal Reserve's Empire State Manufacturing Survey at 19.4 for the month. That was down from the unexpected spike to 30.2 in October, and well below expectations for a more mild slowdown, to a reading of 26.Retail sales also slowed, edging up just 0.2% in October, according to Commerce Department estimates. That was still better than the downshift to a 0.1% gain expected by economists. Sales had jumped 1.9% in September. Minus auto sales and gas, sales rose 0.3%, just below projections for a 0.4% advance.September business inventories estimates, also from the Commerce Department, arrive at 10 a.m. ET, followed by the Energy Information Administration's weekly oil stockpiles report at 10:30 a.m. ET.Cisco Systems (CSCO) and Sally Beauty (SBH) are among the few companies scheduled to report after today's close.RELATED:The Big Picture: Stocks Fall Modestly As A Few Warnings Lights AppearThese 5 Key Earnings Are On Tap: Investing Action PlanIt Just Took 10 Days For This Stock To Trigger A Rare Hold RuleTrump Is Close To Big Wins On Tax Cuts And ObamaCare

241,TGT,"The IBD/TIPP Economic Optimism Index rose 3.3 points to an eight-month high of 53.6 in November, remaining in optimistic territory for a 14th straight month, but high-earning households stood out as the only group feeling particularly bullish.XAmong households earning more than $75,000, IBD/TIPP's optimism gauge jumped 4.6 points in November to 56.6, firmly above the neutral level of 50. By contrast, households earning less than $30,000 and those with earnings from $50,000 to $75,000 both reflected slight pessimism at 49.5. Modest optimism prevailed among those earning between $30,000 and $50,000, with a 51.3 reading.A surging stock market, a strong job market that has seen unemployment sink to a 17-year low of 4.1%, and Washington's shift to tax cuts from ObamaCare subsidy cuts have all buoyed optimism, but especially among higher earners.The lack of more widespread optimism probably reflects a combination of political division and a prolonged period of tepid wage growth. Still, there's some evidence that wages are perking up, especially among modest-wage earners.Target (TGT) just hiked its minimum wage to $11 from $10 an hour, with a commitment to hit $15 in 2020. Amazon.com (AMZN) has put pressure on other employer to raise wages with its hiring binge, including a one-day spree in August in which it aimed to hire 50,000 people at $12 an hour or more.IBD'S TAKE: The Dow Jones industrial average closed near 23,550 on Monday, up 1,650 points since IBD changed its market trend indicator on Aug. 22 to ""confirmed uptrend"" from ""uptrend under pressure,"" the equivalent of a yellow light turning green.

243,TGT,"Almost as soon as Pepsi (PEP) released its ""Jump In"" ad celebrating protest marches, protesters angrily complained that the ad was making light of protests — specifically Black Lives Matter protests — forcing Pepsi to pull the ad and apologize.Pundits immediately blamed the lack of racial diversity on Madison Ave., but it's more likely that the fiasco was the result of a lack of ideological diversity.In the 2-plus minute ad, model Kendall Jenner is in the middle of a photo shoot when a perfectly diverse group of marchers comes by carrying signs with peace symbols or messages like ""join the conversation,"" and dancing to a song with lyrics like ""We are the movement, this generation/You better know who we are, who we are.""At one point, Jenner is encouraged to join the march, and does so by dramatically pulling off her blonde wig and wiping off her lipstick, and somehow changing from a slinky dress into a T-shirt and stylish jeans, where she proceeds to hand a can of Pepsi to a cop, which elicits cheers from everyone. (You can see the ad for yourself on YouTube.)Pepsi issued a mea culpa after pulling the ad, saying it was just ""trying to project a global message of unity, peace and understanding"" — although the ad was clearly meant to pull at liberal heartstrings of those upset about a certain person being president.In a New York Times piece, advertising copywriter Nathaniel Friedman comments that ""One of the most frequent observations about 'Jump In' is that it rang so hollow that it's amazing no one involved in its creation anticipated this blowback. That's less surprising when you realize that minorities are underrepresented in advertising. For example, one report found that only 5.3% of managers and professionals at agencies in 2008 were black.""Of course, Neither Friedman nor anyone else making this observation knows the racial makeup of the people who put together and approved the Pepsi ad. But we'd bet there were more blacks involved than conservatives.Had there been even one nonliberal in the room, the ad probably never would have seen the light of day, because conservatives would have warned Pepsi that trying to overtly appeal to liberals — as this ad so clumsily does — almost always backfires, either infuriating liberals themselves or fueling endless calls for more appeasement.As the National Center for Public Policy Research's Justin Danhof once noted: ""Corporations that cave to the left only place a bigger target on their backs.""Some examples to show that Danhof has it right:In fact, a Fortune survey found that Wal-Mart is the company liberals say is the worst one for American and that they would most like to shut down.Making overt left-wing appeals not only tends to backfire with its target audience, it can easily antagonize those who aren't liberal. When Target (TGT) decided to change its bathroom policy to please the LGBT crowd, its sales tanked.After Kellogg (K) pulled its ads from Breitbart in November because it wasn't in line with the cereal maker's ""values,"" Breitbart mounted a boycott, which Kellogg said had no impact, although its stock price underperformed its main competitors for months after. Plus, weeks after pulling its ads, Amnesty International released a report saying that Kellogg, along with other food companies, had been getting palm oil from plantations ""where there are severe labor rights abuses,"" such as the use of child labor. Values, anyone?Corporate executives would do well to remember that — like tic-tac-toe and global thermonuclear war — the only way to win at the political appeasement game is not to play at all.RELATED:Corporate Execs Play Politics At Their Company's PerilWhy Are 'Progressives' Fighting Against Uber and Airbnb?Liberal Attacks On Restaurant Giants Punish Minority-Owned Franchises

244,TGT,"Department stores such as Macy's (M), J.C. Penney (JCP) and Kohl's (KSS) sold off Monday on little news, as investors continue to lower their prospects for traditional retailers as shoppers increasingly shift to Amazon.com (AMZN) and other e-commerce sites.Macy's fell 3.8% to 29.37 on the stock market today, trading at its lowest levels since early February, when takeover buzz began.Kohl's sank 4.8% to 38.56, setting a seven-month low intraday.J.C. Penney retreated 2.3% to 5.85, hitting a five-year low. Regional department store operator Dillard's tumbled 4.5% to 49.79, also hitting its worst levels since early 2012.IBD's Retail-Department Store group, rated dead last out of the 197 industries that IBD tracks, was the biggest losers in Monday's session. Macy's and Kohl's were among the very worst performers on the S&P 500 index Monday.Department stores are working hard to try to be viable, emphasizing their online presence. But Amazon is grabbing a huge share of online sales growth and boasts bigger shipping discounts than even major retailers. Brick-and-mortar chains hope to better-leverage physical stores for online pickups and returns. But at the same time they are slashing their store count. That lowers costs, but calls into question the very omnichannel model they are trying to use to battle Amazon.IBD'S TAKE: Despite their brick-and-mortar woes, traditional retailers are seeing big online sales gains, but from very low levels.Target (TGT) fell intraday to a five-year low, though the retailer closed up 8 cents to 54.37. Target has been lumped in with department stores, especially after its weak Q4 earnings report and guidance.Amazon, for its part, rose 0.55% to 856.99. Amazon is still in buy range from an 821.75 entry and is setting up in a four-weeks-tight pattern with an 860.76 buy point.As for other retailers, Wal-Mart (WMT) isn't doing as badly as some of its rivals. Wal-Mart saw sharp online sales growth over the holidays, with U.S. same-store sales rising. Wal-Mart is re-emphasizing lower prices, a push that's squeezing everyone from Macy's to Target to grocers such as Kroger (KR).Wal-Mart shares closed up 0.1% to 59.98 Monday. But Wal-Mart stock is below its 200-day line and its relative strength line shows the retail giant is an S&P 500 laggard.Off-price retailers such as TJX (TJX) and Burlington Stores (BURL) are near highs, but they too retreated Monday, down 1.3% and 2%, respectively.RELATED:Macy's, Costco, Kohl's And Other Retailers Are Getting SlammedRetailers Face 2017 'Reckoning,' More 'Sad Malls' As Amazon Keeps BoomingTarget Dives To 2014 Levels: 'We're Slow And Have Too Much Inventory'J.C.

245,TGT,"Stocks bucked up from a weak start to end on solid ground Thursday, as economic data and oil prices drove some of the day's widest gains.The Dow Jones industrial average, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite all ended up 0.3%, a solid finish after all three indexes traded flat-to-lower for the first 15 minutes of the day. Preliminary data showed volume mixed, higher on the Nasdaq, lower on the NYSE, vs. action on Wednesday.Bank and financial groups comprised seven of the 10 largest gains among industry groups, buoyed by the Commerce Department's revision of its fourth-quarter GDP estimate, to 2.1% growth, up from 1.9%. Foreign banks and gold miners were two of the five worst industry declines on the stock market today.A half-dozen stocks on the Dow industrials clocked gains of better than 1%. Exxon Mobil (XOM) topped the group, rising 1.8%, aided by a second straight 2% gain in oil prices that sent West Texas Intermediate prices back above $50 per barrel.Nike (NKE) was the only Dow Jones industrial average play that dropped more than 1%.ConocoPhillips (COP) led the S&P 500 with a 9% advance. The Houston-based energy producer announced Wednesday plans to sell its Canada tar sands assets to Calgary-based Cenovus Energy (CVE) for $13.3 billion. The move earned Conoco an upgrade to buy, from hold, along with an 8% price target increase from UBS. Cenovus shares dived 13%.Akamai Technologies (AKAM) slumped 4% in big trade. The network solutions leaders said late Wednesday that it would acquire software startup Soasta for an undisclosed cost. Soasta reportedly counts Apple (AAPL), Target (TGT) and Nordstrom (JWN) among the customers for its performance testing and analytics program CloudTest. The loss sent Akamai to a test of support at its 40-week line.IBD 50 stock Momo (MOMO) hammered out a 5% gain, sending shares to new highs and up more than 7% for the week. Shares are up 49% since clearing a 23.96 cup-with-handle buy point in February.Also taking out new highs among IBD 50 stocks was Commscope Holding (COMM). The provider of telecom connectivity services bumped up 3% in above-average trade.

Sales rose nearly 25% to $1.581 billion. It was the second straight quarter of accelerating profit and revenue growth. Same-store sales surged 16.6% as e-commerce sales surged 63% to $154.9 million.Outlook: Ulta Beauty sees Q1 EPS of $1.75-$1.80 and sales of $1.244 billion to $1.265 billion. Analyst had expected EPS of $1.80 on revenue of $1.27125 billion. Ulta sees Q1 comps, including e-commerce, up 9%-11%.Stock: Ulta fell nearly 5% to 260.49 in after-hours trading, suggesting the stock will tumble below its 50-day line at Friday's open.

247,TGT,"Target (TGT) last month launched four private-label brands — A New Day, Goodfellow, JoyLab and Project 62 — as the big-box retailer aims to boost sales amid an increasingly harsh retail environment.XAhead of the discounter's earnings report Wednesday morning, a look at some of Target's recent trademark filings offers hints about what exclusive brands might come next.Not long after telling the Wall Street Journal that house brands Merona and Mossimo will be no more, Target on Aug. 2 filed for about nine trademarks related to the phrase ""Universal Thread"" or ""Universal Thread Goods Co.,"" which encompasses bags, casual wear, outerwear, sleepwear and other apparel categories and bears a bohemian cursive logo.Similar name, but different category. United Thread applies to ""personal care kits containing women's grooming products."" For some reason, it also applies to candles.This used to be Target's Good & Gather brand, according to a Star Tribune story from April, after a stint in the company's Techstars accelerator program. Last September, Target said Obvious was ""re-imaging lunches for kids."" The latest filings, from May, refer to packaged meals that include healthful-looking ingredients such as fish, trail mix, nut butters, quinoa and the like.This filing from January refers to ""wood preservatives and stains; paints,"" as well as potpourri, soap, lotions — and oddly enough, digital scales, measuring spoons and cups, and Christmas decorations.The little double-H-in-a-house logo probably means, if this brand comes to shelves, that consumers might expect Hearth & Hand to supply home decor reminiscent of a cozy log cabin in December. (Maybe? Who knows.)The ""Name & Name"" naming convention is a strong trend among youthful brands, so why stop now? Blue & Other, like Universal Threads, also encompasses bags and clothes.These two, filed separately and together, are fairly wide-ranging in their targets: home decor, kitchenware, cutlery, lighting fixtures, clocks, jewelry boxes and stationery.The slew of new private labels — there are supposed to be over a dozen, overall — are part of Target's strategy to drive fresh revenue its way. All of those brands will be members of the retailer's well-performing ""signature categories,"" which include style, wellness, baby and kids products.Sales of its Cat & Jack kids apparel brand, which replaced the old Cherokee and Circo lines, has surpassed sales of the latter two brands combined, according to the Journal.Target management said in its May earnings call that in the months after the launch of Cat & Jack, spending on children's clothes at Target climbed more than 50%. Cat & Jack became a $2 billion brand in its first year, said Product Design & Development SVP Julie Guggemos on Sunday.That's nothing to sneeze at: Home and apparel sales make up about $26 billion — more than a third — of Target's revenue, according to the company. Kids home collection Pillowfort and nursery line Cloud Island are two of its other recently launched exclusive brands.Target isn't alone in its investment into private-label goods. Quartz's dive into the USPTO site recently uncovered over two dozen trademarks affiliated with Amazon (AMZN), including its existing Lark & Ro women's apparel brand and Mama Bear baby products.Amazon, of course, has been projected to surpass Macy's (M) as the nation's largest apparel retailer this year.Target did not immediately respond to a request for comment regarding its unreleased private-label brands.RELATED:Cisco, Target To Report; 2 Others In Or Near Buy Zones: Investing Action PlanRetail And E-Commerce News And Stocks To Watch5 Things Wal-Mart Is Doing Right As Amazon Threatens: Goldman

248,TGT,"In a season of disastrous hurricanes, beleaguered credit bureau Equifax (EFX) is in the volatile eye of a storm of angry consumers and investors. The credit reporting company has been hit by more than 30 lawsuits in the U.S., according to Reuters news service, including at least one suit accusing the company of securities fraud. And it appears to have backed off one maneuver that inflamed consumer ire.XThe suits stem from the massive theft of personal identification information from Equifax that the firm disclosed last week. The data breach took place from mid-May through July, Equifax said.Are you mad enough at Equifax to wonder how to start or join a lawsuit? Think you might feel that way if you discover that someone has bought, say, a new television and charged it to your name and address? And you begin to suspect the cyber crook got his information about you from Equifax?You can either start your own suit or join someone else who has already done so. If you do an online search for phrases like ""Equifax lawsuit how to join,"" you'll find news reports of people and lawyers who've already taken action. After a few more search steps, you'll have lawyers' contact information and you can reach out.You can also ask your own lawyer to recommend an appropriate counsel.One thing you can bet on is that multiple lawsuits will be filed independently of each other. ""The class action lawyer who represents the biggest damaged person or the biggest sheer number of victims will likely be appointed class counsel,"" said Chicago securities fraud lawyer Andrew Stoltmann. ""Eventually all will be consolidated into one (case).""Once someone is appointed class counsel, that lawyer in discovery gets to ask Equifax for the names and contact information of the people whose data was stolen from the credit reporting service. That pilferage involved information for as many as 143 million U.S. consumers, the firm says.The class-action counsel can then contact those people and invite them to join the suit.A class-action lawsuit will likely take three to six years, Stoltmann says.IBD'S TAKE: For advice about how to protect yourself from being victimized by identity thieves, read this IBD report about how to take real-world, practical steps to safeguard yourself and your personal identification information.In the first days after Equifax disclosed the data hack, people on social-media sites accused Equifax of not only endangering the financial health and peace of mind of millions of Americans, but also of forcing them to waive their right to sue the company if they wanted to find out from Equifax if their data had been among the information stolen. Critics said that the waiver came about when people logged in to use two Equifax websites. To proceed, users had to agree to the sites' terms of use, which include the waiver and the site user's consent to submit to arbitration instead.In apparent response to social-media criticism, Equifax reportedly had said it did not plan to hold victims of the data breach to their waiver and arbitration agreement. But securities fraud attorney Andrew Stoltmann told IBD that Equifax would still be free to hold victims to the waiver. ""It's my understanding that this is simply what they have said and the company isn't bound by it if they haven't taken the binding arbitration agreement out.""Apparently in part to quell criticism, Equifax says it has deleted the waiver and arbitration agreement. Spokeswoman Meredith Giffanti told IBD via email, ""To confirm (IBD's question), enrolling in the free credit file monitoring and identity theft protection products that we are offering as part of this cybersecurity incident does not prohibit consumers from taking legal action. We have already removed that language from the Terms of Use on the site www.equifaxsecurity2017.com. The Terms of Use on www.equifax.com do not apply to the TrustedID Premier product being offered to consumers as a result of the cybersecurity incident. Again, to be as clear as possible, we will not apply any arbitration clause or class action waiver against consumers for claims related to the free products offered in response to the cybersecurity incident or for claims related to the cybersecurity incident itself.""Equifax and the other two major national credit reporting services may seek a silver lining in this attack by selling products and services to consumers who want to protect their personal data. Credit freezes, for one, are subject to fees, which can vary depending on your home state. Nick Sloane of Sloane Wealth Management said, ""I anticipate (Equifax) will actually try to profit from this incident by selling upgraded stuff, like more frequent access to credit reports or extending the monitoring for a fee.""Sloane adds that he does not believe that inquiring about the status of one's data with Equifax would expose a consumer to additional security risk. But, he adds, he's not sure any consumer should believe Equifax if it says your data was not hacked. ""I don't think it is 'unsafe' to do so,"" he said. ""My comment is ... I would not believe them either way (why should you; they took how long to inform the public?).""Even if your data wasn't already hacked, you should consider security steps like a credit freeze, Sloane adds. ""If companies who have sensitive consumer information get their sites hacked (Target (TGT) comes to mind), then of course this will happen again. I really think it does not matter if you found out that you were or were not part of a data breach after it happened; it is likely going to occur to you and to me at some point.""Equifax disclosed the data breach last week. The company indicated that it realized it had been hacked on July 29.The data theft involved files that included people's names, Social Security numbers, birth dates, addresses and in some cases driver's license numbers. ""It poses an identity-theft threat to tens of millions of people,"" said Jocelyn Baird, associate editor of NextAdvisor, a consumer information website.Equifax shares sold off on Friday and Monday. They closed down nearly 21% on Monday from their Sept. 7 closing price. They rallied nearly 2% Tuesday.RELATED:Here's A Look At Cybersecurity Stocks That Rose After The Equifax HackHow Much Salary You Need To Buy A HomeYou Need This Much Retirement Savings At Your Age And Income

254,TGT,"Heat continues to mount on credit reporting agency Equifax (EFX), which last week disclosed a massive breach in which hackers stole the personal identification information of as many as 143 million consumers.XOn Thursday, an open-source software organization said that it had publicly posted a patch for the vulnerability that hackers used to access Equifax data about two months before the hack, but that apparently Equifax did not install the patch before the breach took place, if it ever did.Separately on Thursday, the Federal Trade Commission said it is investigating the data breach. In addition, several congressional bills were filed that would hold Equifax and other data brokers accountable for such errors. And on Friday, U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren said she and other senators will introduce a bill to require credit bureaus to let consumers freeze their credit for free, according to Reuters news service. Some credit agencies charge around $5.A credit freeze blocks criminals from setting up bogus accounts whose purchases get charged to victims.The open-source software organization, the Apache Software Foundation (ASF), told IBD that it posted a patch for the vulnerability known as CVE-2017-5638 in the Apache Struts program on March 7.Equifax identified that as the vulnerability that hackers used. But the hack did not take place until mid-May through July, Equifax has said. Equifax realized it had been breached on July 29. Equifax disclosed the breach on Sept. 7.ASF suggested that an organization such as Equifax is presumed to be aware of such postings, but ASF does not know what if anything Equifax did know about the patch. It said that Equifax is not a customer of ASF and that ASF has no one-on-one relationship with Equifax.ASF spokeswoman Sally Khudairi told IBD by email: ""The Apache Software Foundation provides Open Source software that is freely available to all at no cost or restriction on its use. Those who wish to use our software projects simply download the projects from apache.org and/or one of many globally-distributed mirror sites.""Khudairi added: ""Any risks, along with patches, are announced and widely shared with Apache project communities. In addition, security vulnerabilities or exploits are disseminated on sites such as NIST (U.S. Department of Commerce National Institute of Standards and Technology) as well as dozens (if not hundreds) of software providers and security specialists (such as MITRE and Symantec).""Further, Khudairi said, ""As with all Apache software, patches are made available to the public at large. Financial services organizations are often known for being highly aware of security vulnerabilities in general, and are therefore particularly vigilant with their processes for patching any known exploits.""Equifax has not yet responded to IBD questions concerning the patch.ASF oversees more than 350 leading open source projects, including Apache HTTP Server — which it calls the world's most popular web-server software. ASF is a not-for-profit charitable organization, whose sponsors include high-profile corporations such as Capital One (COF), Comcast (CMCSA), Facebook (FB), Google (GOOGL), IBM (IBM), Microsoft (MSFT), Red Hat (RHT), Target (TGT) and Yahoo.Any entity can use ASF's software, even if they are not a sponsor. Equifax is not a sponsor.No one using the ""@equifax"" domain has communicated via email with ASF for almost two years, Khudairi says. ASF can't tell if an Equifax person communicated with ASF using a personal email address.On Sept. 8, the day after disclosing the breach, Equifax stock gapped down 14%. In the stock market today, its shares were trading near 91.40, down 37% from its 52-week high reached July 26.Shares in Symantec (SYMC), which owns credit monitoring service LifeLock, broke out above a 33.32 buy point in an irregular base Tuesday. It dipped below the buy point the next two days but rose back above it Friday. The stock ranks fourth in IBD's computer software security group, according to IBD's Stock Checkup.

That's the best sustained rate of growth since early 2008. and a signal that 3% wage growth may finally have arrived.The tax receipt data, which offer the broadest, most timely read on the health of the labor market, are consistent with what companies are saying and doing. Target (TGT) announced last month that it's hiking its minimum wage to $11 an hour this month as it recruits 100,000 seasonal workers.

260,TGT,"The U.S. economy added 261,000 jobs in October, storming back from a hurricane-hit payroll report in September, while the unemployment rate fell to a new cycle low of 4.1%, the Labor Department reported on Friday.XWall Street economists expected a gain of 325,000 jobs and a steady 4.2% jobless rate. But payrolls from August and September were revised up a combined 90,000, leaving the average monthly job gain at 162,000 over the past three months. The unemployment decline reflected a big tumble in the labor force participation rate, to 62.7% from 63.1%.Wage growth shocked on the low side, however. Average hourly wages dipped one cent on the month, rising just 2.4% from a year ago. That badly lagged expectations of a 0.2% monthly gain and 2.7% annual rise.The jobs data remain messy in the wake of the hurricanes, so it's hard to draw big conclusions regarding the health of the labor markets based on the October employment report.Treasury yields fell on the soft wage report, while major stock indexes held onto modest gains fueled by Apple (AAPL) on its strong earnings and guidance.Wage growth often comes in deceptively weak when the Labor Department's survey week doesn't include the 15th, which bimonthly paychecks are delivered, which was the case in October.With the jobless rate already at a level that Federal Reserve policymakers see as consistent with full employment, wages are the key number going forward. As annual wage growth perks up to 3%, the Fed will gain confidence that inflation will firm up over time.Ahead of the jobs report, there was some evidence that 3% wage growth may already be near. Daily Treasury statements show that federal income and employment taxes withheld from worker paychecks are now growing at 6% from a year ago, according to an IBD analysis. That's the best sustained rate of growth since early 2008.The tax receipt data, which offer the broadest, most timely read on the health of the labor market, are consistent with what companies are saying and doing. Target (TGT) announced last month that it's hiking its minimum wage to $11 an hour this month as it recruits 100,000 seasonal workers. Target eventually plans to raise its minimum wage to $15.IBD'S TAKE: The Dow Jones industrial average closed above 23,500 on Thursday, up more than 1,600 points since IBD changed its market trend indicator on Aug. 22 to ""confirmed uptrend"" from ""uptrend under pressure,"" the equivalent of a yellow light turning green.

Before that we were kind of more in the 4% range, and it spiked up closer to 5%.""On a Sept. 19 call, AutoZone (AZO) CEO William Rhodes said the auto parts retailer, with 5,300 stores across the U.S., has ""experienced accelerated pressure on wages significantly more than I have experienced in my nearly 23 years of AutoZone.""Brink's (BCO) CEO Doug Pertz noted in an earnings call last week that third-quarter profits were hurt by ""significant wage adjustments in key markets that have been experiencing very tight and highly competitive labor conditions,"" according to a Seeking Alpha transcript.Pertz said the move to reduce turnover among truck drivers and messengers came in response to ""unemployment rates that are getting to full employment type of levels, and specifically when you're competing against Amazon (AMZN) and others in the area that the markets were improving.""Management at the cash management and security company said fourth-quarter price hikes have pushed some of those higher wage costs on customers, evidence of pricing power that isn't present in most areas of the economy.

For the full year, the retailer sees $6.50-$6.65, or $6.05-$6.20 excluding tax benefits, vs. the consensus for $5.85.IBD'S TAKE: In a world where Americans do actual shopping at Amazon or other e-commerce sites, the raison d'etre of malls is waning. Some shopping arenas are calling on mayhem and drama to boost foot traffic.Children's Place stock surged 18.3% to 118.15 on the stock market today, blasting out to a new high and past a 111.30 buy point in a consolidation going back nearly three months. The stock had closed Tuesday at 99.90, just below its 50-day moving average.Children's Place stands out as many apparel chains, department stores and other major brick-and-mortar retailers struggle as mall traffic dwindles and more people buy clothes at Amazon (AMZN) and online. Urban Outfitters (URBN) fell and Express (EXPR) tumbled Wednesday on weak earnings and guidance reports. Last week, Target (TGT) and Costco Wholesale (COST) delivered subpar results, triggering big stock declines.Children's Place did close 22 stores in the fourth quarter and didn't open any new locations.Children's Place has a Composite Rating of 64, which means it outperforms 64% of all other companies based on a variety of fundamental and technical factors. Typically you want to see very high Composite Ratings, ideally 95 or above. With earnings rebounding and the stock surging, Children's Place will likely see a jump in its CR rating.RELATED:Macy's, Costco, Kohl's And Other Retailers Are Getting SlammedTarget Dives To 2014 Levels: 'We're Slow And Have Too Much Inventory'Costco To Raise Membership Fees After Fiscal Q2 Earnings, Sales Miss

270,TGT,"All eyes turn to the Federal Reserve on Wednesday, then to President Trump on Thursday for his announcement of Chair Janet Yellen's successor. But the biggest economic news of the week may already be out.XDaily Treasury statements show that federal income and employment taxes withheld from worker paychecks are now growing at 6% from a year ago, according to an IBD analysis. That's the best sustained rate of growth since early 2008.The data reflect growing wage pressures and signal that 3% wage growth may finally have arrived. That's a threshold that will signal to the Fed that price inflation pressures are beginning to build, though it may take a while for higher inflation to materialize.Markets see virtually zero chance of a rate hike on Wednesday, with the only Fed news likely to be its recognition of stronger growth amid tepid inflation, reinforcing expectations of a December move. Fed Gov. Jerome Powell, who is expected to get the nod from Trump, is seen as a status-quo candidate, as far as monetary policy is concerned.The tax receipt data, which offer the broadest, most timely read on the health of the labor market, are consistent with what companies are saying and doing. Target (TGT) announced last month that it's hiking its minimum wage to $11 an hour this month as it recruits 100,000 seasonal workers. Target eventually plans to raise its minimum wage to $15.Greg Levin, CFO at BJ's Restaurants (BJRI), which has 195 locations in 25 states, said on an earnings call last week, ""I was kind of surprised, frankly, at some of the challenges on hourly labor wage rates in the fourth quarter. Before that we were kind of more in the 4% range, and it spiked up closer to 5%.""On a Sept. 19 call, AutoZone (AZO) CEO William Rhodes said the auto parts retailer, with 5,300 stores across the U.S., has ""experienced accelerated pressure on wages significantly more than I have experienced in my nearly 23 years of AutoZone.""Brink's (BCO) CEO Doug Pertz noted in an earnings call last week that third-quarter profits were hurt by ""significant wage adjustments in key markets that have been experiencing very tight and highly competitive labor conditions,"" according to a Seeking Alpha transcript.Pertz said the move to reduce turnover among truck drivers and messengers came in response to ""unemployment rates that are getting to full employment type of levels, and specifically when you're competing against Amazon (AMZN) and others in the area that the markets were improving.""IBD'S TAKE: The Dow Jones industrial average closed near 23,400 on Wednesday, up about 1,500 points since IBD changed its market trend indicator on Aug. 22 to ""confirmed uptrend"" from ""uptrend under pressure,"" the equivalent of a yellow light turning green. Make sure to read The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines. Management at the cash management and security company said fourth-quarter price hikes have pushed some of those higher wage costs on customers, evidence of pricing power that isn't present in most areas of the economy. Target's big wage hike, by contrast, came just weeks after it announced broad price cuts, which appeared to be a response by price cuts by Amazon.com at Whole Foods Markets right after closing its acquisition.The growth in federal withheld taxes reflects job gains, hours worked and both incentive and regular pay. Given that total hours worked in the economy are growing about 2% from a year ago, according to Labor Department data, 6% growth in withheld taxes points to a likelihood of 3% wage growth. However, because the data reflect income from commissions and other incentive pay, as well as changes in tax code parameters each year, the data don't lend themselves to precise analysis.The spike in tax withholdings in the spring reflected, in large part, an apparent slow start and strong end to bonus season. Bonuses must be paid by March 31 to be counted in the prior year's tax filings.The September job's report showed the average hourly wage accelerating to 2.9% from a year ago, though that may have been slightly inflated by the temporary disruption of low-paying jobs due to hurricanes. Wall Street economists expect wage growth to backslide to 2.7% in October, when the monthly employment report comes out on Friday.While there's good reason to expect an upside surprise on wage growth on Friday, there's also reason not to. That's because wage growth often comes in deceptively weak when the Labor Department's survey week doesn't include the midmonth pay period, which was the case in October.RELATED:Wal-Mart Breaks Out On Buyback, Bullish Online Sales ForecastHurricanes Hit Payrolls, But Wage Gains May Speed Up Fed Rate HikesDid Target's Wage Hike Just Prove Fed Hawks Right — Or Wrong? Stocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth Stocks

272,TGT,"On any given morning, you could smooth out your Pinzon Egyptian cotton sheets before tossing on a Goodthreads poplin dress shirt, Franklin Tailored sharkskin-gray suit and a pair of Franklin & Freeman penny loafers. Breakfast might be a bowl of 365 Everyday Value organic quick oats and Wickedly Prime dry-roasted almonds with a cup of Happy Belly organic Fair Trade coffee, as you lean back into your Strathwood chaise lounge.XDespite not bearing Amazon's (AMZN) signature arched arrow, they're all part of an army of more than 30 private labels that belong to the increasingly ubiquitous e-commerce behemoth, a bounty waiting to be innocently discovered online as modern shoppers ditch old-school name brands and seek out stuff that's cool but cheap.Meanwhile, Wal-Mart (WMT), Target (TGT) and other Amazon rivals also have been rushing out new, re-imagined house brands, as a flurry of private-label innovation and a shift in consumer habits challenge the value of a traditional name brand. For chains that find the right balance between their own labels and outside ones, long-moribund shares could see life again. But while private labels have been hiding in plain sight for decades, the current surge could deliver another jolt to the retail sector, if national brands lose ground and prices fall further.""With the advent of Amazon and the 'everything store,' you can pretty much get a national brand that you want, anywhere,"" said Kantar Retail analyst Tiffany Hogan. ""So I think we're seeing another swell in private-label development, being used less as a fill-in strategy, which is how many of them probably started,"" and more of an offensive play.It's already a massive business for supermarkets, drug chains and mass-merchandise stores, with sales hitting a record high of $118.4 billion in 2015, according to the Private Label Manufacturers Association. And so far in 2017, private-label manufacturing sourcing has grown 26% vs. the prior-year period, according to ThomasNet data, with notable pops in cosmetics and pharmaceuticals.Today, what might have once prompted mockery at a school cafeteria is emerging from a makeover. Back in the day, store brands were meant to emulate well-known national names, offering what was perceived as a lower quality but cheaper option, rather than a distinct alternative on par with the bigger brands. Instead of red-and-white soda cans plastered with knockoff-style logos, there are now a lot more products like Whole Foods' 365 brand cola, proudly crafted with pure cane sugar and filtered carbonated water.For a retailer, owning a brand means margins are higher, prices are more competitive, and customers can't get the products anywhere else. At Amazon alone, the private-label market represents a $1 billion gross-profit opportunity, Morgan Stanley has estimated. Plus, there's greater control over product creation and speed to market, said Hogan.And companies are taking advantage of that control, crafting unique images meant to resonate with consumers' hearts and not just their wallets.""I am not a person who has or probably would ever get a tattoo, but if I were going to get one, I would want it to be the design on our coffee bag,"" says Liza Landsman, president of Jet.com, the e-commerce player acquired last year by Wal-Mart. ""I just think it's really beautiful.""She's talking about the creature on the cover of one of Jet.com's newly launched Uniquely J in-house products, an intricately inked Peruvian tiger. And it's not hard to see why: It looks more like a hipster's sleeve tattoo than a coffee container.Uniquely J's slim-but-growing collection of 50 or so items — salsa, avocado oil, sandwich bags, toilet paper — don't all sport edgy tigers. Some have cartoon bears and walruses. All are aimed at consumers of the ""metro-millennial lifestyle,"" and mark a pivot from the private-label game plan of old.""Over the last few years, the attitude toward private label among consumers has really evolved, and I think that's in response to the fact that it's not your father's private label anymore, that so much innovation and product and packaging and design is happening in that space that there (are) ample opportunities to bring really interesting offerings to market,"" said Landsman.Attitudes were much different in the early 1980s. Back then, high-end designer Halston inked a billion-dollar deal to create a lower-priced version of its apparel for J.C. Penney (JCP). But brand dilution was so frowned upon back then that Bergdorf Goodman expelled the Halston brand altogether from its upscale stores.In the 1990s, Target launched brands like Archer Farms and teamed up with architect Michael Graves for an exclusive designer partnership. Those efforts, plus in-house brands like Merona and Mossimo, which are now being retired, were better received and earned Target a devoted following among shoppers looking for reasonably fashionable but affordable items.""That was cool,"" said Jim Holbrook, CEO of private-label retail services firm Daymon. ""It was exclusive, you could only get it at Target; it was well designed, and at an affordable price. And to me that was sort of the advent of the differentiating strategy.""Target now wants to win back customers who knew and loved the ""Tar-zhay"" of yesteryear. It's in the process of debuting no fewer than a dozen brands, all either clothes or furnishing, including A New Day (womenswear), Goodfellow (menswear), Project 62 (home décor), Joylab (athleisure) and Hearth and Hand with Magnolia, a home and lifestyle label created in conjunction with HGTV stars Chip and Joanna Gaines.They hope to replicate the success of Cat & Jack, the company's shining example of what a good private label can accomplish. The cheery, on-trend kids clothing raked in $2 billion just in its first year, a remarkable feat for a debut in a home and apparel category that brings in $26 billion annually for Target — over a third of its total revenue.""Target kind of lost their way for a couple years, but (CEO) Brian Cornell's done a great job refocusing them on kids' apparel, home and launching of all these"" private-label brands, said Edward Jones analyst Brian Yarbrough of Target's chief, who took the helm in 2014.And Macy's (M) — which has a well-regarded stable of 20 or so exclusives like the Martha Stewart Collection — plans to grow its private and exclusive brands to 40% from 29% of the business by 2020, saying they help stem store traffic losses at its department stores.But Kohl's (KSS) recent private-label venture offers a warning. The department store had pushed its private labels but upset the balance between major brands and in-house offerings, weighing on sales. That showed management that national brands still matter, Yarbrough said. The department store has since focused more in the other direction, partnering with Under Armour (UAA), for instance.""Now, the risk is, for some retailers, you don't want to go too far,"" he said.In other words, shoppers like a healthy smattering of unique store brands, so long as they can still find household names like Nike (NKE) or Coca-Cola (KO) on shelves.For 20- and 30-somethings who came of age during the Great Recession, however, brands may matter even less than ever, amid their existential hunt for authenticity and uniqueness.The online store Brandless, for example, is a curated selection of groceries, household and personal care items that sell for a straightforward $3 apiece but come without what the startup's CEO, Tina Sharkey, has termed the ""Brand Tax,"" i.e. marketing costs and the ""false narrative of cartoon characters and actors"" on packaging.Brandless doesn't sell any Starbucks. Instead, it offers a chocolate-colored bag of organic, fair-trade cold brew, simply labeled ""Cold Brew Coffee Bag."" Other items are similar. No Kleenex, just ""Facial Tissue."" No Chapstick, only ""Lip Balm.""They could be mistaken for cheap generics, but the company proudly touts merchandise that is carefully sourced and ""non-GMO, sometimes organic, fair trade, kosher, gluten-free, no added sugar and more.""""I think people would tell you that millennials are exponentially more open to buying brands they didn't grow up with and trying things that speak to their values, are affordable, are not wedded to things that were necessarily at their table for years,"" said Sharkey. ""So I think there's a huge openness (to new brands) and openness to private label.""Therein lies a challenge to companies' exclusive offerings, however. Modern millennial shoppers aren't brand loyal, so they're game to skip big-name labels in favor of private brands. But companies are banking on the hope that their unique products will cultivate some modicum of loyalty, or at least one or two return trips.Loyalty is what Amazon knows well as it tries to lure more subscribers to its Prime ecosystem with its own house brands, which includes a number of womenswear lines, not to mention its popular Amazon Basics and Amazon Essentials for tchotchkes around the house.Of Amazon's estimated 34 private-label brands, 19 are clothing collections. That there's an industrywide rise in interest in store-brand apparel manufacturing comes as no surprise to ThomasNet CEO Tony Uphoff, who pointed to store closures at Gap and Abercrombie & Fitch and the decline of traditional brands.But success, even for Amazon, is not guaranteed. Paris Sunday, its fashion-forward casual line of dresses and other clothes, is reportedly being phased out, according to a recent WWD story.Still, it's early days, and as department stores are waning in influence, Amazon's access to massive amounts of data means it wields gargantuan power.""Way back in the day, it would take several months to figure out what a trend was and what people wanted and analyze the data,"" said Daymon CEO Holbrook. ""And then the data got more available with point of sales scanner data and loyalty card data, so that would take several weeks. And now, Amazon's true competitive advantage is they know, real time, minute by minute, what people want.""In the first half of 2017, the young women's apparel line, Lark & Ro, made an estimated $1.9 million for Amazon — chump change — but AmazonBasics has become a $210 million business, according to 1010data estimates.And sales of Amazon's in-house children's apparel, Scout & Ro, grew fivefold over that same time frame, said the research firm.""The brick-and-mortar retailers who get good at marketing and good at telling those stories and get good at the human touch, I think, can beat Amazon,"" said Holbrook. ""But at this point, Amazon's trying a lot of different things in the private brand space. And they're going to figure it out.""

274,TGT,"Supermarket giant Kroger (KR) said Thursday that an ongoing slump in grocery prices was largely responsible for its surprise drop in same-store sales, and the company said the market environment it's in now could persist through the first half of this year.Kroger said it expected conditions in the first half of this year to be ""similar"" to the back half of last year. At that time, lower food prices were a big topic of discussion during earnings calls in the grocery industry.The company added that its results in the second half of 2017 ""are expected to show improvement as the company cycles the previous year.""However, management also said it expected the market to become ""more competitive.""Wal-Mart (WMT), which draws much of its sales from groceries, began a price-cutting crusade last year. Target (TGT), which also sells groceries, said last month that it would lower prices and that retailers were navigating a ""seismic shift"" in their industry.Meanwhile, the e-commerce giant behind much of that seismic shift, Amazon (AMZN), is deepening its foray into grocery delivery and plans to open physical convenience stores.Kroger has been trying stave off the effects of lower food prices, which threaten to drag grocery stores into a discount war that could wear away at sales as chains rush to clear shelves.The company's fourth-quarter same-store sales fell 0.7%, worse than the Consensus Metrix forecast for a 0.1% gain.Earnings per share fell 7% to 53 cents, a penny better than estimates. Revenue rose 5.5% to $27.611 billion, edging past views for $27.308 billion.The company forecast full-year EPS of $2.21-$2.25, with the midpoint in line with consensus views for $2.23. Same-store sales over that time were seen as flat to up 1%.""We are lowering costs to invest those savings in our people, our business, and technology. This approach will enable us to deliver on our long-term net earnings per diluted share growth rate target of 8-11%, plus an increasing dividend, as it has in the past,"" CEO Rodney McMullen said in a statement.""In 2016, Kroger grew market share, increased tonnage, and hired more than 12,000 new store associates. For 2017 and beyond, we will continue delivering for our customers while also setting the company up for our next phase of growth and customer-first innovation.""Shares sank 4.3% to 30.67 on the stock market today, falling further below their 50- and 200-day lines. SuperValu (SVU) edged up 0.3%, and natural foods grocery giant Whole Foods (WFM) dipped 0.5%.Wal-Mart rose 0.4% intraday while Target inched up 0.2%.As Edward Jones analyst Brian Yarbrough told IBD last year, beef prices were lower for cyclical reasons. Egg prices slid as more shoppers stuck with egg substitutes — and didn't return to buying eggs — after a 2015 bird flu outbreak came and went. Demand for milk weakened in Asia and Europe as the dollar strengthened.In December, during Kroger's third-quarter earnings call, McMullen said the current round of so-called ""food deflation"" was the company's third in 30 years. Previous deflationary periods were three to five quarters long, he said then.However, he added that Kroger had still been scooping up market share and that the lower prices had helped the company learn better ways to operate.RELATED:Kroger Cautious On 2016, 2017 Earnings As Food Price Deflation ContinuesKroger Is Latest To Warn On Food Deflation, Doesn't Fear Wal-Mart

275,TGT,"Costco Wholesale (COST) missed fiscal second-quarter earnings and sales forecasts and increased its annual membership fees, which are a major contributor to the retailer's operating income.Estimates: Profit for the February-ended quarter up 10% to $1.36 a share on 6% revenue growth to $29.86 billion, according to Thomson Reuters.Results: EPS of $1.17 on revenue of $29.13 billion.

U.S. comps in February, excluding gasoline, rose 2%, below the 3% gain predicted by Retail Metrics.Effective June 1, annual fees for individual and business memberships in U.S. and Canada will go up by $5. Fees for Executive memberships will go up by $10. Costco sees the changes affecting 35 million members, with about half of them Executive members.Membership fees contributed $2.65 billion to Costco's fiscal 2016 revenue, which totaled $118.7 billion for the year. Those fees accounted for the bulk of Costco's operating income.Stock: Costco sank 4.5% late. Shares closed up less than 0.1% at 177.98 in the stock market today. Costco stock is well out of buy range after clearing a 165.05 entry point from a cup-with-handle base.Why It Matters: For the same reason that TJX (TJX), Burlington Stores (BURL) and Ulta Beauty (ULTA) matter — they're all retailers that aren't floundering.Last month, Costco reported 5% in comparable-sales gains for January, excluding currency impacts and gas-price changes, marking the biggest comp-sales gain in over two years. This comes at a time when big-box retailers like Target (TGT) are struggling amid a war with Amazon (AMZN) and other online players.Plus, some on Wall Street are speculating that Costco is mulling another increase to its membership fees. UBS analysts believe a fee hike is ""still likely"" in 2017, citing Costco's history of raising fees every five or six years.RELATED:Burlington Stores Stock Hits New High On Strong Earnings, OutlookCostco Soars On Biggest Comparable Sales Gain In Over 2 Years

By contrast, online sales rose 34%.""Our fourth quarter results reflect the impact of rapidly-changing consumer behavior, which drove very strong digital growth but unexpected softness in our stores,"" said Cornell in the statement.Target management said it would not provide explicit guidance beyond this year due to uncertainty. For Q1, it sees EPS of 80 cents to $1, below consensus views for $1.33, and full-year EPS of $3.80 to $4.20, well below consensus for $5.06.Same-store sales are expected to decline by mid-single digits for Q1 and by low-single digits for the year.IBD'S TAKE: As the 'Amazon Effect' barrels on, here's how big box retailers are faring online. It was already known that Target's holiday-period sales were not great. The company said last month that its November-December same-store sales fell more than 3%, although more-than-30% digital sales growth offset that brick-and-mortar softness.Last week, Wal-Mart reported Q4 earnings and U.S. same-store sales beat forecasts Tuesday as online sales jumped 29%, and its guidance for full-year revenue growth exceeded Wall Street estimates.Retailers are struggling to figure out how to build their e-commerce presence while stemming the bleeding of foot traffic from physical stores. Department stores like Macy's (M) and Kohl's (KSS) have seen their shares crater so far in 2017 on the heels of weak holiday sales.Macy's stock fell 1%, and Kohl's lost 2.7%.RELATED:

284,TGT,"The final trading day of February was a rough one for the Russell 2000 as the small-cap index was down 1.4% in late trading. The weakness came one day after the index jumped 1% in higher volume.Selling was more contained in the NYSE indexes with the S&P 500 down 0.3% and the Dow Jones industrial average lower by 0.1%.

Shares of Priceline jumped 6%, while Domino's added nearly 3%.IBD'S TAKE: The performance of restaurant stocks has been a mixed bag recently, but the group is home to plenty of names that are executing well. See who the top-rated restaurant stocks are with IBD Stock Checkup.Priceline was a top performer in the Nasdaq 100, along with Celgene (CELG).

"
286,TGT,"As President Trump, barely a month into his presidency, speaks to the nation on Tuesday night to outline his economic plans, his White House lacks his predecessors' clarity at the same stage about how to achieve its economic policy goals.But that hasn't prevented him from praising his pace as being virtually unparalleled for its productivity. While the credit he's claimed for job creation plans announced by Wal-Mart (WMT), Intel (INTC) and General Motors (GM) has been disputed, investor enthusiasm over Trump's policies has clearly played a role in lifting the Dow Jones industrial average and other market gauges to record highs.But on bread-and-butter economic policy, Trump still seems to be grasping for a way forward at a stage when Presidents Reagan and George W. Bush had already detailed their tax-cut plans and President Obama had signed his stimulus program into law.Reagan detailed his tax-cut plan on Feb. 5, 1981, and signed it into law on Aug. 13, slashing the top marginal tax rate to 50% from 70%.Bush detailed his tax-cut plan on Feb. 8, 2001, and signed legislation on June 7 of that year. Tax rebate checks of $300 per individual arrived in the mail that summer.Obama signed his $787 billion stimulus on February 17, 2009, which included, among other things, extended unemployment benefits, a $400-per-worker tax credit, and funding for infrastructure, energy efficiency and elevated state Medicaid costs.After the GOP election sweep last November, the White House and top leaders in Congress may have helped set unrealistic expectations about what they could accomplish, and how fast. Yet, it's also true that Trump and the GOP are undertaking efforts that carry a higher degree of difficulty.Politically, Obama had a filibuster-proof majority in the Senate, and passing a stimulus only required assembling a big basket of tax and spending goodies.As Trump's tax plan is expected to do, the Bush tax cuts relied on budget reconciliation, limiting the vote threshold to a simple majority. However, Bush sidestepped the toughest part of reconciliation, which requires that legislation be deficit neutral beyond the 10th year. The trick was to let the Bush tax cuts sunset after 10 years and hope — partly in vain, it turned out — that a future Congress would make his tax cuts permanent.The downside of such an approach is that long-term tax changes can have a much bigger impact on behavior, such as deciding where to locate a manufacturing facility.Bush also was able to sell his tax cut because of the budget surplus and the low federal debt level that he inherited.By contrast, current CBO projections show the deficit surpassing $1 trillion by 2023 and reaching 5% of GDP by 2027. Meanwhile, CBO also says the debt held by the public will balloon by $10 trillion over the next 10 years, hitting $25 trillion in 2027, or 89% of GDP vs. 77% in 2017.The avoidance of deficit-neutral policy essentially meant that no tough trade-offs were needed. On the other hand, the centerpiece of the House GOP approach for cutting the corporate tax rate to 20% from 35% involves a 20% border tax on imports that retailers like Target (TGT) and Dollar Tree (DLTR) are waging war against.IBD'S TAKE: Here's why corporate tax reform could collapse if political opposition kills the House border tax proposal. Trump, who has gone back and forth on the merits of the border tax plan, said on Monday that he wouldn't release details of his tax plan until the budget impact of repealing and replacing ObamaCare is clear.That's the other big anchor weighing on Trump's economic agenda. He faces the challenge of repealing and replacing the signature policy achievement of his predecessor. Despite a failure of the GOP to settle upon any approach for replacing the Affordable Care Act since it was passed in 2010, Trump said on Monday, ""Nobody knew that health care could be so complicated.""Nevertheless, Trump declared that the White House has come up with a ""really, really good"" plan to dispatch with ObamaCare. The jury is out until at least Tuesday night. But if Trump can figure out how to make good on the GOP's plan to make ObamaCare better and cheaper, then maybe they can figure out all the pesky details needed to make tax reform fly.RELATED:Trump Prioritizes ObamaCare Repeal Before Tax Cuts, Vows 'Big' Infrastructure BoostThe Trump Economy: Jobs, Regulations, Taxes And Trade

287,TGT,"Wal-Mart's (WMT) fourth-quarter earnings and U.S. same-store sales beat forecasts Tuesday as online sales jumped, and its guidance for full-year revenue growth exceeded Wall Street estimates.The retail giant's earnings per share dropped 13% to $1.30, topping views by a penny, while revenue edged up 1% to $130.9 billion, missing estimates of $131.27 billion.Wal-Mart U.S. same-store sales rose 1.8%, the biggest increase in four years and better than the Consensus Metrix forecast for a 1.3% gain, as traffic climbed 1.4%. Wal-Mart U.S. e-commerce sales jumped 29%, including Jet.com and online grocery sales.The dividend was also hiked by 2% to $2.04.Wal-Mart also sees Q1 EPS of 90 cents-$1.00, with the midpoint slightly below consensus for 96 cents, and full-year EPS of $4.20-$4.40, with the midpoint also a bit shy of the consensus for $4.33. It sees Q1 U.S. comp sales up 1%-1.5% and full-year total sales growth of 2%-3%, better than consensus for a 1.8% uptick.Shares rallied 3% to 71.45 on the stock market today. Target (TGT), which reports next week, was up 0.6%. Macy's (M), which also reported Q4 results early Tuesday, gave up much of its earlier gains and closed down 1 cent to 32.29.Wal-Mart stock has been volatile since the election but has suffered more recently on another weak holiday shopping season for brick-and-mortar stores and efforts in Washington, D.C., to impose a 20% border tax on imports.CEOs from the nation's top retail chains traveled to Congress and the White House last week, lobbying lawmakers against the border tax.Meanwhile, Wal-Mart continues to look for ways to counter Amazon (AMZN). Last year, it bought Jet.com for more than $3 billion.And last month, Wal-Mart ended its fee-based ShippingPass program, which provides two-day shipping. Instead, the company said it will offer free two-day shipping on more than 2 million items for receipts of at least $35, without a fee.Amazon this past weekend responded by cutting the minimum order on its non-Prime shipping to $35, though deliveries will take five to eight business days.IBD'S TAKE: Amazon is gaining ground in large retail markets beyond its core markets of electronics and media, putting the e-commerce giant in position for a strong performance in 2017.And even as Wal-Mart tries to fortify its e-commerce flank, Amazon is starting to build its own physical stores.Amazon Go, announced in early December, is envisioned as a small (1,800-square-foot) convenience store with no check-out lines that instead uses wireless technology to charge customers' Amazon accounts.RELATED:If Border Tax Dies, Trump Corporate Tax Cut May Collapse

290,TGT,"The stock market ended modestly lower Thursday as retail stocks received the most attention, while the Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 continued to battle for support at the 50-day moving average.XAt the close, the Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 and Nasdaq showed losses of 0.1%-0.2%. Small caps outperformed, with the Russell 2000 up 0.3%. Preliminary data showed volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq coming in slightly higher than Wednesday's levels.Late Wednesday, the Federal Trade Commission cleared a merger between Amazon.com (AMZN) and Whole Foods Market (WFM), and Amazon promptly announced plans to cut prices at Whole Foods. That fueled sell-offs in food retailers like Wal-Mart (WMT), Costco (COST), Target (TGT) and Kroger (KR). Kroger fared the worst, falling 8%, while Wal-Mart, Costco and Target showed losses ranging from 2% to 5%.Cisco Systems (CSCO), Merck (MRK) and Chevron (CVX) held up well in the Dow with gains of around 1%.Big earnings movers in the retail sector included two heavily shorted stocks: Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF) and Guess (GES). Shares of Abercrombie surged 16% while Guess vaulted 18%.Earnings also lifted shares of retailers Dollar Tree Stores (DLTR), Williams-Sonoma (WSM), Michaels Companies (MIK) and Burlington Stores (BURL), but all four closed near session lows after a strong start.Friday could be an interesting session depending on what comes out of the Fed's Annual Economic Symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyo. Fed Chair Janet  Yellen and European Central Bank President Mario Draghi are speaking Friday. The Fed is about to start shrinking its $4.5 trillion balance sheet after years of quantitative easing to stimulate the economy. The ECB, meanwhile, could be ready ease back on its bond purchases amid signs of economic improvement.Among the day's gainers in the stock market today, Sodastream (SODA) gained nearly 2% to 60.39. After falling 7% below a 57.78 buy point, the stock found support at the 50-day moving average and is back near highs. Initially, Sodastream was known for its carbonation system for making soda drinks at home, but as soda has become less popular among consumers, the company's sparking water offerings are enjoying strong demand.Finally, for a good example of what institutional selling in a stock, check out shares of Ulta Beauty (ULTA). The former leader reported earnings after the close, and slumped 9% in early after-hours trading despite beating profit estimates. Growth prospects for the retailer remain solid, but its technical picture has weakened considerably after several above-average volume weekly declines since June.RELATED:Amazon Will Cut Whole Foods Prices Monday, Integrate Prime: Grocery Stocks Slammed2 Hot Mining Stocks Break Out Into Buy Zones As Metals RallyUlta Beauty's Q2 Earnings: Dud Or Double-Digit Comps Growth?

291,TGT,"Apple (AAPL) initially fell more than 1% Monday but trimmed its losses to around 0.6% at 156.70 as the major indexes continued to avoid an eclipse of their strong year-to-date gains.XBy late afternoon, the Dow Jones industrial average and the S&P 500 were nearly break-even, while the Nasdaq composite limited its loss to 0.2%. The Nasdaq 100 was also off 0.2% and is trying to stay near its flattening 50-day moving average.Volume was running sharply lower on both main exchanges; Friday saw the expiration of weekly and monthly equity and index options.Apple on Aug. 2 cleared a 156.75 flat-base entry and only has gained roughly 3.7%. As seen on a daily chart, the stock has shown zigzagging action, briefly slipping below the proper entry three times already. However, no sell signal has triggered for now.At 156.68, shares are just 3% below the all-time peak of 162.51, while small-cap indexes have dipped more. The S&P SmallCap 600, off 0.1%, has fallen 6% below its all-time peak of 878.At 5779, the Nasdaq 100 is up 18.8% since Jan. 1, far outstripping the S&P 500's 8.4% lift.Losing stocks are edging out winners on the Nasdaq by a 4-to-3 margin. But on the NYSE, advancers are leading decliners by a slim margin of fewer than 100 issues.As e-commerce activity does not show signs of letting up anytime soon, at least five top operators in the retailing space have fallen much more than the major equity benchmarks. All but one have triggered new sell signals.Ulta Beauty (ULTA) continued to fade, sinking nearly 4% to 235.49. The cosmetics and hair care products chain has broken through support at the 200-day moving average near 270 and failed to lift back above the long-term support line. Notice, too, how the stock's 50-day moving average has crossed below the 200-day line. That's bearish.Wall Street expects July-ended fiscal Q3 earnings rising 24% to $1.78 a share. That's a decent gain, but a little shy of the 25% increase one would expect from a CAN SLIM market leader. Plus, it would mark a considerable slowdown from EPS gains of 26%, 33% and 41% in the prior three quarters.Target (TGT) (18 Relative Price Strength) is trying to bottom out after falling as much as 17.6% in the past three months. Check out the week ended July 28, when the giant discount chain fell hard during the week but ended it with a solid 1% gain in sharply higher gain. Such reversals at the bottom of a stock's decline are bullish.But Target, which still depends a lot on consumers to visit their stores to keep sales flowing, needs to rise back above the 40-week moving average (roughly equivalent to a 200-day moving average on a daily chart) to show that institutional investors are seriously accumulating shares. For now, Target is just 11% below the 52-week high.Target is forecast to grow FY 2018 earnings by 11% to $3.92 a share. But the 1.8% annualized dividend yield is inferior to the S&P 500 (around 1.9%).Home Depot (HD), the biggest gainer in the 30-stock Dow, rose more than 1.3% to 149.62 and is currently forming a new base. It recently posted a 14% EPS increase for the second quarter, marking a 14th quarter in a row of double-digit earnings-per-share growth.The IBD Big Cap 20 doesn't currently hold any traditional brick-and-mortar retailers. However, consumer-oriented firms help pack the list, including Mastercard (MA), PayPal (PYPL), energy drink marketer Monster Beverage (MNST) and Royal Caribbean Cruises (RCL).Michael Kors (KORS) and Five Below (FIVE) are trying to buck the general sell-off in the apparel and discount retail sectors, respectively.Michael Kors, famous for its jet set-styled handbags and clothing, may be working on a new bottoming-base pattern, which would be first stage. The stock had collapsed more than 60% from a February 2014 peak near 101. But shares are now up more than 15% in August so far and are on track for a third monthly advance. Quiet action from here would possibly yield a new buy point near recent upside resistance, at 46.Kors' Q2 profit dropped 11% to 80 cents a share, but that was a far smaller decline than viewed. Sales fell 4% to $952.4 million, marking a fourth quarter in a row of shrinking sales.Five Below, which sells toys, accessories and clothing for $5 each or less, rallied more than 3% to 48.58. A cup-with-handle base is forming. For now, the Philadelphia-based retailer shows a legitimate entry of 51.62, 10 cents above the two-week handle's high. The base barely passes the midpoint test (handle's midpoint is 49.29, base midpoint 49.21).Five Below holds a decent Composite Rating of 87 on a scale of 1 to 99 from Stock Checkup, second only to group peer Ollie's Bargain Outlet (OLLI). Five Below shows an excellent A grade for SMR (Sales + Profit Margins + ROE) but the 54 RS Rating needs more work.RELATED:Here Is The Easy And Fast Way To Spot Major Market Tops Before Stocks CrashIBD Sector Leaders: Why YY Is Leading The Market, Fundamentals And Technicals-WiseStocks Near A Buy ZoneThe Best Large Cap Growth Firms Today: Inside Big Cap 20

The Nasdaq Composite dumped 0.2%, as Apple (AAPL) and the FANG stocks all posted moderate losses.Markets stalled Wednesday ahead of the release of minutes from the Federal Open Market Committee's July meeting, and just after news broke that the Trump administration had abandoned two key business councils manned by blue chip top executives. The decision once again stirred concerns that Washington's commitment to tax cuts and other key elements of the president's agenda would not be soon in coming.The chief executives of Corning (GLW), General Electric (GE), United Technologies (UTX) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) had decided to leave the council Wednesday, the Wall Street Journal reported, in response to the President Trump's response to events Saturday in Charlottesville, Va. The heads of Merck (MRK) and Under Armour (UA) had announced their exits Monday, and leaders of the Alliance for American Manufacturing and the AFL-CIO resigned from the group Tuesday.Blackstone Group (BX) Chief Executive Stephen Schwarzman informed the White House that members of the President's Strategic and Policy Forum had decided to dissolve the group, according to the Wall Street Journal. Minutes later, the President tweeted that he was eliminating both the Manufacturing Council as well as the Strategy and Policy Forum.On the Dow, Wal-Mart and Cisco threw out the early anchor, both posting declines after their quarterly results.Cisco fell 2% after earnings and revenue declined in line with expectations, but growth in services and recurring revenue was lackluster. The loss dragged shares back below 10-week support, as the stock attempts to build a floor in a three-month consolidation.Wal-Mart dragged 2.2% lower after meeting analysts' second-quarter targets and providing guidance below expectations. Comparable store sales rose 1.8%, near the top end of guidance in a 12th straight advance.

Second-quarter guidance was in line with expectations. The decline cut the stock's 10-week moving average in heavy tgrade, sending a sell signal, but stopped short of a 7% decline below a 43.18 buy point, avoiding the automatic sell rule.After the close, Applied Materials (AMAT), Latam Airlines (LFL), Gap (GPS) and Ross Stores (ROST) are among the companies scheduled to report.Manufacturing slowed less than expected in the mid-Atlantic region in August, sending the Philadelphia Federal Reserve's Manufacturing Business Outlook Survey to 18.9, down from a reading of 19.5 in July, but above consensus forecasts for a dip to 17.

Holiday-quarter reports showed weak foot traffic and soft, if not declining, same-store sales. Consumers aren't buying less, but it has become the conventional wisdom that Amazon.com (AMZN) is murdering all but the best malls, and that young people prefer experiences to tangible products…

295,TGT,"Ulta Beauty's (ULTA) estimate-beating results and double-digit same-store sales make it a retail outlier amid a landscape beset with weak traffic and comparable sales declines. But can it keep up this pace?When the specialty beauty retailer reports late Thursday, Wall Street expects 26% profit growth to $2.13 a share on 21.5% revenue gains to $1.54 billion.Shares fell 2.1% to 269.92 in the stock market today, moving back below a 274.09 buy point and testing its 50-day moving average for the first time in three months. The stock has been rising just above or below the entry area for the past several weeks.Other retailers — including Macy's (M), Kohl's (KSS) and Target (TGT) — have disappointed investors. Amazon.com (AMZN) looms ever larger as the reason for many retail woes.But the off-price, home improvement and specialty beauty sectors frequently get call-outs for eluding Amazon's tentacles.And one indicator of Ulta's holiday-quarter performance may come from rival Sephora, whose parent company LVMH reported results in late January.""We're optimistic on the opportunity for sustained growth at ULTA, as LVMH reported further (double-digit) growth in revenue and profit at Sephora, driven by market share gains in all regions,"" wrote Cowen analyst Oliver Chen in late January, adding that strong shopper demand for specialty beauty products ""bodes well for Ulta.""In fact, he appears to prefer it over Sephora, which only carries high-end ""prestige"" brands. Ulta carries mass brands such as Revlon (REV), Maybelline and NYX in addition to upscale products from the likes of Urban Decay Cosmetics and Nars.""While we acknowledge ULTA and Sephora overlap on some brands, we continue to like ULTA's exposure to a wider demographic with a broad spectrum of brands from mass to prestige.""IBD'S TAKE: What's holding back Amazon and other e-commerce pure plays from eating into Sephora and Ulta's market share? There are several reasons why Amazon has been powerless against beauty stores. But even strong reports don't always provide Ulta shares with an immediate post-earnings boost. Its last two quarterly disclosures have been accompanied by declines before shares picked up steam again.E.l.f. Beauty (ELF) reports Q4 results Wednesday after the closing bell. The value-cosmetics brand's stock fell 2.9% to 25.92 on Tuesday.

296,TGT,"Shares of Macy's (M), Kohl's (KSS), Nordstrom (JWN), J.C. Penney (JCP), Costco Wholesale (COST) and other retailers are getting slammed Monday, but it's not yet clear what exactly is weighing on the sector.Macy's closed down 3.4% at 30.69 on the stock market today after losing 4.4% on Friday. Kohl's also lost 3.4%, Nordstrom 1.8%, J.C. Penney 4.8%. IBD's Retail-Department store group fell 3.3% Monday, one of the very worst performers out of 197 industries that IBD tracks.IBD'S TAKE: Macy's has been added to IBD's Leaderboard, which provides annotated chart analysis of actionable stocks. Leaderboard typically focuses on growth stocks at or near buy points, but Macy's is among a new crop of possible short sales.February store sales sank 17%, said Business Insider on Monday, citing Bloomberg and First Data. That data appeared to be public last week, per a tweet from Bloomberg reporter Jodi Xu Klein:U.S. department store Feb sales downs 17%, tax refunds may help, says Bloomberg Intelligence #retailers— Jodi Xu Klein (@jodixu) March 3, 2017Meanwhile, the New York Post reported late Friday that Macy's bidder Hudson's Bay isn't pleased with the ""high price"" being asked for the nation's largest department store chain. Hudson's Bay also hasn't lined up financing yet for a Macy's bid, Reuters reported on Friday.And NPD Group said Monday that apparel sales grew 3% in 2016 to reach $218.7 billion, but were struggling to rise beyond that.""The industry had positive overall performance with growth in most categories, but it has struggled to exceed 3% sales growth since 2013, as significant gains in select consumer and retail segments were offset by declines in others,"" said NPD.Costco and Target (TGT) are also swept up in Monday's downward action. Costco fell 2.1%, undercutting its 50-day line intraday. Costco gapped down 4.4% on Friday following its report of weaker-than-expected earnings and sales.Target, which crashed 14% last week on its own weak results and guidance, lost 2.2%. But Wal-Mart (WMT) dipped just 0.2%.Retail Metrics head Ken Perkins says there's ""no specific reason"" he's aware of for the broad sector decline, though ""you can probably take your pick.""Among those issues he cited: delayed tax refunds, broader Q4 earnings weakness — down 2.1% year-over-year, he said — concern over the border adjustment tax, high levels of distressed debt in retail, and of course, Amazon (AMZN).Perkins also noted that retail earnings pre-announcements ""are running 5-1 negative-to-positive so far this earnings season.""RELATED:Target Dives To 2014 Levels: 'We're Slow And Have Too Much Inventory'Costco To Raise Membership Fees After Fiscal Q2 Earnings, Sales MissJ.C.

297,TGT,"President Trump on Wednesday met with retail CEOs, promising to cut industry regulations and urging them to build more stores, while Target (TGT) afterward warned a proposed border tax would raise prices.Trump also promised a ""massive"" tax plan ""in the not-too-distant future."" That followed Trump's remarks to airline CEOs last week when he vowed to announce something ""phenomenal in terms of tax"" in the coming weeks.Wednesday's meeting included CEOs from Gap (GPS), AutoZone (AZO), Target, Tractor Supply (TSCO) and JCPenney (JCP), who were in Washington, D.C., to lobby the White House and Congress against the border tax.""We're cutting regulations big league,"" Trump said at the meeting, later adding, ""You have a very, very big regulatory problem, and we're going to take care of that, because I want more jobs.""He also pressed the executives on growth.""We want you to expand your stores,"" Trump said. ""You'll tell me why you will or why you won't. And tell me why you won't, we'll work on you a little bit.""The issue of a border tax did not come up specifically during the public remarks. But Target said later it was brought up, though didn't mention what Trump said about it.""They also discussed the … proposal for a border adjustability tax, which is a priority issue for Target because it will raise prices for American families on everyday essentials,"" Target said in a statement, according to CNBC.If enacted, Target said, such a policy ""would have profound implications for our guests and business, and at Target, we believe that anything that raises prices for families is not a good idea for America.""Trump did reiterate his administration's attempts to bring down the overall tax burden on businesses and simplify the tax code, so much so, that ""H&R Block probably won't be too happy — that's one business that might not be happy with what we're doing.""Shares of H&R Block (HRB) fell as much as 2% on the comment but pared losses and were down 0.8% to close at 20.80 on the stock market today. TurboTax provider Intuit (INTU) was flat.Shares of Target were up 0.2% to 65.75, Gap added 0.8% to 24.39. AutoZone rose 0.5% to 739.50, while Tractor Supply lost 0.9% to 72.73, and JCPenney rose 0.6% to 7.31.When asked for comment on Trump's mention of H&R block and whether a simpler tax code was good or bad news for the company, the company referred IBD to a LinkedIn post by CEO Bill Cobb from December.""Regardless of the tax reform changes to come, we know that people are always going to want expert help to make sure they get the most money back,"" Cobb said in that post.

298,TGT,"CEOs of Best Buy (BBY), Target (TGT), Gap (GPS), Autozone (AZO) and others will reportedly meet Wednesday with members of Congress to argue against a potential tax on the imports they rely on to keep costs down.The executives will meet with Kevin Brady, the House Ways and Means Committee chairman and senators, according to Reuters, which added it was unclear if the executives would also meet with President Trump.Brady and House Speaker Paul Ryan have been at work on a plan that would slash corporate income taxes to 20%, impose a new 20% tax on imports, but spare export revenue from being taxed, Reuters said.Shares of Best Buy closed 3% higher at 45.29 on the stock market today. Target rose 1.3% to 65.65, and Gap climbed 2.4% to 24.20.IBD'S TAKE: Along with a border tax, the retail landscape has dried up as more customers shop online and a younger generation values more meaningful experiences over things. Here's what malls are doing to stay alive. The meeting comes ahead of a potential announcement Trump said he would make in the next to or three weeks that would be ""phenomenal in terms of tax.""Higher import taxes against nations like Mexico and China could hurt a variety of retailers and force them to pass more costs onto consumers.""Border adjustments create uncertainty for multi-national brands from a tax and FX perspective while consumers face significant cost inflation,"" Cowen & Co. said in a research note last month.Nike (NKE) was among the most insulated from a border adjustment tax ""due to significant international segment mix,"" Cowen said. Hanesbrands (HBI) and G-III Apparel (GIII) were among the most vulnerable.""In a 20% border adjustment scenario,"" the firm added, ""multi-national apparel and footwear brands must immediately raise prices, on average, by a high-teens rate and hope for fairly inelastic demand but could still see profitability lowered by 70% to 20%, depending on mix of business, deductions, and FX movements even with corp. tax rates lowered to 20%.""RELATED:Retailers Face 2017 'Reckoning,' More 'Sad Malls' As Amazon Keeps BoomingPresident Trump Attacks Nordstrom To Defend Daughter's BusinessSears Dumps Some Trump-Branded Goods But Aims To 'Leave The Politics To Others'

303,TGT,"Amazon (AMZN) slammed the grocery sector — and pretty much any retailer that sells food, including Wal-Mart (WMT) — when it announced on June 16 that it was acquiring Whole Foods market for $13.7 billion.Wal-Mart shares tumbled below their 50-day moving average on the news and have yet to retake the key level as they build a flat base. But Goldman Sachs on Friday added the mega-retailer to its conviction list and upgraded the stock's rating to buy from neutral with a price target of 84.Analyst Matthew Fassler said Wal-Mart is well positioned to handle increased technology and e-commerce spending as well as ""weather"" Amazon's growth as it focuses more on consumables.In particular, he sees merit in Wal-Mart's ""front-loaded investment, scale, capacity for additional investment, small-market focus, and current impressive inventory discipline.""Shares are up 1.7% at 76.34 on the stock market today, heading back toward their 50-day average.Rival Target (TGT) was down 0.2% after soaring 5.3% on Thursday following its strong Q2 earnings and same-store sales guidance. Grocery giant Kroger (KR) rose 0.4% and Sprouts Farmers Market (SFM) 0.8%. Of the three, only Sprouts has so far retaken its 50-day line since the Whole Foods shocker.Target has been working to bolster its online shopping efforts. But Wal-Mart's shopping spree is in full swing in 2017, adding Bonobos, Moosejaw, Modcloth and Shoebuy to its e-commerce portfolio after acquiring Jet.com last year.""We imagine that WMT, as an institution, did not have much to rethink the day AMZN announced its intent to acquire WFM,"" said Fassler. ""Tactically, WMT has improved in-store execution visibly, tightened inventory, and kept pace with overall US retail SSS momentum after years of lagging behind.""That's not to say Wal-Mart is invincible, however. Fassler commended the big-box retailer's e-commerce efforts, but said it has ""more limited tools"" than Amazon, Costco, Target and Kroger on the business-intelligence end. And Wal-Mart has already slashed prices in ""many"" markets to preemptively fend off discounters courting customers who would otherwise go to Wal-Mart for fill-in trips, ""and the wall of worry is high right now, in our view.""RELATED:Wal-Mart To 'Weather' Amazon, Boeing Upgraded, Momo Price Target Hiked

304,TGT,"If you want to know how prospects for tax reform look, don't watch President Trump's address before a joint session of Congress on Tuesday evening. Watch this brutal new ad from the National Retail Federation.The retail group, leading a fight on behalf of Wal-Mart (WMT), Costco (COST), Dollar Tree (DLTR) and others, depicted Republicans as heartless tax-hikers, slapping taxes on ""your car, your food, your medicine, your clothes.""As a bonus, viewers are told, Congress is throwing in its ""new job-killing formula for free.""The border-adjusted tax, or BAT tax as it's called in the NRF ad, would apply a 20% tax on the full value of imports in the House GOP proposal to lower the corporate tax rate from 35% to 20%.More than $1 trillion raised by the BAT tax over a decade would pay for the cost of the rate cut. Supporters argue that retailers and their working-class customers wouldn't be hurt by the tax on imports because the dollar would appreciate vs. foreign currencies and neutralize the tax. But economists are divided over whether currencies would fully adjust.IBD'S TAKE: Backers of a 20% border tax say that the dollar would rise about 25%, effectively negating the higher tax bill faced by importers. Yet if that were to happen, the stronger dollar would hurt the U.S. tourism industry — including Trump hotels.House backers of the plan have warned that the border tax is integral to their plan and that tax reform could die without it.To understand why, consider that a plan to cut the corporate tax rate to 25% from former House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dave Camp was pronounced dead on arrival by GOP leaders. Deficit-neutral reform, which is needed to pass via reconciliation, would mean cutting prized tax benefits for things like domestic production, research and development, and accelerated depreciation.The only proposals for cutting the corporate tax rate below 25% involve big increases in capital gains taxes, which have attracted few GOP supporters.Wal-Mart fell 1.4% and Dollar Tree 3.7% intraday on the stock market today, as Target (TGT) sold off on its grim earnings and guidance.

310,TGT,"Stocks wrestled to a healthy finish Thursday in a session where early gains were dented by Senate testimony from Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen.XThe Dow Jones industrial average slimmed to a 0.1% gain, after climbing almost 0.2% in late trade.  The S&P 500 and Nasdaq ended up 0.2% each.  Small caps posted a weak session, with Russell 2000 futures ending only slightly below the break-even line.The Nasdaq and S&P 500 dropped hard just after 10 a.m. ET, during the first half hour of the Fed chair's Senate testimony Thursday. The S&P 500 rallied back to retake its early-morning high. The Nasdaq posted its high of the day just ahead of Yellen's testimony.The day's economic data had a mixed effect on trade, including a more slight-than-expected drop in weekly unemployment claims and a smaller-than-forecast increase in core producer prices for June.Thursday's action left the Nasdaq composite ahead nearly 2% for the week and tracking toward its best weekly finish since late May.  The S&P 500 was up 0.9% and the Dow Jones industrial average held a 0.6% gain.Six of the 10 strongest gains among industries came from retail groups, with department stores and auto parts chains leading the procession.Target (TGT) appeared to launch the retail rally, rising nearly 5% after boosting its second-quarter same-store-sales and earnings guidance, based on strong April and May traffic. Dillards (DDS), Kohl's (KSS) and J.C. Penney (JCP) all surged 5% or more. Wal-Mart (WMT) climbed 1.5% to lead the Dow industrials.Apple (AAPL) was hot on Wal-Mart's heels, up 1.4% as it reached to test resistance at its 10-week moving average.

Tesla (TSLA) underwrote that decline, tumbling 2% in weak trade. The stock is in its second week below its 10-week moving average, ending 17% below its June 23 high.Applied OptoElectronics (AAOI) sprung up 7% and triggered a rally in fiber-optic plays after preannouncing June-quarter earnings and revenue above analyst expectations.

312,TGT,"Amazon (AMZN) continued to pump out a series of announcements Friday to build interest in Prime Day, its biggest shopping event of the year that is set to launch late Monday and run through Tuesday.XScheduled to last 30 hours beginning at 9 p.m. ET Monday, this year's event will be offered to shoppers in 13 countries, with an eye toward snaring even more members in the service that is rapidly approaching 100 million customers. The online sales event is exclusively for members of the company's Amazon Prime loyalty program, with Amazon promising ""hundreds of thousands of deals.""Ultimately the e-commerce giant hopes to up its membership in what has become a highly lucrative venture for Amazon. In a recent note to clients, Cowen analyst John Blackledge said Prime will be the long-term driver of Amazon's retail business.""Amazon continuously improves Prime's value proposition, which should drive higher Prime subs and further Amazon market-share gains over time,"" Blackledge wrote. ""Even with Amazon shares up (30.5%) year to date, we believe investors may still not fully appreciate the power of Amazon Prime.""Amazon now has about 85 million Amazon Prime members, up 35% from the 63 million it reportedly had one year ago, according to a report by Consumer Intelligence Research Partners issued Thursday. CIRP estimates that 63% of Amazon shoppers are now Prime members, spending $1,300 per year on the site, compared with about $700 per year for nonmember customers.Amazon offers a free 30-day trial membership, which can be used on Prime Day. During last year's Prime Day event, Amazon reported that ""several hundred thousand"" consumers signed up for Amazon Prime, a scenario expected to be repeated.Amazon Prime members pay $99 a year and get free two-day shipping on most goods in addition to access to streaming video, music and other perks. Amazon Prime was launched 11 years ago, initially offering just free shipping.Amazon was up 1.4%, near 978.76 in the stock market today, retaking its 50-day moving average.On Friday, Amazon put the focus on its two-hour delivery service, called Prime Now, by offering consumers exclusive deals they can get on Amazon Prime Day.Amazon also is expected to put its own products front and center. Expect to see specials on the Alexa-enabled Amazon Echo and Echo Dot, in addition to Amazon's line of tablet computers and its Kindle readers, as well as its recently launched line of apparel. Special deals will be offered to those who order goods through the Amazon Echo devices.Launched three years ago, Amazon said last year's Prime Day was its biggest sales day ever, with orders surpassing the previous year's tally by more than 60% worldwide and 50% in the U.S. Amazon boasted that Prime Day surpassed its sales from Black Friday and Cyber Monday, two of the busiest online shopping days overall, though it did not release sales figures.IBD'S TAKE: Amazon, an IBD Leaderboard stock whose shares are up 33% in the past year, is extended after recently finding support at the 50-day moving average. It sports a healthy IBD Composite Rating of 94 out of a possible 99.In the previous two years, several retailers jumped aboard the success of Prime Day, taking advantage of the media buzz leading up to the event. They included Wal-Mart (WMT) and Target (TGT), which promoted big discounts and free shipping.Wal-Mart began offering free shipping with no minimum purchase for five days to counter the rival event. Target was offering various discounts, but the company said deals had more to do with the back-to-school season. Target was offering 30% discounts on clothing and 25% off home items.Last year's Prime Day event was criticized for the lack of compelling deals. The deals were plentiful, but consumers complained that most of the bargains were on leftover inventory rather than must-have shopping items.But Amazon said that small businesses and entrepreneurs saw orders nearly triple year-over-year as customers ordered more than 20 million items from small businesses and entrepreneurs across more than 50 categories last year.

313,TGT,"""Buy now"" with one click.Online shoppers know the payment tool well. It's a good example of how innovating in digital payments can take a company and its stock a long way. XJust ask founder Jeff Bezos at Amazon.com (AMZN), whose shares have approached the 1,100 mark.Other digital-payment players — think PayPal Holdings (PYPL), Square (SQ), and hot startup Stripe — also make it easier for merchants to nail down purchases, whether shoppers are on a PC, using a smartphone or in a store. PayPal and Square have shined in 2017, with their stocks climbing 50% and 92%, respectively, for the year vs. a gain of 10% for the S&P 500.Innovation in digital payments is making cash and checks go away and someday may even eliminate plastic credit cards. As technology evolves, a battle is raging to draw in merchants to payment ecosystems, along with billions of dollars in transaction fees.Payment processors are wooing merchants with new software-based sales tools and website services and, in some cases, cash loans to grow their businesses.""Anything a merchant can do to reduce the amount of friction in the transaction has an immediate effect on the top line, in terms of incremental sales, and the bottom line, in terms of lower transaction costs,"" said Thad Peterson, analyst at Aite Group.IBD'S TAKE: Keep an eye on credit card and payment-processing stocks, which have risen in weeks to rank 31st in price performance among 197 industry groups tracked by Investor's Business Daily. A leader in the group, PayPal's stock climbed to a record high after earnings. Use the IBD Stock Checkup to see how PayPal and other stocks stack up on crucial fundamental and technical measures.But competition is fierce in the crowded digital-payment industry, with well-funded startups challenging corporate giants from the credit card, e-commerce and consumer electronic fields. It's a tight-margin business, but huge.Online payment processors generally garner around 2.9% of a transaction value plus a 30-cent fee from merchants. They may pay partners, such as banks, to use their systems. ""It has to be a scale (volume) business to make it work,"" said Peterson.The good news is that e-commerce is booming. Global e-commerce sales will jump to $4 trillion by 2020, up from $2.35 trillion in 2017, accounting for nearly 15% of all retail spending worldwide, says research firm eMarketer.Competition is about to get even rougher.Amazon's U.S. patent for 1-Click technology, which stores payment and shipping information, expires in mid-September. When that happens, analysts say Visa (V), Mastercard (MA) and Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL) are expected to jump in with their own versions of the technology, intensifying the battle for merchants. While the credit card networks offer their own speedy online payment systems, such as Visa Checkout, they still require a user name and password to complete a transaction, while 1-Click does not.Amazon grew into an e-commerce giant by leveraging its 1-Click technology, rolled out in 1997. Apple (AAPL) licensed 1-Click for its app store, paying Amazon for the friction-free payment option.Keep Up With Stocks Near A Buy Zone At IBDMore recently, Amazon has been using 1-Click to attract merchants to its payments platform. If online shoppers log in to their Amazon accounts at third-party websites, 1-Click speeds up the checkout process. Partners include luxury retailer Moda Operandi, Nine West and L'Occitane.Amazon in February announced that 33 million consumers are using its payments service at both its site and third-party sites, up from 23 million a year earlier. That still trails PayPal's 210 million active customer accounts worldwide. Amazon reported earnings late Thursday and fell far short on earnings views due to high expenses.As digital-payment rivals target merchants, they're tapping a new tool — loans. Banks have stepped back from lending to small businesses since the 2008 recession. But Amazon, Square and PayPal have expanded their lending. Shopify (SHOP), a provider of e-commerce platforms that uses Stripe technology, has jumped into the lending game, too.Amazon in early June said its lending to small businesses has topped $3 billion, including $1 billion in loans over the last 12 months. Some 20,000 small businesses have received loans ranging from $1,000 to $750,000. Amazon uses internal data to identify creditworthy clients.PayPal in May announced that it has issued more than $3 billion in loans to 115,000 businesses globally since 2013. Square's lending has topped $1.5 billion over three years.One weapon that Square has been able to wield is making credit-card readers that plug into mobile phones and tablets, such as Apple's iPad. That enables Square to drill down deeply into the small-business realm by targeting ""micro-merchants"" — very small entities that may not have accepted credit cards previously. A handyman, lunch-truck operator or masseuse might be among them.Square in March unveiled a new platform enabling its retail customers to process payments on custom websites, getting into competition with Stripe and PayPal. Jordan McKee, analyst at 451 Research, says payment processors aim to add higher-margin products.""Everyone wants to be a solutions provider,"" said McKee. ""The payments space is difficult. Margins are very slim. It's a game of scale. These companies are using payment processing as a linchpin to offer software-based services with higher margins that are sticky.""""Payments is a hard business to make money in. But if you can offer software with monthly fees and get recurring revenue then you build a bigger business,"" he added.What companies will find long-term success? It's hard to say, but here's a snapshot of new developments involving three big digital-payment players that illustrate the industry stakes, strategies and ambitions.The iPhone maker says Apple Pay, the mobile payments service rolled out in 2014, is on track to be accepted at 50% of U.S. retailers by year-end. ""It's a commendable milestone but pales in comparison to the ubiquity of Visa and MasterCard in physical stores and PayPal (online) acceptance,"" said Josh Beck, a Pacific Crest Securities analyst in a report. Loup Ventures says only 13% of Apple's 680 million iPhone users have activated Apple Pay.Apple launched its first large-scale marketing campaign targeting mainland China in late July, notes research firm Analysys Mason. Apple has lagged in gaining traction vs. local mobile payment incumbents, Alipay and WeChat.Looking to gain traction with millennials, Apple in June introduced a rival to PayPal's Venmo and Square Cash, both person-to-person payment systems. Consumers link a bank account to a smartphone app and send money to friends or family using an email address.While the money-transfer services are mostly free for consumers, PayPal and Apple see the apps as acquisition and engagement tools. PayPal also aims to get fees from merchants that accept the money transfers as payment.The San Francisco-based startup maintains it has no plans to go public, despite speculation that it could pull the trigger next year. Stripe's latest funding round in December gave it a whopping $9.2 billion valuation. In all, Stripe has raised $440 million.Investors include American Express (AXP) as well as Visa, which has placed multiple online- and mobile-shopping bets, also investing in Sweden's Klarna and Square.Stripe's software enables companies to accept and track online payments made via credit or debit cards as well as smartphone apps and cyber-currencies such as Bitcoin. Stripe's customers build its tools into their own apps and websites. The tools help businesses bypass complex relationships with banks and older payment providers.Stripe's technology lets companies focus on their products rather than back-end payment processing. Customers include Salesforce.com (CRM), Uber-rival Lyft and Target (TGT). Stripe's closest rivals are PayPal's Braintree unit and Dutch startup Adyen.""Braintree and Stripe are similar animals,"" said Aite's Peterson. ""They take the payment processing load off of a merchant along with the risk. Both of them need to find ways to add value, to broaden their platform.""Stripe on July 10 unveiled a partnership with Alipay, part of Alibaba Group (BABA), and WeChat, part of Tencent Holdings (TCEHY), two of China's biggest digital-payment services. The deal gives Stripe access to hundreds of millions of Chinese consumers.Amid worries over competition from Apple, Amazon, and Stripe, PayPal has nonetheless raised 2017 revenue guidance and its three-year revenue outlook. Since spun off from eBay in 2015, PayPal has evolved from a payment button to a broad payments service provider, while expanding from online checkout to mobile payments.PayPal in February said one-third of all its transactions are now mobile while three-fourths of the top 100 online retailers accept PayPal. PayPal has forged new alliances with Visa, Mastercard, Google and Facebook (FB).Apple has also warmed up to PayPal. PayPal announced in early July that consumers in North America, Australia, Israel and seven European nations will be able to use their PayPal accounts for purchases across Apple platforms, including the App Store, Apple Music and iTunes.A deal with Amazon remains elusive.""Convincing Amazon to accept PayPal seems unlikely given it already has its own payments-tender type, its own private-label card, and it recently added a staged-wallet feature for Prime members, which we see as a direct threat to PayPal,"" said Thomas McCrohan, a Mizuho Securities analyst in a June 27 report. Pacific Crest Securities says PayPal could be a takeover target of several companies, though nothing seems imminent.More In-Depth AnalysisSmart Ideas In Artificial Intelligence And Early Investing Hot SpotsHere's One More Thing Amazon Is KillingFast Food Makes Its Biggest Change Since The Drive-Thru

317,TGT,"The ""Amazon (AMZN) effect"" is well documented. Foot traffic at brick-and-mortar stores across America are declining as people spend their dollars online.But it's also shaping what is perhaps the new normal among department stores and other retailers as they fight for market share through a beefier online presence.At Kohl's (KSS), sales for the key holiday quarter were ""weak,"" said CEO Kevin Mansell in the company's earnings release Thursday, as brick-and-mortar traffic declined. But that softness was ""offset somewhat by strength in online demand.""Kohl's shares fell 2.1% to 40.91 in the stock market today. For the key holiday quarter, total sales fell almost 3% to $6.21 billion, missing views for $6.22 billion, as comparable store sales drooped 2.2%. Per-share profit fell 9% to $1.44, besting expectations by 11 cents. Kohl's also raised its dividend by 10% to 55 cents.Fellow department store Macy's (M) logged similar Q4 results on Tuesday, with sales and comps down but ""double-digit growth"" in its online business.Wal-Mart (WMT) on Tuesday boasted a 29% U.S. e-commerce gain as its overall 1% revenue gain came up short.Soft in store, strong online is a recurring theme. Target's (TGT) November-December comparable store sales fell 3% as digital sales popped 30%. (That discounter reports next week.)But online sales are still a fraction of traditional stores' business, so it's hard for even strong e-commerce gains to move the needle.IBD'S TAKE: In an e-commerce-driven consumer landscape, the raison d'etre of malls is waning. Some shopping arenas are calling on mayhem and drama to boost foot traffic.Reducing store count is one way to combat crummy foot traffic. Kohl's said it closed 19 locations in 2016 and opened nine small-format locations, as well as a number of outlets.Macy's is 66 stores into its 100-store closure plan. The rest will be shuttered over the next few years. That will give the department store operator a ""healthy physical portfolio"" that will complement its growing online sales, said CEO Terry Lundgren on the Macy's earnings call on Tuesday.But the kicker is: as department stores close more stores, that may only in turn weigh on their e-commerce sales.""Our customers buying online love to return in store,"" said Macy's CFO Karen Hoguet on the same call. ""They love to shop in store, buy online. So we are, I think, forever going to lose some of that Macys.com business when we close a single-store market.""Macy's shares rose 0.3% on Thursday but are continuing to find resistance at their 50-day line.Wal-Mart has taken a slightly different tack with its acquisition of smaller Amazon rival Jet.com and its push into online groceries. That helped drive its strong online sales gain as the big box retailer also gave bullish overall revenue guidance. Wal-Mart's 29% online sales gain is faster than Amazon's overall revenue growth of 22%, and that's flattered by its Amazon Web Services cloud division.""We're the second-largest U.S. online retailer by revenue, one of the top three online retailers by traffic and our Wal-Mart app is among the top three apps in retail,"" said Wal-Mart CEO Doug McMillon on the call Tuesday.Wal-Mart shares fell 0.6% on Thursday but are still up solidly for the week.Wal-Mart recently dropped its Amazon Prime membership rival and announced that it would offer free two-day shipping for minimum orders of $35. Amazon this week dropped its free shipping minimum order to $35 for non-Prime members, but deliveries will take five to eight business days.Meanwhile, faster fashion and athleisure — two other ongoing trends — appear to be on the minds of Kohl's execs going into the new fiscal year.""In 2017, we will accelerate our focus on becoming the destination for active and wellness with the launch of Under Armour (UAA) in early March,"" said Mansell. ""We will also extend our efforts on improving our speed to market across all of our proprietary brands into all apparel areas and home.""Kohl's said it expects $3.50 to $3.80 in diluted per-share earnings for fiscal 2017 and a 1.3% decline to 0.7% growth in total sales, vs Wall Street forecasts for $3.73 EPS on flattish sales.Comps are expected to range from a decline of 2% to flat sales for the year.Nordstrom (JWN) reported so-so results and guidance late Thursday. The upscale department store said Nordstrom.com sales topped $2.5 billion in 2016, more than 17% of total revenue.

319,TGT,"General Electric (GE) CFO Jeffrey Bornstein said Wednesday that some industries ""will sit on their hands waiting"" and not invest unless lawmakers deliver promised changes to taxes and regulations and provide more clarity on health care policy.The warning comes as House Republicans' corporate tax revamp is running into opposition in Congress, as more GOP lawmakers balk at a proposed import tax that's seen as a key piece of the overhaul. President Trump has yet to unveil his own tax plan. And while Trump also wants to repeal and replace ObamaCare, some Republicans have turned squeamish about sweeping changes to the health law.At the Barclays Industrial Select conference in Miami, Bornstein said he is ""reasonably confident"" that the changes will get passed in 2017, but said investors could be ""very disappointed"" if they aren't.""If we don't get corporate tax reform across the goal line in 2017,  if we don't provide some visibility to where health care is going in 2017, and if we don't deliver on all the regulatory changes the administration has talked about in 2017, I think we could end up in a very difficult place,"" he said.On Tuesday, GE CEO Jeffrey Immelt — along with CEOs from Boeing (BA), United Technologies (UTX) and other industrial exporters, as well as drugmakers Celgene (CELG), Eli Lilly (LLY), Merck (MRK) and Pfizer (PFE) — wrote a letter urging congressional support for the House's tax reform blueprint, which includes a border adjustment tax.A total of 16 companies signed the letter, but more than 100 companies (including Wal-Mart (WMT), Target (TGT) and Nike (NKE)) and dozens of trade groups have signed on to Americans for Affordable Products, a group created to oppose the import tax.GE shares fell 0.6% to 30.33 on the stock market today. Boeing shares were off 0.1%. United Tech rose 0.1%.Last month, as talk of repealing ObamaCare began ramping up, GE's Immelt also indicated that some customers could become more cautious.""If I took it by segment, the Affordable Care Act is getting the most attention in the media and by our customers,"" he said on a conference call after reporting mixed Q4 results. ""I think you could see some caution around the Affordable Care Act as you go forward. We haven't really seen that much. But that could happen.""Trump said at a rally in Florida over the weekend that a replacement plan for ObamaCare won't be coming for ""a couple of weeks."" He warned earlier that the process could last until next year.Meanwhile, markets are still waiting for the White House to detail its own tax proposals, as those from congressional Republicans take more flak.Last week, Trump told retail CEOs that a ""massive"" tax plan will come ""in the not-too-distant future."" That followed his remarks to airline CEOs in the prior week, when he vowed to announce something ""phenomenal in terms of tax"" in the coming weeks.RELATED: If Border Tax Dies, Trump Corporate Tax Cut May CollapseTrump Silent On Ex-Im Bank, Hints At 'Big' Boeing Super Hornet Order

320,TGT,"Security stocks in general rose Tuesday as analysts weighed in with upbeat reviews for last week's RSA Conference, one of the security software sector's biggest annual events.Proofpoint (PFPT) retook a buy point Tuesday, while Palo Alto Networks (PANW) was eyeing one.IBD's 27-company Computer Software-Security industry group came within pennies of a more than two-month high in early trading in the stock market today, and it was up 0.6% at the close Tuesday. The group ranks just No. 125 out of 197 groups, but that's up from No. 175 eight weeks ago and No. 151 four weeks ago.IBD'S TAKE: Security software isn't currently a hot industry, but there always are some hot groups, and you can go in-depth on the top industries by tracking IBD's Industry Snapshot feature.Analysts in general expect security software companies to rebound in 2017 after a soft 2016. Security spending cooled off in 2016 after a series of high-profile breaches at Target (TGT) and JPMorgan (JPM), among others, sparked a big jump in security spending in 2014 and '15.""Security remains a top priority for IT, and budgets are growing,"" Rosenblatt Securities analyst Marshall Senk wrote in a research report Tuesday. ""Our research points to the majority of organizations with budget increases.""Said William Blair analyst Jonathan Ho in his report Tuesday: ""We attended the RSA Conference last week and came away incrementally positive on the cybersecurity space, based on our meetings with public and private companies.""Proofpoint stock ended trading Tuesday up 2.1% to close at 83.56. That's back within the buy zone from a breakout last month at 82.81, out of a cup-with-handle base. Shares are trading near two-month highs.Ho praised new features launched by the company.""Proofpoint released new features for its social media product to broaden its reach to the digital media market,"" he wrote. ""The new solution includes capabilities to monitor URLs and websites for potential spoofing and trademark infringement from malicious users.""Senk cited Proofpoint product partnerships with the likes of Palo Alto, Splunk (SPLK) and CyberArk Software (CYBR), saying that ""the partnering strategy, driven
"
321,TGT,"around deep partner integration, is beginning to pay dividends.""Palo Alto Networks stock, meanwhile, rose 0.7% Tuesday, to 155.80. But it was up just a fraction Tuesday afternoon, near 155. The stock has been forming a cup base with a buy point of 165.79.Speaking of Palo Alto, Senk wrote that ""we look for another transitional quarter on the product side, with partners reporting stronger pipeline builds for both the back half of this year (July) and into F18."" The company's fiscal year ends on or near July 31.Ho, too, praised Palo Alto's product announcements at RSA, a five-day event in San Francisco that ended Friday.Ho said the event attracted more than 43,000 attendees, easily topping last year's record attendance of around 40,000. The show also attracted more than 550 exhibitors, he said, which he said included nearly 120 first-time exhibitors.RELATED:Cloud, IoT, Arby's Hack Featured At RSA'Nimble' Proofpoint Takes Market Share

322,TGT,"CEOs of Dow stocks General Electric (GE), Boeing (BA) and 14 other big U.S. exporters are warning that unless Republicans embrace a controversial tax on imports, a once-in-a-generation chance at tax reform will fail and American workers would be the losers.""Our tax code penalizes American workers who make products or provide services sold abroad, while favoring their international competitors,"" the CEOs wrote in a letter to leaders of both parties in Congress.Among other companies whose CEOs co-signed the letter were Caterpillar (CAT), Dow Chemical (DOW), Raytheon (RTN), United Technologies (UTX), Oracle (ORCL) and some of the biggest drug and biotech companies: Celgene (CELG), Eli Lilly (LLY), Merck (MRK) and Pfizer (PFE).Caterpillar, Merck, Pfizer and United Technologies also are members of the Dow Jones industrial average, in addition to General Electric and Boeing.The letter puts some of the largest U.S. companies squarely behind House Speaker Paul Ryan and other House GOP leaders, who argue that leveling the international playing field by cutting the U.S. corporate tax rate to 20% (or lower) will be impossible without their plan for a 20% tax on imports, which would raise $1 trillion over a decade.Yet the biggest surprise about the letter may be just how few companies signed it, while more than 100 companies, including Wal-Mart (WMT), Target (TGT), Nike (NKE) and the American subsidiary of Toyota (TM), and dozens of trade groups have signed onto the Americans for Affordable Products, created to oppose the House border tax proposal. (Wal-Mart and Nike are also Dow industrials stocks.)Retail stocks were under pressure from early December, as prospects for a border tax were on the rise, but they've made a modest recovery lately as prospects faded. On Tuesday, perhaps helped more by Wal-Mart's positive earnings report as well-received Macy's (M) earnings than weighed down by a revved-up lobbying campaign for the tax, retail shares were on rise. Wal-Mart rose 3% to close at 71.45 on the stock market today, while Target added 0.6%.IBD'S TAKE: Supporters of the border tax plan say that the dollar would rise by 20% vs. other currencies, meaning that it wouldn't harm either corporate profits or consumers. But it does pose a risk to U.S. investors holding shares of companies like Alibaba or international ETFs.Under the House proposal for a border-adjusted tax, U.S. companies would pay a 20% tax rate on the full value of imported goods, while export revenue would be tax-free. The border tax would raise more than $1 trillion over a decade to offset the cost of lowering the 35% statutory tax rate to 20%, the conservative Tax Foundation has said.Without the border tax, the ability of Congress to reduce the U.S. corporate tax rate will be limited to ""incremental tweaks (that) will not level the playing field for American workers or dramatically reinvigorate economic growth,"" the CEO letter said.It's not clear precisely why so few companies came out in favor of the border tax. Although the proposal seems to be running into a buzz saw among Republicans in the Senate, it's possible that the letter wasn't widely circulated. However, Caroline Freund, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, has predicted that ""many more big lobbies will be against the BAT (border-adjusted tax) than in favor."" That's because the tax favors labor-intensive industries that export more than they import, with aerospace being a rare example.There's one nagging question about why companies such as GE and Boeing that are so dependent upon exports would back the border tax. Most trade experts who have looked at the tax have big doubts that it would comply with World Trade Organization rules, so it could lead the U.S. into a trade war. Given that uncertainty and the possible consequences, it's hard to understand why companies so dependent upon trade would support the border tax, yet that may partly explain why the list of supporters is so small.RELATED:If Border Tax Dies, Trump Corporate Tax Cut May Collapse GOP Border-Tax Plan Would Sock U.S. Tourism — Including Trump Hotels

324,TGT,"Wal-Mart Stores (WMT) reportedly is not considering an offer for Whole Foods Market (WFM), dashing hopes that the retail giant could spark a bidding war after Amazon's (AMZN) $13.7 billion deal for the high-end grocer.As of Friday, Whole Foods also has not received any bids countering the Amazon offer, sources told Reuters.Whole Foods stock vaulted nearly 20% last week after Amazon reached a deal to buy the grocer for $42 a share. The stock extended gains this week amid hopes of a bidding war for the natural foods company.In addition to Wal-Mart, Kroger (KR) and Target (IBD) were said to be on the list of potential bidders.Shares of Whole Foods closed 0.6% lower at 42.94 on the stock market today, after rising as much as 43.84 intraday, and lost another 0.1% in late trade.

325,TGT,"Amazon (AMZN) sparked mass panic in the grocery and retail space when the e-commerce giant said it was buying Whole Foods Market (WFM), but everyone should calm down and stop clutching their pearls about megaretailer Wal-Mart (WMT), argues Moody's.X ""While the deal will certainly help Amazon's competitive position in the grocery business, the proposed deal still falls well short of being a real threat to Walmart, which remains the world's biggest retailer and grocer,"" wrote Moody's analyst Charles O'Shea on Wednesday, adding that Wal-Mart is expanding its footprint at a time when other brick-and-mortars are shrinking.He sees Wal-Mart's food business accelerating at a quick clip, highlighting the company's in-store pickup feature as its ""latest weapon."" Wal-Mart CFO Brett Biggs said in May that the company's online grocery service had expanded to 670 locations.For the select areas where Walmart Grocery is available, many shoppers can get same-day delivery, similar to Amazon's grocery-delivery service, Amazon Fresh. And Wal-Mart's Jet.com acquisition last year for over $3 billion has helped the retailer try to keep pace with Amazon's sprawling e-commerce tentacles.IBD'S TAKE: As Whole Foods' share price creeps higher than the 42-per-share that Amazon offered, some speculate that Amazon may not even be the final bidder: Whole Foods Stock Signals Another Bidder Is Coming, But Who?Notably, even with the pickup of 460 Whole Foods stores, Amazon still doesn't have the on-the-ground reach of Wal-Mart's more-than-5,300 physical locations (including Sam's Club). Biggs has also said that 90% of Americans have access to the big-box store within a 10-mile radius.""Our view for the short to medium term is that for Walmart this moves the competitive needle a mere smidge,"" said O'Shea in a separate note out Wednesday. ""Realistically speaking, a challenged $16 billion food retailer is merely changing owners. And Walmart, already the world's largest retailer, also is the world's biggest grocer.""Amazon, an IBD Leaderboard stock, rose 1% to 1,002.23 in the stock market today.

326,TGT,"Costco Wholesale (COST) reported 7% sales growth in June to $12.17 billion and 6.5% in same-store sales growth for the month excluding gas prices and currency. But big questions remain about how the membership discounter will thrive as Amazon (AMZN) buys Whole Foods Market (WFM) and roils ever more retail sector.XFor the five-week period in June, Costco's U.S. same-store sales grew 6.3%, above consensus of 3.7%, according to Stifel. Core Canada comps rose 6.8% and other international comps grew 7.1%. There are 734 Costco warehouses worldwide; 511 of them are in the U.S. and Puerto Rico.The U.S. comp included 4.5% U.S. customer traffic, which BMO Capital Markets analyst Kelly Bania said is ""particularly impressive considering the continued challenging trends experienced across other parts of retail and Amazon fears.""She maintained an outperform rating and 185 price target.Costco shares fell 0.6% to 157.09 in the stock market today after trading at 161.35 soon after the market open. The stock is well below its 200-day and 50-day moving averages after plunging on June 16, the day Amazon announced its acquisition of Whole Foods Market, a move that caused panic throughout the retail and grocery sphere.Costco's June results appear to have bolstered Wall Street's confidence in the members-only retailer.""We also think the results indicate Costco can coexist with large hard line competitors like Wal-Mart and have limited cannibalization from Amazon,"" wrote Stifel's Mark Astrachan late Wednesday.Other grocery names haven't shaken off the hit. Kroger (KR) remains below its 50-day and 200-day, sinking 18.9% on its June 15 earnings report and another 9.2% the following day on the Amazon-Whole Foods announcement.Sprouts Farmers Market (SFM) managed to retake its 200-day but remains below its 50-day.

Job growth was solid amid a variety of upbeat June economic data.XThe Nasdaq rose 0.2% for the week after hitting its lowest levels since May 19. The S&P 500 closed below its 50-day on Thursda but rallied for a 0.1% weekly gain. The Dow industrials, buoyed by financial components, hit an all-time high Monday and was closed the week up 0.3%, even as General Electric (GE) and Verizon (VZ) dived to 21-month lows. Tesla plunged amid weak Q2 deliveries, Model 3 news and a less-than-stellar safety rating. The latest Federal Reserve and European Central Bank meeting minutes indicated that policymakers are moving toward tightening policy, weighing on stocks and lifting global bond yields.The U.S. added 222,000 jobs in June, more than 170,000 expected, while April and May payrolls were revised higher. The jobless rate unexpectedly ticked up to 4.4% as more people looked for work. Average hourly wages advanced 0.2%, a little less than expected. Meanwhile, the ISM manufacturing index for June rose to the best in years while the ISM nonmanufacturing gauge showed still-strong expansion.For the second straight week, U.S. investors paid more attention to the European Central Bank than to the Federal Reserve. Both central banks released minutes from their June meetings.Economists interpreted the Fed minutes as indicating a bit more uncertainty about whether inflation will rebound and, thus, about the Fed's rate trajectory. Still, absent a surprise, the Fed seems likely to announce in September that it will gradually scale back its $4.5 trillion balance sheet, inflated with Treasury and mortgage bonds purchased in response to the financial crisis.The ECB's policy signals have been jarring because they represent a pretty dramatic, if gradual, potential change from the central bank's long-running asset-purchase program.ECB President Mario Draghi indicated last week that the eurozone monetary authority could begin scaling back its asset buys, which economists now expect to happen by early 2018. The ECB minutes from the June 7-8 meeting revealed that policymakers discussed dropping language from future meeting statements saying that they're prepared to reverse course and increases asset purchases if conditions demand.Tesla CEO Elon Musk announced that the closely watched Model 3 has passed all regulatory inspections, signaling that production will start Friday and announcing a ""handover party"" on July 28 for the first 30 customers.

General Motors (GM), Ford Motor (F) and Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) saw sales drop 5%, 5% and 7% respectively year over year, while Toyota Motor (TM), Nissan (NSANY) and Honda Motor (HMC) grew sales modestly. Overall, the industry posted its sixth straight month of falling or flat sales, despite higher use of incentives. Consumers continued to spurn the car segment for SUVs, crossovers and trucks. Sales of new vehicles have slowed this year as freshly off-lease vehicles have flooded the market. Even the red-hot SUV segment is starting to show softness. June sales came in at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 16.4 million, the lowest rate of the year.An eight-day win streak came to sharp end on Wednesday, while even a sharp drop in U.S. crude and gasoline inventories couldn't give prices much of a boost. U.S. crude fell 3.9% to $44.23 a barrel for the week. The Energy Information Administration said U.S. crude stockpiles fell by 6.3 million barrels last week vs. analyst expectations for a 2.3 million barrel draw. Gasoline supplies dropped by 3.7 million barrels, also more than expected. But domestic crude production bounced back to 9.34 million barrels per day after falling to 9.25 million BPD in the prior week.

Analysts estimate revenue of $44.7 billion, which would be up 25% from Q4 2015 and maintain a steady string of double-digit growth going back more than four years. Analysts expect earnings per share minus items to rise 35% to $1.35.RBC analyst Mark Mahaney, in addition to his outperform rating, set a price target on Amazon of 950.Amazon stock lost 0.8% to close at 823.48 on the stock market today.IBD'S TAKE: Amazon is gaining ground in large retail markets beyond its core markets of electronics and media, putting the e-commerce giant in position for a strong performance in 2017.Mahaney, in a research note, said foreign currency exchange rates could mean ""greater than normal risk to Wall Street estimates"" on operating income for Q4 and Q1, despite signs of a strong holiday sales season for Amazon.Amazon is also investing heavily in India and other international markets, as well as building multiple fulfillment centers and investing heavily in original video content and other projects, all of which will continue to weigh on profitability, he wrote.But Amazon remains a core long-term hold, Mahaney wrote, saying its two key markets — e-commerce and cloud computing — are only about 10% penetrated, with the company posting year-over-year growth rates that are ""extremely consistent and inherently very impressive.""Needham analyst Kerry Rice, in a research note, said he expects Amazon to meet earnings estimates, but not beat. Overall e-commerce sales growth during the holiday sales season only met expectations, ""given the slower-than-expected start as consumers focused their attention on the presidential election instead of holiday shopping,"" he wrote.Rice also agreed that foreign exchange headwinds ""could limit growth upside."" Rice has a hold rating on Amazon stock.In addition, Rice wrote, ""We believe a more competitive landscape could slow the rate of Amazon's market share expansion.""Wal-Mart (WMT) and Target (TGT), he wrote, are gaining ground in e-commerce sales. Wal-Mart has added to its e-commerce strength with its $3.3 billion acquisition of Jet.com.Rice also says that Amazon's Q1 operating guidance could disappoint, as the company remains in a heavy investment cycle.But in a research note late Sunday, Pacific Crest Securities said Amazon was the clear sales winner this holiday season, which should dampen concerns that its continued heavy investments could cause an earnings miss. Pac Crest also said growth and profit margins for the company's cloud business, Amazon Web Services, ""should remain robust despite pricing fears.""Among other internet stocks, Facebook (FB) is set to report earnings after the market close on Wednesday.Wall Street expects Facebook to report revenue growth of 46% to $8.5 billion — the second quarter in a row of revenue deceleration, attributable in part to a deliberate move by Facebook to cool the growth in advertising to avoid saturation, analysts have said.

Kraft Heinz (KHC) is pursuing a mammoth deal for Unilever (UN). NetEase (NTES), Cisco Systems (CSCO) and NetApp (NTAP) rallied on earnings, while General Motors (GM) may sell its European unit Opel.The Dow industrials and Nasdaq composite rose 1.8% for the week, with the S&P 500 added 1.5%, all hitting new highs during the week. Apple was a key contributor to all the major indexes. Fed Chair Janet Yellen's somewhat hawkish tone didn't worry investors, but gave bond yields and bank stocks a boost.""Waiting too long to remove accommodation would be unwise,"" Fed chief Janet Yellen told Congress, a shift from her 2016 tone emphasizing downside risks to the economy. Yellen, along with other Fed officials speaking during the week, raised the odds of a near-term hike slightly. Markets don't expect a March move but see a 50-50 move by May and a strong likelihood by June.  Yellen warned against repealing financial regulations passed after the credit crisis.Meanwhile, retail sales and inflation data were stronger than expected, while small-business optimism hit a fresh 12-year high and the Philly Fed manufacturing index shot up to its strongest reading since 1984.RELATED:Worries over intensified wireless competition pressured phone company stocks after Verizon Communications (VZ) reintroduced unlimited data plans nearly six years after removing them. Verizon sought an edge over T-Mobile (TMUS) and Sprint (S) by offering high-definition video as part of unlimited data. T-Mobile quickly changed its offer to include HD video. Sprint cut its unlimited price to $50 a month or $90 for two users, including HD video. AT&T (T) opened unlimited wireless beyond DirecTV and U-verse customers. Analysts say industry consolidation could ease competition. Merger talks are expected to heat up when a government spectrum auctions ends, perhaps by late March.RELATED:T-Mobile (TMUS) on Feb. 14 reported Q4 profit and revenue that edged views. For 2017, it forecast branded postpaid subscriber additions of 2.9 million, below estimates. Analysts called the guidance conservative, though in any event T-Mobile will likely lead industry subscriber growth for the fourth year in a row in 2017. For the first time, T-Mobile provided free cash flow guidance. It forecast three-year FCF annual growth of 45% to 48%, or about $4.5 billion by 2019.Softbank is willing to give up control of its majority-owned Sprint to achieve a merger with T-Mobile, Reuters reported Friday. Sprint rose 3.3% on Friday and T-Mobile 5.5%, with AT&T and Verizon rising modestly that day.RELATED:Apple, the top Dow industrials stock in 2017, hit a record high of 136.27 on news reports related to its cash-return plans and the upcoming iPhone 8. Apple reportedly increased its order of OLED displays from Samsung for its 10th-anniversary smartphone, due out in September. CFO Luca Maestri said Apple would look to boost dividends and buybacks if the U.S. cuts corporate tax rates, as expected under President Trump.RELATED:Kraft Heinz (KHC) signaled it will continue to pursue the European consumer and food products giant even though Unilever (UN) said the offer undervalued the company and sees no reason for further talks. A combination would be one of the largest of all time and create a global food giant. Kraft Heinz, which has been slashing costs to boost profit, shot up 10.6% Friday to a record high. Unilever leapt 15.3% to 48.79, also setting a record best. Snacks giant Mondelez (MDLZ) fell. Consumer products firms such as Kimberly-Clark (KMB) rallied.RELATED:President Trump on Wednesday met with CEOs from Target (TGT), Gap (GPS), AutoZone (AZO) and other retailers, saying he would cut regulations and encouraging them to expand in the U.S. Trump also said a ""massive"" tax plan was coming ""in the not-too-distant future."" Target, afterward, warned that a GOP plan for a border adjustment tax as part of corporate tax reform would force them to ""raise prices for American families on everyday essentials."" That subject came up during the meeting, although it was unclear how much of a focus it was.RELATED:Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) gobbled up shares of Apple (AAPL) in Q4, quadrupling its holdings, according to a regulatory filing. He also continued to fill up on Delta Air Lines (DAL), American Airlines (AAL) and United Airlines (UAL). David Einhorn's Greenlight Capital also boosted its stake in Apple. Appaloosa cut its stake in the iPhone maker but hiked its stake in Southwest (LUV). George Soros took stakes in Facebook (FB), Goldman Sachs (GS) and Delta, but dropped United. Activist investor Trian Fund Management built up a $3.5 billion position in Procter & Gamble (PG).RELATED:The Chinese mobile gaming giant late Wednesday reported Q4 earnings per American depositary receipt of $4.40 minus items on revenue of $1.74 billion, both well above the analyst consensus. Online game revenue rose 63% in local currency to $1.29 billion. NetEase said it added 40 mobile titles in 2016, and in December it announced 14 new PC and mobile games. NetEase licenses many games from Activision Blizzard (ATVI), including ""World of Warcraft"" and ""Overwatch."" NetEase stock leapt 14% on Thursday to a record high after edging past a buy point earlier in the week.RELATED: In its fiscal Q2 ended Jan. 28, Cisco earned 57 cents per share minus items, flat from a year earlier but topping views by a penny. Revenue fell 2% to $11.58 billion, the fifth straight decline, but that beat expectations of $11.55 billion. Cisco's deferred revenue from software and subscriptions jumped 51% to $4 billion in fiscal Q2, a sign that its shift to software and services from its core business of selling network switches and routers is gaining momentum. Cisco shares rose 7%, hitting their best levels since November 2007.RELATED:Chip gear maker Applied Materials (AMAT) earned 67 cents a share ex items in its fiscal Q1, up 158% year over year, on sales of $3.28 billion, up 45%. Analysts expected 66 cents and $3.27 billion. It was Applied Materials' fourth straight quarter of accelerating sales and EPS growth. For fiscal Q2, Applied Materials sees strong earnings and sales growth that are above Wall Street models. Applied Materials shares rose 1%, near 16-year highs.RELATED:Data storage systems provider NetApp reported earnings and guidance that topped views.

Saudi Arabia had the biggest decline in output. U.S. crude stockpiles jumped by 9.5 million barrels, according to the Energy Information Administration, well above analyst estimates. But stocks at the Cushing, Okla., hub were down. The number of U.S. oil rigs in operation rose yet again. Diamondback Energy (FANG) reported Q4 results above Wall Street views and raised its full-year production outlook and capital-spending target. Devon Energy (DVN) also reported Q4 results above expectations.RELATED:Peugeot's parent, PSA Group, said it was in talks with General Motors (GM) about potentially acquiring the U.S. automaker's Opel division, which also includes the British Vauxhall brand. The deal would give PSA Group a 16% market share in Europe, second only to Volkswagen (VLKAY). GM has had trouble turning a profit at the unit and had a tentative deal in 2009 to sell it to Canada's Magna.RELATED:One big health insurance merger, between Aetna (AET) and Humana (HUM), is dead, while the other, between Anthem (ANTM) and Cigna (CI), broke out into a wrestling match. Federal judges blocked both deals earlier this year. Cigna sued Anthem for $13 billion in damages on top of a $1.85 billion breakup fee. But a judge blocked Cigna from ending the merger after Anthem countersued, arguing that Cigna has tried to sabotage the deal.Humana, which gets a $1 billion payment from Aetna for its trouble, moved on by announcing a stock buyback and saying it will exit the ObamaCare exchanges. Aetna's CEO said the ObamaCare exchanges are in a death spiral. And Molina Health (MOH) signaled it would likely exit the ObamaCare exchanges next year.UnitedHealth (UNH) tumbled 3.7% Friday on news that the Justice Department has joined a whistleblower suit accusing the health insurer of overcharging Medicare Advantage by hundreds of millions of dollars, possibly billions of dollars. Other health insurers, including Aetna and Humana also retreated Friday.RELATED:DOJ Accuses UnitedHealth Of Overcharging Medicare AdvantageSnap (SNAP), in an updated SEC filing, says it's looking to 200 million shares at a price range of 14 to 16 a share, raising roughly $3 billion. That would give it a valuation of $19.5 billion to $22.2 billion, below earlier reports that the Snapchat parent would seek $25 billion. Snapchat enjoys rapid revenue growth, but Facebook (FB) is successfully imitating Snapchat features, especially on its Instagram app.RELATED:U.S. Steel (X) flirted with a buy point during the week while Steel Dynamics (STLD) and Nucor (NUE) and aluminum maker Alcoa (AA) jumped on reports that China is considering sweeping production cuts to combat smog. Reuters reported that China could slash steel capacity by at least half and aluminum capacity by 30% in certain months.Cement and aggregates firms, like steel companies, are expected to benefit from President Trump's infrastructure push, as well as a multibillion-dollar wall on the border, but that won't help 2017 results much. Martin Marietta Materials (MLM) on Tuesday missed fourth-quarter earnings and sales estimates and gave a subdued 2017 outlook.RELATED:Las-Vegas-centric MGM Resorts International (MGM) turned profitable in Q4, reversing a year-earlier loss, but missed estimates, while revenue was in line. Melco Crown Entertainment (MPEL), which operates out of gaming hub Macau and elsewhere in Asia, topped views on sales but missed on EPS. Macau has been trying to recover after the Chinese government launched an anti-money-laundering crackdown.  MGM fell 9.3% on Thursday to a three-month low. Melco fell 4.5% after briefly retaking a buy point in the morning.RELATED:ON Semiconductor (ON) rose 10.1% through Thursday, hitting its best levels since August 2000, after the chipmaker on Sunday reported adjusted EPS rose 53% and sales climbed 50%, both beating. Q1 guidance also was strong.Shopify (SHOP) hit a record high after the e-commerce platform provider reported Q4 earnings that topped views as revenue grew 86% to $130.4 million.

332,TGT,"A yawning trench of dirt, wood and exposed cables currently sits at the mouth of the Westfield Century City in west Los Angeles. The Apple (AAPL) store is still open and the Tesla (TSLA) showroom has been moved to a different spot, but much of the shopping center remains under construction.When it reopens this year, it will have expanded into a glamorous 1.2-million-square-foot beast of a mall — 422,000 square feet larger — complete with Italian food emporium Eataly, hip burger joint Shake Shack (SHAK) and ""new high-fashion streetside boutiques.""XIn fact, the Century City mall won't just be a mall, it will be ""an immersive sensory experience unprecedented in the modern retail space,"" according to a 2015 Westfield press release. This location hardly needs a tuneup. With $1,457 in sales per square foot, it is the ninth-most productive mall in the country, according to a CNBC story from May, citing real estate research firm Green Street Advisors. So why spend $800 million on a makeover?Looks matter more than ever, particularly as social-media bragging rights become an essential part of the millennial shopping experience. So these days, every retailer has to put on a good show, ramping up the drama to boost foot traffic and cheat death as Amazon (AMZN) spells doom for more and more American malls.""(Young people are) very into cataloging everything they do via social media, and so these more luxury experiences have more social currency,"" said Talmage Advisors CEO Liz Dunn.That could mean Snapchatting from inside a Tiffany (TIF) — regardless of whether you buy something — or taking a topside photo of your artisanal lunch. (Never has flat lay photography been so popular.)""Whatever it is, there's a lot more social currency to that than saying 'I'm at a TGI Friday's,' "" she said.The mall's transformation into an ""immersive sensory experience"" contrasts with the post-World War II bloom of malls, which attracted Americans to cookie-cutter hubs with their one-stop-shopping convenience. That has since given way to the splendid isolationism of two-day shipping via Amazon Prime, hollowing out traditional malls and forcing the survivors to become purveyors of experiences that can be shared online.Fellow L.A.-based shopping center The Grove, owned by Caruso, underscores the trend and is a social-media maven's dream.It houses many of the same stores as a regional mall does — like Banana Republic, J. Crew and Anthropologie — but also features a fountain, trolley and live music, helping put it at No. 2 on CNBC/Green Street Advisors' list with a $2,200 in sales per square foot. The photogenic plaza was even once the backdrop for Hollywood-gossip show ""Extra,"" which has no doubt upped its social cred among tourists who want a glimpse of glam.""This is where all the B-list celebs, YouTube stars, and Instagram influencers shop (I saw an Instagram male model there myself when I went),"" gushed one Yelp reviewer visiting from Toronto.The lure of exclusivity, that close cousin of luxury, is another way retailers have amped up the theatrics.It's a tactic long employed by an athletic-footwear industry that routinely releases shoes in small batches, driving up demand from sneakerheads and high-schoolers alike. There's even a sneaker stock exchange, StockX, devoted to the resale of Jordans, Kobes and anything Kanye has ever designed for Adidas.Other retailers have since caught on. Coach (COH) and Disney (DIS) last year introduced a limited-edition House of Mouse-themed handbag line. Spice Girl-turned-fashion designer Victoria Beckham is behind Target's (TGT) upcoming capsule collection. And H&M seems to have an endless series of designer linkups in the pipeline.The New York Times even declared 2016 ""the year of the drop,"" referring to the slew of limited-edition releases and pop-up shops, like Kylie Jenner's blink-and-it's-gone store, designed to create shopper frenzy.The Hollywood Reporter called the December opening of Jenner's pop-up, located within the Westfield Topanga Mall in Los Angeles' San Fernando Valley, ""mayhem.""Mayhem is the antithesis of convenience, when it comes to shopping. But that is the point. No one wants to stand in line outside for hours waiting for laundry detergent. A Kylie Lip Kit, however, is not long for this world.To get a teen or 20-something to the mall — and most ""drop"" shoppers are under 30, noted the Times — the mall must act a little more like a nightclub, velvet ropes and all.Even supermarkets are in on the action: Some Whole Foods Market (WFM), Kroger (KR) and Gelson's locations feature wine bars, a premium add-on meant to keep grocery shoppers in stores longer.Such theater may seem gimmicky, but it works, and is also being seen in actual theaters. The local cineplex, a requisite component of any shopping mall, is also undergoing a revamp.On the defensive from Netflix (NFLX) and massive TVs, theaters have been making screens bigger, audio better, and seats more spacious. And as an alternative to grabbing popcorn from the concession stand and trying to find a decent seat, more theaters now serve cocktails and dinner to your reserved Barcalounger while that summer blockbuster plays in Imax 3D.AMC (AMC), for example, embarked three years ago on a $600 million reseating project to rip out traditional chairs and replace them with recliners.AMC, which has called its collective upgrades a ""winning playbook,"" outlined at a recent presentation that attendance has grown 53% and revenue leapt 70% in its 1,500 or so reseated theaters. It has thousands more theaters in line to be updated.Top exhibitor chain Regal Cinemas (RGC) also recently attributed recent outperformance to plush seating, calling out recliner sites as the ""biggest driver.""""Theaters have to do something to differentiate themselves from the in-home experience,"" said RBC analyst Leo Kulp. ""That's really what's driven these investments over the past several years.""Theaters, full-service restaurants and other bells and whistles have woven themselves into a successful mall's narrative, but it may be a while before the experiential stuff surpasses retail stores that sell shirts and shoes.""The future will certainly bring less retail, but it will take a few years to tip the scale"" so that retailers become a mall's minority residents, said NPD Group retail analyst Marshal Cohen.There is also some hope for once-reliable mall anchors like Macy's (M) and Nordstrom (JWN), even as Macy's reportedly considers selling itself after a brutal holiday season.The Grove has a Nordstrom, and the revamped Westfield Century City is actually adding a department store to the mix, for a total of three major names. It will now house a two-story Macy's, three-story Bloomingdale's and a three-story Nordstrom that is being relocated from the next mall over.But the massive upgrades being made to shopping arenas could even further widen the gap between top-market malls and their less-moneyed brethren.Of the more-than-1,000 malls in America, the 300 or so top-market ""A-malls"" account for 75% of mall value (a metric comprised of sales productivity, size and other factors), according to Green Street Advisors.So what's a midtier mall to do? For developers, the answer may be: Change or die.Strong anchors are ""imperative"" for a shopping center's long-term viability, according to Green Street's 2017 mall outlook report, since income-generating tenants want malls with ""vibrant,"" traffic-driving anchors.As department stores waver, Green Street's research points to restaurants, movie theaters and ""traditional power-center tenants"" — like Ulta Beauty (ULTA), Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS) and pet stores — as rising power players.But Talmage Advisors' Dunn is not optimistic.""The problem is, it's a little bit of a self-fulfilling prophesy,"" she said. ""The landlords aren't willing to invest in the lower-tier centers, and the thing that would potentially take a lower-tier center to help it jump a bracket is investment. But it's hard to justify the investment if the center's performance isn't in that top-tier range.""

333,TGT,"Wal-Mart (WMT), Macy's (M), Gap (GPS) and other retailers rose Monday as investors sold ""Trump rally"" stocks and perhaps lowered the odds of tax reform that could sock merchants.Wal-Mart rose 1.2% on the stock market today. But that's after Wal-Mart hit eight-month low on Friday. Target (TGT) edged up 0.7%, Macy's 1.4%, Dollar Tree (DLTR) 1.6% and Gap 1.3%.Retailers tumbled at the end of last week after the White House hinted that it might back the House GOP tax reform plan that includes a 20% border-adjustment tax. House Republicans have said they see the border-adjusted tax, which applies to imports but not exports, as a critical part of tax reform because it would raise more than $1 trillion to help pay for slashing the corporate tax rate to 20%. Retailers, which are huge importers, fear the plan will slam their profits.President Trump's immigration order could end up hurting the odds of tax reform and other key parts of Trump's fiscal agenda. That's because with a thin GOP majority in the Senate, he can't afford to alienate potential allies.IBD'S TAKE: Apple and Boeing are among six Dow stocks in buy range to start the week. But three of these blue-chip stocks dipped below entry areas amid Monday's market retreat.Separate from Trump and his tax and trade policies, brick-and-mortar retailers face an near-existential crisis as shoppers continue to shift online. While Wal-Mart, Target and others are beefing up e-commerce efforts, Amazon (AMZN) appeared to dominate online holiday sales growth. Investors will get an idea of how strong Amazon was when it reports Q4 earnings late Thursday.Amazon shares fell 0.6% to 830.38 after briefly undercutting its 821.75 buy point intraday.RELATED:Why Trump Immigration Order May Weigh On StocksTrump Immigration Ban Sinks Delta, American, UnitedTrump Tax Fears: Wal-Mart, Target, Macy's Hit New Lows
"
334,TGT,"Republicans are beginning to coalesce around a high-risk strategy to deliver a major corporate tax cut that has remarkably high odds of blowing up on them.The White House signaled on Thursday that President Trump is seriously considering the House GOP plan to cut the corporate tax rate to 20% and cover much of the cost by imposing a 20% tax on imports, while making exports tax-free.The proposal faces a bruising political battle as major importers like Wal-Mart (WMT) and Target (TGT) warn that they — and their customers — could be slammed by what opponents have labeled a ""consumer tax"" on imported goods. Shares of Wal-Mart, Target and many retailers retreated on the stock market today, hitting multi-month or multi-year lows.While some economists are confident that the exchange rate between the dollar and other currencies would seamlessly adjust to neutralize the impact of the border tax, other economists and industry analysts warn of a potentially jarring impact. Prices could rise even on vehicles built in the U.S. by General Motors (GM) and Ford (F) because few models are composed of at least 75% domestically sourced parts. Goldman Sachs has warned that U.S. ""oil prices would appreciate immediately and sharply vs. global oil prices.""Expect Democrats to line up behind corporations warning that the poor and working class will bear the brunt of the GOP border tax — even though the tax-reform approach emerged from the George Soros-funded Center for American Progress and it might not sound so bad to labor unions.Yet concerns about price spikes aren't the primary risk. A gradual transition to the new tax regime likely could minimize near-term market disruptions, and the law could even include triggers to slow down a ramping up of the border tax if inflation starts to percolate.The real risk for Trump and Republicans is that the border-adjusted tax may violate World Trade Organization rules. A wide array of experts believe a negative WTO ruling is likely and even supporters say it's a real possibility.Republicans have said they're willing to take their chances at the WTO, and it's not hard to understand why they're willing to roll the dice. Without the $1 trillion-plus raised by the 20% border tax, Republican leaders see no palatable way of making a major cut in the corporate tax rate revenue neutral in the intermediate term, which is necessary to avoid a filibuster and pass via reconciliation.The border tax is the GOP's magic bullet that will pay to fix the U.S. corporate tax code and may even pay to build a wall on the border with Mexico. But what if there is no magic bullet? If the WTO declares the border tax to be illegal, the GOP would face three unpleasant choices: repeal the border tax and blow a bigger hole in the widening deficit; replace it with one of the options that Republicans are currently ruling out as untenable; or keep it in place and invite other countries to retaliate in ways that would hurt the U.S. economy.IBD'S TAKE: Big exporters like Boeing could have a negative tax rate under the GOP tax reform plan.This scenario isn't written in stone. The WTO could find that the border-adjusted tax regime complies with international trade rules. But with so much doubt about the outcome, the GOP is effectively jumping off a cliff and hoping that its parachute opens, much like it would be doing if it repeals ObamaCare before passing a replacement.The tax reform panel appointed by President George W. Bush considered a border-adjusted tax but eventually ruled it out, citing ""uncertainty over whether border adjustments would be allowable under current trade rules, and the possibility of challenge from our trading partners.""To understand why there's a good case the border-adjusted tax would violate WTO rules, consider first how White House press secretary Sean Spicer described the border tax on Thursday in discussing how a tax on imports from Mexico could pay for Trump's wall.Spicer said that applying a border adjustment tax, as ""the plan that's taking shape now"" would do, ""is, by the way, a practice that 160 other countries do.""Yet there's a distinct difference between the value added tax that 160 other countries impose and the border-adjusted tax that the White House is considering. The key is that other countries apply the VAT regardless of whether a product is imported or produced at home.By contrast, writes Caroline Freund of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, ""The cash-flow tax proposed in the House is discriminatory. The tax on domestically produced goods would be less than the tax on imports.""In fact, the very reason that the GOP finds this border-adjusted-tax acceptable is that — unlike a VAT — it doesn't apply to the wages involved in making or selling a product. Basically, the tax on imports would apply to the full value of an import, while the tax on domestic goods would only apply to the positive cash flow that is generated from the sale.If the WTO rejected the border-adjusted tax, the logical fix would be to remove the wage deduction, effectively turning the tax into a nondiscriminatory VAT, argues Freund. Yet, she adds, since shifting to a VAT would raise consumer prices and have a disproportionate impact on low-income and poor households, Congress would have to take steps to solidify the safety net.The problem with this scenario is that Republicans are terrified of a VAT, which they see as offering a slippery slope to keep raising taxes incrementally.It's not clear that the other main alternative to pay for a corporate tax cut — a big hike in taxes on capital gains and dividends — would be any more appetizing.How it all would play out is unpredictable, but it seems possible that the fallout could dent or upend the GOP majority. Meanwhile, the uncertainty could undo the positive effects corporate tax reform is supposed to have in making it more attractive to do business in the U.S.RELATED:Trump Backs 20% Import Tax To Pay For Border Wall — Or Not Trump Trade: What He Can Do Legally On Nafta, China, Mexico, Taxes

335,TGT,"XWhole Foods Market (WFM) shares continued to climb Monday, signaling increased belief that someone else could top the $13.7 billion Amazon.com (AMZN) deal for the high-end grocer.Barclays analyst Karen Short said she ""would not be surprised if there is a bidding war"" for Whole Foods, upgrading the high-end grocer to overweight from equal weight and raising her price target by 26% to 48, well above Amazon's announced acquisition price of 42 a share.A fresh bid could be as high as 57 a share, Short says, giving a big potential upside. Meanwhile, the regulatory risk for Amazon's deal is low, so the potential downside from buying Whole Foods shares is low in her view. And beyond fending off the e-commerce giant, Short added that a strategic retail bidder could create up to $600 million in synergies.Is this a plausible scenario? Barclays isn't the only one that seems to think so. Oppenheimer upped its price target to 45 on Friday, not long after the deal was announced, on the grounds that the deal undervalued Whole Foods' prospects and ""powerful brand."" Analysts there see a mid-40s-range buyout as more appropriate.Shares of Whole Foods Market rose 1.3% to 43.22 in the stock market today — even after closing up 29.1% on Friday to 42.68.So who, exactly, could pop out of the woodwork to beat Amazon's $13.7 billion offer? In Short's view, the list of suspects is long: ""all retailers that sell food and compete with (Amazon) because we think most have too much to lose not to bid."" Kroger (KR), Target (TGT) and Wal-Mart (WMT) are on that list.The nation's grocery chains and big-box stores have already lost a lot since Friday, as shares of Kroger, Target, Wal-Mart and Costco (COST) suffered mightily from the merger announcement.(The only grocery retailer that isn't getting further kicked Monday on news of the deal is Sprouts Farmers Market (SFM) — and that's likely because Oppenheimer pegged it as the next possible takeover target. Sprouts rose 3.5% on Monday.)Kroger rose 1.6%, but after crashing nearly 28% last week. Wal-Mart edged up 0.3% while Target fell 1.7%.Costco continues to suffer Monday, falling 2.7% to a 2017 low and undercutting its 200-day moving average. Deutsche Bank downgraded Costco to hold, citing intensifying competition from efforts by Amazon and Wal-Mart to ramp up their in-store and online business.The Whole Foods acquisition ""represents a game changer with (Costco's) competitive moat of grocery under greater threat while its digital platform lags peers, putting membership renewal at higher risk for decline,"" wrote Deutsche's Paul Trussell. He cut his price target on Costco to 172 from 187.Still, the membership warehouse's traffic and margins are solid, he said. And Cowen's Oliver Chen, who has an outperform rating on Costco, believes the retailer's vertical integration and low prices will continue to be brick-and-mortar traffic drivers.For his part, Chen isn't so sure that Costco would be interested in — or Target would be capable of — proposing a buyout for Whole Foods, and Wal-Mart might only have interest insomuch as a buyout would be a defensive measure. But he is wondering about Amazon's next shopping spree.""We believe there are likely capabilities, routes to market, and specialized brand propositions at retailers which could be synergistically combined with largely pure-play online retailers such as (Amazon),"" wrote Chen.Who? Why, Nordstrom (JWN), Urban Outfitters (URBN), Ascena Retail Group (ASNA) or even RH (RH) (formerly known as Restoration Hardware).Those might be some pretty unexpected names for a potential Amazon takeover — but then again, so was Whole Foods.RELATED:Are These Amazon's Next Five Targets?What Amazon's Whole Foods Deal Means For RetailAmazon-Whole Foods Merger Could Be 'Category Killer' For Food, Eateries

336,TGT,"Wal-Mart (WMT) beefed up its online portfolio Friday, announcing that it will acquire men's clothing retail startup Bonobos for $310 million in cash as it battles Amazon (AMZN) in the e-commerce market.The news coincided with Amazon's own acquisition of Whole Foods (WFM) for $13.7 billion Friday.Discount retailer Wal-Mart has been on a shopping spree of its own in the past year as it steps up its digital strategy. Last month, Wal-Mart-owned Jet.com announced it was buying ModCloth, a vintage-inspired women's apparel e-tailer. Earlier this year, Jet.com announced the acquisition of Shoebuy from IAC (IAC) for about $70 million, and Wal-Mart inked a deal to buy online outdoor retailer Moosejaw for $51 million. Wal-Mart purchased Jet.com in August 2016, and on Friday said the channel ""continues to provide a strong avenue for reaching an urban, millennial customer.""After the deal closes, Andy Dunn, founder and CEO of Bonobos, will oversee the company's online consumer brands and report to Marc Lore, the president and CEO of Wal-Mart U.S. e-commerce.""We're seeing momentum in the business as we expand our value proposition with customers and it's incredible to see how fast we're moving,"" Lore said Friday.In its most recent quarter, Wal-Mart saw 63% growth in U.S. e-commerce sales, the majority coming from organic growth in Walmart.com. Since the start of 2017, Walmart.com has unveiled two-day free shipping with no membership fee, extra discounts for picking up orders in stores and easy ordering online and in stores.The Bonobos deal is subject to regulatory approval and is expected to close near the end of the second quarter or the start of the third quarter of this fiscal year, Wal-Mart said.Shares of Wal-Mart plunged 4.6% to 75.26 on the stock market today, gapping down below their 50-day line.

337,TGT,"X Unhinge jaw, devour Whole Foods Market (WFM). Amazon's (AMZN) latest acquisition is its largest ever at $13.7 billion, and one that promises to shake up the retail space — though exactly how is unclear.A combined Amazon and Whole Foods Market would create the fifth largest U.S. grocery retailer behind Wal-Mart (WMT), Kroger (KR), Costco (COST) and Albertsons/Safeway, said Cowen analyst John Blackledge in a Friday note.As Investor's Business Daily has previously reported, Amazon's foray into the grocery aisle isn't new. Through Amazon Fresh and Prime Pantry, Amazon already has some level of grocery-delivery built into its fulfillment strategy, though the complexity of handling produce and perishables at its fulfillment centers means that the rollout has been relatively slow.It was not until the latter half of 2016 that Amazon ""meaningfully ramped up its expansion efforts"" to be in approximately 20 major U.S. markets, wrote Blackledge in an earlier report from March.Engulfing Whole Foods now brings 460 additional brick-and-mortar locations in the U.S., Canada and the U.K., and around 87,000 more employees to Amazon's arsenal. Whole Foods raked in $16 billion in sales in fiscal 2016.That expanded presence in the real world could mean all manner of retail ripples. Amazon could use the acquisition to increase its product offering through Prime Now or expand its beta-tested curbside pickup offering, among other things, noted Piper Jaffray analyst Michael Olson. The e-commerce titan could also incorporate its private-label items, ""compressing costs and removing differentiation currently enjoyed by retailers like (Wal-Mart).""Whole Foods will expand Amazon Fresh's potential footprint to most of the U.S., especially in upscale areas, Olson added. ""We believe Amazon can therefore launch nationwide grocery delivery coverage within 12-18 months.""For Sprouts Farmers Market (SFM), ""it will likely complicate its delivery partnership with AMZN through Amazon Prime Now,"" wrote UBS analyst Michael Lasser. Amazon and Sprouts announced a Denver grocery delivery partnership on Thursday.Additionally, ""we consider it to be a negative read for (Target), as it could further complicate its efforts to gain traction creating a stronger, better-for-you food offering in its stores,"" he said.The buyout could also increase the existing allure of Amazon's Prime membership.In the cybersphere, Amazon Prime was already the ""most used"" platform to buy groceries online in 2016, according to a Cowen survey from March. Prime's 47% share outguns Wal-Mart 39% piece of the pie, and Cowen's Blackledge added that the U.S. grocery retail market is ""greatly underpenetrated online,"" projecting earlier this year that online grocery sales could reach $177 billion in 2022, up from an estimated $71 billion this year.And there appears to be plenty of room to grow within Amazon's own ecosystem: Consulting firm Magid said only 13% of Prime subscribers buy groceries on Amazon.Analyst reaction has been swift. BMO Capital Markets upped its price target on Whole Foods to 42, Amazon's offer price. Oppenheimer raised its target on Whole Foods to 45 from 40, and said it can't rule out the possibility of another bid for the upscale grocer as a defense measure against Amazon.Some investors apparently agree with Oppenheimer. Whole Foods shares shot up 29.1% to 42.68 on the stock market today. Amazon rose 2.4% to 987.71.Calling the buyout a ""somewhat surprising step"" from Amazon, RBC analyst Mark Mahaney also noted surprise that Amazon is wading further into brick-and-mortar retail.The question of what Whole Foods can bring to Amazon appears to be answerable in a dozen different ways. A murkier question appears to be what Amazon can do for Whole Foods.""We could see AMZN perhaps improving WFM's procurement processes, but it's very unclear to us how Amazon would improve the rest of WFM's operations,"" said Mahaney, noting that Amazon ""has typically not bought fixer-uppers.""""So we see substantial execution risk here, offset only by the reality that in the AMZN scheme of things, this is actually a relatively modest acquisition,"" he wrote.UBS' Lasser sees potential for ""deeper price investments"" at Whole Foods, which he says is ""necessary"" to re-accelerate same-store sales growth at the grocer.Looking to Amazon's peer in China might offer some clues about what comes next in the plan.""If you look at Alibaba (BABA) and what they've been able to do in China with the grocery stores that they've invested in, that might be a model, but you don't know because Amazon is always going to be on the forefront,"" ACSI Funds CEO Phil Bak told Investor's Business Daily. Amazon and Whole Foods Market are both holdings in the company's fund.Alibaba recently inked a deal with Chinese supermarket heavyweight Shanghai Bailian Group, which has 4,700 locations in the country, and the China e-commerce giant has an approximate one-third stake in Sanjiang Shopping Club.Amazon ""is not following anyone else's model,"" said Bak. ""They're going to pave the way, and they're going to create a new model for how grocery shopping can be.""One thing is clear: This massive acquisition means that the list of Amazon-proof stores is getting smaller.""As other brick and mortar retailers have come to realize the hard way that competing with Amazon is a formidable challenge, supermarkets will now have to contend with not only competition with each other and nontraditional grocers like Wal-Mart and Target, but with a retailer like Amazon which has the financial capacity to price aggressively,"" said Moody's Vice President Mickey Chadha in an emailed statement, adding that ""smaller regional supermarket chains and independents will bear the most pain.""Kroger, which plunged 19% Thursday after warning on full-year earnings, sank 9.2% on Friday to a two-year low.Wal-Mart, Costco and Target shares also were big losers, along with dollar stores and drugstores with significant grocery operations. Sprouts Farmers Market was down 6.3% after losing 9.4% Thursday.Wal-Mart has been seen as a growing Amazon competitor online, reporting revived e-commerce growth in recent quarters and making several initiatives such as curbside delivery and discounts for in-store pickups. It's also made several online acquisitions, announcing Friday that it will buy Bonobos, an upscale online men's apparel site, for $310 million.But UBS' Lasser said the Amazon news may have a more limited impact on Costco and specialty stores.""COST's limited assortment, low cost structure, and deep private label penetration probably means that its fortunes will be preserved, at least for the foreseeable future,"" Lasser wrote. ""Further, the dollar stores like DG and DLTR tend to serve a customer segment that lives in rural areas or has limited resources or looking for a fill in trip. Thus, those models may not see as much change as is feared.""RELATED:Amazon Is Buying Whole Foods For $13.7 Billion, Roiling SectorAmazon-Whole Foods Merger Could Be 'Category Killer' For Food, EateriesCould Trump-Bezos Tension Imperil Amazon-Whole Foods Deal?Amazon's Next Big Growth Play Will Surprise You

338,TGT,"Stocks held modest losses with a little over one hour remaining in Friday's session as Wall Street weighed weaker-than-expected housing starts and consumer confidence data, as well as a high-profile acquisition by Amazon.com (AMZN).Shares of Amazon jumped 2% on news that it's shelling out $13.7 billion to acquire Whole Foods Market (WFM). Amazon wasn't afraid to pay up for Whole Foods, because the deal values the high-end grocery chain at around $42 a share. Shares of Whole Foods jumped 28% on the news.The Dow Jones industrial average was mostly unchanged despite big drops by Wal-Mart (WMT) and Nike (NKE). The blue-chip index was buoyed by strength in Chevron (CVX) and Exxon Mobil (XOM).The S&P 500 eased 0.1% and the Nasdaq composite gave back 0.2%. Small caps lagged with the Russell  2000 down 0.6%. Volumes on the NYSE and Nasdaq were tracking much higher than Thursday's levels as options expired.Grocery stocks fell hard on the Amazon news. Wal-Mart crashed 5% and Target (TGT) lost 7%. Costco (COST) slipped 7%.Chipmaker Impinj (PI) was seen as a potential beneficiary of the Amazon news. Amazon is a member of Impinj's RAIN alliance to promote RFID technology, which is used to better manage inventory in retail environments. Shares of Impinj soared 16% to 54.44. The emerging leader went public nearly one year ago at 14.Elsewhere, Finisar (FNSR) jumped 8%, but its 200-day moving average is looking like a resistance level for now. Earnings matched expectations, but Wall Street seemed more focused on the company's discussion of a ramp-up of 3D sensors that are widely expected to be in Apple's iPhone 8.In the biotech space, Bioverativ (BIVV) closed in on a 58.98 buy point. Shares rose nearly 2% in average volume. Bioverativ is Biogen's (BIIB) global hemophilia business and started trading as a separate stock in early February.Homebuilders didn't react much to weaker-than-expected housing data that showed starts falling 5.5% in May vs. expectations for a 3.5% rise. Meanwhile, the first reading on consumer confidence for June from the University of Michigan came in light at 94.5. The consensus estimate was for a reading of 97.1.Integrated oil firms, pipeline operators and refiners outperformed as oil prices rose slightly. U.S. crude oil for July delivery settled at $44.74 a barrel, up 28 cents.

339,TGT,"The retail stock swoon picked up on Friday after getting started late in the session on Thursday, when the White House appeared to offer the clearest sign yet that President Trump may embrace the House GOP border-tax plan that could sock retailers' earnings.Shares of Target (TGT) fell 0.7% to 63.70 on the stock market today, retreating intraday to their lowest since November 2014. Wal-Mart (WMT) slid 1.6% to 65.66, hitting an eight-month low. Other retailers that have bucked the sector's recent woes also got caught in the downdraft. Costco (COST) slipped 1.2%, while Best Buy (BBY) sank 3.9%, falling below its 50-day line.Department stores were among the hardest hit. JCPenney (JCP) tumbled 4.7% to a 1-year low while Macy's (M) lost 2.7% for its worst close since late 2011.Shares of Amazon (AMZN) were relatively unscathed, easing 0.3% to 836.30, just below a buy point. The online shopping giant is seen as less exposed to a border tax, partly because of its fast-growing web services business and partly because import taxes would be borne by Amazon sellers responsible for shipping goods to the company's fulfillment centers.According to the initial news reports on Thursday afternoon, White House press secretary Sean Spicer seemed to offer confirmation that Trump would adopt the House proposal for a 20% tax on imports. Spicer said that the wall Trump wants to build on the border with Mexico could be paid for with a 20% tax on imports from Mexico as part of the broad corporate tax reform package being developed.While the White House later clarified that the border tax was only one option being considered, that apparently did little to assuage investors' concerns. Despite unexpectedly slow annualized fourth-quarter GDP growth of 1.9% reported on Friday, major stock indexes were essentially flat in afternoon trading, suggesting that politics were behind the retail walloping.IBD'S TAKE: Big exporters like Boeing could have a negative tax rate under the GOP tax reform plan.Wal-Mart and Target officials pleaded their case in Capitol Hill meetings this week. The National Retail Federation is lobbying aggressively to block the tax, which it says could lead to an outright decline in consumer spending.Economists generally suggest that such fears are way overblown because appreciation of the dollar vs. other currencies should offset the 20% tax. Nevertheless, retailers that were hoping for a big boost to after-tax profits from tax reform are now giving off a sense of panic about how they may fare under the GOP plan.House Republicans have said they see the border-adjusted tax, which applies to imports but not exports, as a critical part of tax reform because it would raise more than $1 trillion to help pay for a reduction in the corporate rate to 20%.RELATED:Trump Backs 20% Import Tax To Pay For Border Wall — Or NotU.S. Economic Malaise Hits 11 Years: GDP Growth 1.6% In 2016Why Tax Reform Could End In Tears For Trump And GOPWhy Trump Tax Reform Could Hurt Alibaba, Other ADRs  
"
340,TGT,"Boeing (BA) is going to bat for the BAT — the border adjustment tax that is a central part of the GOP plan to cut the corporate tax rate.The controversial Republican tax-reform plan, which would slap a 20% tax on imports but make exports tax-free, has gotten off to a rough start in the court of public opinion. The National Retail Federation has warned that it would raise prices and cause consumer spending to decline, while analysts have said that big importers like Wal-Mart (WMT), Target (TGT) and Best Buy (BBY) could suffer major hits to profitability.House Republicans, with the help of economists, have countered that an anticipated 20% appreciation of the dollar would neutralize those negative effects, while removing what they call a ""Made in America"" tax.Now big exporters including Boeing and General Electric (GE) are reportedly gearing up to help House Speaker Paul Ryan make that case, and it's not hard to understand why.Consider Boeing: The company paid an effective federal tax rate of 27.7% in 2015, when it had a current tax bill of $2.1 billion, but would have had negative tax liability under the House plan.In 2015, 59% of company revenue came from non-U.S. customers. Given that Boeing does almost all of its manufacturing and sourcing within the U.S., it has limited exposure to the 20% import tax. Meanwhile, the House GOP tax plan exempts exports from any tax. Companies would be taxed on their cash flow, basically the total cost of (non-imported) goods, labor and capital outlays minus U.S. revenue.In effect, Boeing's U.S. cash flow, as far as the GOP tax plan is concerned, would have been dramatically negative once its $56.7 billion in non-U.S. revenue was excluded.IBD'S TAKE: The House GOP tax reform that Trump is considering would likely help foreigners holding U.S. stocks and hit U.S. investors in foreign investments, such as Alibaba's ADRs or overseas ETFs.Morgan Stanley analysts wrote in December that some big exporters ""may pay little or no federal taxes — and may even accrue tax benefits in the form of net operating losses.""Yet some tax experts say the only way to make the House plan work as intended would be for the federal government to write a check to exporters with negative liability.The border adjustment tax would effectively become a trade barrier, doing more to keep out imports than to facilitate exports ""unless cash refunds were provided,"" wrote American Enterprise Institute scholar Alan Viard.William Gale, co-director of the Tax Policy Center, wrote that while it may create a ""serious optics problem"" for Treasury to write checks to big corporations, the issue is just one of perception. Because of the exchange-rate adjustment, the House plan shouldn't affect the after-tax profitability of either exporters or importers, he wrote.President Trump initially sounded wary of Ryan's tax reform approach, calling it ""too complicated"" and the wrong medicine for a dollar that is already ""too strong."" But he may have put those concerns aside: White House spokesman Sean Spicer said Thursday that Trump would pay to build a wall on the Mexican border with funds generated by a 20% border tax as part of tax reform. But White House chief of staff Reince Priebus later said a 20% tax is just one option.The outcome of this rhetorical and political battle may be critical in deciding whether Trump can deliver on his plan to cut the corporate tax rate to a range of 15% to 20% from a statutory rate of 35%, among the world's highest. Without the $1.1 trillion in revenue that would come from the border-adjusted tax, analysts say a tax rate of 25% may be the best Trump can do.Boeing shares fell fractionally to close at 167.70 Friday on the stock market today. But they're up nearly 6% for the week, hitting new highs after the aerospace giant topped earnings views.RELATED:President Trump Backs 20% Import Tax To Pay For Border Wall, Aide SaysWal-Mart, Best Buy, Apple Rally After Trump Pans GOP Border Adjustment Tax

341,TGT,"Amazon (AMZN) announced it will report fourth-quarter earnings on Thursday Feb. 2, as Cowen issued its latest monthly survey on the e-commerce giant showing ongoing strength in its lucrative Prime business.Cowen analyst John Blackledge said its monthly survey of 2,500 U.S. consumers suggests Amazon has about 50 million Amazon Prime customers, up from 41 million a year ago. These loyalty program customers accounted for 57% of total Amazon customers who bought products in December, said Cowen, in line with the six-month moving average and up from 46% a year ago.""Prime has maintained healthy growth despite its scale largely due to Prime's increasing value proposition,"" Blackledge wrote.Amazon Prime customers pay an annual fee of $99.99 and receive multiple benefits, including faster and free product delivery, access to a wide selection of goods and free media offerings that include music and video.IBD'S TAKE: Amazon is gaining ground in large retail markets beyond its core markets of electronics and media, putting the e-commerce giant in position for a strong performance in 2017.Early Thursday, Amazon said its Q4 earnings report is set for Feb. 2 after the market close.The consensus estimate is for Amazon to report revenue of $44.7 billion, up 25% year over year and maintaining a steady string of double-digit growth going back more than four years. Analysts expect earnings per share minus items to rise 35% to $1.35.Blackledge, who lists Amazon as one of his ""Best Ideas For 2017,"" has an outperform rating and price target of 1,050 on Amazon stock, which rose a fraction to 809.04 in the stock market today. Shares have formed a cup base, with a buy point at 847.31.The ongoing shift to buying goods online instead of shopping at brick and mortar retail stores continues to ripple through the industry.On Wednesday, Target (TGT) reported weaker-than-expected same-store sales during the holidays, following Macy's (M), Kohl's (KSS), Tiffany (TIF) and more, as brick-and-mortar retailers struggle against the ongoing shift to online purchases.Target's November-December same-store sales fell 1.3% vs. a year earlier. The big box retailer also issued Q4 guidance below estimates. Target's warning follows Macy's and Kohl's, which both reported 2.1% November-December comps declines and slashed forecasts.Amazon efforts to expand its apparel business is paying dividends. For 4Q, Amazon apparel purchasers were up about 16% year over year, compared with 2% at Wal-Mart (WMT) and an 8% decline at Target, says Blackledge.RELATED:Amazon Reportedly Ends Talks To Acquire Stake In Middle East E-Com LeaderAmazon Plants A 'We're Hiring' Sign To Reach 100,000 New Jobs

342,TGT,"The sales numbers from big U.S. retailers over the holidays were deflating — with the notable exception of e-commerce leader Amazon.com (AMZN), which had its best holiday season ever.But the pressure Amazon has applied to Wal-Mart (WMT), Kroger (KR), Target (TGT) and other retailers is about to get more intense with Amazon's expansion into its opponents' lair: brick-and-mortar retail.Amazon is set to open its first Amazon Go convenience store, an actual physical store. Other Go stores will soon follow.Amazon Go, announced in early December, is a small (1,800-square-foot) convenience store with a novel twist — there are no check-out lines. In-store wireless technology will tabulate your purchases and charge your Amazon account.Physical-store retailing may never be the same, some observers say.""The most impressive thing they are doing is tying together the best retail technology into one operation that should effectively reinvent the basic retail model as we know it,"" said Bill Bishop, co-founder and managing partner of Brick Meets Click, a consulting and retail advisory services company. ""What Amazon is doing will radically increase the efficiency and productivity of the retail model.""IBD'S TAKE: Amazon is gaining ground in large retail markets beyond its core markets of electronics and media, putting the e-commerce giant in position for a strong performance in 2017.The Amazon Go stores will sell a range of groceries, specialty foods and ready-to-eat meals. The first Amazon Go, near Amazon headquarters in Seattle, is being tested by Amazon employees ahead of the official opening, which the company says will be early this year.Amazon says its checkout-free shopping experience ""is made possible by the same types of technologies used in self-driving cars: computer vision, sensor fusion, and deep learning."" The technology automatically detects when products are taken from or returned to the shelves and keeps track.Amazon hasn't said how many Amazon Go stores it plans to open, but its usual intent is to make every market it enters a multibillion-dollar business. The company does now have three physical bookstores (in Seattle, Portland and San Diego) that are more or less conventional stores, though customers can download books they find in the stores to their Kindle or other devices. Five more bookstores are in the works, in New York City, Chicago, New Jersey and two Boston suburbs.The stand-alone grocery store, however, marks a new phase in Amazon's ambitions to rule at least parts of the conventional brick-and-mortar store world. Besides Go, Amazon reportedly is exploring other formats for food stores and curbside pickup facilities.Amazon stock, trading near record highs touched in October, rose 0.74% to 827.46 in the stock market today. The stock has formed a cup-with-handle base, with a buy point of 843.94.Wal-Mart is paying attention. The No. 1 retailer intends to bring online ordering of groceries and curbside pickup service to nearly a quarter of its roughly 4,600 U.S. stores by year-end, Wal-Mart executives recently said. Wal-Mart also has reorganized its e-commerce unit and assigned new executive positions.And in September, it bought rising e-commerce startup Jet.com for $3.3 billion. Jet.com founder Marc Lore is now CEO of Wal-Mart's e-commerce operation.Meanwhile, Amazon continues to experiment in the grocery business aside from the Go stores. It offers a same-day and next-day grocery delivery service, through Amazon Fresh, in several big cities. But delivering groceries that customers order online has been a failed business model for about 15 years — first tried then abandoned by companies such as Webvan during the go-go dot-com bubble period around 2000.Bishop says Amazon, too, might be such a casualty — unable to attract the high volume of customers needed to make grocery deliveries a profitable business,""I think they hit a bit of a wall in terms of growth and penetration,"" Bishop said. ""I believe that Amazon Fresh has not met their expectations, and that the Amazon Go store is a response"" to that failure, as Amazon tries ""to figure out how to get more people buying their groceries.""Amazon is attacking the grocery market from the angles of a hybrid model that includes online shopping, a grocery pickup service and in-store no-checkout shopping, approaches ""we believe will accelerate Amazon's penetration in the grocery business,"" Bishop said.Amazon is deep in a test-and-learn stage with groceries and Amazon Go, says Meaghan Werle, an analyst at broad-based retail consulting firm Kantar Retail""We expect a slow and pretty disciplined rollout of this store concept as Amazon tries to figure out how to sell groceries and tackle the brick-and-mortar space,"" Werle said.Amazon Go extends Amazon's foray into the physical world that started with the bookstores — the first one opened in Seattle in November 2015 — where besides books Amazon also features its consumer electronics products, the Kindle e-readers, Echo and Echo Dot home smart speakers, Fire tablet and Fire TV stick.Amazon also reportedly plans to open dozens of small pop-up retail kiosk-type storefronts  in shopping malls over the next year to showcase its hardware devices.""Amazon has acknowledged that there is value in brick and mortar,"" Werle said.There is a lot of value, in fact. Annual U.S. grocery and beverage sales alone approach $800 billion,""Consumables are such a huge interest to Amazon,"" said Werle. ""And in order to expand their grocery presence they need to establish more brick-and-mortar stores.""The small-store concept in groceries, however, already has been tried and abandoned by retailers such as Wal-Mart.In 2011, Wal-Mart began experimenting with a small-store concept called Express, which included low-cost goods and groceries. Wal-Mart eventually closed all 269 stores.Werle says Amazon has a better shot at success thanks to its efficiencies in its supply-chain delivery process and other technologies that fit better with small-store economics.A report from Cowen last March said Amazon already controls an estimated 1.1% of the $795 billion U.S. food and beverage business through various Prime offerings, including Pantry and its fresh-grocery delivery service, Fresh. Wal-Mart, including Sam's Club, leads with 21%, according to Cowen analysts John Blackledge. Kroger is No. 2 with a 9% share, followed by Albertson's/Safeway, Costco (COST) and Publix.In December, Amazon announced it would expand its full-time U.S.-based workforce by 100,000, to a total of 280,000, by mid-2018. The company said the added employees are needed in large part to staff the expansion of their order-fulfillment centers.But Pacific Crest Securities says the new hires also could be part of Amazon's push to accelerate efforts to build physical stores.""Amazon will also add nonfulfillment center jobs, but we think that still leaves a significant and unexplained gap,"" wrote Pacific Crest analyst Edward Yruma. ""We believe that this could be explained by an accelerated rollout of physical stores.""In particular, he wrote, ""We think that a potential grocery pickup concept looks particularly promising.""RELATED:Amazon: Still The E-Commerce Elephant In The Retail Room?After The Mall Doors Close, Analysts Cut Macy's, Kohl; Chipotle UpgradedRetailers Face 2017 'Reckoning,' More 'Sad Malls' As Amazon Keeps BoomingNordstorm's '1972' Warning Is Another Sign Of Dying Malls

343,TGT,"President Trump assured CEOs of Tesla Motors (TSLA), Ford (F) and U.S. Steel (X) on Monday that he'll definitely cut the corporate income-tax rate to 15% or 20%, yet Wall Street is closely watching to see if he can deliver.Doubts have crept in since Trump's dismissal last week of the leading House GOP corporate tax reform plan as ""too complicated"" and bound to boost the dollar that's already ""too strong."" Meanwhile, the House plan's 20% tax on imports has set off a fierce lobbying campaign from retailers like Wal-Mart (WMT), Target (TGT) and Best Buy (BBY), which fear that their tax bills would soar. Big tech importers like Apple (AAPL) would have to pay the 20% border tax and could also take a hit to foreign earnings as the dollar appreciates.But the newest Republican plan to sidestep a contentious debate over a border tax may drive home the reality that there aren't any politically easy ways of delivering a massive corporate tax cut, which might soften some of the criticism the House GOP is facing. The border tax would raise $1.1 trillion over a decade to help pay for the tax cut. The alternative proposed by Sen. Mike Lee of Utah would slash corporate taxes and pay for it by increasing tax rates on capital gains and dividends to offset much of the revenue loss.""Taken together, these two changes would transfer the workers' share of the corporate tax onto American investors, who, again, are the natural and disproportionate beneficiaries of globalization relative to American workers,"" Lee wrote at The Federalist conservative blog.In other words, Lee's plan would deliver a big, beautiful cake to U.S. investors but wouldn't let them dig in.IBD'S TAKE: The House GOP tax reform that Trump is considering would likely help foreigners holding U.S. stocks and hit U.S. investors in foreign investments, such as Alibaba's ADRs or overseas ETFs.Economists figure that workers bear part of the burden of America's relatively high corporate income tax in lower wages, because it chases some investment to lower-tax locales. Lee, who hasn't put out a full-fledged plan, based his idea on a 2014 proposal from Alan Viard of the right-of-center American Enterprise Institute and Eric Toder of the left-leaning Tax Policy Center. Lee cites the 2014 version of their plan that cut the corporate income tax rate to zero and raised the tax rate on capital gains and dividends to the ordinary income rate of 42.4% (including a 3.8% ObamaCare tax on investments).Yet those authors revised their approach last year. To overcome the criticism that foreigners who owned shares of U.S. companies would escape any taxation, Viard and Toder decided to retain a corporate income-tax rate of 15%. Further, to avoid giving investors reason to hold onto their shares indefinitely to delay any tax payment, they would apply capital gains taxes based on the annual change in the market value of investors' equity holdings.Like the House GOP's border tax, the intent of their approach is to remove the tax code's incentive to produce overseas vs. in the U.S., or to shift profits to overseas subsidiaries through a variety of other strategies. Yet the lack of any colleagues on board may be a sign that there's even less support for taxing Americans' investments than foreign imports.RELATED:Wal-Mart, Best Buy, Apple Rally After Trump Pans GOP Border Adjustment Tax

344,TGT,"If gold stocks are doing well, then investor doubts must be creeping in over all of those things that seemed like sure bets to tarnish gold's future after Donald Trump's election: corporate tax cuts, a big fiscal stimulus, and faster U.S. and global growth.On Monday, shares of Newmont Mining (NEM) rose 3.2% to finish at 37.94 on the stock market today, their highest close since the election. Newmont has bounced 23% from its post-election low as gold prices have now erased more than two-thirds of their losses, with prices for the precious metal rising 0.9% to $1,232.10 an ounce on Monday, the highest close since Nov. 10.The SPDR Gold Trust ETF (GLD) rose 1.35% to 117.70, while the Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 and Nasdaq were all modestly lower.What's amazing about gold's comeback is that it's happened even as the Dow finally crested 20,000 and was managing to hold that level Monday afternoon. Investors clearly haven't thrown in the towel on the President Trump reflation trade that initially killed gold stocks, but they may be hedging their bets somewhat. A potentially volatile period for European politics also is providing more reason to worry about downside risk.IBD'S TAKE: President Trump's agenda faces a large degree of uncertainty. If the WTO found the border tax backed by House Republicans — and increasingly by the White House — to be illegal, the GOP would face three difficult choices that could throw the ruling party into crisis.""The recent difficulty congressional Republicans have had in moving forward on Obamacare repeal does not bode well for reaching a quick agreement on tax reform or infrastructure funding, and reinforces our view that a fiscal boost, if it happens, is mostly a 2018 story,"" Goldman Sachs economist Alec Phillips wrote late last week.Goldman cut the odds to just 20% that Congress will pass a border tax adjustment, which would tax imports but not exports, as part of corporate tax reform. The controversial proposal is under attack from big importers like Wal-Mart Stores (WMT) and Target (TGT), while big exporters like Boeing (BA) and General Electric (GE) rally in support.Here's the real concern for investors, says Brian Gardner, Washington analyst at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods: The border tax ""is the linchpin for the GOP plan, and without it, the tax reform effort could collapse.""The postelection rally was based on expectations that Trump would push hard on the pro-growth aspects of his agenda and de-emphasize other key campaign themes about restricting trade and immigration, Goldman says. But now Goldman sees increasing odds that tax cuts will get bogged down in the legislative process as the populist aspects of Trump's agenda come  to the fore.Rising populism may have been the primary driver of gold prices on Monday, as investors weighed a more uncertain future for the eurozone.In France, a financial scandal threatened to sink the candidacy of center-right front-runner Francois Fillon, suddenly boosting the chances of Marine Le Pen, who wants to break from the euro.Meanwhile, German Chancellor Angela Merkel's re-election contest suddenly looks like it could be a dogfight.

353,TGT,"Here's an estimate that may be hard to fathom: Nearly one-third of health care spending in the U.S. is considered wasteful.That's about $1 trillion in payment mistakes, excessive treatment, pricing errors and administrative waste.It's also a market opportunity for Cotiviti (COTV), a leading provider of technology and services that health insurers and retailers use to ensure accurate payments in an increasingly complex environment. Most of its clients are insurance companies, with a primary focus on payment inaccuracies.""We are, by far, the leader in this space,"" Cotiviti Chief Executive Doug Williams said in an interview with IBD. ""Our job is to help our clients understand the accuracy of what has been paid and, if there is an inaccuracy, help get that corrected.""In 2015, Cotiviti says it helped clients retrieve $2.7 billion in excessive fees paid for health care services, working with more than 40 health care organizations.That includes eight of the 10 largest U.S. insurers. Atlanta-based Cotiviti declined to name those customers.Cotiviti, however, does disclose some of its retail customers, for which it is a leading provider of payment accuracy services. It has more than 35 retail clients, including eight of the 10 largest retailers in the U.S., including Amazon (AMZN), Home Depot (HD), Wal-Mart (WMT) and Target (TGT).By helping retailers identify variances in payment for goods and services, Cotiviti saved them more than $500 million in 2015. The company uses sophisticated analytics and data mining tools to identify potential inaccuracies.Still, finding mistakes can be tricky.""There's a lot of variable data, a dynamic set of data elements that are constantly changing and very difficult to have all at once,"" said Williams.Some companies do part of the job themselves. Health insurers comb through their data for errors, and by the time Cotiviti gets a look at it the easy stuff is already picked over.""We take their work, which is already very accurate, and advance it to a level of precision that's not reasonable for them to invest in at that level,"" said Williams. ""We're able to do it because we spread it across so many clients.""The roots of Cotiviti extend to 1979 as a company named Connolly, a provider of payment accuracy solutions to the retail industry. It was acquired in 2012 by Advent International. That year, Connolly merged with iHealth Technologies and Cotiviti was formed.Advent owns a majority of the common stock, giving it effective control over the outcome of votes on all matters requiring approval by Cotiviti stockholders.The company held its initial public offering on May 26, raising $236 million, the majority of which was used to pay off debt. Shares priced at 19 and now trade near 33, making it one of the top performing IPOs in the past year.Cotiviti reported third-quarter revenue of $156 million, up 14% year-over-year and the fourth quarter in a row of double-digit gains. Earnings per share rose 24% to 36 cents, the seventh straight profitable quarter.For the nine months ended Sept. 30, Cotiviti reported sales of $457.3 million, up 17% year-over-year, and earnings per share of 27 cents, up 30%. Its primary competitor in the health care sector is HMS Holdings (HMSY). In the retail segment the main competitor is PRGX Global (PRGX).In 2015, Cotiviti derived 86% of its revenue from its health care segment, with the balance of the company's sales stemming from separate retail operations.""There's a tremendous need for this company,"" said Robert Willoughby, an analyst at Credit Suisse who follows Cotiviti. ""Ultimately, if you want to bet against this business model you have to assume fraud and abuse will not happen in the health care system.""Willoughby said Cotiviti is well positioned to benefit from evolving demographic trends that include an aging population and increasingly sicker subpopulation that will drive health care costs higherWilloughby has an outperform rating on Cotiviti and a price target of 39. On Monday, Cotiviti shares gave back much of the 2% gains they had made in Friday trades, but recovered much of that to end trading down 0.4% to 34.53.IBD'S TAKE: IPOs are a seedbed of innovation and can be huge stock winners but can also reverse quickly. IBD frequently writes about IPO Leaders, and Cotiviti is one of the best performing IPOs of 2016.The process of timely and accurate claims processing and reimbursement in the U.S. health care system is extremely complex, with billions of claims submitted annually. Various estimates say there was nearly $1 trillion in unnecessary or wasteful spending in 2015 throughout the industry. Of that total, about $170 billion came from inaccurate submissions by health care providers.Its revenue is derived primarily through contracts with clients, which call for performance fees based on a percentage of the inaccurate payments that Cotiviti prevents. A small portion of revenue, less than 5%, comes from a fee-for-service basis whereby billing is based upon a flat fee or a fee per hour.Cotiviti estimates that the money-saving opportunity addressable by its technology and services is approximately $35 billion. From that, it sees a total market of about $5 billion addressable by its solutions. Its ability to expand the revenue pool will determine the long-term success of Cotiviti.The company says it has ""multiple strategies"" for achieving continued growth. Among them are significant opportunities to grow within its existing group of customers by increasing the volume of claims it reviews and cross-selling its products. Cotiviti has a history of innovation in improving existing solutions, developing new ones and expanding the scope of services. Additionally, it plans to selectively pursue acquisitions and strategic partnerships in payment accuracy and adjacent markets.""We are in a continuous process of reinventing ourselves,"" said Williams. ""We work on it every day, making sure we deliver in the current world but also creating the capability and capacity for the next opportunity.""But in a health care market full of complexity and uncertainty, more of that is coming. President-elect Donald J. Trump, is working with the Republican-controlled Congress to ""replace and repeal"" the Affordable Care Act, better known as ObamaCare. There's plenty of uncertainty as to how that will shake out and what it could mean for the already complex payment system. But Williams said that's not a major concern at this time.""Certainly there is a lot of political rhetoric and it seems there is a path to have some regulatory and policy changes,"" Williams said. ""They have to come up with ways to control costs and waste and abuse, and things like that are meaningful contributors of that cost.""Willoughby shares that point of view, saying: ""There will always be a growth environment for health care claims.""RELATED LINKS:Doctors' ObamaCare Warning To GOP Lifts Hospital, Insurer StocksTrump, GOP Face Huge 'Now What?'

354,TGT,"The adoption of credit-card chip technology by U.S. retailers is having an unintended consequence: Criminals are moving from brick-and-mortar stores to the internet.The use of stolen card data to pay for merchandise on websites, in mobile apps and by dialing call centers surged 40% last year, according to a report from Javelin Strategy & Research released Wednesday. That's forcing merchants to spend billions on online fraud protection in an effort to detect when a crook is using someone else's card number.""We are seeing more sophisticated type of fraud moving into the online environment,"" said Erika Dietrich, global director of payments risk management at fraud fighter ACI Worldwide (ACIW).By the end of last year, almost 1.81 million U.S. merchants had switched to accepting European-style chip cards, more than double the number the year before, according to Visa (V) Issued by banks, cards containing the so-called EMV technology are much harder to counterfeit, which cuts down on in-person fraud at stores.With worldwide e-commerce surging and more stolen data available on the black market, retailers are ramping up spending on online security. E-commerce merchants and financial institutions will spend $9.2 billion annually in fraud-detection solutions by 2020, up 30% from current levels, according to Juniper Research.As recently as October, the fraud-protection company Radial Inc. used to get one to two inquiries from new large customers a month. That number has since climbed to more than 12 a month, said Stefan Weitz, chief product and strategy officer. Radial's more than 100 clients include Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA), StubHub and Ralph Lauren (RL).Fueling the surge in interest are an increasing number of data breaches at companies ranging from Target (TGT) to Wendy's (WEN), which potentially exposed private financial information from millions of customers to identity thieves. U.S. government agencies and companies suffered a record 1,093 data breaches last year, up 40% from 2015, according to the Identity Theft Resource Center in San Diego.""There's a great deal of investment not only from StubHub peers, but also from the vendors,"" said Joseph Asaro, head of operations for North America at StubHub, a unit of eBay (EBAY). ""The vendors would not be investing so heavily if there's not great profit in it.""To bolster its arsenal, Visa acquired CardinalCommerce in December to help merchants and banks authenticate e-commerce transactions. New vendors are also entering the fray: This year, Tender Armor LLC, a Fort Lauderdale, Fla.-based startup, will offer its fraud-fighting technology to debit-card customers of InComm Holdings, which issues prepaid cards. Tender Armor texts or e-mails customers a daily code that replaces the one on the back of their cards for purchases.""Because the code is dynamic and only known to the consumer, the fraudsters can't use it,"" Madeline Aufseeser, Tender Armor's chief executive, said in an interview. ""This simple solution deputizes the consumers and puts the control back in their hands.""Meanwhile, payment processor Cayan, which serves mid- to small-sized businesses, plans to integrate security software from Kount. That company uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to help merchants pinpoint fraudulent sales. For each transaction, Kount's engine analyzes hundreds of relevant variables and activity across the globe in real time to predict risk of fraud.Existing fraud-fighting companies' business is blooming. Easy Solutions says sales of its product that helps banks and retailers monitor transactions grew 128 last year, up from a 75% gain in 2015. Radial, which promises to shoulder its clients' fraud costs, saw its sales rise 15% last year.Radial's software can use about 800 rules to determine if a transaction is fraudulent. Suspicious transactions are flagged and sent to several dozen human analysts around the world who can verify addresses, or even call the customers to weed out fraud.""They do detective work at some point,"" said the company's Weitz. ""We guarantee to our customers that they pay zero fraud.""Online sales worldwide are projected to rise to $27.7 trillion in 2020, up from $22 trillion last year, according to researcher eMarketer. North America, the second-largest e-commerce market in the world behind Asia, is expected to see double-digit growth through 2020, eMarketer said. Expansion into new categories such as grocery, and increasing sales through mobile devices are helping to boost sales, the company said.More shopping online means more opportunities for crooks, who are now using sophisticated attack tools such as bots. The software programs can run through online checkout pages and place orders using stolen data automatically — without a human being needing to be involved.""Right now the environment is more challenging than it's ever been,"" said Al Pascual, research director and head of fraud and security at Javelin, a consulting firm focused on the financial industry. ""And things will get worse before they get better.""

355,TGT,"President-elect Donald Trump's agenda of cutting the federal corporate income-tax rate and boosting infrastructure spending is giving U.S. investors plenty of positive reasons to stay at home when it comes to stock picking. Now they may get a not-so-positive reason to lighten up on their foreign stock holdings.While the details of corporate tax reform are still far from certain, the House GOP's border-adjusted tax proposal that Trump's team is weighing could create some surprising winners and losers. Among the biggest losers could be U.S. investors holding American depositary receipts of Alibaba (BABA) and other foreign companies. Among the biggest winners may be foreign investors holding U.S. equities.Retailers like Wal-Mart (WMT), Target (TGT), Dollar Tree (DLTR) and others are panicking over the House plan that would impose a 20% tax on the value of imported goods, but not on exports. The fear is that this could be a disaster for retail earnings, as well as for their consumers, who could see big price hikes.Yet economic theory suggests that exchange rates would adjust to balance out the impact of the tax shift. Deutsche Bank expects that the dollar would rise 15% vs. foreign currencies, largely offsetting the higher taxes on retailers. But economics is, of course, a highly uncertain science and other analysts says it's possible that the currency adjustment could be as little as 10% or well above 20%.In other words, Wal-Mart, Target and their peers may have reason to be concerned and, without question, so do American investors holding foreign stocks.Although American depository receipts (ADRs) and the underlying American depositary shares are priced in dollars, they don't provide any protection against currency risk. If the currency of the foreign company's home country suddenly sinks 20%, the American depositary shares immediately fall to reflect that decline.Alibaba's U.S. shares reflect this. While already correcting from late September highs, Alibaba fell sharply after Election Day, as the dollar rallied. Shares continued to slide until late December, about the time that the U.S. dollar peaked. Alibaba and other U.S.-listed Chinese stocks such as NetEase (NTES) have rebounded in 2017, helped by China's central bank intervening to support the yuan.The same currency risk applies to exchange traded funds like KraneShares CSI China Internet ETF (KWEB) that many investors use to invest in a sector. An exception, to at least some degree, are hedged equity ETFs, which aim to neutralize currency risk.IBD'S TAKE: The Trump rally may have arrived at the show-me stage, when markets are looking for confirmation that the positive parts of his agenda will come to fruition. For now the market remains in a confirmed uptrend, which means the risk-reward in buying leading stocks breaking out of consolidations is favorable. Read IBD's The Big Picture each day to see if the uptrend remains intact.Federal Reserve data show that U.S. residents held $7.2 trillion worth of foreign equities, including ADRs, at the end of September. Meanwhile, foreigners held $5.7 trillion worth of U.S. corporate equities, so the stakes in a potentially abrupt currency adjustment aren't small.Wall Street strategists are divided on the odds of the House border-adjusted tax becoming a reality, with Citigroup calling it likely and Goldman Sachs seeing about a 1 in 3 chance. Those odds seem high, considering all the criticism the proposal is coming under, including from some Republicans.Still, there are a number of reasons why Republicans including House Speaker Paul Ryan like this idea. One of the biggest is that a border-adjusted tax could raise more than $1 trillion that would help offset the cost of lowering the corporate tax rate. Without that offset, the GOP could have a hard time delivering a big corporate tax rate cut via reconciliation, which requires just 50 votes but precludes deficits beyond 10 years.RELATED:Trump's Trade Hand: 6 In-Your-Face Cards, No AcesTax Reform May Pit GOP Vs.

356,TGT,"Financial markets didn't skip a beat last week as reports emerged that President Trump would sign a new order on Friday blocking citizens of Iran and six other predominantly Muslim nations from traveling to the U.S.But it's not surprising that stocks woke up on the wrong side of the bed on Monday after the messy rollout of a policy that temporarily invalidated green cards, stranded hundreds of travelers at airports, sparked large protests and drew condemnation from countries around the world.American Airlines (AAL) and Delta Air Lines (DAL) led a downdraft among airline stocks after airport protests that didn't exactly present the most inviting picture to welcome travelers. Delta was itself a big part of the news coverage after Trump tweeted that the company's technological snafu that grounded flights was the real cause of weekend chaos at airports.Apple (AAPL) and Starbucks (SBUX) were among the U.S. companies that tried to distance themselves from the policy. Chief Executive Tim Cook said Apple ""would not exist without immigration,"" since Steve Jobs' father came from Syria, target of Trump's indefinite refugee ban.Starbucks committed to hiring 10,000 refugees in the next five years in the 75 countries where it does business. Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google said it's putting up $2 million for groups including the American Civil Liberties Union that work to secure legal protections for immigrants and refugees.Companies have reason to be worried about the symbolism and the real impact on some foreign-born employees. For investors, the moves may lower confidence that Trump will be able to execute his agenda of tax cuts and infrastructure spending that have fueled the market's postelection rally.IBD'S TAKE: If the WTO found the border tax to be illegal, the GOP would face three difficult choices that could throw the ruling party into crisis.Google said it recalled workers on H-1B visas from targeted countries amid concern that they wouldn't be able to return to the U.S. under Trump's order. Now tech companies, in particular, are bracing for another executive order on reform to the H-1B program that provides visas to workers in specialized occupations. Shares of computer services firms including Wipro (WIP) and Cognizant Technology Solutions (CTSH) were under pressure on Monday.For the broad market, the bigger concern is that Trump may be alienating those who he will need to deliver on his agenda. Above all, he'll need the support of at least 49 of 52 Senate Republicans to pass corporate tax reform, which is shaping up to be a contentious battle. The White House is signaling support of House Speaker Paul Ryan's plan for a border-adjusted tax that big importers like Wal-Mart (WMT) and Target (TGT) are gearing up to fight.While few GOP senators have taken a position on the House approach, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., tweeted that anything that slaps a border tax on Corona would be ""mucho sad."" After Graham and Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., criticized Trump's immigration order for making America less safe, Trump lashed out with his own tweet, calling the two ""sadly weak on immigration.""Bloomberg News reported over the weekend that the White House now views the House border-tax plan favorably, calling it the ""most nationalist"" way to reform the corporate tax code. Yet, assuming Trump can find the votes to pass it, the big corporate tax cut could end up backfiring if the World Trade Organization rules that it is illegal, as many experts expect it to do. With Trump praising Brexit, dissing the European Union, sparring with Mexico and bellowing ""America First,"" the chances that the WTO will give America the benefit of any doubt are looking increasingly unlikely.It's not yet clear if Trump's infrastructure package will need Democratic votes to pass, but the wildly anti-Trump sentiment on the left makes it harder for Democratic lawmakers to meet him halfway. At the moment the opposition party is setting a high hurdle for Trump to win their support, laying out their own $1 trillion government-funded package that bares little resemblance to the White House approach of offering $137 billion worth of tax credits as an incentive for the private sector to undertake massive infrastructure projects.All of these challenges come on top of huge uncertainty and disagreement among Republicans about their first order of business: Repealing ObamaCare on a party-line vote and then, somehow, figuring out to replace it without blowing up the individual insurance market.RELATED:Trump Tax Fears: Wal-Mart, Target, Macy's Hit New LowsTrump Wall Stocks Caterpillar, Materials Firms Breaking Out

357,TGT,"After vowing a border tax, then calling it ""too complicated,"" then saying it was still being considered, President Trump told a group of CEOs Monday that the U.S. will incentivize domestic production and impose a ""very major"" tax on goods that American companies produce overseas.During a meeting with a manufacturing advisory group, Trump also reiterated pledges to slash regulations and income taxes.Afterward, Ford (F) CEO Mark Fields told reporters the meeting was positive. The carmaker had earlier canceled plans to build a new plant in Mexico. While Trump criticized Ford during the campaign for making cars there, the company said canceling the plant was due to lack of demand for small cars.Others at the meeting included CEOs of Tesla Motors (TSLA), Under Armour (UA), Lockheed Martin (LMT), Arconic (ARNC), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and U.S. Steel (X). The advisory panel is led by Dow Chemical's (DOW) CEO.Shares of Ford closed down 0.4% on the stock market today. General Motors (GM) and Fiat Chrysler (FCAU), which also have Mexico operations but recently pledged major U.S. investments, fell 1% and rose 2.7%, respectively. The CEOs of the three carmakers will also meet with Trump Tuesday at the White House. Tesla relies on a U.S.-based factory for final production and rallied 1.7%.Retail giant Wal-Mart (WMT), which relies heavily on imports, finished 0.8% lower, and Target (TGT) lost 0.4%.IBD'S TAKE: The House GOP tax reform that Trump is considering would likely help foreigners holding U.S. stocks and hit U.S. investors in foreign investments, such as Alibaba's ADRs or overseas ETFs.In an interview published last Monday, Trump told the Wall Street Journal the border-adjusted tax plan was ""too complicated"" and could result in ""a bad deal,"" sending shares of Wal-Mart, Best Buy (BBY) and Macy's (M) higher.The next day, Trump told Axios the border tax, which is a key element in the congressional GOP's tax strategy, is ""certainly something that's going to be discussed.""RELATED:Wal-Mart, Best Buy, Apple Rally After Trump Pans GOP Border Adjustment TaxTrump Trade, Tax Talk Hits Dollar As Mexico Warns On Tariffs Wal-Mart, Target, Macy's Drop Amid Tariff Talk: Investing Action Plan

Technology and financial services led advancing S&P sectors. Consumer discretionary led the decline as Target (TGT) joined other retailers in trimming fourth-quarter revenue guidance on weak holiday sales.Global X Uranium (URA), an ETF  that has outperformed in January, stumbled nearly 7% in morning trade.Shares of its No. 1 holding Cameco (CCJ) crumbled after the uranium giant warned Tuesday that analyst estimates are too high and it expects to report a loss for 2016.

360,TGT,"Threats of a trade war intensified over the weekend, as President-elect Donald Trump said the dollar ""is too strong"" and warned BMW that it would face a 35% tariff on imports to the U.S. from a plant it's building in Mexico.Trump's words help sink the U.S. dollar index by 1% vs. other major currencies on Tuesday. Meanwhile, gold prices rose 1.6% to $1,215 an ounce and the 10-year Treasury yield slipped as low as 2.33%, the lowest level since November 29.Following similar threats of a ""big border tax"" aimed at Ford (F), General Motors (GM) and Toyota (TM), Mexico's economy minister Ildefonso Guajardo indicated the country was preparing to strike back.""It is clear we need to be prepared to immediately neutralize the impact of such a measure,"" he said in a Friday interview on Mexican TV.Guajardo added that Trump's plan to counter the competitive advantage of low-cost countries with tariffs would lead to a global recession.Trump's dollar comments had added significance because they brought out in the open divisions among GOP leaders about how to achieve corporate tax reform.Those divisions might be positive news for retailers like Wal-Mart (WMT), Target (TGT) and Dollar Tree (DLTR) that could be hit by House Speaker Paul Ryan's favored approach to corporate tax reform. Yet they raise big questions about how Republicans will be able to offset the cost of tax cuts, which is critically important since budget measures passed through reconciliation must be revenue neutral after 10 years.IBD'S TAKE: The House GOP tax reform that Trump is considering would likely help foreigners holding U.S. stocks and hit U.S. investors in foreign investments, such as Alibaba's ADRs or overseas ETFs.Trump, in an interview with the Wall Street Journal published on Monday, voiced doubts about the House plan for a border-adjusted tax, saying it was ""too complicated"" and could result in ""a bad deal.""Trump's chief problem appears to be the consensus that the a 20% tax on all imports would lead to a significant appreciation of the dollar vs. other currencies. He specifically called out China and its weakening currency.""Our companies can't compete with them now because our currency is too strong. And it's killing us,"" Trump said.The House plan has come under criticism, and not just from retailers, for potentially violating World Trade Organization rules. Still, some proponents have pitched it as a way to improve U.S. competitiveness without the brunt instrument of tariffs that Trump seems to prefer.One big selling point of the House plan to impose a 20% tax on the value of imports is that it would raise in excess of $1 trillion to offset the cost of lowering corporate tax rates. If Trump rejects that idea, it's unclear how the GOP will be able to make its numbers add up.RELATED:Trump Trade: What He Can Do Legally Vs.

361,TGT,"A lukewarm shopping environment hasn't put a blemish on the beauty industry, which has been the fastest-growing retail segment for the last three years, according to NPD Group.Specialty players Ulta Beauty (ULTA) and LVMH-owned Sephora are flourishing — and value cosmetics brand and recent issue e.l.f. Beauty (ELF) appears poised to take advantage of the on-fire trend.E.l.f., which sells its wares mostly via CVS (CVS), Target (TGT), Ulta Beauty and other national retailers, went public at 17 in late September, rising roughly 70% to about 29 a share as of Wednesday.In an email Q&A with Investor's Business Daily, e.l.f. CEO Tarang Amin outlined his approach to engagement, the significance of its small but growing brick-and-mortar presence, and the company's greatest growth opportunities in 2017.IBD: Social media — Instagram in particular — has become a hot spot for beauty enthusiasts. Following e.l.f.'s Beauty Scape activation, how does social media play into your engagement strategy in 2017, and how do you see that impacting the new loyalty program?Amin: Our approach to engage consumers is deeply rooted in social media and digital platforms, and will continue to be a main pillar of our engagement strategy. We were extremely pleased with the outcome of our e.l.f. Beauty Scape activation, which delivered a 25% increase in Instagram followers and reached a combined community of 53 million across social media platforms. We believe we can further build awareness and deepen engagement with our consumers in different ways, including our new Beauty Squad loyalty program. We enrolled 80,000 consumers in just the first six weeks and look forward to continuing to expand the program as we strengthen our CRM capabilities and deliver more fun, relevant content for our consumers.IBD'S TAKE: What's holding Amazon back from becoming a major player in beauty?

How do you see the sales mix of e.l.f. direct-channel, third-party e-commerce (such as Amazon) and national retailers shifting over the next few years, if at all?Amin: We expect the U.S. to be the largest source of our growth over the next few years as we grow space allocation with existing retailers, increase new customers and grow our direct-to-consumer business through elfcosmetics.com and e.l.f. stores. The majority of our growth will be driven by national retailers, given the white space that we see here in existing doors as well as new doors. That being said, our direct channel plays an incredibly important role in terms of validating our innovation and engaging with our consumers, and we believe there is significant room to grow here as well.IBD: There are fewer than 20 stand-alone e.l.f. brick-and-mortar retail locations. What's the significance of building out a brick-and-mortar presence?Amin: In Q3 of 2016, we opened seven e.l.f. stores, to bring our total to 15, including our first California stores, with two locations in the Los Angeles metropolitan area. Our stores showcase a broad assortment of e.l.f. products, create an environment dedicated to play beautifully, and allow us to test and validate new products. We believe our stores provide a great opportunity for us to connect with our consumers in an experiential format, and drive both awareness and engagement.IBD: Cosmetic and skin care products are still selling well, even as other areas of retail have struggled. Do you see interest in beauty peaking any time soon?Amin: We believe that the cosmetics category is highly attractive given its scale, growth dynamics and consumer demand trends. And, given the importance of cosmetics in a woman's daily regimen and the availability of products across price points, the category has demonstrated resiliency through economic cycles. We expect cosmetics to continue to be among the fastest growing and most consistent consumer categories.IBD: What's the biggest area of growth and opportunity for e.l.f. in 2017?Amin: We believe we are in the early innings of growth as we continue to make progress on our four key strategies: Build a great brand, lead innovation, expand brand penetration and drive world-class operations. We continue to see momentum in both our direct channels and leading national retailers, as well as strong operational results and remain excited about our business as we head into 2017.RELATED:How Instagram, Twitter Beauty Selfies Are Changing The Face Of RetailRetailers Face 2017 'Reckoning,' More 'Sad Malls' As Amazon Keeps BoomingWhat's Driving The Success Of 'Un-Amazon-Able' Ulta Beauty?Domino's CEO Doyle On Netflix, Trump And Pizza's 'Jetsons' Future

363,TGT,"Amazon.com (AMZN) isn't attending the annual ICR Conference in Orlando, Fla., but its presence was arguably felt in one way or another Tuesday morning.With holiday retail figures out — some tremendously disappointing to investors, others less so — and Amazon crowned the clear winner of Christmas by Slice Intelligence, the conference presents an opportunity to reflect on a modern shopping landscape pockmarked by growing online sales and subdued mall traffic.American Eagle Outfitters (AEO) management said it was ""relatively happy"" with its real estate portfolio, calling it ""pretty healthy"" and noting that it doesn't feel particularly hurt by Macy's (M) recent announcement to close dozens of locations, despite having stores in those same areas.But an outperforming digital channel could prompt store closures anyway.""We're looking at things like digital penetration to brick-and-mortar sales within that region,"" said one executive at the conference. ""You know, if a store's in a C-mall location, for instance, and although we're still making money (but) we're seeing digital having a much higher penetration — you know, we might decide to close that store. ""He then said that the company ""will definitely see a decrease in our U.S.-based real estate portfolio over the ongoing years, particularly as traffic gets more challenged in some of the C(-mall) locations.""American Eagle shares were up 1.7% at 15.22 in late-afternoon trading on the stock market today. Amazon dipped 0.15%.Separately, Lululemon (LULU) CEO Laurent Potdevin told CNBC following his presentation that the upscale yogawear maker is being targeted in its approach.""When you think about traffic, we're not going after every bit of traffic; we're really focused on getting highly qualified traffic,"" said Potdevin on CNBC. ""If you'd been in our stores during the holiday season, they were really, really busy. And our conversion was outstanding, both in-store and online.""What about Amazon moving in on the apparel space with activewear of its own?""When you have more competitors, you have a bigger market, and it's an opportunity,"" said Potdevin in response. ""I'd rather have more competitors than no competitors. . . It really validates the strength of the market.""Lululemon shares rallied 3% to 70.26 as they work on a cup-with-handle base with a 72.80 buy point.And then there's beauty, which has thus far been a market that's shown relative immunity to Amazon's appetite for brick-and-mortar retailers' business.For e.l.f. beauty (ELF) — which began as an e-commerce business — part of that advantage comes in the form of speed-to-market. It takes the low-cost makeup company as little as 20 weeks to bring a product to market, while larger, slower-moving players can take up to two years to launch product, according to e.l.f. executives at the conference.""We've been able to grow regardless of economic cycle,"" said e.l.f. CEO Tarang Amin.E.l.f. is carried in retailers like Target (TGT), Wal-Mart (WMT) and CVS Health (CVS). With only a handful of stand-alone stores, it is expanding its reach via in-store partnerships with existing retail heavyweights.""We see Ulta (ULTA) and Walgreens (WBA) as natural partners and expect a possible announcement in the next 60-90 days,"" wrote Piper Jaffray analyst Stephanie Wissink following the presentation.""The company's trend identification, development speed, and commitment to newness are both averaging up the gross margin and driving working capital utility, but are also setting the brand apart at retail from a merchandising, messaging, and engagement perspective.""Shares of e.l.f. were down 1.6% at 28.60, near the low of a flat base with a 32.64 entry.

Alternatively, team Trump has been weighing support for a House Republican corporate tax change that would indirectly apply a 20% tax on imports, even though it might not pass muster with the World Trade Organization.Trump aides Thursday responded to the CNN report, stressing that no decisions have been made.""The CNN story got a little bit too far out over its skis,"" Trump transition spokesman Jason Miller told reporters. ""The incoming administration is obviously discussing numerous trade deals and tax reform packages with members of our own team as well as members of Congress. But it's too early to go into specific speculation on issues of tariffs or border adjustability.""The report followed the announcement that economist Peter Navarro, who has defended Trump's campaign threat to slap a 45% punitive tariff on Chinese imports, will head a soon-to-be-established White House National Trade Council.On Thursday, shares of major retailers were taking it on the chin. Wal-Mart (WMT) was off 2.3% on the stock market today. Macy's (M) slid 3.6%, Target (TGT) 4.4%, Gap (GPS) 5.4% and Dollar Tree (DLTR) 5.65%. E-commerce giant Amazon.com (AMZN) fell 0.55%. (Retailers also fell on reports of weak holiday sales and traffic).One of the big questions since the election is how Trump will merge his populist campaign themes with a traditional Republican agenda of tax cuts and deregulation. A boost to infrastructure spending and use of the bully pulpit to keep companies like Ford (F) and Carrier, a unit of United Technologies (UTX), from shutting down U.S. production are two clear ways that Trump aims to stay faithful to his working-class supporters who put him over the top in the Rust Belt. Demanding that Mexico and Canada open up North American Free Trade Agreement for renegotiation is another likely tack. Yet the latest reports offer the clearest indication that Trump may go further than investors have been expecting.It's easy to see why investors are excited about the prospect of a big corporate tax cut. Trump's campaign plan to cut the corporate rate to 15% from the 35% statutory rate could boost S&P 500 earnings by $180 billion, or 16%, figures Jonathan Glionna, head of U.S. equity strategy research at Barclays.IBD'S TAKE: Stocks that stand to benefit from both corporate tax cuts and an infrastructure boost have been among the big winners of the Trump rally. Two of those stocks, Freeport McMoRan and Martin Marietta Materials, are near a buy point. Check out Leaderboard, where IBD's market writers help you find buying opportunities in these and other stocks as they emerge, as well as sell signals to lock in profits.But some companies and sectors could stand to benefit much more than others. Domestic-focused industries like retail and homebuilders, many of which derive 100% of income from the U.S., could see an earnings boost of 30% or more, Glionna wrote, and could get a further boost from a consumer tax cut. Dollar General (DG), for example, could see its 37% effective tax rate (including state taxes) fall to 17% under the Trump plan.Among industry groups, only telecom would get a bigger lift than retail, with AT&T (T) and Verizon (VZ) seeing a 29% boost in earnings.Yet, retailers could, all of a sudden, become big losers if Trump adopts the House Republican plan. While cutting the statutory corporate tax rate to 20% from 35%, the House plan would no longer allow businesses to deduct the cost of imports from taxes. That means retailers such as Dollar General, Wal-Mart, Amazon, Costco (COST) and Starbucks (SBUX) would have to pay a tax equal to 20% of the cost of the clothing, televisions, toys and coffee they import.Because retail profit margins are generally in the low single digits, one concern is that retailers that sell a lot of imported goods might have to pass much of those taxes on to customers to maintain their profitability.""Clearly a 20% tax on the wide range of consumer goods that are imported into the United States would put increased economic pressure on families who can least afford it,"" the National Retail Federation said after the House unveiled its ""Better Way"" tax plan in June.Actually, the economic impact of the House plan is far from clear. While imports could be 20% more expensive and exports 12% cheaper, the dollar could appreciate by 15% or more, largely offsetting the tax changes, Deutsche Bank wrote in an analysis this week.Trump and the GOP could be in for a big battle if they build corporate tax reform around this border-adjustment plan. Yet, reform may not be much easier if they choose another path. The conservative Tax Foundation estimates that this border adjustment of corporate taxes would raise $1.1 trillion over 10 years, a huge sum that helps offset the cost of lowering the corporate tax rate to 20% in the House plan. Unless the GOP can get eight Senate Democrats on board, which is doubtful, a tax package passed via reconciliation will have to be deficit-neutral beyond 10 years, so offsets are needed to make the U.S. tax code more competitive.On top of that, there are real worries that other countries will punish American companies if the Trump administration applies tariffs or Congress adopts what looks like a border tax.It's probably safe to say that the stock market rally has downplayed some of these nagging problems in implementing the Trump agenda and that the ride may get bumpy because the range of possible outcomes is wide.As JPMorgan analysts wrote this week, ""While a lot of the early corporate tax reform enthusiasm was predicated on a cursory examination of the headline rate cuts, markets are now examining the radical changes being proposed to the intricacies of the code. (Last) Thursday and Friday saw notable weakness in apparel/retail-linked stocks and a big factor behind the selling was concern around the border adjustment concept that sits at the heart of the GOP corporate tax reform plan.""RELATED:Here's How Much Trump Tax Cuts Could Boost The Stock Market Tax Reform May Pit GOP Vs.

367,TGT,"As malls die, Macy's (M) plans huge job cuts, and Sears (SHLD) closes 150 stores, online sales on sites like Amazon (AMZN) and devices like your Apple (AAPL) iPhone, to the surprise of perhaps nobody, were higher during the 2016 holiday season.Online sales rose 11% a record $91.7 billion, Adobe (ADBE) said Thursday, slightly surpassing the company's own expectations for $91.6 billion. More of those sales were made via mobile devices, which drove half of site visits, Adobe said. Mobile sales jumped 23% to $28.43 billion.Other surveys have suggested that Amazon grabbed a huge share of that e-commerce growth. But it didn't entirely hog the spotlight. Online auction site eBay (EBAY) was the most mentioned retailer on social media, ""with eBay sellers promoting their items for purchase and eBay buyers highlighting products they bought that they couldn't find in stores,"" Adobe said.Amazon shares rose 3.1% to 780.45 in heavy volume on the stock market today, retaking its 50-day moving average. Amazon hadn't closed above that key support level since Oct. 27, when the online giant missed earnings estimates and gave cautious guidance.Shares of eBay edged up, continuing to trade comfortably above their 50-day. Apple, which announced December App Store revenue hit $3 billion in December, also nudged higher, close to a buy point.Amazon, Wal-Mart (WMT) and Target (TGT) lagged eBay in social-media mentions.Pokemon Sun/Moon was the most frequently mentioned product, followed by Barbie, Oculus and Legos.""But it's not just the total online sales figure that made this a historic holiday shopping season,"" said Tamara Gaffney, principal analyst and director at Adobe Digital Insights, in a statement. ""This year, Black Friday set a new record by surpassing the $3 billion mark for the first time at $3.34 billion, with high growth in the evening hours.""Black Friday also became the first day in retail history to bring in more than $1 billion in mobile sales, she said.And Adobe's report indicated that more people are doing their buying later in the holiday season — posing more challenges to the delivery infrastructures of UPS (UPS) and FedEx (FDX).Sales accelerated closer to the end of last month, Adobe said, as shipping cutoff dates approached and more customers made purchases online and picked them up in stores.IBD'S TAKE: As malls become relics of the retail and real estate world and Amazon comes to dominate more forms of commerce, many store chains will face a reckoning this year.The gains in online sales have come at the expense of many brick-and-mortar retailers. Macy's and Kohl's (KSS) slashed earnings views late Wednesday as both reported a 2.1% same-store sales decline in November and December. Barnes & Noble (BKS) also said holiday sales were grim, while Sears announced a new raft of store closures and sold its Craftsman tool line.Macy's shares crashed 14% Thursday, Kohl's 19% and Barnes & Noble nearly 7%. Other department stores, apparel retailers and makers and other retail-related groups were big losers Thursday.Those follow other signs that physical stores were suffering.Handbag maker and retailer Kate Spade (KATE) is reportedly exploring a sale, while Nordstrom (JWN) management, according to a JPMorgan report, said brick-and-mortar traffic was at its worst levels in more than 40 years.Off-price retailers, however, have fared better against the likes of Amazon in part due to their ""treasure hunt"" appeal, in which shoppers don't entirely know what kind of bargain they're going to find.RELATED:Christmas Meltdown: Macy's, Kohl's, Kors, Fossil, L Brands, OthersWhat's Driving The Success Of 'Un-Amazon-Able' Ulta Beauty?Ross Stores: A No-Nonsense Retailer Free From Amazon's Clutches

368,TGT,"November retail sales rose 0.1% vs. the prior month, the Commerce Department said Wednesday, less than expected as the holiday shopping season got underway and consumer optimism jumped after the presidential election.Sales rose 0.2% excluding autos and 0.2% excluding autos and gas.Economists expected a 0.4% seasonally adjusted increase for retail sales, as well as a 0.4% gain excluding autos and 0.3% excluding autos and gas. October retail sales rose 0.6%, revised down from 0.8%.One issue is whether postelection sentiment would spur higher spending. The IBD/TIPP Economic Optimism Index shot up to a 10-year high in December. The stock market has soared to record highs since Donald Trump's presidential win on hopes for big tax cuts and regulatory relief. The stock market rally both reflect and fuels increased confidence — and bolstering portfolios and 401(k)s.However, auto sales fell 0.5%, their first decline since March.Amazon (AMZN) and other online retailers remain strong. Nonstore sales rose just 0.1% vs. October, seasonally adjusted, but were up 11.9% vs. a year earlier, far outstripping other major categories. Several reports indicated that Thanksgiving weekend sales rose sharply online, with mall traffic declining.IBD'S TAKE: After initially lagging during the Trump market rally, Apple, Amazon and other big-cap techs are shaping up for potential breakouts.Department store sales fell by 0.2%, with sporting goods chains down 1%. Electronic and appliance stores edged up just 0.1% while clothiers' sales were flat. Furniture and home furnishing chains (up 0.7%), restaurants (0.8%), grocery stores (0.4%) were solid.However, Target (TGT) gave upbeat guidance last month and later said Black Friday sales were strong. Shares of Target and many brick-and-mortar retailers rallied sharply following the election and amid relatively upbeat earnings and outlooks. Wal-Mart, the world's largest retailer, also has risen, despite a brief sell-off on weaker-than-expected Q3 sales. Target, Wal-Mart and many traditional retailers are seeing significant online sales growth.As for hot products, the Apple iPhone 7 likely will be a solid seller. Apple iPads and Samsung 4K TV were hot sellers on Black Friday and Cyber Monday, thanks to big discounts.Hefty discounts make it hard to tell if a retailer's holiday sales will translate into big profits or weak margins.Next week, FedEx (FDX) will report quarterly earnings, with close attention paid to the shipping giant's comments about holiday shipments. FedEx and UPS (UPS) offer a rough proxy for e-commerce sales.Also next week, Nike (NKE) and mall-based athletic shoe retailer Finish Line (FINL) should give an idea about holiday demand for athletic footwear and apparel.In stock market trading, Amazon ended the trading day down 0.7% to 768.82, still below its 50-day moving average. Apple edged higher, extending a rise above its 50-day line as it nears a buy point. Target dipped while Wal-Mart rose fractionally.RELATED:Wholesale Prices Jump 1.3%, With Inflation On The Comeback TrailFactory Production Drops for First Time in Three Months

369,TGT,"Amazon (AMZN) is gaining ground in large retail markets beyond its core markets of electronics and media, putting the e-commerce giant in position for a strong performance in 2017, says a report from Cowen.Cowen analyst John Blackledge on Thursday reiterated his call that Amazon will become the largest retailer of apparel and accessories in the U.S. market next year, passing Macy's (M) as the leader.""Amazon's broad offering coupled with fast paced growth of Amazon apparel purchasers will drive further share gains and, in turn, reduce massive fragmentation, as about 45% of U.S. apparel revenue sits outside the top 15 players,"" Blackledge wrote.The notion that Amazon will push deeper into apparel and make it a strategic focus was amplified Tuesday when the e-commerce giant unveiled a line of private-label dress shirts for men. The company said it plans to expand into dress pants, sport shirts and sweaters in the future.Blackledge has an outperform rating on Amazon and price target of 1050.Amazon stock fell 0.4% to 767.33 on the stock market today. Amazon is working on a two-month consolidation, but it's still below its 50-day line since it reported weaker-than-expected Q3 earnings and cautious guidance on Oct. 27.IBD'S TAKE: New products or services represent the N in IBD's CAN SLIM investing system. Strong earnings growth (the C and A in CAN SLIM, for Current earnings and Annual earnings) is the No. 1 factor to look for in a stock, but New products or services often generate stellar profitability.On Monday Amazon announced Amazon Go, a high-tech convenience store in Seattle, where Amazon is based. The 1,800-square-foot store is in beta-testing for now; it opens to all in early 2017. Amazon Go takes dead aim at the physical-store world and poses an increasing threat to Wal-Mart (WMT) and others.Amazon also reportedly plans to open dozens of small retail storefronts in shopping malls over the next year, designed to showcase its hardware devices, such as the Kindle and Amazon Echo.Large U.S. retailers are not running from the pressure.With the continuing aggression of Amazon, Wal-Mart intends to bring online ordering of groceries and curbside pickup service to nearly a quarter of its roughly 4,600 U.S. stores by the end of 2017, Wal-Mart executives recently said.Target (TGT) reported strong digital sales in the third quarter and surprisingly bullish earnings and holiday-quarter guidance. Macy's noted strength in Apple (AAPL) sales and signaled a cheery holiday season ahead. Target also noted ""meaningful"" improvements in sales of Apple products in Q3.Among other reasons Blackledge is bullish on Amazon is its Amazon Prime membership platform. He estimates there are more than 50 million Amazon Prime members, who pay an annual fee to receive benefits such as free shipping, special deals, and access to Amazon music and video services. Amazon Prime members order more and spend more than non-Prime members and are ""extremely loyal,"" Blackledge wrote.Another positive is Amazon Web Services, which is the leading provider of public cloud services. It's ""well positioned to benefit from the continued workload migration to the cloud,"" Blackledge wrote.RELATED:TV Wars Accelerate As Amazon Expands HBO, Cinemax On Prime ChannelsAre Apple, FANG Stocks Ready To Join The Trump Rally?Amazon Devices Were Amazon's Top Sellers Over Thanksgiving WeekendAmazon's Next Big Growth Play Will Surprise YouAmazon Fights Google, Apple For Smart Device Clout

370,TGT,"Online retail king Amazon.com (AMZN) is taking dead aim at the physical-store world Monday, introducing Amazon Go, a retail convenience store format it is developing that will use computer vision and deep-learning algorithms to let shoppers just pick up what they want and exit the store without any checkout procedure. And Amazon reportedly has more such store concepts in the works.Shoppers will merely need to tap the Amazon Go app on their smartphones, and their virtual shopping carts will automatically tabulate what they owe, and deduct that amount from their Amazon accounts, sending you a receipt. It's what the company has deemed ""just walk out technology,"" which it said is based on the same technology used in self-driving cars. It's certain to up the ante in the company's competition with Wal-Mart (WMT), Target (TGT) and the other retail leaders.IBD'S TAKE: Amazon isn't the only retailer to test skipping the checkout line. Wal-Mart warehouse chain Sam's Club is rolling out self-scan and pay. That's part of Wal-Mart's big push to improve efficiency, transforming whole industries once again: ""How Wal-Mart May Revive U.S. Productivity — And Its Own Fortunes.""The company said its first Amazon Go store -- an 1,800-square-foot convenience store -- is in its home base of Seattle, but for now is just open to Amazon employees on a beta test basis. It says the store will open for everyone in early 2017.Amazon explained Amazon Go in a press release and short video.The company said the store will feature groceries, including ready-to-eat breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snack options made daily. It will also stock ""well-known brands"" and ""special finds.""""We view grocery as AMZN's biggest potential source of revenue upside over time, with Go being another layer of AMZN's multi-platform grocery strategy,"" Cowen & Co. analyst John Blackledge wrote in a bullish research report Monday.Amazon, though, is exploring at least three formats of brick-and-mortar food stores, the Wall Street Journal reported Monday, citing people familiar with the matter.  The other two formats are for facilities larger the Go convenience stores, the WSJ said, and will include curbside pickup.Amazon stock closed up 2.6% at 759.36 on the stock market today, but still below its 50-day line after falling after Donald Trump was elected president. Trump has said Amazon benefited from unfair tax breaks, and he has feuded with the Washington Post, which is owned individually by Amazon CEO and founder Jeff Bezos.RELATED:Amazon's Next Big Growth Play Will Surprise YouAmazon, Other Fang Stocks Dip On Sector RotationAmazon Fights Google, Apple For Smart Device Clout

371,TGT,"The U.S. economy expanded at a 3.2% annual rate in the third quarter, the Commerce Department said Tuesday. That's the strongest growth since the second quarter of 2014 and revised up slightly from the initial reading of a 2.9% gain.Economists had expected a 3.1% revised reading.Consumer spending rose at a 2.8% pace, faster than the initial reading of 2.1%. .Separately, the Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index shot up 8.5 points in November to 107.1, the highest since July 2007 and much better than views for a rise to 101. The reading, which reflects post-election sentiment, showed consumers are more upbeat about current and future conditions for business and jobs.Together with the GDP data, the report bodes well for consumers' willingness to spend this holiday season.Initial readings on holiday spending have been mixed. In-store sales over the Thanksgiving weekend fell particularly sharply, though that partly reflects a shift to online shopping and retailers offering deals throughout November and December.Online holiday sales are booming, growing even stronger than expected. That should be good news for Amazon (AMZN), which has outstripped e-commerce growth in recent years. But Target (TGT), Best Buy (BBY), Wal-Mart (WMT) and other retailers are putting more effort than ever on online sales.IBD'S TAKE: Stock markets have rallied on hopes for Trump's tax and spending plans, but here's why economists are wary of Trumpnomics.Apple (AAPL) products have been big sellers, with Target and Best Buy offering deep discounts on Apple iPads. Samsung 4K TVs have also been hot.Business investment on structures was revised up sharply, though spending on equipment and software was revised down. Net exports boomed in Q3, though largely on soybean exports. Residential investment was revised to a smaller 4.4% decline.Meanwhile, the S&P/Case-Schiller 20-city home price index for September rose 0.4% vs. August, matching economists' expectations. Home values ros 5.1% vs. a year earlier, just below forecasts for 5.2%.The Case-Schiller index is considered one of the most comprehensive for home prices, but it is backward looking. Even's September's data will reflect a three-month moving average.Meanwhile, mortgage rates rose along with Treasury yields in recent months, especially after the presidential election. Investors are betting on Federal Reserve rate hikes and perhaps higher inflation.Apple shares fell 0.1% on the stock market today, still trading modestly below their 50-day moving average. Amazon slid 0.55%, also finding resistance at the 50-day line. Target, Best Buy and Wal-Mart rose less than 1%.On Thursday, the Institute for Supply Management will release its November manufacturing index, while automakers will release U.S. sales figures. On Friday, the Labor Department will release its employment report for November.

372,TGT,"Analysts at BTIG lowered their holiday outlook on Monday on higher ""promotionally-driven sales"" as spending and traffic fell over the big holiday shopping weekend.BTIG now sees 2016 holiday same-store sales rising 1.7% down from the 2% forecast in September. The analysts cited a report from ShopperTrak that found traffic at brick & mortar stores traffic fell 1% on Thanksgiving and Black Friday sales while RetailNext said sales at brick & mortar stores fell 5%.The analysts found full parking lots at Best Buy (BBY) and Wal-Mart (WMT) early on Black Friday but said shoppers were bargain hunters trying to score deep discounts.Average spending per person fell 3% to $289.19 vs. 2015, according to a Friday-Saturday NRF survey conducted by Prosper Insights & Analytics. More people shopped online vs. in stores, NRF said.Best Buy shares slid 2.7% to 45.34 on the stock market today. Wal-Mart shares fell 4 cents to 71.19.BTIG said that the four-day holiday weekend will account for 18% to 21% of total holiday sales with Black Friday itself representing 8%-10% of total holiday sales.Some shoppers skipped long lines and crowded parking lots to shop online. E-commerce sales over the holiday rose 17.7% to $5.3 billion from 2015.Total online sales rose 16.4% to $9.36 billion, according to Adobe Digital Insights. Amazon (AMZN) said Thursday-Friday sales would top a year earlier. Given that Amazon has outpaced online sales growth in recent years, that's a low bar.Amazon's best-selling items over the weekend were the Dot, a low-end version of its Amazon Echo smart speaker, and the Amazon Fire TV Stick with Alexa Voice Remote.But Amazon products weren't the most sought after electronic items.According to Adobe (ADBE) report the five top-selling electronic products on Black Friday were Apple (AAPL) iPads, Samsung 4K TVs, Apple MacBook Air notebooks, LG TVs and Microsoft (MSFT) Xbox game consoles.Amazon shares fell 1.7% to 766.77, pulling back from a test of its 50-day line. It has buy point of 847.31. Apple was off 0.2% to 111.57, above an old buy point of 110.33. It's also in a flat base with a potential buy point of 118.79. Microsoft rose 8 cents to 60.61, still in buy range.IBD'S TAKE: Apple and Amazon items might be hot ticket items this year but their stocks might be as well as they at could make notable moves during the holiday shopping season.Best Buy and Target (TGT) were seen to have the best Black Friday deals for Apple products according to reports.Cyber Monday will be one of the biggest, if not the biggest, online shopping day of the year in the U.S.Target shares fell 1.1% to 77.73.Adobe estimates Cyber Monday sales will hit $3.36 billion, up 9.4% from 2015. That would just top Black Friday online sales, which soared 21.6% to $3.34 billion.RELATED: Thanksgiving Weekend Spending Down; More Shopped OnlineRetailers Heavily Discount Video Games To Drive SalesWireless Headphones, 4K TVs, Drones Top Christmas Wish Lists

373,TGT,"Consumers hit the malls, PCs and phones over the holiday weekend for big discounts, but they spent less than a year earlier, the National Retail Federation said Sunday, with more people shopping online than in actual stores.Average spending per person fell 3% to $289.19 vs. 2015, according to a Friday-Saturday NRF survey conducted by Prosper Insights & Analytics.""It was a strong weekend for retailers, but an even better weekend for consumers, who took advantage of some really incredible deals,"" NRF President and CEO Matthew Shay said. ""In fact, over one third of shoppers said 100% of their purchases were on sale.""The number of shoppers rose to 154 million from 151 million in 2015. That reflected a 4.2% rise in online shopping and a 3.7% drop in-store shopping.Analytics firm RetailNext found that in-store sales tumbled 10.4% on Black Friday.The NRF survey found that 44% shopped online and 40% went in-store.Thanksgiving and Black Friday online sales rose 18% to $5.27 billion, according to a separate survey by Adobe Digital Insights, higher than the $5.05 billion expected.Apple (AAPL) products, notably discounted Apple iPads and some Macbooks, were among the big Black Friday sellers online, Adobe said. While Apple did take part in Black Friday directly this year, Best Buy (BBY) and Target (TGT) were generally seen as having better online deals.IBD'S TAKE: Looking for stocks that are at or near proper buy points? Apple, Amazon, Best Buy, Ulta Beauty are stocks to watch.The continuing shift to online should be good news for Amazon, which has dominated e-commerce growth in recent years. Amazon said Thursday-Friday sales would top a year earlier, but that's not really a surprise. Eight of the 10 retailers that had the fastest e-commerce growth were brick-and-mortar locations.Target was bullish about Thursday-Friday sales generally.With deals more widely available throughout November and December, Thanksgiving weekend may be less important. That could explain why the average consumer said they reduced spending this year.Just 9% of consumers have finished holiday shopping, down from 11% a year ago, NRF said. And 23% have yet to do any gift buying, up from 19%.""With mid-season shopping behind us, it's not too late for retailers to tweak their online and in-store strategies to help increase traffic and see a big payoff during the last few weeks of the holiday season,"" Shay said.Next up is Cyber Monday. But with online deals so omnipresent already, how much buzz can retailers generate for this traditional online shopping day? Wal-Mart (WMT) launched its ""Cyber Monday"" deals at the crack of midnight on Friday.

374,TGT,"Apple (AAPL) might discontinue its low-cost iPhone SE handset next year in favor of a new entry-level iPhone, a top Apple analyst is speculating.In a research note this week, KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said he expects that Apple's upcoming 11th-generation series of smartphones will come in three screen sizes. The flagship iPhone 8 handset will feature an organic light-emitting diode (OLED) display measuring 5.1 or 5.2 inches, he said. Apple also will sell two LCD-screen models that are the same sizes as the current iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, which have displays measuring 4.7 and 5.5 inches, respectively. Those new LCD handsets could be called the iPhone 7S and iPhone 7S Plus, he said.The 4.7-inch iPhone 7S could become a new midrange or even low-end model for Apple, Kuo said, according to AppleInsider.Apple's current low-end smartphone is its iPhone SE, which starts at $399. The next cheapest iPhone is the iPhone 6S, which starts at $549. Apple introduced the iPhone SE in March and is expected to skip its traditional annual hardware upgrade for the product.IBD'S TAKE: Apple stock has a below-average IBD Composite Rating of 43, meaning it has been outperformed by 57% of stocks in key metrics over the past 12 months. Apple stock has formed a flat base with a possible buy point of 118.79.The iPhone SE is Apple's bid to attract more price-sensitive consumers, especially in emerging markets like China.The iPhone 8 is expected to be a major redesign, featuring a bezel-free, edge-to-edge OLED display. OLED screens reduce power consumption and extend battery life. They also have faster refresh rates, better contrast, sharper color and a wider viewing angle. Plus, they can be used in curved and wraparound displays.The iPhone 8 also might feature wireless charging or superfast charging, analysts say. It also will get a speedier processor and improved camera. The iPhone 8 is due out in fall 2017.Apple and third-party retailers were offering Black Friday deals on iPhones, iPads and other Apple products for post-Thanksgiving sales.Apple on Friday was offering free Apple gift cards worth up to $150 to shoppers who buy select Apple products at full price. But better deals for Apple products could be found at retailers like Best Buy (BBY) and Target (TGT).For instance, Target was selling the Apple Watch Series 1 smartwatch for $198 on Black Friday, a $71 discount off its regular price of $269. Meanwhile, Apple was giving customers a $25 Apple gift card if they bought a full-price Apple Watch.Apple wasn't discounting its iPhone 7 series phones for Black Friday. But Target was giving customers a $250 Target gift card if they bought and activated an iPhone 7 handset. And Best Buy was offering gift cards of $100 to $250 depending on the model of iPhone 7 purchased.Drexel Hamilton analyst Brian White on Friday reiterated his buy rating on Apple with a price target of 185. Apple stock rose 0.49% to 111.77 in the shortened session on the stock market today. Shares have been trading below their 50-day moving average all month, after hitting a nearly one-year high of 118.69 on Oct. 11.""Apple remains one of the best-positioned tech companies to benefit from spending trends this holiday season with a well-received iPhone 7/7 Plus, a new Apple Watch and a new MacBook Pro with Touch Bar,"" White said in a research report.RELATED:Apple Poised For Prime Spot Under Christmas TreeApple iPhone 7 In Short Supply In U.S., China; Plus Models ScarceSmartphone Shake-Up: Samsung Slips, China Expands, iPhone 8 Pending

375,TGT,"High expectations got the better of Ulta Beauty (ULTA) last quarter, despite solid results and bumped-up guidance. Could that happen to the specialty beauty retailer again, even if its third-quarter results shine late Thursday?As of Monday, Wall Street analysts are anticipating per-share profit to rise 23% to $1.37 a share on 22% revenue growth to $1.11 billion.Cosmetics and skin care are retail standouts. Specialty shops Ulta and LVMH-owned Sephora have been riding the beauty trends, with Ulta able to serve up double-digit same-store sales growth during a time when many other retailers are hoping for comps that are simply in the black. And analysts often call out Ulta Beauty as a top retail pick, immune to the charms of shopping on Amazon (AMZN).So why would investors expect anything but a rally from positive results? A quick recap:Despite reporting better-than-expected Q2 results in late August, shares tumbled over 6% and sank below their 50-day line. Slightly light Q3 profit guidance and concerns of high valuation were tossed around as possible causes.One equity strategist even mused on Twitter that male investors might not ""get"" the beauty business.Since then, however, Ulta has raised its Q3 and full-year guidance. For the 2016 fiscal year, it now expects mid-20% EPS growth and 12%-14% comps gains, up from low- to mid-20% growth and 11%-13% increases, respectively.Shares popped back up above their key 50-day level on the news.IBD'S TAKE: Ulta isn't the only retailer taking advantage of shopper lust for beauty products.

Apple stock climbed 0.5% while Fitbit fell 2%.At Macy's, the crowds have been ""steady,"" CEO Terry Lundgren told CNBC, adding that sales of apparel — dresses in particular — are strong.IBD'S TAKE: Looking for great holiday season deals on stocks?

Specialty retailers like Ulta and LVMH (LVMUY)-owned Sephora thus far appear well-shielded against Amazon's (AMZN) e-commerce appetite, and experts are optimistic about the growth prospects of e.l.f.'s low-cost products.IBD'S TAKE: Retailers are gearing up to do battle against Amazon and friends.

386,TGT,"Saying business and other enterprise customers continue to spend to prevent network breaches, Check Point Software Technologies (CHKP) early Monday posted Q3 earnings and revenue that handily topped Wall Street estimates, sending shares of Check Point and other security software vendors rising.""Customers continue to leverage the Check Point security platform and increase their adoption of our advanced security capabilities which is resulting in higher subscription revenues,"" company CEO Gil Shwed said in the earnings releases. ""We continued to see strong sales of our SandBlast, Zero-Day Protection solutions, resulting in triple-digit growth as customers focus on prevention.""The company reported sales of $428 million and EPS ex items of $1.13, where analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had forecast $1.08 and $423 million. Q4 guidance for EPS ex items and for sales also beat analyst consensus, William Blair analyst Jonathan Ho said in a research note.Year-over-year sales growth of 6%, however, was the smallest since Q4 2014, and the 8.7% growth in earnings per share minus items was the smallest rise since Q1 2014. UBS analyst Brent Thill, in a research report this month, said the software cybersecurity industry has been benefiting from a ""binge-buying"" growth mode after high-profile breaches at Target (TGT) and elsewhere, but that this ""supercycle"" was ending.IBD'S TAKE: The security group doesn't rank highly at the moment, but to learn about things like the CASB (cloud access security broker) market — where the players include Check Point, keep tabs on the IBD Industry Snapshot, which looks at the hot and potentially hot industry groups.After a slew of high-profile data breaches, many companies rushed to upgrade firewalls that sit between private networks and the internet and invested in threat detection technologies. ""We expect the next stage of the spending cycle to intensify competitively, where incumbents — namely perimeter security vendors — are likely to contend with greater discounting tactics,"" Thill wrote at that time.On Monday, though, William Blair's Ho said Check Point's Q3 ""product outperformance was driven by strong adoption of the company's next-generation firewalls ... .""""While the environment remains competitive, we believe Check Point can continue to sustain market share when factoring in the revenue impact from the shift from product revenue to subscription revenue,"" Ho said in his research report, maintaining an outperform rating on Check Point stock.Check Point is No. 1 in firewalls, according to tech research firm Gartner, and also in unified threat management, or UTM.IBD's 26-company Computer Software-Security group has rebounded from a big dip early this year, but it's down about 8% for the year and ranks just No. 51 out of 197 groups.Proofpoint (PFPT) is one of the top-rated companies in the group, and its earning beat on Oct. 20 lifted cybersecurity stocks. Its focus is on data loss and email protection, competing more directly with companies such as Symantec (SYMC) and Cisco Systems (CSCO) rather than Check Point.Check Point stock rose 4.4% in the stock market today, to 84.56, hitting a four-month-plus high. Shares of Cisco rose a fraction Monday, while Symantec stock rose 0.60% and Palo Alto Networks (PANW) rose 1.5%.RELATED:Cybersecurity 'Supercycle' Ending?Proofpoint 'Separating From Security Pack'

387,TGT,"Amazon (AMZN) on Thursday announced that it will hire more than 120,000 seasonal holiday workers this year, up 20% from a year earlier, as the e-commerce giant continues to deliver blistering growth. Meanwhile, brick-and-mortar retailers plan flat to lower holiday staffing.Amazon's second-quarter revenue rose 31% vs. a year earlier, the best gain in more than four years. Part of that is due to its booming Amazon Web Services cloud-service unit, but the company's core business of selling goods is still robust.As for traditional retailers, Target (TGT) has said it will hire 70,000 in-store staffers this holiday season, unchanged from 2015. Kohl's (KSS) will add 69,000 temporary workers for a fourth straight year. Macy's (M), which is closing many stores, is adding 89,000, down 2%. Target, Kohl's and Macy's have reported multiple quarters of declining sales.IBD'S TAKE: Amazon continues to expands into groceries, reportedly planning to set up convenience stores as well as curbside pickup locations. That could boost Amazon revenue by billions of dollars and pose a bigger threat to Wal-Mart, Target and other big grocery sellers.Meanwhile, FedEx is hiring 50,000 seasonal workers, down slightly vs. last year. UPS says it will hire 95,000 seasonal workers, the same as last year. UPS cited efficiencies that will allow it to ship more with less.FedEx and UPS have been big winners from e-commerce shipments, but Amazon is building up its own fleet of planes for shipping.Some 14,000 seasonal workers were brought on full-time after the 2015 holidays, Amazon said, predicting even more permanent hires this time.Amazon shares fell 0.6% to 829.28 on the stock market today, but are still close to record highs set last week.Macy's fell 2% and Kohl's lost 1.85%, while Target nudged a few pennies higher. All three are well off highs.

388,TGT,"More than 9 million posts on Facebook's (FB) Instagram get the hashtag #selfiesunday, 6 million-plus are marked #selfienation, about 275 million are tagged #selfie, and 302 million are simply tagged #me.So is it any surprise that products like Make Up For Ever's ""Ultra HD"" foundation, Temptu's airbrush foundation kits, or Pur Cosmetics' ""Love Your Selfie"" palette exist?""Millennials have a mindset of being 'selfie-ready,'"" Piper Jaffray analyst Steph Wissink told Investor's Business Daily. That has helped drive lip and eye products to become two of the best-performing cosmetic categories for the last three years, she says, highlighting that the beauty sector's growth tracks ""almost exactly"" with the rise of smartphones and mobile devices.Camera-friendly cosmetics — once the realm of news anchors and movie stars — are now mainstays at specialty beauty stores Ulta Beauty (ULTA) and LVMH (LVMUY)-owned Sephora. But as Amazon (AMZN) continues to suck up more dollars from consumers, brick-and-mortar chains are increasingly latching on to the social media-driven fire for cosmetics and skin care products, which are proving to be a glimmer of hope for a surprising range of shops trying to lure Instagram-savvy shoppers.Last year, cosmetics, skin care and fragrance made up a $37.7 billion market in the U.S. vs. $266.8 billion in apparel and footwear sales, according to Euromonitor research. But beauty has been the fastest-growing retail segment for at least the last three years, outpacing apparel, footwear, food, in addition to being one of the fastest-growing segments online, said NPD Group analyst Karen Grant.Echoing that trend, Ulta continues to crank out double-digit same-store sales gains — 14.4% in its most recent quarter — while the Gap (GPS) and Macy's (M) each posted comps of negative 2% in their latest reports, while Nordstrom (JWN) reported a 1.2% decline. Their respective stocks have followed the diverging sales trajectories as well.IBD'S TAKE: Robust and reliable growth appeals to institutional investors, so it's not surprising that Ulta has seen eight straight quarters of rising fund ownership. Plus, four typically better-performing mutual funds have reported a position in the stock.The major chains have taken notice, and are looking for a makeover with some social-media flair.Retail icon Macy's, which by Cowen & Co.'s estimates will be overtaken by Amazon next year as the biggest U.S. clothing seller, is planning to open more in-store locations of luxury beauty retailer Bluemercury, a 2015 acquisition, and is expanding its brand assortment beyond traditional prestige names to include smaller labels.And for any shoppers who bought $35 in Rampage accessories, the nation's largest department store also recently offered a free selfie stick.""Beauty is the new hoodie, in terms of being a product that works well with social media,"" said Cowen analyst Oliver Chen, noting that retailers are looking for categories that are less vulnerable to promotions and unseasonable weather. ""You can't deny the power of social media. On average, someone will spend over 15 hours a week on social media.""Social media help shape and stimulate new trends, he added, as well as educate others about those trends. Makeup lovers now scour Alphabet's (GOOGL) YouTube for contouring tips and skim hashtags for brow-shaping tutorials from the seemingly endless parade of self-appointed beauty gurus with a domain name and an Instagram account.Department store beauty counters remain a fixture but are in particular danger of losing relevance in this digital age. NPD Group said that compared to two years ago, 11% more women are doing cosmetics product research online.By the time the customer enters the store, she's frequently past the product research stage, says Wissink. ""She walks in, she says 'I need palette 212,' and (the salesperson) goes 'Wait a second, don't you want to see our lip, our eye (products)?'""The social-media driven shift in habits means retail heavyweights have to enhance the store experience. In fact, chains that previously had no service aspect are adopting in-house experts to guide customers through the beauty aisle.For example, CVS Health (CVS) now has in-store beauty consultants and last year upgraded its makeup and skin care offerings in a few thousand locations. In its August earnings call, CEO Larry Merlo said the drugstore chain was focused on shifting its assortment toward health, beauty and store brands, all of which are higher-margin segments.And Target (TGT) features a ""beauty concierge,"" clad entirely in black and available to answer questions about the big-box retailer's brands.""It's meant to create retail theater,"" said Wissink, noting that customers ""crave that tactile in-store experience.""Shoppers enjoy sampling new products in store, and the quest for a Holy Grail blush can become a day out with the girls. In the process, it's not uncommon to snap a selfie and send it to a friend — or to Twitter (TWTR) followers — for immediate feedback.For their part, premium brands like Estee Lauder and Clinique are loosening their grip on exclusivity as they accept that shoppers like to sample different brands from a variety of retailers.They've broadened their distribution to specialty retailers like Ulta and lower-tier department stores like J.C. Penney (JCP), which nixed creating a whole new in-store beauty experience in lieu of bringing in an already-successful titan: Sephora.Its in-store Sephora locations were among the department store's top-performing divisions, the company said in its Q2 earnings release in August, and there are plans for more Sephora shop-in-shops to drive beauty-revenue growth.""Seems like everyone's trying to get a piece of that pie,"" said FBR analyst Susan Anderson. ""It's working, at least for Sephora and Ulta, so everyone jumps on the bandwagon.""And as beauty products increasingly drive traffic to stores, chains that traditionally haven't sold them are now testing them out.A Barnes & Noble store seems like a peculiar place to open up a beauty counter, but it may be inclined to seize trends early, given that Amazon laid waste to book sellers.The Glossary, as it is cleverly called, is a college-focused shop-in-shop stocked full of makeup and skin care products from Smashbox, Burt's Bees and other millennial-friendly brands, not far from the Jane Austen paperbacks and math textbooks needed to survive freshman year. Barnes & Noble College — a subsidiary of Barnes & Noble Education (BNED) -- has rolled out the pilot program at a handful of locations, including Emory University, Southern Methodist University and the University of California at Riverside.""(It's) similar to what they did a few years ago with coffee shops,"" said NPD's Grant. Barnes & Noble wants shoppers ""to browse, to know that they can hang out."" After all, the longer retailers can get customers to stay in the store, she said, the better the chances of them buying something.Apparel stores like Urban Outfitters (URBN) and American Eagle Outfitters (AEO) are also cultivating nascent beauty offerings. Teen retailers have broadly been trying to reconfigure their identities now that their millennial consumer base has grown up and out of midaughts trends.Urban's curated ""Back-to-School Beauty"" collection showcases a small mix of products, including trendy Korean brand Tonymoly and uberhip Milk Makeup. (Besides select Urban Outfitters, the only other place to buy Milk in a store is Sephora.) In its mid-August earnings call, Urban Outfitters management called out the strength of its beauty segment, as well as its home and intimates divisions.American Eagle's foray into the beauty space has been more hesitant, though it may have more up its sleeve. Its Aerie Global Brand President Jennifer Foyle noted in American Eagle's May earnings call that the company has assembled a team ""to venture into the beauty business, but we are going to walk before we run."" It, too, sells Tonymoly face masks, plus some assorted Aerie-branded lotions and body washes.Rolling out new display cases is one thing, but building up a healthy following on Twitter, Facebook or Instagram is another.Out of all of its department store brethren, Nordstrom has the strongest social presence, with 2.1 million Instagram followers to Bloomingdales' paltry 608,000 and J.C. Penney's 300,000 follower count. It was one of the first major companies to incorporate Like2Buy into its Instagram profile, allowing customers to click through and buy the pictured products.All of them pale in comparison to Sephora's 8.8 million followers and Ulta Beauty's 2.4 million Instagram devotees. Still, the department stores are seeing progress at the cash register.Nordstrom's summer ""Glam-Out Days"" offered free makeup tips and services during its yearly ""anniversary sale"" event. According to Piper Jaffray research, beauty products had the highest sellout rate during the promotional period, with 51% of Nordstrom's makeup and skin care products selling out, up from 30% last year and 8% in 2014.""One of the things that makes beauty important within department stores is (that) it's a gateway,"" said Grant.

389,TGT,"Will corporate spending on cybersecurity insurance siphon away budget dollars from security technology?Insurance companies led by American International Group (AIG), Chubb (CB), Beazley and Axis Capital are eyeing the cybersecurity market. Security providers such as Cisco Systems (CSCO), IBM (IBM), Palo Alto Networks (PANW) and Check Point Software (CHKP) are paying attention.Many companies are interested in coverage for ""business interruption"" losses, if computer systems or data are unavailable due to an attack. They are finding that coverage, while other cybersecurity insurance plans cover destruction of data and property and ""reputational harm."" Theft of intellectual property, however, often is not included in such coverage, with too many unknowns for insurers.Inadequate coverage and expensive premiums keep many companies from buying cybersecurity insurance, analysts say, but they also say such coverage is improving and gaining more customers.IBD'S TAKE: At No. 56, IBD's Computer Software-Security industry group doesn't have a high enough ranking among the 197 groups that IBD tracks to warrant too much attention. But there are always areas worth attention, and one way to hone your skills is to take some lessons from IBD University on how to buy stocks.Consulting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers sees big growth. It estimates that total cybersecurity premiums will skyrocket to $7.5 billion in 2020 from $2.5 billion in 2015. That estimate might be low. Aon Benfield, a reinsurance broker, says cybersecurity insurance premiums will reach at least $10 billion by 2020. Insurance broker March & McLennan estimates that the cyberinsurance market — which includes coverage for business interruption, reputational harm and much more — could multiply by ""three to five times"" by 2020 from about $2 billion in 2014.The growth projections have put security technology providers on alert, but worries that cybersecurity insurance will lower spending on security technology might be overblown, says Rob Ayoub, an analyst at research firm IDC.""There's been wild theories that companies are going to chuck security out the window,"" Ayoub told IBD. ""Companies may spend less, depending on what's covered (in their cyberinsurance). But when you think of fire insurance: Just because you have fire insurance doesn't mean that you don't spend on smoke alarms or fire extinguishers, right?""Cyberinsurance may be part of the equation, but it's not a replacement for security.""Cybersecurity insurance is still evolving and most companies are evaluating how much to spend on network security vs. insurance, and what types or levels of coverage to have.If companies buy insurance, they still have reasons to keep investing in security technology. One big reason would be to get lower insurance rates. Companies might be able to buy cybersecurity insurance at lower rates by demonstrating that they've upgraded to the newest software or that they comply with industry ""state-of-the-art"" practices to deter cyberattacks.IBD's 26-company Computer Software-Security industry group ranks No. 56 out of 197 groups, with Palo Alto, Barracuda Networks (CUDA) and Proofpoint (PFPT) among the stocks with the highest IBD Composite Ratings.Corporate spending on security has been growing at about a 6% annual rate, but it usually remains at just 4% to 10% of overall IT budgets, analysts say.Spending on security technologies topped $78 billion last year, says research firm Gartner. After a slew of high-profile data breaches in 2013-14 targeting such companies as Sony (SNE) Pictures and retailer Target (TGT), many companies rushed to buy security technology. That uptick in ""crisis spending"" drove security software stocks to fresh highs in mid-2015. But spending growth on security software has slowed in the past 18 months as companies reassess priorities and fewer big breaches have surfaced.Rand Corp. in September released a study claiming that the average cost of corporate data breaches is less than $200,000, not the millions of dollars that might justify higher spending on technology.But for big companies that fear the really big losses, cybersecurity insurance has limits. A Morgan Stanley study said coverage limits top out near $35 million, though other sources have said $50 million or more.Chief financial officers and boards of directors are getting more involved in setting security budgets, which generally remain under the purview of chief information officers. CFOs might prefer insurance to a bigger security budget.""At some point, enterprises will allocate incremental budget to insurance to protect against catastrophic events rather than keep on building stronger cyber technology,"" said Keith Weiss, a Morgan Stanley analyst, in a recent research report. ""However, this market is still emerging, with insurance companies tackling the challenge in quantifying and pricing for potential cyber-risk.""One problem for insurance firms, says a PwC report, is a lack of actuarial data when it comes to data breaches. In the automobile insurance market, statistics are used to calculate the risk of various car models being stolen, for example. In cybersecurity, new companies aim to provide threat-trend analytics to insurance firms, not easy when many corporate victims prefer to keep smaller breaches out of the public eye.""There isn't enough historical data to gauge losses resulting from brand impairment or compensation to customers or suppliers,"" said PwC.The PwC report says that because data breaches can remain undetected for several months or even years, potential losses are hard to estimate.Some industries, such as retail and health care, face higher premiums due to potential exposure of customer data. Ultimately, though, more companies may get coverage as cyber-risk models are developed.The devil will be in the details of cybercoverage. Insurance may cover cyberattacks by organized crime rings or ""super-hackers,"" but probably not state-sponsored ones from China or Russia because of the issues involved. And liability coverage in the cybersecurity insurance realm remains limited and varies according to company and industry, observers say.In Congress, Rep. Ed Perlmutter, D.-Colo., in September introduced a bill offering a tax deduction of 15% on the costs of cyberinsurance, but the measure hasn't progressed.Jonathan Ho, an analyst at William Blair & Co. who follows Palo Alto Networks, Fortinet (FTNT), CyberArk Software (CYBR) and other cybersecurity vendors, says cybersecurity insurance will become an normal piece of a company's risk management.""Cyberinsurance is something companies will consider separately as part of risk management,"" he said. ""It doesn't remove the responsibility of trying to defend an organization to the best of your ability.""Making cybersecurity investments still makes sense. Some data losses have been in the hundreds of millions of dollars.""RELATED:Proofpoint 'Continues To Separate From Security Pack'Palo Alto Networks, Proofpoint, CyberArk In FavorIs Cybersecurity Supercycle Over?

390,TGT,"A future with slow-growing productivity — and by extension, slow-growing incomes — seems close to becoming conventional wisdom. But the strides that Wal-Mart (WMT) is making with technology that streamlines everything from tracking inventory to simplifying check-out suggest a brighter outlook.The retail giant was considered a prime force behind the last productivity boom (think bar codes, scanners and retailer-supplier data links) and the subsequent productivity bust (heavier reliance on temps and part-time workers come to mind).But facing competitive threats from Amazon (AMZN), Dollar Tree (DLTR), Dollar General (DG), Target (TGT) and Costco (COST), and the simultaneous challenge of substantially raising its own wage scale, Wal-Mart is re-engineering virtually every aspect of its business. New technologies and strategies have been tested, sending drones flying through warehouses, equipping shoppers with their own scanners and putting apps in the hands of efficiency-seeking store managers. Now sales are on the upswing, though profits have yet to follow, as the pace of change at Wal-Mart is accelerating.The payoff for investors won't be immediate. On Oct. 6, Wal-Mart cut its profit outlook again as it invests heavily to improve operations in stores and online. The stock has a lousy 19 Composite Rating out of 99, which means the stock only outperforms 19% of all other stocks based on earnings, share price performance and other key criteria. The Retail-Major Discount Chains group is No. 190 out of 197 industries that IBD tracks.IBD'S TAKE: Wal-Mart, like many retailers and companies in other modest-wage industries, have seen profit margins pressured amid intense competition and rising wage pressures. But some have thrived. On Thursday, Ulta Beauty predicted earnings growth above 20% through 2019. Read this Investor's Corner primer on profit margins.The good news for consumers is that the retail giant is sharing some of its efficiency gains via lower prices, which means you can expect its efficiency measures to spread to other companies. Amazon may be the most disruptive force in retail, but Wal-Mart's sheer scale still gives it an outsized influence on the economy. Kroger (KR), Target and the dollar stores are feeling heat from Wal-Mart price cuts, the companies have hinted at and analysts have signaled in recent weeks. Even fast-casual restaurants and quick-service chains like McDonald's (MCD) appear to be feeling pressure due to Wal-Mart's grocery price cuts along with its upward pressure on wages, with the cost of eating out rising at a record pace vs. eating in. When Wal-Mart makes up its mind to cut prices and do what it must to accomplish that, suppliers and competitors have little choice but to change the way they do business too.Here's a look at some technology programs underway at Wal-Mart and how they could change the productivity paradigm for retailers and the broader economy.IBD'S TAKE: Wal-Mart is the best stock in its sector, but its Retail-Major Discount Chains group is ranked 190 out of 197 by IBD based on stock performance and Wal-Mart shares aren't near a buy point. For a primer on how to find stocks to buy at the right time, visit IBD University.Wal-Mart CEO Doug McMillon said on the Aug. 16 earnings call that the company will roll out its new self-scan-and-pay technology at all Sam's Clubs this fall, letting members of the discount warehouses ""skip the checkout line.""Customers can use the ""Scan & Go"" app to ring up items as they put them in their shopping cart and see a running receipt total on their phones. The app also handles payment, so customers just show their receipts to greeters on the way out.The technology has been a long time in development. In 2014, the company pulled the plug on a year-old Scan & Go pilot program at 200 Wal-Marts using an app that was only compatible with Apple (AAPL) iPhones.But the company isn't reserving its latest innovations for Sam's Club customers. In June, Wal-Mart rolled out mobile payment technology at all of its 4,600 U.S. locations. It is testing out customer handheld scanning devices provided by the store in a number of Wal-Mart locations, but management has noted the logic of offering the same self-scan capability via smartphone that it's doing at Sam's Club.Scanning items as you put them in your cart relieves one of the frustrations of people who prefer the self-checkout lane. But like shoppers who check out with the help of a cashier, they still face another frustration: Finding bar codes slows everything down.Wal-Mart is experimenting with a technology called digital watermarking that, in the words of McMillon via Instagram in June 2015, ""could transform the way our customers check out.""Digimarc (DMRC), which subsequently confirmed that its bar code technology was the subject of McMillon's post, invisibly embeds bar code information repeatedly over retail packaging so there's no need to locate it or reorient the merchandise before scanning.Adoption of this next-generation bar code, if broad adoption is to occur, must proceed in steps. Bar code scanners must be designed to read the digital watermarking, and Zebra Technologies (ZBRA) and Datalogic are now equipping their scanners to do so.Regional grocer Wegmans has begun using digital watermarking on its private-label packaging in a logical first step before broader adoption by consumer packaging companies. Wegmans, which has 89 stores, expects $2 million in annual savings for every extra item scanned per minute vs. the usual 21, noted Cowen & Co. analyst Robert Stone in a recent research report.The next big breakthrough would be for major producers like Procter & Gamble (PG) to update their packaging. A push from Wal-Mart could certainly provide an impetus, but there's another important catalyst: By mid-2018, food labels of large manufacturers must meet new standards, making nutrition information easier to read, Stone notes.Eventually, Digimarc has said, shopping carts equipped with scanners could read its bar codes when customers put items in the cart.Wal-Mart said in June that it will start using drones to take inventory in its warehouses by late 2016 or early 2017, identifying when stocks are misplaced or running low. The drones will make a one-day job out of work that now takes employees a month to complete, while reducing the risk of accidents, Wal-Mart says.The drones are part of a larger push to manage inventories more efficiently. Wal-Mart, like other retailers including Home Depot (HD), Target and Kohl's (KSS), has been making a big push to keep inventories to a minimum and improve efficiency by rationalizing product selection (such as three sizes of salad dressing instead of six) and having more frequent supplier deliveries. Wal-Mart also is keeping more inventory in distribution centers to facilitate e-commerce shipping. One goal is simply limiting the number of times merchandise has to be moved by an employee from the time Wal-Mart receives a supplier shipment to final purchase.The latest U.S. economic data show that inventories at general merchandise stores fell 0.6% from a year earlier in July. In the short term, better inventory management may hold down economywide output and make productivity look awful, even if it's actually a partial result of retailers making efficiency gains. In the second quarter, leaner inventories subtracted 1.16 percentage points from GDP.Over time, though, inventory efficiencies reduce costs and permit lower prices and, possibly, better product selection. Wal-Mart's own inventories declined 2.9% from a year earlier in the second quarter, including a 6.5% drop in comparable-store inventories, management reported on its August earnings call. Meanwhile, in-stock levels continued to rise, meaning fewer frustrated customers.Now every member of Wal-Mart's in-store management team has a My Productivity smartphone app to request restocking of certain items and check sales trends while they roam the aisles and assist customers.""Prior to My Productivity, management associates were spending thousands of hours in the backrooms of our stores annually,"" wrote Mark Ibbotson, Wal-Mart executive vice president, in a June blog post introducing the new technology. ""That simply cannot be in today's world.""Wal-Mart's latest move to improve productivity, like many of its efficiency gains, involved using old technology in a new way. In early September, the company said it was cutting 7,000 cash accounting and invoicing jobs in its U.S. stores. Instead, the company will use cash recycler machines to count money and will handle invoicing at a central office.Wal-Mart also has been dreaming up new ideas for fixing the age-old problem of unused shopping carts left in the parking lot or cluttering the shopping aisles. This year, Wal-Mart filed a patent for a robot that collects unused shopping carts. A related idea would let customers hail a shopping cart via smartphone.While there's no telling how long it may take that burst of creativity to materialize in stores, the key point is that Wal-Mart is leaving no stone unturned or idea unconsidered to drive productivity and improve the customer experience. On Oct. 6, the company hosted a few dozen companies out of 250 original applicants in a ""Technology Innovation Open Call."" The winners got to pitch their technology solutions for retail, logistics, big data, security and social media.Wal-Mart's efficiency moves have swept through the economy before. An influential McKinsey & Co. study on productivity in the second half of the 1990s found that the retail sector accounted for nearly one-fourth of the U.S. rise, adding that ""more than half of the productivity acceleration in the retailing of general merchandise can be explained by only two syllables: Wal-Mart.""Big information technology breakthroughs, such as bar codes, wireless scanning guns and electronic data interchange with suppliers, came long before productivity took off. Wal-Mart's efficiency gains in that era were as much due to managerial efforts, McKinsey found. The key was that its tech and management changes were both geared toward achieving ""everyday low prices."" Wal-Mart reached a scale that compelled its business partners and rivals to follow suit or risk being left behind.U.S. output per work hour at general merchandise stores, excluding department stores, soared by nearly 150% from 1995 to 2007.But over the past eight years through the end of 2015, productivity in this sector has risen just 3%.What went wrong? A sluggish economic recovery, modest wage gains, and an overabundance of stores as Amazon gained market share. Wal-Mart, which opted to close 154 U.S. stores at the start of 2016, went through a six-quarter string of same-store sales declines through mid-2014 as its customer-satisfaction rankings tumbled.Retailers and other modest-wage employers such as fast-food chains took what might be viewed as profit shortcuts. Wal-Mart reportedly boosted its temp workforce and had understaffed stores. Other employers boosted their ranks of part-timers clocking fewer than 30 hours per week to dodge paying for health insurance or facing a fine under the ObamaCare employer mandate.Wal-Mart's penny pinching hurt sales and productivity, ultimately spurring lower profits and a change in strategy.As the economy nears full employment and employers recognize that cutting corners hasn't paid off, wage gains are picking up as companies try to raise their game. Wal-Mart has been at the forefront, raising its own base wage to $10 an hour, pushing other modest-wage employers to follow suit or suffer low morale and high turnover.Yet whatever productivity gains Wal-Mart is seeing from initiatives launched in the past year or two have yet to catch up to its extra spending on wages and on technology to improve customer satisfaction and narrow the gap with Amazon. While sales rose 3.1% from a year ago at Wal-Mart's U.S. stores in the second quarter, expenses rose 8.3% and operating income fell 6.2%.The company warned last week that it won't turn the corner on earnings growth until 2018, forecasting roughly flat per-share profits next year, prompting some analysts to reel in their price target for Wal-Mart shares. Wal-Mart also said it would scale back plans to grow its U.S. store base, adding just 55 stores in the next fiscal year, compared with 135 this year, while building more distribution centers for online orders.Ultimately, consumers will decide with their feet and their wallets how productive Wal-Mart investments turn out to be. On that score, Wal-Mart's 1.2% same-store increase in customer traffic last quarter looked like a good sign, even as fewer people were shopping at rivals Target and Dollar General.Wal-Mart CEO: Sam's Club Shoppers Can Skip Cashier Off The Charts: Fast Food Inflation Vs.

391,TGT,"U.S. retail sales this holiday season may grow at a faster pace than last year, fueled by rising wages and a stronger job market, the National Retail Federation said.Consumer purchases may increase 3.6% to a $655.8 billion in November and December, excluding autos, gas and restaurant sales, the Washington-based NRF said in a statement Tuesday. Sales climbed 3% last year, and the seven-year average since the recession ended in 2009 is 3.4%, the group said.U.S. shoppers may be feeling more holiday spirit, with the unemployment rate holding at an eight-year low and bigger paychecks putting more money in shoppers' wallets. There are signs that consumers already are loosening their purse strings: The U.S. personal savings rate fell to 5.7% of disposable personal income in August, down from 6.2% in March, according to the Commerce Department. Still, weak mall traffic may force traditional retailers to work hard over the holidays to entice customers.""All of the fundamentals are in a good place, giving strength to consumers and leading us to believe that this will be a very positive holiday season,"" NRF Chief Executive Matthew Shay said in the statement.IBD'S TAKE: NRF says e-commerce and other nonstore sales will rise 7% to 10% to $117 billion. While department stores and other brick-and-mortar stores struggle, Amazon continues to enjoy huge growth, with shares hitting new highs. Amazon is on IBD's Leaderboard, a premium service with annotated chart analysis of top stocks, many at or near buy points. Take a free trial.The NRF's holiday sales estimate was lower than a projection from Deloitte, which said last month that sales in stores may increase as much as 4%. A separate survey of about 1,000 U.S. consumers by AlixPartners indicated that 83% of shoppers expect to spend about the same or more this holiday season.In preparation for the holiday rush, retailers are making their annual push for seasonal workers. Target (TGT) and Kohl's (KSS) have said they plan to hire the same number of temporary employees as last year, with both adding about 70,000 apiece. Macy's (M), meanwhile, is hiring 83,000 holiday workers, down about 2,000 from last year.Political uncertainty abroad and at home, as well as the chance of unseasonably warm weather, are the biggest threats that could restrain holiday spending, NRF Chief Economist Jack Kleinhenz said in the statement. Still, the strong U.S. economy is likely to fuel shoppers this season.""Consumers have seen steady job and income gains throughout the year, resulting in continued confidence and the greater use of credit, which bodes well for more spending throughout the holiday season,"" Kleinhenz said.

400,TGT,"It's been awhile since a Target-level security breach erupted, but make no mistake, by many key measures network security breaches continue to rise.The number of reported breaches actually fell March through July compared with the previous five months, yet breaches are up 16% in 2016 through July vs. the year-earlier period, says Piper Jaffray analyst Andrew Nowinski. He says the trend will equate to robust spending on security software in the second half of 2016.Publicly reported breaches are only ""the tip of the iceberg,"" Nowinski told IBD. There's an underworld of hacking activity that doesn't get disclosed or that disclosure laws don't always touch. Ransomware, malware and social engineering -- hacking du jour today -- aren't always disclosed.""Breach activity is definitely increasing on a year-over-year basis, but the breaches are smaller than they were,"" he said. ""The increase in breaches should translate to increasing revenue growth (for security vendors) in the back half of 2016 and early 2017.""Cybersecurity stocks are on an upswing following a Q1 crash that saw IBD's 26-company Computer Software-Security industry group touch a 15-month low of 1484 on Feb. 9. Since then, the group has risen more than 40% and has climbed to No. 34 out of 197 groups tracked, from No. 191 just 13 weeks ago. The group, though, is down 6% this year.The group is led by CyberArk Software (CYBR) and Qualys (QLYS), which both have IBD Composite Ratings of 98 (99 is the highest possible).IBD'S TAKE: CyberArk Software is among a number of Israeli tech companies traded in the U.S. As the world economy expands, investors are advised to keep a broad lookout for winners. One way to do this is to track the IBD Global Leaders list, which currently includes CyberArk among its 10 companies.Wall Street, in general, recognizes there will be flux in the breach environment, says Caleb Barlow, a vice president for IBM (IBM) Security. He says credit-card fraud soared in 2014 and plummeted in 2015. But then came a big jump in health care industry breaches last year, he told IBD.Health care hacks accounted for 49% of the total in July, up from 31% in June, says Nowinski. The health care field had the most breaches that month, but breaches at businesses were No. 2, accounting for 35% of total breaches.Health care data can be coveted by the bad guys, Barlow says. He expects an increase in ransomware and social-engineering attacks for the sector, saying it can be years before these attacks become apparent. For that and other reasons, he says breach data are only a general barometer for the industry.""Bad guys are often in the system for a year before people realize it,"" he told IBD. ""So we don't know yet.""Still, he says it's possible that one in three U.S. residents have had at least some health care data lost to breaches.Entrepreneurial bad actors forced 55 breaches exposing more than 590,000 records in July, down from 67 breaches and 5.7 million records in July 2015, with both months below the historical average of 69 breaches, Nowinski wrote in an Aug. 15 research report.March and April saw more breaches than usual, he said, helping offset the big breaches in 2015 that hit health insurer Anthem (ATHM) and the U.S. Office of Personnel Management. Big 2014 breaches including those at retailer Home Depot (HD) and at bank JPMorgan (JPM). Retail chain Target (TGT) discovered its major breach of customer data in December 2013.July wasn't wracked by a ""mega-breach"" -- a breach that exposes more than 10 million records-- but the breach of Athens Orthopedic Clinic in Georgia resulted in 397,000 online medical records unleashed. That was the largest-known breach in the past three months, Nowinski says.This year has seen some big breaches, though no big headline grabbers, led by attacks on the Office of Child Support Enforcement, 21st Century Oncology and Verizon Enterprise Solutions (a unit of Verizon Communications (VZ)). Through July, there have been 569 reported breaches this year in the U.S., up from 492 in the first seven months of last year, says Nowinski.""Total breach activity is actually increasing, albeit at a slower pace than a few months ago,"" Nowinski said.But Germany-based cable manufacturer Leoni in August announced it had fallen victim to a sophisticated attack, losing about $44 million in the process.Dan Wiley, head of incident response at security software vendor Check Point Software Technologies (CHKP), likens the threat landscape to a balloon.""You squeeze it at one point and it moves to an equal opposite area,"" Wiley told IBD. Credit-card fraud has plummeted as banks have invested in strong chip-card/EMV technology and mobile wallets from the likes of Apple (AAPL), Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google and Samsung improve security. So, he says, bad actors are switching tactics.""A lot of the financial gains for credit-card fraud have changed,"" he said. ""And the attackers are doing other things like ransomware, or cloning of cars or NFC (near-field communication) card hijacking, or all the million other different ways to steal credit-card numbers.""Industry trackers Gartner and IDC say ransomware attacks are rising. In some instances, those breaches must be reported. Such was the case when Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center had to pay a $17,000 ransom to regain control of the hospital's systems.Many other ransomware attacks, though, go unreported.Enterprises continue to spend for security, says Wiley. The security industry is now within a mile of most hackers -- rather than the six-mile lead the Black Hats used to have, he says. But the small-business sector often still plays ostrich, he told IBD.""If they have an attack, I see them spending,"" he said. Otherwise, ""they're sticking their heads in the sand and continuing to do their business, not wanting to lift their head to see if there's a lion about to pounce on them.""IBM's Barlow estimates that 80% of breaches are the work of highly organized criminal gangs. Some of their motives are apparent, but not all. In any case, criminal gangs, nation-states, teen hackers on a lark and other culprits will continue to try to breach networks, with only a few big cases making headlines.""Tune in to this idea that bad guys go into systems and gather data,"" Barlow said. ""It doesn't always result in large breaches.""RELATED:'Nimble' Proofpoint Takes Share From Cisco, SymantecPalo Alto Networks 'Deceleration' Worries InvestorsIBD 50: CyberArk, Activision, Dave & Buster's Near Buy Points

The stock has been on a tear since breaking out of a cup-with-handle base in March. Nvidia blew past earnings expectations last week and gapped up 30% the following day.IBD'S TAKE: Bank stocks are taking a breather Wednesday, but so far the action has been healthy. Here's a look at notable bank stocks' chart action.Mastec (MTZ) was downgraded from buy to neutral Wednesday morning by D.A. Davidson on valuation concerns, though the research firm remains optimistic about the company's current growth prospects. The stock rose 22% in the last five trading days from a 31.25 buy point. The stock fell 4% on Wednesday.Tencent Holdings (TCEHY), the major Chinese internet company, reported its Q3 earnings this morning. The company's Q3 profit rose to 10.65 billion yuan, a 43% increase from a year earlier. Revenue was up 52% to 40.39 billion yuan. The ADR was trading down 1.5% in midday trading.Two major retailers reported their Q3 earnings earlier today: Target (TGT) and Lowe's Companies (LOW). Results were mixed.On the upside, Target posted better than expected top-line and bottom-line growth, while raising its Q4 same-stores sales guidance. Target reported non-GAAP EPS of $1.04 vs the 83-cent consensus estimate. Revenue came in at $16.4 billion, which was higher than than the $16.3 billion estimate. Investors rewarded the company's results, sending the shares up over 7%.Despite the gap up this morning, the stock remains in its base-building phase. The stock is now trading above its 50-day and 200-day moving averages. With an Relative Strength Rating of 28, Target is not much of a leading stock. On the fundamental side, Target's EPS Ranking is 63 and has four quarters of negative revenue growth. The company has had trouble competing with Amazon.com (AMZN) as American and global consumers shift how they shop.On the downside,  Lowe's missed expectations across the board and the stock fell 3% after being down as much as 5% in early trading. Lowe's reported non-GAAP 88 cents a share, which fell short of the 96-cent estimate. On the revenue side, the company's revenue totaled $15.74 billion vs. a $15.84 billion estimate.Since gapping down on heavy volume in August 2016 on its Q2 earnings release, the stock has been a significant market underperformer.

407,TGT,"Despite competition for consumer dollars from 4K TVs and drones, Apple (AAPL) is expected to be one of the winners this holiday season, Drexel Hamilton analyst Brian White said in a research report Monday.""Apple remains one of the best positioned tech companies to benefit from spending trends this holiday season with a well-received iPhone 7/7 Plus, a new Apple Watch (Series 2, ceramic Apple Watch Edition, Apple Watch Nike+) and a new MacBook Pro with Touch Bar,"" White said. ""If Apple launches its new AirPods for the holidays, we expect this gift to be a very popular stocking stuffer.""Apple's wireless earbuds, called AirPods, were expected to launch in late October, but were delayed for some last-minute improvements. Apple's website lists the $159 product as ""coming soon.""The holiday shopping season officially kicks off this weekend with Thanksgiving evening and Black Friday doorbuster sales.The National Retail Federation is projecting overall holiday sales to grow by 3.6% this season to $655.8 billion and above the 3.2% growth seen in 2015, while also higher than the seven-year average increase of 3.4%.The Consumer Technology Association predicts consumer-electronics sales will rise by 3.1% this holiday season, vs. 1.4% growth in the November-December period last year.This holiday season, the CTA expects strong U.S. sales of drones (1.2 million units, up 112% year over year), virtual reality headsets (700,000 units) and 4K ultra-high-definition televisions (4.5 million units).The top tech products on gift wish lists include notebook computers (11%), TVs (8%), smartphones (8%), tablets (7%) and video-game consoles (5%), according to a consumer survey by CTA. There also is interest in smartwatches (3%), VR headsets (2%), home robotic vacuums (2%) and portable GPS (2%), CTA said.Best Buy (BBY) signaled strong holiday tech sales when it reported better-than-expected fiscal third-quarter results last week. The consumer-electronics retailer was helped in Q3 by the launch of Apple's iPhone 7 and robust sales of 4K TVs and home theater systems.Discount retailer Target (TGT) also pointed to a merry holiday season ahead with its third-quarter report last week.On a conference call with analysts, Target CEO Brian Cornell said the retailer saw ""a meaningful improvement in sales of Apple products, driven by their introduction of several new product innovations"" last quarter.Mark Tritton, Target's chief merchandising officer, sees the Apple momentum continuing this quarter.""In electronics this quarter, we're planning for strong demand for Apple's new products,"" he said on the call. ""We're also expecting a lot of guest interest in virtual reality, along with connected home devices like Google Home.""Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google Home is a smart speaker that answers spoken questions and plays music on command. It competes with Amazon.com's (AMZN) market-leading Echo devices.Consumer Intelligence Research Partners on Monday estimated that Amazon has sold 5.1 million Echo devices in the U.S. since the product debuted in late 2014.

408,TGT,"Black Friday. Cyber Monday. Super Saturday. The annual retail running of the bulls is a treacherous terrain of sharpened elbows and trigger-happy mouse clicks for shoppers trying to get the best deal possible.The stakes are even higher for the stores themselves: The National Retail Federation has said that sales in November and December can account for anywhere from 20%-40% of a retailer's yearly sales. Perhaps fortunately for department stores like Macy's (M), Kohl's (KSS) and others, there's nowhere to go but up this Christmas.""Given the fact that last year was so horrible, the comps are easy,"" said Morningstar analyst Bridget Weishaar.As weather, inventory issues, heavy discounting and e-commerce giants like Amazon (AMZN) weighed, Macy's reported a 4.7% same-store sales decline in November and December of last year. Kohl's Q4 2015 comps edged up a mere 0.4%. Overall, last year's holiday retail sales disappointed with only 3% growth, said the NRF, less than expected.Holiday 2016 should prove to be a little less dire. The NRF predicts a 3.6% retail gain in November and December to $655.8 billion; online sales are seen rising 7%-10% to $117 billion. And retailers are feeling bullish. Target (TGT), Macy's and Nordstrom (JWN) all raised guidance going into the all-important shopping season.Predictably, online sales continue to eat into brick-and-mortar market share. Traditional stores are again gearing up to do battle with Amazon and friends.Wal-Mart (WMT) is pushing up its ""Cyber Week"" deals from Monday to Friday so that they start essentially the minute Thanksgiving Day is over. Target's ""10 Days of Deals,"" which include both in-store and online promotions, already started on Saturday.""If you look at the companies that reported earnings, it's e-commerce that's driving a significant amount of the growth,"" said Weishaar. ""What's unique in it is mobile is becoming a higher penetration of the digital section, so that would be something new. I don't think a lot of the companies have figured out how to convert the sales on mobile.""Shopping via smartphone is the next frontier. Thanksgiving Day and Christmas are projected to be the biggest mobile-shopping days of the year, said Adobe.One consequence of a ramp-up in retail digital wars, however, is that fewer people head into brick-and-mortar shops.Retail Metrics head Ken Perkins says the industry could see a ""significant slowdown"" in Black Friday foot traffic.Traffic fell in the mid-single to high-single-digits on Black Friday 2015, and retailers could see an equal or even greater decline this time around, he said, particularly as other shopping events during the year dilute the impact of the post-Thanksgiving sales day.Besides Cyber Monday and Super Saturday, the menu of existing shopping holidays has grown to include Amazon's Prime Day and even China-based Singles Day, among others.Foursquare's data are a little more optimistic; the company predicts a 3.5% year-over-year slide in Black Friday foot traffic, which would be ""far less severe"" than the prior year's figures.""The importance of Black Friday from a traffic (perspective) to brick-and-mortar stores is going to continue to decelerate,"" said Weishaar. ""With more people shopping online, the one specific day becomes less important.""IBD'S TAKE: Adobe data indicate that Black Friday sales will be the ""biggest ever,"" growing 11.3% from last year to $3.05 billion in sales. For a look at what else is happening this week, check out IBD's Investing Action Plan. Broadly speaking, inventory levels are cleaner in Q4, which translates to more targeted, strategic discounting instead of promotional wars, said Weishaar. But even in the absence of ""everything must go""-type sales, that doesn't mean that consumers shouldn't expect to see a whole lot of deals floating around.Which retail names will be winners this year?Instinet analyst Simeon Siegel pointed out in a recent note that execs at various retailers have alluded to a challenging, promotional holiday season. But there are gems to be found.""Although the election triggered a surprising sense of hope (and short squeezes), we believe much uncertainty remains and would rather buy quality companies that have lagged,"" he wrote, calling out Ulta Beauty (ULTA) as his top pick and noting that the recent Lululemon Athletica (LULU), HBI and Kate Spade (KATE) sell-offs look ""interesting.""Still shining is the off-price sector, as consumers remain hesitant about paying full retail for products and stores have a tough time escaping the ""always-on-sale"" cycle. Athletic wear also continues to dominate street fashion.Nike (NKE), TJX (TJX) and Ross Stores (ROST) remain Siegel's long-term choices.Holiday shoppers, unconcerned about the fate of retail stores, will continue to like what they like.Millennials, who favor experiences over tangible goods, may not be retailers' favorite customers. But PwC research found that the teen set, Generation Z, likes ""stuff — and shopping in stores.""""To them, stuff matters,"" said the report. ""Stuff like personal electronics, clothes, shoes, and toys. Which is what they're hoping to receive this holiday season.""RELATED:Black Friday Is The New Cyber Monday: Wal-Mart Pushes Up Sale

409,TGT,"October's 2.8% annual rise in average hourly wages was the best since 2009, but it's a safe bet that the pace of wage gains will keep rising in coming months, likely by a good amount.That may dent the market's confidence that the Federal Reserve, after hiking rates next month, will stay on hold until the very end of 2017.There are three reasons why a further pickup is pretty much baked in the cake:First, labor markets are getting tighter and the competition for good workers is heating up.Starbucks (SBUX) on Oct. 3 gave a wage hike of at least 5% to every barista and manager at all of its U.S. stores. In July, JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon announced that the company would boost the minimum wage for 18,000 tellers and customer-service workers from $10.15 to $12 over two years.On an Oct. 26 conference call, Panera Bread (PNRA) said average associate wages rose 5% in the third quarter, both to ""effectively compete for talent"" and keep up with higher minimum wages. Panera CFO Michael Bufano went so far as to call the level of wage inflation ""unprecedented"" and noted that the company raised bakery prices 2.4% during the quarter to offset cost increases, according to a Seeking Alpha transcript.Second, average hourly wages have been rising at a 3.1% annual rate over the past six months and even faster over the past three months, 3.3%. In other words, monthly wage growth would have to slow to keep the annual rate of increase from rising significantly.Third, wage growth went through a slump in late 2015 and early 2016, so the weak comparison is likely to make the wage acceleration look even stronger than the underlying trend. In particularly, the three-month pace of wage growth fell to 1.9% in December 2015 and again in February 2016.Then, at the end of February, Wal-Mart (WMT) boosted wages by $1.5 billion, and Target (TGT) and Costco (COST) quickly followed with wage hikes of their own.IBD'S TAKE: The best stocks tend to have margins that are high relative to those of rivals and that are steady or growing, so look for companies that have the pricing power to withstand rising wages. For a primer on profit margins, read this Investor's Corner. IBD makes research easier with a proprietary SMR Rating that combines sales growth, profit margins and return on equity. Visit IBD Stock Checkup to see how your stocks rate.Markets took the news in stride on Friday that average hourly wages accelerated, with the 10-year Treasury yield and U.S. dollar index both losing ground. Yet it's hard to tell what's driving markets at the moment, in particular whether Donald Trump's revived presidential hopes are trumping other market-moving news.On Friday, Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank President Dennis Lockhart said he was ""open to running the economy hot"" to heal the labor market, but that's not yet a consensus view.Lockhart also said that ""turmoil around the election"" could interfere with December rate-hike plans.In September, when the Fed signaled that a December rate hike was coming, the median projection of policymakers was for two hikes in 2017. For now, markets aren't taking the Fed at its word. On Friday, the CME Group FedWatch tool showed markets pricing in a 71.5% chance of a December hike but just a 30.6% chance of a second hike through November 2017.RELATED:U.S. Added 161,000 Jobs, But Best Wage Gain Since 2009 Puts Pressure On Fed This Is The Best News About Wage Growth In A Year (But Markets Won't Love It)

410,TGT,"Burlington Stores (BURL) easily topped second quarter estimates, driving its shares up Thursday to an all-time high.The off-price women's, men's and children's apparel retailer reported a 105% increase in Q2 earnings per share minus one-time items to 39 cents on a 10% hike in revenue to $1.26 billion. Analyst consensus was for 30 cents EPS and $1.24 billion sales.Sames-store sales grew 5.4% and gross profit margin improved 40 basis points to 39.6%. Burlington Stores also took advantage of favorable interest rates to re-price a major loan at a lower rate.""We believe we are well positioned for the fall season,"" CEO Tom Kingsbury said in a written statement.For Q3, Burlington expects adjusted EPS of 30-32 cents, just below forecasts for 33 cents. The company expects sales to climb 7.1%-8.1%, implying $1.318 billion, roughly in line with views for $1.317 billion. It sees sales at comparable stores rising 2.5%-3.5% in Q3.Burlington shares closed 3.1% higher at 80.85 the stock market today, after hitting a record 83.41 intraday. The stock has soared from a May 18 low of 51.19 after EPS growth over the last three quarters rose from 3% to 39% and 105% last quarter.IBD'S TAKE: Burlington Stores stock has risen more than 50% in three months and it's extended above buy range. But several quality stocks are near buy points, including two retailers. To find that list, as well as stocks actually breaking out, take a trial of IBD's Marketsmith.Burlington joined ""Dress for Less"" apparel retailer Ross Stores (ROST), which reported strong earnings on Aug. 18. Ross Stores hit a record high on Aug. 19 but has drifted lower this week, including a 0.7% loss Thursday.But their off-price peer TJX (TJX), which operates T.J. Maxx, Marshalls and other brands, reported a disappointing outlook for both Q3 and the full year with its Q2 results on Aug. 16. Shares fell below their 50-day line and are still trading above or below that key level. TJX edged up 0.3% Thursday.More broadly, deep discount variety stores Dollar Tree (DLTR) and Dollar General (DG) both missed forecasts Thursday. Dollar Tree slid 9.9% and Dollar General plunged 17.6%.Among big-box discount giants, Wal-Mart Stores (WMT) reported solid results as earnings dipped a penny from last year but topped estimates. Wal-Mart shares rose to a 14-month high on Aug. 18 but have since drifted lower, back below their 50-day line. Wal-Mart fell 1.4% on Thursday to the lowest since late June.Meanwhile, Wal-Mart rival Target (TGT) gave weak guidance last week, sending its shares tumbling below their 50-day and 200-day lines.

411,TGT,"Stocks continue to grind sideways, while the latest run of retail earnings, including Home Depot (HD) and Wal-Mart Stores (WMT) didn't offer much clarity on consumers. Cisco Systems (CSCO) offered job cuts and a weak outlook. But Chinese internet stocks continue to deliver robust earnings, while oil made a strong advance.The major averages moved sideways, closing little changed. The Nasdaq rose 0.1%, grinding out its eighth straight weekly gain. The S&P 500 fell less than one point and the Dow lost 0.1%. Several Federal Reserve officials made hawkish hints, insisting a September hike was in play. While markets doubt that, the comments did have an effect. Energy stocks were strong as oil prices rallied. Retailers generally rose, led by Wal-Mart and Ross Stores (ROST), though TJX Cos. (TJX) was among the losers. Cisco Systems cut jobs and its outlook. Tencent (TCEHY) led a slew of  top-rated China internet stocks reporting earnings.Brent crude futures, the international benchmark, rose above $50 a barrel. Meanwhile, U.S. crude prices shot up 9.1% for the week to $48.52 a barrel. Buzz about a new push for an oil production freeze among OPEC and large non-OPEC producers helped lift prices. But Saudi Arabia is raising production to meet domestic demand, and Iran hasn't made a decision on joining the informal freeze talks in September.Meanwhile, U.S. crude stockpiles fell for the first time in four weeks, with gasoline supplies also down. But U.S. production rose.

413,TGT,"Apple (AAPL) iPhones are drubbing Samsung and other Android rivals in the Bring Your Own Device race to provide ""bulletproof security,"" says Tech Research Pro.Yet, good security often, if not usually, is lacking on employee-owned mobile devices used in the workplace, a Tech Research Pro survey found and other sources say.Of 259 respondents in a Tech Research Pro survey in April and May of decision makers in companies worldwide, 76% said their companies let employees use personal smartphones for business but only a third of IT departments support these devices, and employees aren't too security conscious.""Enterprise security breaches reported by respondents also reflected a tendency on the part of employees to take a more relaxed attitude toward security on their mobile devices,"" Tech Research Pro said in its report.The BYOD trend is important for Apple and Samsung, which see the enterprise sector as a growth opportunity amid overall slowing smartphone growth, says ZDNet and TechRepublic editor Larry Dignan. Corporate information technology units are trying to respond.Industry tracker Forrester recently found that more than half of all corporations are developing BOYD programs. Still, 1 in 3 decision makers polled by Tech Research Pro said their IT departments support only company-provided smartphones, tablets, wearables and laptops.Apple is leading Microsoft (MSFT) and Samsung in usage of tablets and wearables; it's leading Microsoft, Lenovo, Dell and  HP Inc. (HPQ) in laptops; and it beats Samsung in smartphones, according to Tech Pro Research. Apple's lead is partly on the opinion that it's more secure, Dignan told IBD.In the Tech Research Pro survey, more than half of respondents (51%) rated the iPhone as ""good or excellent in security."" Only 30% said the same for Samsung, though the company is closing the gap with its Knox mobile security app, says Tech Research Pro.The gap in actual usage is smaller -- 67% were using Apple vs. 62% using Samsung -- meaning some users could be trading lesser security for lower device costs, since Apple devices often cost more than others.BlackBerry (BBRY) also dominated Samsung in terms of security perception -- 39% rated its security as ""good or excellent."" And Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google is also pushing for the enterprise segment, Dignan says.Still, the halo effect of Apple's security pays real dividends.""From the start, Apple has had good security built in,"" Dignan told IBD. ""It doesn't have the fragmentation that Android has. It's hard to protect Android, which has different versions, flavors and eight different operating systems vs. one iOS.""Apple's security reputation stems in part on its tight control of its App Store and requirements for installing apps, says Ryan Kalember, Proofpoint (PFPT) senior vice president of cybersecurity strategy.""The iOS devices, for a very long time, were considered more or less bulletproof from a security perspective, unless they were jailbroken,"" Kalember told IBD. Jailbreaking an Apple device escalates a user's privileges, allowing third-party apps not approved by the App Store to be installed.Many security professionals consider jailbreaking an opening to a Pandora's box. Such was the case when a hacker created Ex Code Ghost, mimicking Apple's Ex Code app which developers use to create legitimate apps. The Ghost version was uploaded near the end of 2015 and allowed apps to be created, but it inserted malicious code after the fact.Apple identified the offending code, but not before it penetrated 1,100 legitimate apps in the official App Store, including the app for Chinese Uber rival Didi Chuxing Technology, a ride-hailing service.""It was cleaned up, but it was a very a clever way to puncture the illusion that, just if you had iOS only and no jailbroken devices, then you were safe from a security perspective,"" Kalember said.Soon after, Proofpoint discovered another vulnerability shadowing Apple's security illusion -- Dark Side Loader, a fraudulent app store that clones legitimate apps by stealing certificates. Dark Side Loader takes advantage of an Apple mechanism that allows companies to create and upload their own apps to a private store for employees.But Dark Side Loader uses it to peddle free versions of paid apps, allowing Apple users to circumvent the official app store. Kalember likens it to Napster for apps, which is troubling because ""Apple never reviews that app ... like Apple does for every app in the enterprise store.""Still, Apple shines in the Tech Research Pro security survey. The lion's share of respondents (82%) rated Apple's iPad security ""good or excellent,"" vs. 77% and 73% for Microsoft and Samsung, respectively. In wearables, 65% rated Apple's security highly to 58% for both Microsoft and Samsung.Also, 42% felt Apple's MacBooks have excellent security, while only a third said the same for Microsoft. Dell, HP and Lenovo trailed at 30%, 29% and 27%, respectively.The BYOD trend kicked off in earnest less than a decade ago, but it's already entrenched. Of respondents to the Tech Research Pro survey, only 2% said there is absolutely no use of personal mobile devices -- smartphones, laptops, tablets and wearables -- in their workplaces.To that end, Forrester Research found that 60% of corporate decision makers plan to invest heavily in mobile application development before year's end. CNBC reported recently that Target (TGT), Walgreens (WAG), Amazon.com (AMZN) and eBay (EBAY) are leading the pack in developing mobile apps for their employees.But employees are the weak link in security, Tech Research Pro found. Only 12% of those surveyed had experienced a breach in the past year, but of those, 57% cited a lost device and 23% lack of data encryption on the employee's device.That extended to sharing the device and/or the data with unauthorized people within and outside the company.Nearly every laptop (96%) was password-protected, along with 89% of tablets, 85% of smartphones and 57% of wearables, researchers found.But less than half of all devices required data encryption or central management. Laptops are most likely to be encrypted (47%), but only 38% of smartphones and 36% of tablets are protected similarly, says Tech Research Pro.Mobile device management (MDM), which can remotely push updates or lock down a misplaced device, was used on 48% of laptops, 47% of tablets and 44% of smartphones. Wearables trailed in every security regard. Less than a third are protected by encryption or mobile device management.Wearables are just entering the workplace, though. Of those surveyed, 94% were using smartphones and laptops, 74% were using tablets and only 14% were using wearables. BYOD wearables were most prevalent in the military, law enforcement, health care, field maintenance and sports sectors, Tech Research Pro found.Usage has a part to play on security perception. Respondents ranked laptop security highest with tablets, smartphones and wearables trailing, respectively. This likely stems from the ability to track down a lost or stolen device, researchers said, which is why desktops are considered the most secure devices.BYOD security is an overwhelmingly mobile target, Proofpoint's Kalember says. IT departments are still inking their policies, which is why only the savvier companies require higher levels of protection like MDM and mobile threat protection, he told IBD.More stringent IT departments might install MDMs that scan for rogue apps, Kalember said. The tech team can lock a user out of corporate email and/or apps until the offending app is uninstalled. But IT departments employing such tactics are early adopters, he says.""The typical thing we see for most BYOD is that the IT department has a primitive understanding of an employee blacklist, and it's to avoid employee time-wasting,"" he said. ""They might install a mobile device management tool to prohibit employees from installing 'Angry Birds' or 'Pokemon Go.' ""

414,TGT,"Art instructor and mother of three Amy Frankson has cut back on her trips to Pavilions supermarket from three times a week to maybe three times a month. For the most part, her groceries — including perishables like eggs and milk — are now dropped off at her doorstep in green totes marked ""AmazonFresh.""Her household used to rack up about $300 in weekly supermarket receipts from Pavilions, a Safeway chain. Now Frankson's family spends about $200 a week on groceries, and buys an estimated 85% from the Amazon's fresh-grocery home-delivery service. There's also the convenience factor.""If I order it in the morning, it could be there by dinner time,"" she said from her home in Newport Beach, Calif.Shoppers like Frankson have Wal-Mart (WMT), Kroger (KR) and others scrambling to get ahead of Amazon (AMZN). The e-commerce giant has swallowed up segment after segment of the retail business and spit out bookstores, electronics retailers and clothing chains along the way. Now Amazon hungers to pile groceries onto its plate.And millennials, who are finally starting to form their own households, could accelerate Amazon's push into refrigerators around the world.In fact, even as Amazon rolls out new shows on its streaming video service and new gadgets with artificial intelligence, some analysts believe everyday groceries could deliver the biggest boost to its revenue.Amazon shares have pulled back a bit after hitting new highs earlier this month but were up 0.1% at 744.86 Friday. The stock is up 10% so far for 2016, compared with the S&P 500's 6% year-to-date gain.Wal-Mart rose 3 cents to 73.55 on Friday, and Kroger edged up 0.1%.IBD'S TAKE: Amazon's earnings report next week could propel the stock even higher. Here is how investors could have approached Amazon's earlier run-up and why the lowest stock price isn't always the best.For now, Amazon controls an estimated 1.1% of the $795 billion food and beverage business through various Prime offerings, including Pantry and its fresh-grocery delivery service, Fresh. Wal-Mart, including Sam's Club, leads with 21%, according to a March analysis from Cowen analysts John Blackledge and Oliver Chen. Kroger's 9% market share puts it at a distant second, and Albertson's/Safeway, Costco (COST) and Publix round out the top five with low- to mid-single-digit shares apiece.But when it comes to online grocery sales, Amazon is already No. 1, bagging a 22% share in 2015 vs. Wal-Mart's 13%.First tested in Seattle almost a decade ago, AmazonFresh has quietly popped up since then in about a dozen cities along the coasts. They include Los Angeles, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Baltimore and New York.A new offensive has brought Fresh back into public focus. The service recently launched in Boston and across the pond in London.An Amazon spokesperson said the company does not comment on its product roadmap.""We're branching out as fast as we can while being careful not to sacrifice the quality and convenience our customers expect from AmazonFresh,"" says Amazon's help page.To shop on AmazonFresh, customers have to sign up for Prime Fresh, a higher-tier Prime membership that costs $299 annually. At $200 more than a regular Prime subscription, the service isn't exactly cheap, but Frankson said it ""definitely pays for itself.""Gen Xers like Frankson and her husband, Brian Mackerer, both 42, are contributing to growing online-grocery penetration. According to a recent Cowen analysis, 16% of surveyed 35- to 44-year-olds used such a service in February. As for millennials, the firm found that 21% of 25- to 34-year-olds had bought groceries online, with 28% pegged as ""likely future buyers.""""Particularly with a younger generation, there's no desire to drive to a store and push a cart down an aisle and load heavy items and stand in line at checkout and then throw stuff in your trunk or in bags on the bus or whatever and take it home, when there are other more convenient options,"" Baird analyst Colin Sebastian told IBD.Fellow tech titan Alphabet, meanwhile, has taken a different route with its Google Express service, positioning itself as a courier between residents and nearby stores like Target (TGT), Ulta Beauty (ULTA) and Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA), rather than a direct competitor.Google Express memberships cost $95 a year or $10 a month; nonmembers are charged $4.99 per delivery. It's available in a sprinkling of cities across the country. Cold grocery delivery is only featured in parts of Los Angeles and San Francisco.Perhaps mercifully for legacy players with established supplier relationships and infrastructure, the complex fulfillment strategy associated with fresh food is slowing down Amazon's grocery takeover.Handling produce and perishables is a whole different animal at an Amazon fulfillment center. There are temperature checks, quality requirements and inspections, according to an MIT report cited in Cowen's analysis. Plus, just like at the supermarket, bags have to be packed with extra care to ensure that berries are not smashed and eggs aren't cracked.Why bother with a low-margin business that has difficult logistics?Because people go grocery shopping about four to five times a month, and the added operating income dollars outweigh the unattractive margins, say Blackledge and Chen. Plus, it lures shoppers into Amazon's Prime ecosystem.""For (Amazon), we think the purchase frequency fits well with the Prime value proposition and the incremental operating-income (dollars) offset the low-margin profile,"" they wrote, adding that Amazon will benefit from scale and logistics expertise, among other things.That should translate to billions more dollars at the top line. The Cowen analysts estimate the U.S. food and drink market is Amazon's ""biggest category for upside impact to revenue and/or"" gross merchandise volume. They see the company's grocery volume shooting up to $23.2 billion five years from now from an estimated $8.7 billion this year.Of the additional spending that goes to online food and beverage sales in the U.S. from 2016 to 2021, Blackledge and Chen think Amazon alone will capture 38% -- and that's a conservative forecast.Longtime food suppliers to grocery stores are expected to hop on board the Amazon train as shopping habits shift, margins be damned.""At this point, a lot of suppliers realize Amazon is absolutely a must — a channel they have to be on, even if it comes at the expense of their margins,"" said Morningstar analyst R.J. Hottovy. ""The amount of velocity and product sales you're going to get through Amazon, you absolutely have to be a partner in some way.""When it comes to online grocery shopping, traditional grocery bigwigs are throwing everything to the wall to see what sticks, including partnerships with last-mile delivery services like Instacart or features such as in-store pickup.""It's very clear that all of those players are looking for a solution,"" said Piper Jaffray analyst Sean Naughton. But which solution works best is still a mystery.Target (TGT) has been testing online grocery delivery in Minneapolis. Kroger shoppers can use ClickList to order online and pick up in a store, or Vitacost.com to order health foods and vitamins for home delivery. Wal-Mart offers curbside delivery pickup in dozens of markets, and has plans to expand.Of the major players, market leader Wal-Mart ""appears to be the farthest along with future-proofing, in our view, with online grocery pickup up in 20 markets now and adding an additional 22 this year,"" according to the Cowen report. It noted that Wal-Mart sees online grocery pickup as a ""key growth strategy"" for its U.S. stores and online business in fiscal 2017 and beyond.At a Deutsche Bank consumer conference in mid-June, Wal-Mart CFO Brett Biggs sounded bullish on the company's online grocery prospects, while noting that its shoppers may in fact prefer in-store pickup over home delivery.""(Customers) like — while they're out — being able to come pick up their groceries,"" he said. ""So it's an area that will evolve a lot. We think we have a good competitive position where we're at, and I think it'll be a big part of our future.""Costco, on the other hand, doesn't care for the ""order online, pick up in store"" model. Instacart and Google Express enable home delivery of certain perishables and other items, but Costco mostly wants customers to pay its warehouses a visit.""We don't want somebody to come by necessarily and pick it up,"" said CFO Richard Galanti during the company's Q2 earnings call in March. ""Maybe that would change if we were having minus-3% comps in our lives. So we want to do everything possible to get them in the store and not just come and pick something up. So I don't see that as being a strategic focus of ours, at least in the near term.""Whole Foods Market (WFM) has taken its relationship with Instacart up a notch. The specialty grocer announced in March that it would roll out in several new markets over the next year, in addition to the 17 metro areas that it already serves.But for Whole Foods, Trader Joe's, Sprouts Farmers Market (SFM) and the like, AmazonFresh isn't the only worry.Meal-kit services like Blue Apron and HelloFresh, which deliver pre-measured ingredients along with a recipe, are a ""fast-growing market"" and an ""incremental headwind"" to the specialty grocery space, according to Naughton. He said 25% of people who say they shop primarily at specialty grocery stores have tried home-delivery meal kits.Indeed, Frankson said Blue Apron is ""eroding"" what is left of her family's need for Pavilions. She has also tried snack subscription box Graze, but said she was ""not crazy about all the snacks and they just piled up.""Amazon has its nose in that, too. Tyson Foods (TSN) will debut a meal-kit delivery service, Tyson Taste Makers, in partnership with AmazonFresh later this year.But for some people — and some foods — the in-store experience will continue to be essential.A Nielsen global study found that 61% of poll respondents think going to a supermarket is ""enjoyable and engaging,"" and 57% believe the act of grocery shopping is ""a fun day out for the family.""Plus, people get picky about their produce.""There's still an element of consumers wanting to touch and feel what they're buying,"" said Hottovy. ""I think that's still the biggest hurdle for them in becoming a major disruptive player.""Frankson, however, is ""very happy"" with AmazonFresh's produce.""They don't give me dodgy-looking avocados,"" she said.

415,TGT,"The second Prime Day was the biggest day ever for Amazon.com (AMZN), with orders surpassing last year's tally by more than 60% worldwide and 50% in the U.S., the e-commerce leader said Wednesday.Amazon did not release sales figures for Prime Day, but last year's 24-hour sales event notched sales of $375 million to $400 million, analyst estimated. Analyst had forecast this year's revenue from Prime Day to be about double last year's.Prime Day was ""another record-breaking success for the sellers and small businesses worldwide,"" Amazon said in its press release. It said small businesses and sellers on Amazon offering deals to Prime members saw orders nearly triple from last year's Prime Day, both worldwide and in the U.S.Amazon launched Prime Day last year, saying it was a celebration of its 20th anniversary. It was also an opportunity to sign up more Prime members, who pay $99 a year and get free two-day shipping on most goods in addition to access to streaming video, music and other perks.Like last year, many analysts said Prime Day lacked a lot of compelling deals. Deals were plentiful, but consumers complained that most of the bargains were on leftover inventory rather than must-have shopping items, wrote Benchmark analyst Daniel Kurnos in a research note.""Despite the catchy name, we believe the company's efforts center primarily around reducing excess inventory, while also highlighting the meaningful value proposition for Prime subscribers,"" he wrote.The day started with a glitch that prevented some buyers of being able to get to the checkout line, a problem that was fixed a few hours later. But the day was just as much about signing up new members for the Amazon Prime loyalty service as it was about sales.Kurnos estimates Amazon signed 6 million new Prime members this year, up from 4 million last year. He estimates Amazon ended Q2 with 85 million Prime members globally and says Amazon could end the year with 110 million Prime members, 75 million in the U.S. and 35 million international. That's significant in that Prime members reportedly spend substantially more with Amazon than do non-Prime members.Kurnos increased its price target on Amazon stock to 915 from 750, with a buy rating.Amazon stock fell 0.8% to 742.63 in the stock market today, still near this week's record highs. It has been an IBD Leaderboard stock for awhile and carries a strong IBD Composite Rating of 97, putting it among the top 3% of stocks in key metrics such as revenue growth.Several retailers jumped aboard the success of Prime Day, taking advantage of the media buzz leading up to the event. Wal-Mart (WMT), Target (TGT) and Gap (GPS) this week were promoting big discounts and free shipping.On Monday, Wal-Mart began offering free shipping with no minimum purchase for five days to counter the rival Amazon event. Late last month, Wal-Mart began offering a free 30-day trial of its ShippingPass, which gives customers unlimited two-day shipping on product orders for $49 a year.Gap, which is the parent company of Banana Republic and Old Navy, tried to avoid the appearance of piggybacking on Amazon, as did Target.Wal-Mart stock rose 0.5% on Wednesday. Gap dipped 0.4% and Target 0.5%.Pacific Crest Securities analyst Edward Yruma, in a research note, said Amazon's successful Prime Day event continues to reinforce Amazon as a shopping destination for consumers and a key partner for vendors. Yruma has an overweight rating on Amazon stock, and price target of 820.

417,TGT,"Business productivity rose at a 3.4% annual rate in the third quarter, tied for the second fastest growth in output per hour worked since the start of 2010, the Labor Department reported on Thursday.Business output rose at an annual rate of  3.5% in the quarter, while hours worked were up just 0.1%. That followed three straight quarters of declining productivity.While the productivity rise was boosted by inventory-building in the quarter, there's good reason to expect better productivity growth to continue after stagnating in recent years. That conclusion comes from a close look at how Wal-Mart (WMT), a prime force behind the last productivity boom, is re-engineering its business processes to meet competitive threats from Amazon.com (AMZN), Dollar Tree (DLTR) and others, while facing the simultaneous challenge of substantially raising its own pay scale.The key is that Wal-Mart's efficiency gains tend to be contagious when it shares those gains with consumers via lower prices, as it's begun to do again recently. Kroger (KR), Target (TGT) and the dollar stores are feeling heat from Wal-Mart price cuts. Even fast-casual restaurants and quick-service chains like McDonald's (MCD) appear to be feeling pressure due to Wal-Mart's grocery price cuts along with its upward pressure on wages, with the cost of eating out rising at a record pace vs. eating in. When Wal-Mart makes up its mind to cut prices and do what it must to accomplish that, suppliers and competitors have little choice but to change the way they do business too.The upshot is that productivity could surprise on the upside, even as economists — including Federal Reserve policymakers — are becoming increasingly sure about a future with low-productivity growth, low economic growth and unusually low interest rates. The latest Fed economic projections in September marked the long-term economic growth rate down to just 1.8% from 2.0% in June.IBD'S TAKE: IBD recently examined a host of ways Wal-Mart is working to streamline its business, from using drones to manage inventories to its new ""Scan & Go"" app. For a closer look, read How Wal-Mart May Revive U.S. Productivity — And Its Own Fortunes.Leaner stockpiles were a big reason productivity growth had been negative in recent quarters, but that was actually a positive sign for productivity growth going forward, because it's partly the result of better inventory management. Wal-Mart's own inventories declined 2.9% from a year earlier in the second quarter, including a 6.5% drop in comparable-store inventories, management reported on its August earnings call. Meanwhile, in-stock levels continued to rise, meaning fewer frustrated customers.RELATED:Forget The Amazon Effect; The Wal-Mart Effect Hits Dollar StoresFast Food Pickle: Eating In Is Now Even CheaperWhole Foods Soars On Kroger Takeover Rumor, Wal-Mart Plans

The stock hit a record 30.50 intraday.Late Thursday, e.l.f. -- which makes low-cost makeup and brushes sold at Target (TGT), Wal-Mart (WMT) and CVS Health (CVS) — reported third-quarter earnings and revenue well above Wall Street estimates.

421,TGT,"Similar to those shopping in malls during the holiday season, customers of Amazon.com (AMZN) complained about waiting in the checkout line for Amazon Prime Day.Amazon later said it fixed the problem, but ChannelAdvisor (ECOM), a company that helps merchants sell items on Amazon.com and other sites, found that its third-party sellers' sales this Prime Day were only about the same as the previous Prime Day, Bloomberg reported.Amazon Prime Day was the busiest shopping day of the year for the e-commerce giant in 2015, the first year for the special promotion. On Tuesday, as was the case last year, Amazon was loaded with discounts on all manner of products for its second Prime Day, attracting so many shoppers that even Amazon's vaunted infrastructure apparently wasn't up to the task.Wrote one Amazon customers on Twitter: ""Fail. Add to cart failed. Retrying … on everything."" Others chimed in with similar complaints, to which Amazon replied: ""Some customers are reporting difficulty with checkout. We're working to resolve this issue quickly.""The one-day sales event, which ends at midnight Pacific Time, is exclusively for members of the company's Amazon Prime loyalty program. Amazon reported that ""several hundred thousand"" consumers signed up for Amazon Prime last year on Prime Day, a scenario likely to be repeated.Amazon said its first Prime Day last year was a celebration of its 20th anniversary. It sold its most units ever, more than even its biggest Black Friday shopping event, Amazon said. Customers ordered 34.4 million items, an average of 398 items per second.""Members will find twice as many Prime Day deals this year, with more than 30% of Lightning Deals worldwide from small businesses and sellers,"" Amazon said in a press release. Amazon said it will feature more than 100,000 deals worldwide.Several retailers have jumped aboard the success of Prime Day, taking advantage of the media buzz leading up to the event. Wal-Mart (WMT), Target (TGT) and Gap (GPS) this week were promoting big discounts and free shipping.On Monday, Wal-Mart began offering free shipping with no minimum purchase for five days to counter the rival Amazon event. Late last month, Wal-Mart began offering a free 30-day trial of its ShippingPass, which gives customers unlimited two-day shipping on product orders for $49 a year. Amazon charges $99 a year for its Prime membership. Gap, which is the parent company of Banana Republic and Old Navy, tried to avoid the appearance of piggy backing on Amazon, as did Target.Mizuho Securities analyst Neil Doshi said in a research note that Amazon last year sold 18% more items on Prime Day than it did on Black Friday in 2014.""Similar to last year, we expect a major boost to Prime subscriptions for Prime Day, although maybe not at the record-setting levels we saw last year, due to a larger base of Prime members now vs. a year ago,"" he wrote.He said one of the major 'knocks' against last year's Prime Day was that some people felt the discounts weren't deep enough.""Given what we've seen so far during the few days of pre-Prime Day 2016 sales, Amazon has been offering many products at solid discounts. If these discounts are indicative of what's to come, we think consumers will be pleased with Prime Day sales,"" he wrote.Amazon stock briefly hit a record high for a fifth straight session, edging up to 757.34. But shares closed at 748.21, down a fraction in the stock market today. Amazon is on IBD Leaderboard, a premium service tracking top-rated stocks.Wal-Mart stock fell 1.1% Tuesday, to 73.26, after hitting a 13-month high on Monday.

422,TGT,"Hoping to cash in on the media buzz around Amazon (AMZN) Prime Day, big retailers such as Wal-Mart (WMT), Target (TGT) and Gap (GPS) are promoting big discounts and free shipping.Amazon.com has scheduled its second annual Prime Day, a one-day sales event, for Tuesday. It is exclusively for members of the company's Amazon Prime loyalty program. Offering numerous sale prices, last year's Prime Day, on July 15, was the biggest single day in Amazon's history, the company said.On Monday, Wal-Mart began offering free shipping with no minimum purchase for five days to counter the rival event. Late last month, Wal-Mart began offering a free 30-day trial of its ShippingPass, which gives customers unlimited two-day shipping on product orders for $49 a year. Amazon charges $99 a year for its Prime membership.Gap was offering discounts of 60% on apparel products. Gap is the parent company of clothing retailers Banana Republic and Old Navy, which were offering similar discounts.Toys ""R"" Us and Babies ""R"" Us shoppers who buy online will get 15% off all regular items on Tuesday only, along with free shipping on purchases of $19 or more.Target also is offering various discounts, but the company told USA Today those deals had more to do with the back-to-school season. Target was offering 30% discounts on clothing and 25% off home items.Amazon said its first Prime Day last year was a celebration of its 20th anniversary. It sold more units than its biggest Black Friday shopping event, Amazon said, as customers ordered 34.4 million items, an average of 398 items ordered per second. The company said it signed up hundreds of thousands of new Prime members that day as well.Amazon doesn't provide detailed numbers on Prime, but the company says it has ""tens of millions"" of subscribers. Analysts estimate about 50 million. Prime members are more active on Amazon than non-members.""The second-annual Prime Day will feature more than 100,000 deals worldwide exclusively for Prime members, making it the biggest Amazon event ever,"" Greg Greeley, Amazon Prime vice president, said in a statement announcing the plan.Amazon launched Amazon Prime 10 years ago, initially offering just free shipping. Perks have expanded to include free streaming videos on Amazon Instant Video, free streaming music on Amazon Music, unlimited photo storage with Prime Photos and one free prereleased book a month with Kindle First.Amazon stock rose 1.1%, to 753.78, in the stock market today, touching a record high for the fourth straight trading session.

423,TGT,"It's Christmas in July as Amazon (AMZN) unleashes twice as many Prime Day deals today in hopes of topping last year's highly successful mega-shopping event.Customers must be Amazon Prime members to participate, but they can also start a free trial of the $99-a-year membership to get in on the deals. Amazon said in 2015 it signed up hundreds of thousands of new Prime members on Prime Day, which was its biggest shopping day ever.Existing Prime Members also showed up in full force last year. Slice Intelligence found that members who placed an average of three or more orders per month in the six months prior to Prime Day accounted for 68% of sales that day.Expectations are even greater for this year's Prime Day. But even with customer complaints about the quality of deals and check-out wait times, an analyst with MKM said last week that he expects Amazon to double its Prime Day sales this year -- boosting Q3 e-commerce revenue growth by 3.5%.Amazon shares hit another new all-time high in the stock market today in heavy volume before reversing lower, losing 0.7% at the close amid reports of so-so Prime Day sales. Shares have risen about 24% since breaking out of a cup-with-handle base in April, and they found support at the 50-day line as stocks sold off.Meanwhile, Wal-Mart (WMT) and Target (TGT) have been beefing up their e-commerce operations and are again hosting deals of their own on Prime Day. Slice Intelligence says that while Wal-Mart did boost its sales for the day last year, they only accounted for 3% of Amazon's Prime Day sales volume.Wal-Mart stock fell 1.1% in slightly above-average volume Tuesday, but the stock has risen about 22% so far this year. Shares hit a 13-month high on Monday.Target is trading 13% below its 52-week high, but it's up 1.4% intraday. The stock recently reclaimed its 50-day line, but it is still trading below the 200-day line.Elsewhere in the tech space, Google owner Alphabet (GOOGL) is attempting to retake its 200-day line as it works on a double-bottom base with a 753.58 buy point. Alphabet rose 0.7%.Facebook (FB) is trading in buy range from a 117.09 buy point and is 2% below its May high. Facebook rose 6 cents to 117.93.

This year, the e-commerce giant said 100,000 deals will be available exclusively for Prime members, who pay a fee of $99 a year for free two-day shipping on most products and access to Amazon Prime streaming video service.Wal-Mart shares rose 0.3% to 74.06 in the stock market today.

JD.com jumped 5%, and Alibaba was up 3.1%.IBD'S TAKE: While Amazon's shares have been in profit-taking sell territory, check out Swing Trader for other entry points and future profit opportunities on the stock.Target (TGT) and Sears (SHLD) are among the other stores offering special deals on or around July 12.It's unclear though whether Wal-Mart will be able to capitalize on rival Amazon's Prime Day, but the retail chain has been upping the ante online.On June 29, Wal-Mart began offering a free 30-day trial of its ShippingPass, which gives customers unlimited two-day shipping on product orders for $49 a year. The company also added an extra free month to customers who already signed up for ShippingPass. Like Amazon Prime, there's no minimum order for ShippingPass.Meanwhile in China, JD.com has seen some gains as it piggy backs on Singles Day, which Alibaba turned into a major event several years ago.Last year, Alibaba's Singles Day sales soared 60% vs. the prior year to about $14.3 billion. While JD.com doesn't release dollar sales for Singles Day, the company said its sales jumped 130% vs. the prior year.

Analysts say cosmetics is a $14 billion retail market in the U.S. One researcher, Euromonitor, pegs the overall U.S. beauty market by retail sales — including color cosmetics, skin care and fragrance — at more than $37 billion.So if beauty is such a hot industry, does that necessarily make newbie ""fast-fashion"" cosmetics brand e.l.f. Beauty (ELF) a buy?Shares of e.l.f. have risen more than 61% from the company's Sept. 22 initial public offering, which was priced at 17. They reached 27.48 by Monday's close, up 2% for the day.

430,TGT,"In a darkened master bedroom, David Kaiserman stood in shirtsleeves next to a turned-down king bed. ""Good morning, Siri,"" he said to the iPad in his hand, and the lights went on while the blackout shades retracted.""Your home is ready to rise and shine,"" the virtual assistant replied.Inside this four-bedroom stucco house in Alameda, Calif., Kaiserman, president of the technology division at construction company Lennar (LEN), was pitching a vision of a home controlled via iPhone or iPad.Tap your phone, and AC/DC's ""Back in Black"" blasts. Tap again, and the bath runs at a blissful 101 degrees. Sweet, right? Of course, your dad might view it as a bit over the top. All told, $30,000 worth of gadgets and gizmos were on display here, many run with Apple's free HomeKit app.As iPhone sales growth  slows, Apple (AAPL) is teaming up with a handful of builders and using these kinds of test beds to inch its way into the market for Internet-connected home furnishings, a nascent field that has attracted rivals like Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google and Amazon.com (AMZN).The gamble is that pricey wireless home devices will be an easier sell when bundled into the home itself. Builders market granite countertops and brushed-nickel fixtures at thousands of model homes across the U.S. Why not video doorbells?Unlike Google and Amazon, however, Apple isn't hawking hardware meant to connect the home. Instead, the HomeKit app could increase the value of its iOS ecosystem — and make it tougher for users to switch to Android phones and tablets.""We want to bring home automation to the mainstream,"" said Greg Joswiak, Apple's vice president of product marketing. ""The best place to start is at the beginning, when a house is just being created.""The convenience on display in the Alameda stucco doesn't come cheap. A single motorized, battery-operated Lutron shade starts at $349. Or consider the Schlage ""touch-screen deadbolt,"" which can be controlled remotely, so you can text an unexpected visitor a code. It can retail for $200. A regular deadbolt fetches $32 at Home Depot (HD) -- and there's always hiding a key under the flower pot.In Fremont, Calif., about 15 minutes from Facebook's (FB) headquarters, Los Angeles-based KB Home (KBH) is also getting its own Apple house ready. Along with the automated thermostat, lights, security system, locks, fans and shades, it lets you, on voice command, change the color of the light underneath a vanity.With the words ""good night,"" the light turns purple. With a ""good morning,"" it switches to white.KB offers wireless devices as upgrades. A basic package runs about $2,000, ""which once rolled into a mortgage is pennies a month,"" according to spokesman Craig LeMessurier. Lennar builds the cost into the price of homes. The Alameda house sells for $1.2 million, though it was a beta model and an actual dwelling wouldn't include $30,000 worth of gadgets.Apple is also working with Brookfield Residential Properties (BRP) and other builders. The companies declined to say when the homes would go on sale.Consumers will buy about $24 billion worth of connected home devices in 2016, according to Strategy Analytics. Though that's a drop in the bucket compared with smartphones, the research and consulting firm expects those sales to nearly double by 2020.For most people, connected homes remain a ways off, said Jonathan Gaw, an analyst with research firm IDC. The proliferating devices remain difficult to install in older homes and, in some cases, seem useless. Gaw cites the wireless candle he saw the other day.""Give me a break,"" he said. ""That only hurts the message. It tells people that we have gone too far. There's too much crap out there, it's only diluting stuff that's really cool.""Even some who sell such gadgets say the hype may be getting ahead of the reality. The discount retailer Target (TGT) opened its own Target Open House showroom a year ago in San Francisco. Shoppers walk through a futuristic home, watching prerecorded displays projected onto its transparent acrylic walls and furniture.In the nursery, a baby wears a Wi-Fi onesie — made by a company called Mimo, founded by whizzes from MIT. It tracks the infant's breathing, skin temperature, sleep and body position. When she stirs, it triggers the home's lights, turns on soothing music on the Sonos wireless speakers and even tells the coffee maker downstairs to start brewing java for red-eyed parents.You can pick one up for $199. Many parents brew the coffee themselves and let their babies wail — or buy a traditional baby monitor for as little as $19.99. Connected home devices can cost five times the price of the old-fashioned version, according to Target spokeswoman Jenna Reck.""The smart home will get there but it's not there yet,"" Reck said. ""Adoption is happening even slower than people predicted.""As with all things tech, there is the matter of glitches, frustration and complexity. Markus Giesler, 40, equipped his 1924 house with an Apple home system so he could be a subject for his own academic research at the Schulich School of Business at York University in Canada.When the associate professor of marketing pulls up to the house in his BMW, the GPS on his phone alerts the garage door to open and turns on lights in various colors and brightness throughout his home, depending on his preferences and the time of day. At least, in theory, they do.""Certain devices obey, and some do not,"" Giesler said.Homebuilders started offering smart devices such as automatic locks and thermostats more than five years ago. In its current model homes, Miami-based Lennar works with a company called Nexia, a unit of Ingersoll-Rand (IR).Lennar's Kaiserman hopes working with Apple will have a ""halo effect,"" helping convince customers that a new home in a subdivision can be a ""cool"" alternative to an existing one.No doubt, Apple would be heartened by the experience of Ken Bieber. Last year, Bieber, a 39-year-old executive at a consulting firm, bought a $357,000 Lennar smart home after visiting a model north of Tampa, Fla.With his Nexia system, his lights automatically start dimming in the evening, signaling that it's time to get ready for bed. When his wife, April, went into labor two months ago, he stayed with her in the hospital and texted a temporary entry code to a friend who walked the dog.Since buying his house, Bieber has spent another $1,000 for wireless motion detectors, a video camera and controls for his light dimmers, ceiling fans and irrigation system.Neighbors ask him for advice on their own smart-home device purchases, and he plans to add motorized blinds.""I'll be watching a movie and suddenly I have to get up and pull blinds — apparently it's just too much for me at that point,"" Bieber said. ""I'm so used to saying things and they just happen.""Related:No Need To Ask Jeeves When You Can Ask Apple, Amazon, Facebook, GoogleHomebuilder Confidence Cools As Housing Market Takes A BreakApple iPhone 7 Makes Big Q3 Impact In Just 2 Weeks Of Sales

431,TGT,"Last week's disappointing earnings report from discount retailer Target (TGT) has cast a shadow over this week's reports from electronics retailers Best Buy (BBY) and GameStop (GME).Last Wednesday, Target slashed its earnings expectations for the rest of the year, citing a ""challenging environment.""Target said it has experienced meaningful pressure in electronics, marked by a double-digit comp sales decline. About a third of that pressure is due to declining sales of Apple (AAPL) products.IBD'S TAKE: Best Buy and GameStop are 2 of 6 stocks in IBD's Retail-Consumer Electronics group, which ranks No. 180 out of 197 groups. GameStop is the top-ranked stock in the group, but it has a low IBD Composite Rating of 29. For more information, check out the IBD Stock Checkup.Best Buy is scheduled to report its fiscal-second-quarter results before the stock market opens Tuesday. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect Best Buy to earn 43 cents a share, down 12% year over year, on sales of $8.4 billion, down 2%, in fiscal Q2.For its fiscal Q3, Wall Street is modeling for Best Buy to earn 45 cents a share, up 10%, on sales of $8.77 billion, down less than 1%.Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter said Best Buy faces declining sales due to a lack of compelling new products.""Declining sales present a more formidable headwind, and continuing cost cuts remain elusive,"" he said in a research report last week.UBS analyst Michael Lasser concurred that consumer electronics sales remain weak, though sales of 4K TVs appear to be heating up.Video game and electronics retailer GameStop is set to release its fiscal Q2 results after the market close on Thursday.Analysts are looking for GameStop to earn 27 cents a share, down 13%, on sales of $1.72 billion, down 2%.For the current quarter, Wall Street forecasts GameStop to earn 53 cents a share, down 2%, on sales of $2.07 billion, up 3%.GameStop has been diversifying from video game shops to stores dedicated to selling mobile devices, Apple products and pop-culture collectibles.In a research report Sunday, Pacific Crest Securities analyst Evan Wilson said NPD retail data point to a weak quarter for physical game software sales. The massive popularity of the free-to-play smartphone game ""Pokemon Go"" from Niantic likely hurt physical software sales in July, he said. Use and engagement of ""Pokemon Go"" is slowing, however, Bloomberg reported Monday.Wall Street's focus Thursday will be on GameStop's second-half 2016 guidance, including the holiday shopping season, investment bank Credit Suisse said in a report Monday.Sales of virtual reality gaming gear could provide upside to Q4 results, Credit Suisse said.Best Buy stock rose a fraction Monday to 32.80 and is up 8% this year, while GameStock stock fell a fraction in the stock market today, though it's up 11% so far in 2016.RELATED:Most-Anticipated Video Game Is Out Of This WorldGameStop Gobbles 507 AT&T Mobility Stores In Diversification MoveBest Buy Latest Retailer To Disappoint, Gives Soft Profit Outlook.

432,TGT,"Wal-Mart (WMT) is rolling out self-scan-and-pay technology at all Sam's Club warehouses this fall, letting members ""skip the checkout line,"" CEO Doug McMillon said in last week's earnings call.Customers can use the ""Scan & Go"" app to ring up items as they put them in their shopping cart and see a running receipt total on their phones. The app also handles payment, so customers just show their receipts to greeters on the way out.The world's largest retailer by revenue also is testing similar technologies at a number of Wal-Mart supercenters after pulling the plug on an unsuccessful 200-store pilot test in 2014.At a challenging time for brick-and-mortar retailers, investors cheered Wal-Mart's Q2 same-store sales gains of 1.6% at U.S. stores and 0.4% at Sam's Clubs, excluding fuel.Yet operating income at U.S. stores fell as Wal-Mart continued to see profits squeezed by its second big wage hike in two years and outlays for a build-out of its online capabilities as it aims to fend off the threat from Amazon (AMZN), as well as rivals like Target (TGT) and Costco Wholesale (COST).""Unfortunately, the price of this stability has been a multiyear erosion in margins and profitability,"" wrote analyst John Zolidis of Buckingham Research Group.IBD'S TAKE: Wal-Mart is ranked No. 2 in its Retail-Major Discount Chains group.

Yet, there are risks, including the political push for a much higher minimum wage that's scored its biggest wins in California, New York, Oregon, Washington D.C. and Chicago.There's also an outside possibility that Democrats win the White House and a majority in Congress and thus have the votes to raise the federal minimum wage to $12 or beyond, while mandating other compensation hikes, such as paid sick leave and family leave.Wal-Mart's emphasis right now is growing the top line, leveraging its stores and distribution network to compete with the likes of Amazon for web business with an in-store pickup option, along with grocery delivery.Yet at some point, and in some high-minimum-wage areas, letting customers skip the cashier might not just be an effort to keep shoppers happy, but could also be a strategy to help contain compensation costs.Wal-Mart hasn't softened its determination to compete by cutting prices as low as possible, doing everything it can to strip away unnecessary costs, as it showed at the beginning of 2016 by shutting down 269 stores, including 154 in the U.S.Of particular note, Wal-Mart closed stores or called off planned openings in parts of the U.S. where the high-minimum-wage movement had scored large wage increases: Oakland, Calif., Los Angeles and Washington, D.C.One reviewer called Sam's Club's Scan & Go app, which is downloadable onto any smartphone, ""the perfect app for shoppers who hate cashiers.""Given Wal-Mart's priorities and its diverse customer demographics, cashiers aren't going to be replaced by mobile scan and payment technology anytime soon. But Wal-Mart is working on a range of such technologies, such as a grocery cart that scans every item in a collaboration with Digimarc (DMRC).Wal-Mart closed 0.15% lower at 72.70 on the stock market today, moving below its 50-day moving average after hitting a 14-month high Thursday.

433,TGT,"Once upon a time, free trade was the one thing almost everyone could agree on, an enlightened policy that brought economic growth, better jobs, growing incomes and higher standards of living.Not anymore. Today, it's a pariah, with even some of its one-time champions raising doubts about its ability to deliver on the promise of a better life for all.With the U.S. economy growing at just 2% a year -- the worst expansion since the Great Depression -- fear of job losses and almost two decades of stagnant incomes fuel opposition to free trade. And that's understandable. The costs of free trade -- closed factories in some industries, unemployed workers, troubled communities -- are easy to see. Less obvious are the benefits in lower prices, higher quality goods, more choices and a better standard of living.The anti-trade anger and bitter debate over its benefits are not confined to the U.S. Some tie the U.K.'s recent Brexit vote to dissatisfaction among developed nations with globalism and free trade. Even the June 29 ""Three Amigos Summit"" of the U.S., Mexico and Canada largely dealt with solving problems still felt from the controversial 1992 North American Free-Trade Agreement.In the U.S., trade could well be the defining issue of the 2016 election -- and perhaps for years to come. Both parties are fielding presidential candidates who believe not in free trade, but managed trade -- ""fair trade,"" as some call it. They blame our current ills on bad past trade deals and ongoing cheating by major trade partners.""Regardless of who wins the presidential election in November, the 2016 campaign has already dramatically undermined a major pillar of post-World War II American economic and foreign policy — free trade,"" said Clyde Prestowitz, who worked on trade issues in both the Reagan and Clinton administrations, in a widely quoted Washington Monthly piece recently.As far back as the 19th century, economist and trade theorist David Ricardo warned that, while free trade makes countries better off overall by exploiting their comparative advantages, some people will inevitably suffer. His ideas were prophetic.Free-trade opponents say it's time to rebalance our chronic trade deficits by ""getting tough"" with our trading partners, weakening the dollar to boost our own exports and even imposing tariffs and nontariff barriers on some imports.Both Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders made free-trade bashing a linchpin of their respective presidential candidacies, blaming trade deals like NAFTA and the World Trade Organization for factory job losses, stagnant worker wages and income inequality.And both came out against the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) with Asia and the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) with Europe, the centerpiece of Obama's trade agenda -- even though Clinton, as secretary of state, ardently supported both.""I don't believe (TPP is) going to meet the high bar I have set for creating jobs and advancing national security,"" Clinton said last year, reversing her support for the 12-nation TPP trade deal, which she once had called the ""gold standard"" of trade deals. ""I am also worried about currency manipulation not being part of the agreement, and that pharmaceutical companies may have gotten more benefits from the deal than their patients.""Bernie Sanders, on the other hand, has never wavered: ""Let's be clear,"" he recently said, ""one of the major reasons that the middle class in America is disappearing, poverty is increasing and the gap between the rich and everyone else is growing wider and wider is due to our disastrous unfettered free-trade policy.""But it would be unfair to say only the left is protectionist. Like Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump has come out against the Asian and European trade deals, and has repeatedly promised to pursue ""fair trade"" rather than free trade.Just two weeks ago, Trump warned in a speech of a ""wave of globalism that wipes out our middle class and our jobs along with it."" In another speech just last week called ""Declaring American Economic Independence,"" he again inveighed against free trade, especially TPP, which he termed ""another disaster done and pushed by special interests who want to rape our country, just a continuing rape of our country.""The free-trade smack-talk doesn't stop at the boundaries of the two major parties.""Even among libertarian-leaning conservatives and free-market liberals (there are a few left), trade pacts such as NAFTA and the WTO are in bad odor,"" wrote the National Review's Kevin Williamson recently.In short, the very idea of free trade is struggling. Funny, since it's one of the few things that economists of all stripes agree on.Gregory Mankiw, Harvard economist and former head of the president's Council of Economic Advisers, conducted a poll of economists for his book, ""Principles of Economics."" He found that 93% agreed that ""tariffs and quotas reduce economic welfare.""Likewise, a 2012 poll from the University of Chicago business school's Initiative on Global Markets found a whopping 96% either agreed or agreed strongly that ""Freer trade improves productive efficiency and offers consumers better choices, and in the long run these gains are much larger than any effects on employment.""That's about as sweeping an endorsement for free trade that exists.So, case closed? Hardly.Because while the argument may be sound that the nation as a whole benefits from free trade, it's quite clear that particular industries and regions can be hit hard by sudden unfavorable shifts in trade -- leaving thousands of workers stranded and making billions of dollars worth of plants, machines, equipment and worker training and know-how obsolete. That can destroy whole communities, as businesses crumble, home values plummet and jobs disappear.For these reasons, most countries, including the U.S., manage their trade -- through tariffs, quotas, subsidies, local content rules, labor standards and regulations. It's just too difficult to tell voters that they'll just have to suffer dislocation and job losses that sometimes come from free trade because, in the long run, everyone will be better off.And while tariffs and other trade barriers have been lowered, protectionism still exists in almost all areas of trade and the economy. Most Americans don't even know it exists.As Cato Institute trade economist Daniel J. Ikenson notes: ""There are 'Buy American' rules limiting government procurement spending to local firms and U.S.-made products, heavily protected service industries, seemingly endless incarnations of agriculture subsidies, shipbuilding and shipping restrictions, the Export-Import Bank, anti-dumping duties and regulatory protectionism masquerading as public health and safety regulations."" That's just a few.A now-famous 2013 study by economists David Autor, David Dorn and Gordon Hanson studied U.S. trade with China. Looking at the years from 1990 to 2007, they found that competition from China's fast-growing economy -- they termed it ""China shock"" -- had destroyed jobs and reduced wages in a number of U.S. industries, in particular manufacturing. And many of the people who lost those jobs weren't re-employed in higher-skilled positions, but rather became enmeshed in the elaborate U.S. unemployment and welfare systems.That study, while accurate, has been used to justify trade protection, in particular against the Chinese. That's unfortunate, because while protectionist policies might sound good, they always fail to deliver the goods, say economists.""The historical record of American protectionism is one of chronically declining domestic industries, higher consumer prices and destroyed jobs,"" wrote economists Lee Ohanian of UCLA and Jesus Fernandez-Villaverde in IBD last April. ""Protecting the U.S. auto and steel industries, which began in the 1970s, did not allow them to succeed.""More recently, economists at Moody's estimated that tariffs proposed by Donald Trump could cost 3.5 million jobs and throw the U.S. into recession. Protectionism, by shrinking markets and killing competition, is an economic dead end.And yet, as proponents claim, the benefits of freer trade over the long run are overwhelmingly positive. To increase trade is to increase our well-being by making it easier to buy and sell goods around the world -- as the data clearly show.The late economic historian and statistician Angus Maddison noted that increased trade helped fuel both the Industrial Revolution and the subsequent unparalleled expansion in wealth and incomes that took place across the world. Since the mid-1800s, Maddison said, the world's population grew roughly six times, while world GDP grew 60 times and world trade by 140 times. Trade is largely responsible for the rise of the West.In recent years, trade has replaced aid as a development tool in what used to be called the Third World. And it has been a remarkable success. In the last three decades, global trade has grown at about 7% a year -- roughly twice the rate of GDP. From 1980 to 2011, according to IMF data, developing world nations raised their share of world exports from 34% to 47%, and their share of imports from 29% to 42%.The upshot? Over the last 25 years more than 1 billion people around the world -- but especially in China and India -- have been pulled out of poverty, largely due to freer trade and globalization.Meanwhile, here in America, the idea common among many that ""we don't make anything anymore"" proves to be utterly false. True, in 1953, manufacturing accounted for 28% of the U.S. economy, its highest share ever. By last year, that was down to 12%.But the reason had nothing to do with ""losing jobs"" to other countries or ""deindustrialization."" It was mostly due to booming service and leisure industries. Last year, manufacturing added some $2.1 trillion to GDP -- more than six times what it added in 1953, and that's after adjusting for inflation. We are the world's No. 2 exporter of goods.Remember that ""giant sucking sound"" from all the jobs that were going to be lost due to NAFTA? Since 1980, the U.S. has created nearly 54 million new jobs, more than any other developed nation by far, notes Scott Lincicome, a trade attorney and lecturer at Duke University. He adds that more than 30 million of those jobs came after the creation of NAFTA and the World Trade Organization in the mid-1990s, the two events that set off much of the current anti-free-trade movement.The benefits of these and other free-trade moves since World War II have been immense.According to the Peterson Institute's study of trade, ""The Payoff to America from Global Integration,"" trade liberalization has created $2,800 to $5,000 in added income for every American -- or roughly $7,100 to $12,900 for each household. And the benefits of free trade, contrary to the rhetoric, go overwhelmingly to those in the lower and middle incomes -- largely because much of their purchasing comes in the form of traded goods like clothing, shoes and food.Since World War II, one free-trade action in particular has had a huge impact on average Americans -- the reduction in tariffs on goods. The Council of Economic Advisers estimates that just reducing tariffs over the last 70 years has added 7.3% to U.S. GDP, or about $1.3 trillion in 2014. That's roughly $10,000 more in income for every household.When people shop at Big Box stores like Wal-Mart (WMT), Costco (COST) and Target (TGT), they are often buying foreign-made goods. Is that a bad thing? From TVs to cellphones to clothing, Americans' standard of living has largely been driven by foreign goods being sold cheaply here -- while U.S. companies focus on higher-end goods and services.Yes, trade deals are complex and often embody things that make free traders blanch -- like local content rules, labor restrictions, and currency controls. Each deal should be judged on its merits, and not every trade deal deserves to be signed.But criticizing trade deals because they make trade freer is a little like criticizing the Indy 500 because the cars go fast.All the way back in 1776, Scottish economist Adam Smith, in his classic ""Wealth of Nations,"" devastated the idea of mercantilism -- that is, that countries get rich by running trade surpluses and accumulating gold. And yet today, as the presidential contenders show, a kind of neo-mercantilism has become increasingly popular.Too bad. Because, as Smith pointed out, free trade makes us wealthier by letting us specialize in producing the things we have a cost advantage in, while buying the things from others that we don't have an advantage in. In doing so, both parties to the trade are made better off. It's an idea that has never been successfully disproved.So free trade isn't really dead, even if it isn't respected as much as it should be. As long as Americans know that free trade has helped this country climb that ladder of prosperity since the 1800s, they will continue to support it.

434,TGT,"CyberArk Software (CYBR) garnered another buyout prediction Wednesday, as Summit Redstone relaunched coverage with a buy rating on CyberArk stock, saying its double-digit growth trajectory makes it a ""compelling"" acquisition candidate.Summit analyst Srini Nandury expects the information security company to continue to gain from the high-profile breaches of Home Depot (HD) and Target (TGT), and the whistleblower cases involving Chelsea Manning (formerly Bradley Manning) and Edward Snowden, because of the niche that CyberArk fills in privileged account security.""Unlike other parts of the security landscape, privileged account security (PAS) still remains a greenfield opportunity given that businesses have under-invested for a long time, leaving their critical infrastructure vulnerable,"" Nandury wrote in a research report.CyberArk has near-term and first-mover advantages, but could see rivalry from Exceedium (acquired last year by CA (CA)), Lieberman Software, Centrify and BalaBit.Total addressable market estimates range from $2 billion to $10 billion, Nandury wrote.CyberArk is ""profitable and prolifically cash-generating,"" making it a rarity among rivals, he wrote. Over the past six quarters, CyberArk beats sales views by 20% and EPS views by even more, he said.""We expect the beats and raises to continue, driven by elevated spending and increased sales capacity,"" Nandury wrote.He has a 55 price target on CyberArk stock, which rose 2.3% to 46.54 on the stock market today.

435,TGT,"A digital crook needs only $70 for an encoder available on Amazon.com (AMZN) to ransack your Visa (V), MasterCard (MA) or American Express (AXP) credit card -- unless you're armed with a chip-and-pin card, says Mark Lanterman of forensic analysis firm Computer Forensic Services.There were 400 million EMV cards -- aka chip-and-pin cards -- in U.S. circulation by the end of 2015, but that's merely 8% of 4.8 billion EMV cards worldwide, according to EMVCo.com. Both figures are rising as EMV cards are protected by end-to-end encryption, reducing fraudulent transactions.Like Apple's (AAPL) Apple Pay and Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google Wallet, EMV cards represent a major security advance from the magnetic stripe cards that remain prevalent in the U.S., Lanterman, Computer Forensic's chief technology officer, told IBD.Magnetic stripes carry personal information and can be counterfeited. EMV cards -- the initials stand for credit card giants Europay, MasterCard and Visa, though many other cards are in the fold -- encrypt information on the chip and use a six-digit ""token"" that changes with every transaction.EMV is your best security bet, says Lanterman, and despite some persistent resistance, the U.S. is picking up the pace in user adoption and improved technology.In the days of Target's (TGT) 40 million-card breach in 2013, most transaction encryption took place on the point-of-sale terminal. In the Target case, hackers breached its POS system and then stole tens of millions of card numbers. With chip-and-pin cards, that can't happen, assuming the encryption is property configured.""Now, the encryption is taking place from that chip all the way to the bank,"" Lanterman said. ""It's point to point. There's no millisecond on the screen, and then it's encrypted. (The account number) is always encrypted.""Chip-and-pin cards reduced Visa's U.S. counterfeit fraud by 26% in January vs. a year earlier, says Stephanie Erickson, vice president of risk products for the credit card giant. It would have cut it even further if more EMV chip cards were in use compared to magnetic stripe cards. As of May, 53% of Visa credit cards and 35% of debit cards were backed by EMV technology, she told IBD.The U.S., though, continues to face not only adoption hurdles, but also technology issues, Lanterman said. Of 10 EMV cards he recently tested, he says he was able to bust into eight. He says the problem with those eight is likely that they weren't properly configured by the card-issuing banks, which clear all transactions on their cards. (More on this below.)Some retailers resist moving to the technology because of the time and cost of getting new card terminals and getting the certification they need from each credit card network.""The technology has great potential,"" Lanterman said, ""but we need to get more retailers on board.""Europe leads in adopting EMV, according to EMVCo.com, an entity set up by its six member organizations -- AmEx, Discover (DFS), Japan's JCB, MasterCard, China's UnionPay and Visa -- and supported by dozens of banks, merchants and others in the payments industry.As of last year, Europe's two zones -- roughly Western and Eastern Europe -- had deployed more than 1 billion EMV cards and boasted 84.3% and 52.3% adoption rates, respectively. In Western Europe, EMV cards accounted for more than 96% of card-present payments -- payments in which the cardholder is physically present along with the card at the point of purchase, such as at retail checkouts.Globally, 35.8% of all card-present transaction in 2015 used EMV tech, up from 32% in 2014. In the U.S., chip-card adoption jumped to 26.4% in 2015, up from just 7.3% in 2014.The U.S. was late to the EMV game in part because the need was less urgent here. Visa's Erickson says the U.S. lagged in EMV because it leads in sophisticated, predictive analytics that help financial institutions detect suspicious or fraudulent card transactions. Other countries had more motivation to move faster to chip-and-pin cards to bolster authentication efforts.Now, the two approaches are converging, she says.""They moved to chip technology to help provide some enhanced authentication and protection against counterfeit, knowing they were doing a deferred transmission of that transaction,"" she said. ""In the U.S., we're adding this chip cryptogram with this one-time code to provide better protection against counterfeit.""As of June, Visa counted 302 million EMV cards in circulation in the U.S. -- 145.7 million credit cards and 156.2 million debit cards -- with 1.2 million merchant locations accepting them. About 23,000 to 25,000 new retail locations come online weekly, Erickson says.Credit cards are the preferred payment method for international travelers and therefore have a head start on debit cards in the U.S., she said.In the meantime, the credit card companies are pushing EMV adoption. In October 2015, Visa changed its liability policy. Now, the bank isn't liable if a customer using one of its chip-and-pin card is hacked, but merchants that haven't installed EMV card readers will be liable, she said.""The liability shifted to the party that had not invested in the chip,"" she said. In October 2017, that policy will extend to fuel pumps and ATMs, adding more incentive to move to EMV tech.So far, say the experts, chip-and-pin cards have proved impossible to counterfeit. And, in any case, the six-digit tokens change for every transaction, so it is useless to hackers, says Erickson. Still, magnetic stripe cards far outnumber their EMV counterparts in the U.S.""The U.S. is the largest market,"" Erickson said, ""but in terms of the percentage of our spending, the U.S. is still in its early days.""Last summer, a Visa poll found that 70% of cardholders had at least one chip-and-pin card in their wallets. The U.S. has made strides, just not enough, says Computer Forensic's Lanterman. He sees the country three years out from real headway in displacing magnetic stripe payments.And ""as long as magnetic stripe cards are accepted, credit card fraud will still be committed,"" he said.But improper configuration, not any fault of users, is another hurdle. When he tested the 10 cards, it was at the behest of a news crew in Minneapolis, where he's based. Lanterman attempted to steal personal information from 10 chip-and-pin cards -- a relative impossibility if they had been encrypted properly at the chip. But as mentioned above, he was able to break into eight.""The two that I could not get were from large, national banks,"" he said. ""I could not steal those numbers. I think the banks outsmarted me and were implementing end-to-end encryption correctly.""Armed with Lanterman's skill, a crook could get a customer's name and account number through a hole in the encryption. Properly configured EMV cards are encrypted from the chip all the way through the processing bank. But eight of those cards had a fissure somewhere in the encryption, he says.Properly configured chip-and-pin card are as secure as Apple Pay and Google Wallet, Lanterman says. He calls the mobile wallet ""brilliant."" Despite popular belief, mobile payment applications don't store a user's actual account number. Like EMV, that account number is tokenized, and a token is worthless to hackers.""The best anyone can do is get a fake number they can't use, because the approval code is a one-off,"" he said. ""It's worthless.""So, fairly solid security in card-present payments is close, though it will be years before EMV tech reaches all of America's mom-and-pop shops.""Small credit unions don't have the resources to configure the technology correctly,"" Lanterman said. ""Issuers need to educate consumers, retailers and local financial institutions. (Broad adoption) will take buy-in from all three.""

437,TGT,"Ulta Beauty (ULTA) Chief Executive Mary Dillon made clear Tuesday that while prestige brands are enjoying a period of growth, the specialty beauty retailer has no intention of straying from the high- and low-end assortment of cosmetics, skin care and hair care products that has made it so popular.When asked at Oppenheimer's 16th Annual Global Consumer Conference about potentially adding more prestige brands to stores, Dillon replied, ""One might ask, 'Why would we do that?' """"We really believe the magic of our proposition is we're not going to be shifting and becoming so predominantly prestige,"" she said, emphasizing the strength of Ulta's curated mix of prestige and mass brands.While not explicitly naming Sephora, Dillon said that Ulta might add slightly more prestige products, but it is ""important to know that we won't ever dramatically continue to shift"" Ulta's product mix toward a more heavily high-end assortment. LVMH (LVMUY)-owned Sephora, Ulta's main competitor in the specialty beauty space, does not carry mass brands like Revlon or L'Oreal.The company also touched on its real estate strategy, with Chief Financial Officer Scott Settersten telling investors that a ""theoretical perfect co-tenant mix"" largely includes off-pricers like TJX's (TJX) Marshalls and T.J.

439,TGT,"Target (TGT) shares tumbled Wednesday, as the big-box retailer took an ax to its full-year earnings guidance and said it plans for a ""challenging environment"" during the rest of 2016.Target said it's lowering earnings expectations to $4.80-$5.20 a share, down from a prior outlook of $5.20-$5.40. Analysts as of Wednesday morning expected $5.13 per share.For the current quarter, Target sees 75-95 cents in per-share profit, on the light side of current expectations for 95 cents, and said it is projecting a 2% drop to flat revenue growth at outlets open more than a year, or same-store sales.Shares fell 5.4% to 70.63 in the stock market today after falling as low as 69.90. But the stock closed below its 50-day line for the first time since early July.During the second quarter, earnings edged up a penny to $1.23 per share, topping estimates by 11 cents. Meanwhile, revenue slid 7% to $16.17 billion, just a hair short of consensus for $16.18 billion. Same-store sales fell 1.1%, weighing on revenue. Not having pharmacies and clinics to count toward results also dragged on revenue, it said.CVS Health (CVS) last year acquired almost 1,700 pharmacies and 80 clinics from Target and re-branded them as CVS pharmacies.According to Reuters, management told analysts on the call Wednesday morning that Target had experienced meaningful pressure in electronics, marked by a double-digit comp decline. About a third of that pressure is fueled in part by declining sales of Apple (AAPL) products.Apple product sales fell 20% vs. a year earlier, highlighting the problem with the tech titan's aging product lineup.Management also reportedly said Target's grocery business disappointed during the quarter.IBD'S TAKE: Target isn't the only one who has turned in lackluster guidance this week. TJX, normally a standout in a struggling retail space, offered weak guidance Tuesday. But some maintain that it could be a sound investment: ""Why TJX Stock Could Still Be A Good Buy Despite Off-Price Outlook.""But the retail major is trying to keep up in an e-commerce-heavy shopping environment. As comparable digital-channel sales rose 16% in the second quarter, Target is looking to continue investing in its digital capabilities. On the call, the company indicated that it will increase its ship-from-store capacity, according to Reuters.CVS shares fell 1 cent to 97.55.

441,TGT,"August's 151,000 job gain missed expectations and slowed from July. But the headline figure still looks decent, or even better for Wall Street because it means the Federal Reserve can take its time before raising interest rates.Yet a look below the surface reveals something entirely different: This was the worst jobs report since 2010.If the data are accurate, the economy is in much worse shape than commonly believed. Yet before going into the ugly details, consider some contrary signals:Since the start of July, JPMorgan Chase (JPM) tellers and Starbucks (SBUX) baristas got a significant bump in pay, while Wendy's (WEN), Ross Stores (ROST), Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) and others have said in earnings calls that they're paying more as they compete for top talent, incentivize performance and keep up with minimum-wage laws. While these are anecdotal reports, federal taxes withheld from paychecks, the broadest gauge of the health of the job market, are growing at the fastest rate in nine months.Now here's what's wrong with the latest jobs report. The problem isn't primarily that job growth has decelerated, it's that wage gains also slowed and the average workweek is now shorter than at any time since the economy was still getting back on its feet in 2011 (unless you count two blizzard-hit months in the winter of 2013-14 when the workweek was equally short).IBD'S TAKE: Despite what the jobs report says, wages have been trending higher, and that's likely to continue as the economy nears full employment. Investors may want to focus on companies with a strong enough position in their markets to withstand labor inflation without suffering a hit to profit margins. Read this Investor's Corner on profit margins and check out IBD Stock Checkup to see how your investments rate.The most important number in each report isn't the net number of new jobs. It's a number that combines the total number of jobs in the economy, the length of the workweek and the average hourly wage. Here's the shock: Aggregate weekly payrolls, essentially the sum total of private-sector pay earned in a week, grew just 3.5% from a year ago in August, the weakest gain since September 2010. (The 3.5% gain matched the level seen in that unusually stormy December of 2013.)The biggest culprit was the length of the average workweek, which was revised down in July from 34.5 hours to 34.4 hours, then fell to 34.3 hours in August. Here's what that means when combined with the modest deceleration in job creation: The total number of hours worked in the economy rose just 1.1% from a year ago, the smallest increase since July 2010. By comparison, total hours worked have grown at least 2.3% vs. a year ago in each of the past five years' August jobs reports.Meanwhile, after average hourly wages grew just 0.1% in August, the annual rate of increase slowed from an upwardly revised 2.7% in July to just 2.4% last month.Despite the added jobs, the paltry wage growth last month and the drop in hours meant that aggregate pay fell 0.2% in August from July.The bottom line is that, if these details reflect reality, the purchasing power of American consumers has gotten pinched. That could help explain why fast-food chains like McDonald's (MCD) have seen sales growth slow, while retailers like Target (TGT) saw a decline in same-store sales. It's also possible that companies facing margin pressures amid tough competition and higher wages have curtailed work hours.Still, the Labor Department data are subject to revision, unlike the tax data that are signaling a faster rise in aggregate pay, so it doesn't make sense to jump to negative conclusions.RELATED:Slower August Job Growth Will Keep The Fed On Hold In SeptemberAs Companies Step Up Wage Hikes, Tax Receipts Get A Lift

442,TGT,"A federal appeals court rejected a $5.7 billion settlement of claims that Visa (V) and MasterCard (MA) improperly fixed credit-card swipe fees, potentially renewing years of litigation with millions of U.S. merchants.The ruling is a blow to credit-card firms that sought to put an end to bitter court battles over fees amounting to tens of billions of dollars annually. The lawsuit, brought on behalf of 12 million merchants nationwide, was filed a decade ago after earlier disputes over the fees. The rejection of the deal raises the prospect that it will have to be renegotiated or the case may go to trial.Dozens of big retailers who opposed the accord cheered the decision, in which the appeals court said provisions barring merchants from suing over fees were unfair. The U.S. Court of Appeals in Manhattan also said that lawyers who represented retailers nationwide didn't do enough to protect their interests.""This is not a settlement; it is a confiscation,"" U.S. Circuit Judge Pierre Leval said in one of two opinions in the case. The judge said he was particularly troubled by the broad litigation release that ""binds in perpetuity, without opportunity to reject the settlement, all merchants who in the future will accept Visa and MasterCard, including those not yet in existence.""Visa declined 2.3% to $74.94 at 11:58 a.m. in New York, while MasterCard slipped 2% to $90.29. The world's largest payment networks were the worst performers in the 68-company S&P 500 Information Technology Index.""We are disappointed by today's ruling,"" Seth Eisen, a spokesman for MasterCard, said in an e-mailed statement. ""We believe we presented a clear case to the court that the settlement was fair and appropriate based on more than four years of negotiation and the close involvement of the district court. We are reviewing the decision to determine our next steps.""Connie Kim, a spokeswoman for Visa, declined to comment.Large retailers including Wal-Mart Stores (WMT), Amazon.com (AMZN) and Target (TGT), as well as major airlines, health insurers and other consumer businesses, had criticized the deal. On Thursday, the Retail Industry Leaders Association, a trade group that represents more than 200 merchants, praised the ruling, saying the settlement would have denied retailers the ability to bring lawsuits over interchange rules and rate setting. The group had formally opted out and objected to the deal two years ago.""Today's decision is a victory for all merchants and consumers,"" Deborah White, the group's executive vice president, said in a statement. ""The settlement orchestrated by the card networks and banks would have undermined merchants' legal rights forever and would have allowed Visa and MasterCard to impose higher and higher swipe fees.""U.S. District Judge John Gleeson in Brooklyn, New York, approved the accord on Dec. 13, 2013, saying he was satisfied with the settlement, which was estimated to be the largest-ever U.S. antitrust deal. Gleeson stepped down from the bench earlier this year.Once owned by groups of major banks, Visa and MasterCard had defended themselves for decades against legal claims that they operated price-fixing schemes. Swipe, or interchange, fees are set by card companies and paid by merchants when consumers use credit or debit cards.The settlement was announced in July 2012. Once worth as much as $7.25 billion, it was valued at about $5.7 billion as of August 2013 after reductions for about 8,000 merchants that dropped out of the damages portion of the lawsuit.The case is In re Payment Card Interchange Fee and Merchant Discount Antitrust Litigation, 12-4671, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit (Manhattan).

443,TGT,"Target (TGT) and UnitedHealth Group (UNH) raised their quarterly dividends Wednesday, following in the footsteps of FedEx (FDX), which pumped up its dividend by 60% on Tuesday.Many U.S. companies have been accumulating cash as wage inflation remains low and the economy continues a slow, steady improvement, and are now moving to increase returns to investors.Big-box discount department store operator Target hiked its dividend 7.5% to 60 cents a share after holding its dividend steady at 56 cents a share for the prior four quarters. The increase will mark the 45th straight year that Target has increased its dividend.Target stock formed a nearly seven-month-long cup-with-handle base from mid-2015 to late April when it edged above an 84.10 buy point to touch 84.14. But it failed to break out and has fallen about 18% from that point.Shares closed up 0.6% in the stock market today. UnitedHealth shares climbed 2.5%. FedEx dipped less than 0.1%.UnitedHealth, the nation's largest managed-care health insurer, lifted its dividend 25% to 62.5 cents a share, up from 50 cents, to be paid on June 28. UnitedHealth Group President and Chief Financial Officer David Wichmann said in a written statement the company is paying the dividend ""while remaining focused on costs and value.""No. 2 U.S. package delivery service FedEx late Tuesday raised its dividend to 40 cents a share from 25 cents, payable on July 1. FedEx stock has been forming a flat base for a little more than a month, with a 169.40 buy point.

444,TGT,"The broadest and most timely indicator of the state of the job market -- federal income and employment tax withholdings -- shows that the new conventional wisdom has got it roughly backwards.The job market didn't suddenly start sputtering over the past few months, as suggested by the surprisingly weak May employment report. Actually, the labor market has been getting stronger over the past several months after steadily losing steam last fall and then sinking with the stock market early this year.The latest data through Friday June 3 show that, over the previous four weeks, withheld taxes rose 4.7% from a year earlier, the fastest growth rate in seven months, an IBD analysis finds.The good news is that the tax data are consistent with the economy picking up after two weak quarters. Still, the news isn't necessarily all that great, because income gains are recovering from really low levels over the winter and are still pretty tame, especially when one factors in a rise in headline inflation since last fall. Further, the data suggest that the Federal Reserve may not keep hitting the pause button on rate hikes for very long.After bottoming out at about 2% year-over-year growth in February, income and employment taxes have staged a recovery, fueled in part by announced pay hikes at Wal-Mart (WMT), Target (TGT) and Costco (COST). A number of companies reporting earnings over the past six weeks also have highlighted wage pressures.“We’re facing an unprecedented environment for retaining and hiring talent,” Panera (PNRA) President Drew Madsen said on the restaurant chain’s first-quarter earnings call.The company noted a 5% rise in retail hourly wage inflation during the quarter, as well as an increase in bonuses for bakery cafe managers.Wendy's (WEN) said it’s seeing wage inflation of 5% to 6%, driven both by minimum-wage hikes and the need to offer a competitive wage “to access good labor.”Kohl's (KSS) CEO Kevin Mansell said the retailer also is “experiencing significant wage pressure.”Earlier in the year, the tax data, which don’t rely on limited sample sizes and seasonal adjustments, had been signaling much weaker wage gains than the monthly employment reports, which do require such guesswork. The puzzle over why job growth had looked so strong, even as the economy barely grew over the past two quarters, may be explained to some extent by faulty data or seasonal factors.The 4.7% rate of growth in withheld income and employment taxes is roughly consistent with annual payroll gains of 2% and wage gains of 2.5%. But the data reflect aggregate pay, so changes in the average workweek or incentive pay also can affect the growth rate.Over time, higher income growth should flow through to better economic growth. But there are reasons to doubt that the upturn in nominal tax withholdings, a proxy for income gains, is a precursor to GDP growth breaking out of its modest range.Companies have been facing a challenging earnings environment and may respond to wage pressures and increases in other input costs by hiring less and trying to boost productivity. That's what Wal-Mart did earlier this year, closing 154 U.S. stores while boosting its own minimum wage to $10 an hour. Kohl's closed 18 stores, including 9 of its 125 stores in California. Meanwhile, Wendy's is making self-order kiosks available to its roughly 6,000 franchise restaurants.Employers are increasingly complaining about their difficulty in finding qualified workers. That's leading Fed policymakers to think that the economy is close to full employment and that they should get on with the process of raising interest rates.

445,TGT,"World's largest retailer Wal-Mart Stores (WMT) said Friday it is partnering with ride-hailing services Uber and Lyft as it ratchets up its competition against Amazon.com (AMZN) in the hotly contested home delivery services arena.In a blog post, Wal-Mart's Global eCommerce Chief Operating Officer Michael Bender said the company will begin the service on a trial basis at Wal-Mart stores, as well as its Sam's Club outlets, in about two weeks. Wal-Mart Chief Executive Doug McMillon was set to provide details on the service at the company's annual shareholders meeting on Friday.""We've been working on convenient new ways to make shopping easier for busy customers and members,"" Bender said in the post, adding that, ""You can see this in our rapid expansion of online grocery pickup across the country, as well as the home delivery service offered in San Jose, Calif., and Denver, Colo.""The new service also could help Wal-Mart keep costs down, in line with its strategy of providing products at discount prices. Along with Amazon, Wal-Mart rival Target (TGT) also has beefed up its home delivery services.Further, Wal-Mart on Thursday announced that in six to nine months it will start using drones to help fulfill online orders, following in the footsteps of Amazon, which has been using the devices.Bender said that with the new ride-hailing services, customers will select a delivery time window, and Wal-Mart employees will prepare the order and request a drive from one of the services to pick up the order and take it to the customer's home.""It's all seamless to the customer. They pay us our normal $7 to $10 delivery charge online and make no payment to the driver,"" Bender said.Wal-Mart shares shot up 10% to 69.20 on May 19 after it reported better-than-expected earnings of 98 cents per share, beating analyst views by 10 cents a share. Wal-Mart dipped slightly to 70.87 in the stock market today. It's risen 26% from a Nov. 13 low at 56.30.Amazon was down 0.4% at 725.54, and Target ticked up 0.5% to 68.65.
"
446,TGT,"Amazon (AMZN) is dominating many retailers, but there are two names in particular that are holding their own as the e-commerce giant grows: Costco (COST) and Ulta Beauty (ULTA).In a report out Thursday, Cowen said it continues to see Costco as an “un-Amazonable retail concept,” as the wholesale superstore reported a 4% rise in May comps, which was in line with estimates.After an earnings beat last week, the analyst said Costco’s “superb price/value, luxury product and streamlined assortment helps drive a sustainable high-margin membership stream.”Cowen has also said Ulta is “un-Amazonable,” while other analysts have noted Amazon’s lack of strength in the beauty products space as well.Costco fell 0.7% in above-average volume Thursday, dropping back below its 200-day line but finding support at its 50-day line. The stock has struggled to stay above its moving averages since attempting to retake those levels after reporting earnings. Shares are trading 10% below their high reached in December.And Ulta hit a new all-time high in light turnover before paring its gains to close up 0.2%. Shares are now extended 26% from a breakout past a consolidation base buy point cleared in March, meaning they’re in a profit-taking zone.Meanwhile, traditional retailers like Macy’s (M) and Target (TGT) are feeling the heat from Amazon.Macy’s has been able to climb off of its May 18 low, reached in the wake of a weak earnings report, but it’s still trading 53% below its 52-week high. Shares closed up 4% Thursday.Target is trading 20% below its 52 week high, and down 0.1% Thursday. Shares failed to break out of a cup-with-handle base, sliced through their moving averages and gapped down in heavy volume on disappointing earnings.

447,TGT,"As Whole Foods Market (WFM) gained popularity over the past decade or so, the chain also developed a reputation as a wallet-gouging food utopia exclusive only to moneyed bohemians.Sales and the stock price suffered, but investors can now scoop up shares on the cheap ahead of a likely recovery driven by lower prices, easier comparisons and other efforts to reclaim increasingly selective consumers from rivals, Credit Suisse said Wednesday in a research note.""We see a unique opportunity to own this leading specialty food player while still in the early stages of a repositioning that should reinvigorate growth,"" wrote analyst Credit Suisse Edward Kelly, who upgraded the stock to outperform from neutral and raised the price target to 40 from 30.Whole Foods shares gapped up 4.9% in the stock market today, climbing their way through a consolidation base begun in December. The stock is now 3% below a 35.09 buy point.Whole Foods stock had plunged earlier, as more value-oriented competitors like Kroger (KR), Wal-Mart (WMT), Target (TGT) and Costco (COST) stepped up their attempts to lure health-conscious but less-wealthy consumers with higher-quality products.But Credit Suisse said Whole Foods has focused more over the past year on cutting prices to repair its image -- an investment that has dragged profits but is poised to pay off in the quarters to come, as consumers gradually come around.Whole Foods this month also opened its first 365 by Whole Foods Market store in Los Angeles' boutique-ish, tattoo-and-beard-heavy Silver Lake neighborhood.Those smaller stores sell cheaper products, cost less to build, take up less real estate and make it easier to reach more customers.""The format allows WFM to reach markets where demographic constraints make its core stores uneconomical,"" Kelly wrote.Credit Suisse's note comes a week after a Retale survey found that only 8% of millennials would cut grocery spending amid economic uncertainty. BB&T Capital Markets last week said those findings were a good sign for higher-end grocery chains like Whole Foods and Sprouts (SFM), as well as chains like Kroger.Whole Foods' same-store sales appear to be close to a bottom, Credit Suisse's note said, adding that the company is heading into some easier year-over-year comparisons. Whole Foods last year suffered following allegations that it overcharged consumers in New York City. The company settled with the city for $500,000 in December following an investigation of the chain's prices.The company has also focused more on tech spending -- including the expansion of digital marketing, new point-of-sale systems and its loyalty program, the Credit Suisse note said. To fund cutting prices, the company also said it would trim $300 million in operating costs over two years, with much of it coming from salaries and benefits, while other adjustments to staff scheduling could help too, Kelly wrote.However, the note said, ""the company will need to be careful since high service is a key differentiator."" The in-store experience also helps mitigate the need for Whole Foods to cut prices even more.""Pricing is the company's biggest problem,"" Kelly wrote, ""but the company does not need to be in-line with peers to be successful, in our view, given its significantly better shopping experience.""

The EU said Apple (AAPL) must repay $14.5 billion in taxes and Mylan (MYL) buckled to pressure and offered a half-priced generic EpiPen. Salesforce (CRM) gave weak guidance, while United Airlines (UAL) hired a key American Airlines (AAL) executive.The major market averages rose modestly for the week, continuing the long string of sideways action near record highs. The Nasdaq composite rose 0.6% while the S&P 500 and Dow industrials climbed 0.5%. Investors see a Fed rate hike in September as even less likely now. Fiber-optic stocks remained hot, generic drugs rebounded. Apparel stores were among the notable losers.The European Union's executive arm ordered Apple to repay 13 billion euros ($14.5 billion) in back taxes plus interest to Ireland, part of a broader crackdown into EU member nations' special tax treatments for big multinationals.

Crude inventories rose for a second straight week, while mixed economic data also weighed. U.S. oil rig counts edged higher to a seven-month high.Drugmaker Mylan (MYL) launched a generic EpiPen on Monday, responding to a frenzy of criticism over price hikes on its allergy treatment. But it faced new lawmaker calls for EpiPen-related documents, while others asked the FDA for an explanation of what was holding up approval for other generic versions. On Friday, some lawmakers accused Mylan of overcharging Medicaid for EpiPen, while Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton said she would crack down on drug-price hikes. Mylan fell 7.1% this week after tumbling 11.6% in the prior week.Palo Alto Networks (PANW) earned 50 cents a share excluding items, meeting fiscal Q4 views for a 79% gain. Revenue growth topped. But EPS guidance for current Q1 was weak and indicated yet another quarter of decelerating Palo Alto growth from very high levels. Despite solid full-year EPS guidance and a $500 million buyback plan, shares fell 7.2% on Wednesday, but rallied for a 3.2% weekly gain, just below its 200-day line.Chipmakers Broadcom (AVGO) and Ambarella (AMBA) late Thursday posted top- and bottom-line beats for quarters ended July 31, and both gave guidance that topped Wall Street … and both stocks fell Friday and for the week. One problem is that investors and analysts have some doubts about crucial products about to be announced by key customers.Ciena (CIEN), a major fiber-optic company, earned 42 cents a share excluding items in its fiscal Q3, up 13.5% and beating by four cents.

The results come as Wal-Mart (WMT)begins its own price-cutting campaign, potentially drawing customers away from rival discounters.Ollie's stock rose 4% for the week, retaking a 26.65 buy point after falling below its 50-day line. Five Below fell 6.5% as it extended its losing streak to eight straight sessions.Lululemon Athletica (LULU) met earnings estimates of 38 cents a share, marking 12% growth, but missed on revenue, as sales grew 14% to $514.5 million vs. forecasts for $515.5 million. Currency-neutral same-store sales rose 5% for the yogawear maker and retailer. Some analysts were anticipating an earnings turnaround, but Lululemon issued cautious Q3 guidance. Shares sank 10%, erasing virtually all of Lululemon's gains from its breakout after its prior earnings report.Shares of United Airlines (UAL) jumped this week after Scott Kirby joined the carrier from American Airlines (AAL), where he had served as president. Kirby, now United's president, is seen by some as one of the industry's best revenue strategists. The move rounds out United's recent efforts to shake up its executive team to compete with American and Delta Air Lines (DAL). United rose 9% for the week, retaking its 200-day line. American climbed 0.8%. Delta, which reported that August unit revenue fell 9.5% vs. a year earlier as it suffered outages that forced cancellations, rose 3%. Hawaiian Holdings (HA), parent of Hawaiian Airlines, rose 4.8%, breaking past a buy point, but in light volume.Smith & Wesson (SWHC) late Thursday reported first-quarter results that easily beat Wall Street forecasts. It raised full-year guidance, helped by new acquisitions. But shares of the gunmaker slid 6.4% on Friday to a two-month low and back below its 50-day line. That's in part due to FBI data on August background checks — a loose indicator of firearm demand — that didn't exhibit the surge seen in previous months.

452,TGT,"Wal-Mart (WMT) and Target (TGT) earnings are on tap this week as overall retail demand remains sluggish and labor costs rise.The slower retail market is expected to weigh on big-box retailer's results, as analysts see Wal-Mart's quarterly earnings falling 5.6% to $1.02 a share and sales climbing 0.1% to $120.3 billion when it announces results Thursday.Analysts see Target's second-quarter earnings falling 8.2% to $1.12 per share and sales dropping 7.2% to $16.17 billion when it reports earnings Wednesday.Last week, Wal-Mart announced it would buy Jet.com for $3.3 billion to keep up with rival Amazon (AMZN) in the online shopping sphere.Wal-Mart also is being squeezed by higher labor costs. Last year the company raised its minimum wage to $10 an hour from $9 and Chief Financial Officer Charles Holley warned that the higher wages along with new training would hit operating profits by $1.5 billion this year.IBD'S TAKE: While big-box retailers have been struggling on soft demand, home-improvement stores like Home Depot are holding at or near buy points. For more on Home Depot, click here. The Commerce Department reported Friday that non-auto retail sales were down 0.3%. General merchandise store sales dipped 0.1%, while department stores saw sales down 0.5% on the month and down 4% vs. a year earlier.Wal-Mart shares finished trading down 0.8% to 73.32 on the stock market today. Target added 0.4% to 75.53.

453,TGT,"The major market indexes were slightly higher at the close Wednesday, after reversing losses following the release of the Federal Reserve policy meeting minutes.The S&P 500, Dow Jones industrial average and Nasdaq managed to edge higher. The S&P was up 0.2%, Dow up 0.1% and the Nasdaq inched up 0.03%. Volume was higher across the board vs. the same time Tuesday.Minutes from the July 27 Fed meeting showed policymakers were increasingly confident about the economic outlook but would wait ""to accumulate more data"" before hiking rates. The statement pointed to ""moderate"" economic gains, a strengthening labor market and ""diminished"" near-term risks to the economic outlook.Solar, hospital and retail stocks led the downside in today's stock market action, while food, utility and online travel stocks outperformed.Cisco Systems (CSCO) was the biggest mover on the Dow, falling more than 1% to 30.72 in heavy trade ahead of its earnings report due out after the close. The networking gear maker plans to cut up to 14,000 employees, or about 20% of its global workforce, according to tech website CRN.Target (TGT) plunged more than 6% to 70.63, gapping down below its 50-day moving average in big volume. The discount retailer reported mixed Q2 results, as earnings topped views but revenue slightly missed. It also lowered its full-year profit outlook.On the IBD 50, Yirendai (YRD) bounced back from Tuesday's slide with a 6.7% gain to 35.62. The Chinese stock has more than tripled from its Dec. 18 offering price of 10 a share and is well extended past a 14.97 buy point first cleared in May.Cintas (CTAS) rose 2.4% to 115.65, adding to its 5% gap-up move from the prior session. Shares are extended from a 109.21 entry of a four-weeks-tight pattern completed last week.A few IBD 50 stocks fell more than 2%, though none of the drops were too severe. Paycom Software (PAYC) gave up nearly 3% to 49.39 in fast trade. Shares are 5% off their all-time high and holding well above their 50-day moving average. The stock had also triggered the 20%-25% profit-taking rule.Discount retailer Five Below (FIVE), had a third straight decline, falling 2.5% to 46.42, and sliding further below its 50-day line. But it had already triggered the profit-taking rule in late July. The fellow IBD 50 name sells all items in its stores for $5 or less and specializes in party goods, food, and products for teens.IBD'S TAKE: Younger companies with outstanding growth in earnings and sales, such as Paycom and Five Below, tend to populate the IBD 50.

454,TGT,"Disney (DIS) recently shuttered its interactive toys-to-life segment, but there are plenty of drones willing to take its place.Spin Master's Air Hogs Connect: Mission Drone, for one, allows users to fly a real-life drone in an augmented-reality space.The company, which went public last year on the Toronto exchange under the ticker TOY, said the drone will be available in specialty stores like Brookstone soon and will launch in mass retailers like Target (TGT) and Wal-Mart (WMT) next year.Spin Master also makes an interactive toy version of ""Star Wars"" droid BB-8.Shares of fellow toy makers Hasbro (HAS) and Mattel (MAT) rose 0.45% and 0.5%, respectively, on Tuesday.Now that Disney's out of the picture, Activision (ATVI) and Time Warner's (TWX) Warner Bros.

455,TGT,"Fears of a broad cybersecurity freeze could amplify after vendors Palo Alto Networks (PANW) and FireEye (FEYE) missed April-quarter expectations and Check Point Software Technology (CHKP), Fortinet (FTNT) and Imperva (IMPV) guided toward slower growth.Then again, rather than a broad slowdown, the pure-play security leaders might in fact be losing some business to tech giants Cisco Systems (CSCO) and IBM (IBM), which are expanding deeper into security, and to specialized security vendors such as CyberArk Software (CYBR), Proofpoint (PFPT) and Mimecast (MIME).""Investors tend to look at security as a single sector, and the reality is you have a lot of different plays here,"" Pacific Crest analyst Rob Owens told IBD. ""In aggregate, we're seeing relatively consistent spending. There is some shifting that is happening, but that makes sense.""Security spending overall rose 13% year over year in Q1, barely down from 14% growth in Q4, Owens says. He says those growth rates are consistent with the past two years.Palo Alto, Fortinet and Check Point all had been hot stocks in 2014 and much of 2015 on the strength of their broad security platforms, but not this year. The focus has shifted to specific security areas such as privileged account management, email and cloud security, and endpoint protection, analysts say. So, while some vendors might be slowing, others are rising, Owens says.Fears of a broad security slowdown go back to last year, Owens told IBD.""We've been having this end-of-the-world discussion for a year now,"" he said. ""Certain vendors that may have been growing at rapid rates (have) decelerated.""Palo Alto Networks -- the No. 2 security software company by market cap, behind Check Point -- is an industry bellwether.Last month, Palo Alto disappointed Wall Street. It guided to 37% year-over-year sales growth for the current quarter, which would be great for most companies but would represents the highflier's slowest-ever growth. Last quarter was the first in eight where its sales rose less than 50%.But the slowdown is relative, Pacific Crest's Owens says.""Palo Alto will continue to perform well, but it can't continue to grow at four times the industry,"" he said. ""Fifty percent to 60% growth is unsustainable.""Piper Jaffray analyst Andrew Nowinski anticipated slow April demand for Palo Alto products, citing checks with resellers.But Dougherty analyst Catharine Trebnick characterized the April slowdown as a ""blip"" in a typically seasonally weak quarter. She blamed FireEye CEO David DeWalt for the panic. During FireEye's fiscal Q3 earnings call in November 2015, DeWalt said ""emergency spending"" in the wake of the notable Target (TGT) and Home Depot (HD) breaches had normalized.""The CEO of FireEye last year said, 'You're just not having all these big breaches and we're not getting attacked from China as much, so spending is slow,'"" she said. ""So, everyone has been chanting the mantra.""(DeWalt is set to step down June 15, leaving COO and Mandiant founder Kevin Mandia to take the reins. FireEye acquired Mandiant in 2014.)Palo Alto Networks wasn't the only pure player to spot braking growth. On May 5, FireEye guided to its slowest quarter ever, and Imperva's outlook for this quarter would mark a fourth straight quarter of sales deceleration. In April, Check Point guided to 6% growth for Q2, down from six straight periods of 9% growth.Fortinet expects sales growth to slow to 27% in Q2 from 34% growth in the prior quarter. And even email specialist Proofpoint -- among those analysts peg as on the rise -- guided to its slowest quarterly growth in 11 quarters, to 32% growth from 37% the prior quarter.IBD's 26-company Computer Software-Security industry group reflects fears of a general tech slowdown. The group was down as much as 34% for the year in early February, hitting a two-year low, as many tech stocks tanked on dour views from LinkedIn (LNKD) and Tableau Software (DATA). The group has since recovered in part, but is still down nearly 16% for the year.Cybersecurity Ventures Managing Editor Steve Morgan says pure players like Palo Alto, Check Point and Fortinet are no longer good barometers for the health of the industry. Instead, thousands of venture-capital-backed startups -- as well as tech giants increasingly expanding their security presence -- are gouging share.In Q1, IBM pulled in $400 million in security sales -- topping Palo Alto, Fortinet and FireEye, and closing in on Symantec (SYMC) -- up 18% vs. the year-earlier quarter and accelerating from 12% growth in all of 2015. Its overall sales fell 5%. For its fiscal Q3 ended April 30, Cisco said its security sales jumped 17% year over year, accelerating from 11% growth in fiscal Q2.Still, the accelerating growth for the IBM and Cisco security businesses falls short of the decelerating growth for most of the pure players. The big companies, though, aren't going away.Microsoft (MSFT) swept three cybersecurity players off the public map in 2015 via acquisitions, but the company doesn't break out its cybersecurity revenue, Morgan points out. And Dell subsidiary SonicWall, acquired in 2012, is potentially pulling in billions, but since Dell is now privately held those figures aren't reported publicly.""That revenue just goes away from what's reported in the public market,"" Morgan told IBD. ""Unless you cover the market really carefully, you won't hear about it.""But the cybersecurity VC market is still booming, he says. In 2015, Dow Jones estimated that $1.9 billion in VC funding was spent backing cybersecurity startups, Morgan says. At one time, it was unheard of for cybersecurity startups to raise more than high single digits in funding, and ""now we're routinely seeing (funding hit) $50 million, $75 million, $100 million.""Those VC-backed companies are ""competing aggressively in the market,"" Morgan said. ""But if they're not public, their revenue figures aren't necessarily being reported.""As private businesses like MalwareBytes, the Herjavec Group (tied to Robert Herjavec of the ""Shark Tank"" TV show) and Black Duck Software begin to achieve scale, they'll further steal share from the publicly traded security firms, Morgan says.Pacific Crest's Owens sees pent-up demand. He says companies still aren't spending enough on security. He ballparks annual IT spending overall near $1 trillion, and cybersecurity spending at $25 billion to $30 billion.""I think security has been an under-spend area for decades,"" he said. ""You're spending about 3% of your capex (capital expenditures) that's focused on IT on security. That's relatively low. Some regulated industries like health care might be two or three times that, but there's still a long way to go.""Building up security spending takes time, Owens says.""There's that perception that you're able to spend an unlimited amount of dollars overnight within security, but that's just not the case in reality,"" he said. ""It's not an overnight type of thing.""Network security still has headroom, Owens says, and he sees products focused on authentication, detection, remediation and endpoint solutions as leaders. Summit Research analyst Srini Nandury pegs privileged account management -- CyberArk's bread and butter -- as the industry's next growth vector. Dougherty's Trebnick expects email security providers like Proofpoint and Mimecast to pick up share. Morgan's bet is on cloud security.Meanwhile, Symantec, Juniper Networks (JNPR), Barracuda Networks (CUDA) and FireEye will continue to struggle, Owens says. Symantec may ""throw out billions in cash flow"" to survive attempts to transition from legacy antivirus to next-generation endpoint protection. FireEye is shifting to a subscription model. Juniper and Barracuda deal with broader macro issues outside cybersecurity, he says.So, back to the original question: Is security spending slowing?Not for many, Morgan says.""What I think you're seeing is a squeeze on the pure-play company,"" he said. But overall, instead of any slowdown, ""I think we're entering an uptick. Spending is up, undoubtedly.""

456,TGT,"Federal withheld income and employment taxes, the broadest and most reliable gauge of the state of the job market, grew 4.5% from a year ago in the four weeks through May 20, an IBD analysis of daily Treasury statements finds.That's the fastest pace in more than six months, providing confirmation that the economy is gaining steam after two weak quarters.The tax data, which don't rely on limited sample sizes and seasonal adjustments, had been signaling weaker wage gains than the monthly employment reports, which do require such guesswork. That may help explain how the economy slowed so much over the past two quarters even as job growth remained solid.The upturn in tax-receipt growth since mid-April could be a precursor to another strong employment report, including a further rise in wage growth that pushes the Federal Reserve closer to a June rate hike.After bottoming out at about 2% year-over-year growth in February, income and employment taxes have staged a recovery, propelled by announced pay hikes at Wal-Mart (WMT), Target (TGT) and Costco (COST).A number of companies reporting earnings over the past month also have highlighted wage pressures.""We're facing an unprecedented environment for retaining and hiring talent,"" Panera Bread (PNRA) President Drew Madsen said on the restaurant chain's first-quarter earnings call.The company noted a 5% rise in retail hourly wage inflation during the quarter, as well as an increase in bonuses for bakery cafe managers.Wendy's (WEN) said it's seeing wage inflation of 5% to 6%, driven both by minimum-wage hikes and the need to offer a competitive wage ""to access good labor.""Kohl's (KSS) CEO Kevin Mansell said the retailer also is ""experiencing significant wage pressure.""The 4.5% rate of growth in withheld income and employment taxes is roughly consistent with annual payroll gains of 2% and wage gains of 2.5%. That's still pretty modest compared to gains upward of 5% in the first half of 2015 and 7% before the recession. But Fed policymakers aren't prepared to wait for more normal wage growth to resume normalizing interest rates.The U.S. is ""basically at full employment or very near it,"" San Francisco Fed President John Williams said Monday.

457,TGT,"Consumer electronics retailer Best Buy (BBY) early Tuesday posted better-than-expected first-quarter sales and earnings, but its soft earnings outlook and the exit of the company's chief financial officer set investors on edge.Best Buy stock dropped 7.4%, to 30.55 on the stock market today.The Richfield, Minn.-based company earned 44 cents a share excluding items on sales of $8.44 billion in the quarter ended April 30. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected 35 cents and $8.29 billion. On a year-over-year basis, earnings per share rose 19%, but sales slipped 1%.For the current quarter, Best Buy is targeting EPS of 40 cents on sales of $8.4 billion. Analysts were modeling 50 cents and $8.31 billion.Best Buy also announced that CFO Sharon McCollam is stepping down on June 14 but will remain with the company in an advisory capacity through the fiscal year ending Jan. 28. Corie Barry, a 16-year veteran of Best Buy and its current chief strategic growth officer, will become the company’s chief financial officer at the conclusion of Best Buy’s annual shareholder meeting, set for June 14.Best Buy CEO Hubert Joly said strong growth in wearable fitness devices, home theater and appliances was offset by continued weakness in mobile phones and tablets in the first quarter.McCollam said she expects slight declines in revenue in the first half of the fiscal year, followed by growth in the back half.""We recognize this will be challenging without a strong mobile cycle and improvements in (consumer electronics) categories overall,” she said in a statement.Best Buy is the latest U.S. retailer to deliver disappointing Q1 reports.

459,TGT,"AT&T (T) has again expanded the retail reach of it Cricket brand, with distribution deals at Best Buy (BBY) and Aaron’s (AAN), as it battles T-Mobile US (TMUS) in the prepaid wireless market.AT&T acquired Leap Wireless and its Cricket brand for $1.2 billion in 2014. Since then, AT&T has stepped up Cricket advertising while opening more retail stores. T-Mobile acquired prepaid specialist MetroPCS in 2013.AT&T says it will add 1,000 Best Buy locations and 2,000 stores through Aaron’s, a nationwide lease-to-own retailer, to its Cricket distribution network.AT&T earlier signed deals with Target, Wal-Mart, and GameStop (GME). AT&T has nearly 4,000 Cricket-owned stores. Cricket wireless services now will be sold at 12,000 outlets across the U.S., including AT&T’s Cricket stores and distribution at Target (TGT), Wal-Mart (WMT), GameStop, Best Buy, Aaron’s and other locations.About one-fifth of U.S. mobile phone users buy prepaid wireless services. Prepaid customers buy calling minutes and data as needed. Many prepaid plans renew automatically every month, blurring the line with postpaid subscribers that have service contracts. Prepaid customers typically buy less-pricey phones upfront, and spend less on data services.T-Mobile and AT&T both added 469,000 prepaid subscribers in Q4, while Verizon Communications (VZ) shed 157,000 and Sprint (S) lost 491,000. Some of Sprint’s prepaid subscribers upgraded to postpaid plans.AT&T stock was up a fraction in midday trading in the stock market today, above 39. Shares are more than 7% extended from a 36.55 buy point first touched on Feb. 3. T-Mobile stock also was up a fraction midday Monday.

460,TGT,"With the Amazon.com (AMZN) one-hour delivery app Prime Now, it's possible to order a big-screen television on New Year's day from a mobile phone and still catch that day's football bowl games.This capability is going to help Amazon destroy the advantage that Wal-Mart (WMT), Target (TGT) and others hope to gain by offering online orders, in-store pickup and stores as warehouses for online deliveries, according to a Wells Fargo analyst.Though ordering a TV from a smartphone and having it delivered immediately is not a typical use of Prime Now, Amazon's app has caught on with consumers. The Seattle-based giant has brought the service to 26 markets in just over a year. It's part of the company's move to dominate ""Need It Now"" shopping, Wells Fargo analyst Matt Nemer wrote in a research note late Monday.Prime Now members must be members of the company's Amazon Prime loyalty program, which costs $99 a year. Amazon Prime includes free two-day shipping, free video streaming and a host of other perks. Those perks include Prime Now, which offers free two-hour shipping of roughly 30,000 products in markets where it's available, and one-hour shipping for $7.99 per delivery.Amazon's push may eliminate a key advantage of physical retailers -- the last-mile convenience of being able to get something immediately. As that advantage disappears, so do other advantages touted by brick-and-mortar stores, such as the ability to pick up an online order quickly at your local store.Prime Now is gaining even in food delivery, Nemer says. He says that Prime Now has a better app for Apple (AAPL) iOS users than Google Express, the Alphabet (GOOGL) food delivery service.Wal-Mart, Target and other retailers have struggled to compete with Amazon's growth rate and innovation -- especially around customer loyalty programs. Target recently launched its Red Card loyalty program.Amazon stock was up nearly 1%, near 567, in afternoon trading on the stock market today.In the research note, Nemer says that Prime Now, though not currently profitable, helps Amazon retain Prime member loyalty and will, with scale, become profitable. Prime also gives the company opportunities to experiment -- for example, selling products in smaller pack sizes or offering high-turnaround fresh groceries that would be impossible to sell on Amazon.com.Nemer says that Amazon's delivery of local food items ""suggests"" that it may compete with food-delivery platforms like GrubHub (GRUB) and privately held Uber's UberEats.It's also possible, Nemer says, that Amazon could begin to eat into convenience store market share. If Amazon can deliver small-pack sizes for lower prices with free delivery, convenience stores could have trouble competing, he says.

461,TGT,"Kroger’s (KR) profit and revenue are both expected to grow about 4% when the supermarket heavyweight reports Thursday. A 4% rise would mark a pickup for revenue growth but a deceleration from seven prior consecutive quarters of double-digit earnings gains.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect fourth-quarter per-share earnings of 54 cents on $26.27 billion in revenue. Earnings per share grew 23%, 26% and 15% in the three most recent quarters. The company has reported flat year-over-year revenue for two out of the last three quarters.Kroger shares have mostly been bobbing below their 50-day line since mid-January but found support Monday, and closed up 1.2% in the stock market today.The grocery-store chain is reportedly interested in acquiring The Fresh Market (TFM). According to Reuters, Kroger is a bidder in the second round of an auction process that also includes Apollo Global Management (APO), KKR (KKR) and TPG Capital.Shares of The Fresh Market, a chain of 183 specialty grocery stores, popped 22% on Feb. 11, when the news broke. Supermarkets have been facing increasing competition, not just from one another but also from stores such as Target (TGT) and Wal-Mart (WMT).Whole Foods Market (WFM) shares rose 0.7%.

462,TGT,"Ross Stores (ROST) will raise its minimum hourly wage for eligible employees to $10 from $9 in the second quarter to attract stronger talent, the off-price retailer said Tuesday, matching Wal-Mart’s (WMT) plans for a hike to $10 this year.The planned increase, discussed on Ross’ Q4 earnings call, echoed similar moves from retailers last year, when Wal-Mart raised wages to a minimum of $9 per hour. After Wal-Mart's pay hike, retailers like Ross, off-price rival TJX (TJX) and Target (TGT) followed.The planned pay hike also weighed on Ross’s full-year earnings per share guidance of $2.59-$2.71, which missed forecasts for $2.75. Comparable-store sales are seen rising 1% to 2%. For Q1, the company sees EPS of 69-72 cents, lower than views for 76 cents.The dimmer forecast comes amid broader fears of a recession, more aggressive off-price offerings from Macy’s and Nordstrom, and pressures for better accommodations for labor across the industry.“As we enter 2016, we continue to face our own challenging multiyear comparisons in an increasingly uncertain and volatile macroeconomic and retail environment,” Ross CEO Barbara Rentler said in a statement.“As a result, while we hope to do better, we believe it is prudent to maintain a somewhat cautious outlook when forecasting sales and earnings for the coming year.”Q4 earnings per share rose 10% to 66 cents, topping by 2 cents. Sales increased 7% to $3.25 billion, edging past views for $3.21 billion. Comps rose 4%.Those results came despite tough holiday promotions from rivals. The Midwest continued to be Ross’s strongest performer, while its largest region, California, outpaced the company’s average.Shares were up 0.75% after hours in the stock market today. The stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 96, having cleared a consolidation in January but fizzling in the days after. Still, shares have generally found support at their 50-day line.Earlier Tuesday, Dollar Tree (DLTR) said Q4 earnings fell 13% to $1.01 per share, falling short of views for $1.07 a share. Revenue shot up 117% to $5.37 billion, thanks to the company’s Family Dollar takeover, but still missed estimates for $5.41 billion.For the year, the company guided for $3.35-$3.65 a share in earnings, below forecasts for $3.76 a share. The midpoint of targeted revenue of $20.76 billion-$21.11 billion is a hair above current estimates for $20.93 billion.Dollar Tree shares closed up 2.2%.

463,TGT,"Just because you're looking at a nice base structure, doesn't mean you can't look at getting a nice dividend too.Paychex (PAYX) has been forming a shallow cup base for the last three months. The weekly chart shows some volume spikes on the downside and lower volume on the right-hand side of its base. However, the Accumulation/Distribution Rating has improved to a B and the up/down volume has improved to 1.0 in the last few weeks. The stock only gave up 16% and held fairly tight at its lows, refusing to give up more ground.The company gets the bulk of its revenue from providing payroll services to small- and medium-sized businesses. With fewer employees, smaller businesses often find it more cost-effective to outsource their payroll and other human resource functions. Paychex has a steady three-year annual earnings growth rate of 8% with an Earnings Stability Factor of 1, where the lower number reflects less volatility in earnings. They have an excellent Composite Rating of 96 with stellar return-on-equity of 38%, no debt, and a dividend yield of 3.2%.Lockheed Martin (LMT) is forming a base that is even more shallow with a depth of 12%, qualifying it as a flat base. Two glaring negatives: the Accumulation/Distribution Rating is a D and the up/down volume is at 0.7. The defense company gets 78% of its revenue from the U.S. government, and could benefit from a budget compromise in October that increased the Pentagon's budget over the next two years.The dividend yield for Lockheed Martin is 3.0% and the dividend growth rate is 19%, a big plus for income investors. The company has reported steady growth in earnings with a three-year annual growth rate of 11% and an Earnings Stability Factor of 3.Target (TGT) just reported earnings this week and rose despite missing estimates. That puts the stock firmly on the right-hand side of a 35-week consolidation. The retail giant saw a big move in its Accumulation/Distribution Rating going from a D- last week to a B this week, largely due to big volume on a 4% gain Wednesday. The dividend yield is 2.8% and the dividend growth rate is 26%.Image provided by Shutterstock.

Urban Outfitters ended Tuesday 11% below a 34.87 buy point in a four-month cup base.Home improvement retailer Lowe's (LOW) gapped down at the open and dropped 5% to 77.16, as its second-quarter sales and earnings stopped short of consensus views. Management also lowered its full-year earnings guidance, but the new figure remained above the consensus target.Target (TGT) also lost 6% to 70.95 after the retail major lowered its third-quarter and full-year earnings guidance to below consensus expectations. Second-quarter earnings rose 1%, topping estimates, while revenue slipped 7% -- in line with analysts' projection.Kids' clothing retailer Children's Place (PLCE) swung up nearly 4% to 89.01 after a 1% bottom-line loss and a 1% revenue gain easily topped analysts' forecasts. The stock ended Tuesday in a buy range above an 85.01 buy point.Other retail stocks on the move after earnings reports included American Eagle (AEO), down 6%, and Staples (SPLS), which slipped 5%. Wal-Mart (WMT), which plans to report its second-quarter results early Thursday, also dropped hard but cut its opening loss to less than 0.5%.Among IBD 50 stocks, China's Yirendai (YRD) rallied nearly 8% to 36. The move signals continued volatility for the online consumer finance site, which staged a sharp reversal from new highs in heavy volume on Tuesday.Uniform service Cintas (CTAS) scaled up 1% after receiving upgrades from Robert Baird and Barclays. The stock is extended after stair-stepping up above a 95.20 buy point cleared in late June.Overseas, Tokyo's Nikkei 225 was one of the few international markets to post a gain Wednesday, rising 0.9%. Markets in Shanghai and Hong Kong booked mild losses. In Europe, Frankfurt's DAX was down 1%, the CAC 40 in Paris was 0.6% lower, and London's FTSE 100 was off 0.4% in early afternoon action.

466,TGT,"Home improvement chain Lowe's (LOW) and discount giant Target (TGT) reported second-quarter earnings Wednesday morning. Both disappointed investors.Estimates: Q2 EPS up 18% to $1.42 on a 6.3% rise in sales to $18.45 billion.Prior Quarter: Q1 EPS up 24% to 87 cents on revenue up 7.8% to $15.234 billion.Results: Q2 EPS was $1.37, while sales rose 5.3% to $18.26 billion. Both numbers missed views. Same-store sales rose 2%, about half of the 4.1% gain analysts had expected.Lowe's also cut its full-year earnings forecast.Stock: Lowe's tumbled 5.5% to 77 soon after the opening bell on the stock market today. That put it below a recent entry point of 80.86 cleared last month. Lowe's had been consolidating and possibly setting up another buy point.Why It Matters: Home improvement stores have been holding up due to housing and remodeling demand, despite a general retail malaise, so Lowe's report is worrisome. On Tuesday, larger rival Home Depot (HD) reported in-line EPS growth and sales that just fell short of views, but it said housing remains a ""tailwind.""Also Tuesday, the housing starts report for July showed builders broke ground on more homes than expected last month, with a 2.1% rise to an annual rate of 1.21 million. Still, starts remain far below the 2-million-plus levels in the years before the crash.Home Depot stock fell 0.2% early Wednesday. On Tuesday, shares briefly hit a buy point before closing down 0.6%.Estimates: EPS down 8% to $1.12 on a 7% decline in revenue to $16.18 billion.Prior Quarter: EPS up 17% to $1.29, while sales fell 1% to $21.626 billion.Results: EPS was $1.23 a share excluding items, topping views. Sales fell about 7% to $16.17 billion, a touch light. Same-store sales fell 1.1%, a bit more than forecasts for a 1% drop.But, amid growing competition from Amazon (AMZN) and weaker demand for apparel and electronics, Target cut guidance. It now sees full-year EPS of $4.80-$5.20, down from $5.20-$5.40, with same-store sales flat to down 2% in the second of the year.Stock: Target tumbled 5.9% to 71 early Wednesday, falling back below the 200-day line after finding support there.Why It Matters: Along with Wal-Mart (WMT), the big-box retailer offered promotions last month to coincide with Amazon Prime Day. But overall retail sales for July were flat despite the e-commerce giant's blowout event -- highlighting the sluggish state of the retail sector and continued pressure on brick-and-mortar stores.Target's weakness could turn sentiment against retail. Keep in mind that despite the investor euphoria surrounding last week's department store earnings, actual demand at Macy's (M) and other rivals isn't great, just better than feared.Wal-Mart, the world's largest retailer, reports earnings Thursday. Wal-Mart fell 0.4% soon after the opening bell, just below the 50-day line.

468,TGT,"Thanks to Amazon (AMZN), brick-and-mortar stores are pumping big bucks into e-commerce capabilities.""Whether our guest is shopping in-store or online, it starts digitally,"" said Target (TGT) CEO Brian Cornell during the earnings call on Wednesday.Target is investing in services like online-order pickup and self-checkout lanes to attract more customers. Comparable digital sales grew 23% in Q1. But Target still ""has work to do"" in making that online experience better, said Cowen.And Wal-Mart (WMT) is playing catch-up, as it tests two-day shipping -- likely to better compete with Amazon Prime.Online sales growth and gross merchandise volume growth in Q1 were ""too slow,"" said Wal-Mart CEO Doug McMillon.The big-box retailer topped estimates, making investors happy, but e-commerce sales decelerated to 7% growth during the quarter. By contrast, Amazon's sales rose 28% in Q1.""We can see progress against several of the necessary capabilities we need to win in e-commerce but we're still working on a few others. We need them all to come together to see stronger growth,"" said McMillon.But Amazon is coming for apparel next -- and soon, grocery.""We believe AMZN's focus on apparel represents a greater threat to WMT and TGT than any other retailer given their overlap,"" wrote Morgan Stanley just a week earlier.

469,TGT,"Wednesday was shaping up to be a solid session for the stock market, that is, until the minutes from the late-April Fed meeting were released at 2 p.m. ET.The minutes showed that committee members weren't averse to a rate hike in June if economic data continues to be strong. At the start of the week, the odds of a rate hike at the June meeting, according to CME Group FedWatch, were 4%. Now they're at 34%. The 10-year Treasury yield spiked on the news, rising 10 basis points to 1.87%.The Nasdaq halved a 1% intraday gain, rising 0.5%. The Dow Jones industrial average and S&P 500 were mostly unchanged.Preliminary data showed volume on the Nasdaq coming in slightly higher than Tuesday's levels. NYSE volume fell. On the NYSE, declining stocks outnumbered advancers by more than 2-to-1. It was the other way around on the Nasdaq, with winners topping losers by a small margin.After the close, Salesforce.com (CRM) jumped  5.5% in after-hours trading after the enterprise software maker reported strong earnings. Tesla (TSLA) was under pressure, though, on news of a share offering. Shares of Tesla jumped 3% in the regular session after Goldman Sachs upgraded shares to buy from neutral, citing valuation.In the stock market today, financials outperformed on growing expectations for a Fed rate hike. In the ETF space, SPDR S&P Bank (KBE) and SPDR S&P Regional Banking (KRE) outperformed, rising around 4% each, but both are still trading near their 200-day moving average lines after getting resistance there last month.Retailer Lowe's (LOW) cleared a base in heavy volume, rising 3%, after reporting strong earnings before the open. Lowe's price action was much different than Home Depot's (HD), which slumped 2.5% Tuesday on similarly strong results.But the news wasn't so good at Target (TGT). Shares gapped down and lost 8%. A bigger-than-expected 5% decline in fiscal Q1 sales trumped a better-than-expected 17% increase in profit.

470,TGT,"A major expansion by Amazon.com (AMZN) into private-label goods, which could come this month, elevates its ability to further challenge legacy retailers across the board.Cowen analyst John Blackledge estimates Amazon will be the No. 2 player in the $425 billion consumable market, excluding food and beverage, surpassing Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA), CVS Health (CVS) and Target (TGT) but still lagging well behind market leader Wal-Mart (WMT).He defines consumables as four segments: personal care products, household products, baby products and pet products.Blackledge also estimates Amazon will be a top-10 player in the $785 billion food and beverage grocery market by 2019.“We are encouraged by Amazon’s growing footprint in this category, which we see as ripe for potential disruption, given younger demos increasingly purchasing grocery items via digital channels,” Blackledge wrote.The leader in the food and beverage category is Wal-Mart, followed by Kroger (KR), Albertsons/Safeway and Costco Wholesale (COST).Last week, the Wall Street Journal cited people familiar with the matter as saying Amazon is set in the coming weeks to roll out new lines of private-label brands that will include its first broad push into perishable foods.According to the Private Label Manufacturers Association, sales of private-label store brands in the U.S. topped $118 billion in 2015, with supermarkets and drug chains accounting for over $70 billion of the total.In the grocery and consumables market, Blackledge says, Amazon’s growth has come at the expense of Wal-Mart, Target. Walgreens and CVS. Amazon’s key competitive advantage is its multiplatform approach with Amazon Prime, which includes same-day delivery for many goods, “all of which should lead to rising number of consumers skipping the trip to the local supercenter, drug store or grocery market,” he wrote.Amazon has sold private-label products since 2009, primarily under the AmazonBasics brand, though that effort has concentrated largely on consumer electronics.Amazon stock rose 0.6% to 702.80 in the stock market today. Amazon stock hit an all-time high of 722.45 on May 12. It carries a strong IBD Composite Rating of 94, putting it among the top 6% of all stocks on key metrics such as revenue growth.Walgreens climbed 1.3% but CVS fell 1.5%. Target climbed 2.4%. Wal-Mart advanced 1%, hitting a nine-month high intraday, after spiking nearly 10% Thursday on strong earnings and same-store sales.

471,TGT,"PayPal (PYPL) shares fell Thursday, after the digital payments giant's investor day showcased ambitious plans but failed to alleviate Wall Street's fears of competition.Management emphasized the breadth of the platform, covering not only the traditional online payment capability but newer technologies at point of sale, ATMs, social media and customized applications for merchants. Executives hope to entice consumers to put more of their spending through PayPal by offering budgeting and money-management capabilities, while enticing merchants with the PayPal Credit offering.The OneTouch payment app has also taken off as a response to the increasing number of purchases made over mobile phones. Management also discussed the rise of ""contextual commerce,"" the trend toward technologies predicting consumer buying habits and bringing products to the consumer rather than the consumer going out and seeking them.Repeatedly, they pointed to the sheer size of PayPal's network, after 17 years of existence, as bringing a key advantage over competing platforms in penetrating these new markets. However, Pacific Crest analyst Josh Beck wasn't so sure.""PayPal highlighted a dramatic shift in commerce, underscored by diverging performance at Target (TGT) and Amazon (AMZN), which creates opportunity and risk,"" Beck wrote in a research note. ""Whether PayPal will be able to retain its competitive moat as Apple (AAPL), Amazon, Stripe and Visa (V) focus on mobile and contextual commerce remains unclear to us.""Beck retained a sector weight rating on PayPal stock.Management affirmed previous financial guidance, including that profit margins will be ""stable to up."" Pretax margins took a definite hit last year as the company has invested in new projects, such as the recently acquired financial-remittance company Xoom.""While we believe management did an exceptional job explaining Paypal’s differentiation (serving both consumers and merchants; expanding relevance by providing solutions from Braintree, Paydiant, PayPal, Xoom and Credit), an intensifying competitive landscape, combined with the company’s margin outlook remain our biggest concerns,"" wrote Sterne Agee CRT analyst Moshe Katri in a research note affirming his neutral rating.Credit Suisse analyst Paul Condra, who holds a buy rating on the stock, emphasized the positive.""Our conviction on the stock was strengthened from (1) commentary that the credit business is not more than high single digits percent of profit (well below speculation of around 25%) and will likely not grow beyond 2% to 3% of payment volume; and (2) increased visibility on growth outlook as management expects to double payment volume in four years, implying 20% total payment volume growth through 2019,"" Condra wrote.PayPal stock fell 3.4% to 37.65 on the stock market today. It was seventh straight decline for the stock, which is now below entry points at 40.03 and 38.62.Apple stock fell 0.4% Thursday, while Visa dipped 0.7% and Amazon climbed 0.15%.RELATED: Apple Pay Rival MCX, Visa Loom At PayPal Analyst Day

472,TGT,"Wal-Mart (WMT) on Thursday reported much-better-than-expected first-quarter earnings and higher U.S. same-store sales. It's a positive sign for the retail sector after disappointing results or outlooks from the likes of Target (TGT), Macy's (M) and Kohl's (KSS) in the face of sluggish economic growth, rising labor costs and competition with Amazon (AMZN).Wal-Mart shares spiked 9.6% to 69.20 on the stock market today, its best day in more than 7 years and gapping above its 200-day and 50-day moving averages. Wal-Mart fell 3% on Wednesday, falling below its 200-day moving average, after Target reported weaker-than-expected sales and guidance. Target itself fell 7.6% Wednesday, hitting its lowest intraday level since late 2014. Target fell more than 1% intraday Thursday.Wal-Mart, the world's largest retailer, reported fiscal Q1 profit of 98 cents a share, beating estimates by 10 cents but down from $1.03 a year earlier. Sales rose 0.9% to $115.90 billion vs. analysts' forecast for a drop to $113.22 billion.U.S. same-store sales climbed 1%, double Wall Street targets. It was the seventh straight quarter of higher domestic comps.As for the current Q2, Wal-Mart expects to earn 95 cents to $1.08 per share, with the $1.015 midpoint above estimates for 98 cents. The discount giant expects U.S. comps to rise about 1%.""There is momentum in many parts of the business,"" CFO Brett Biggs said in a statement.Wal-Mart reiterated its full-year EPS forecast for a 6%-12% decline.One negative note: E-commerce sales rose just 7% vs. a year earlier, decelerating vs.prior quarters. Amazon, meanwhile, reported 28% sales growth in Q1, its best gain in nearly four years.Wal-Mart last week announced that it would offer two-day free shipping with its subscription service, down from three days. It also cut the annual fee by $1 to $49. Wal-Mart is taking aim at Amazon Prime, which costs $99 a year but also offers video streaming.Operating expenses continue to climb, rising 107 basis points vs. a year earlier. Wal-Mart has been raising pay to try to attract and retain better workers.After the market close, off-price retailer Ross Stores (ROST) reported in-line earnings but revenue and guidance were light. Ross Stores fell 6.5% in early after-hours action following a 2.2% regular-session gain.Apparel store giant Gap (GPS) also will report earnings tonight. Gap has already disclosed weak first-quarter same-store sales. Shares closed the regular session up 1.2%.
"
473,TGT,"After shoring up its position in the hotly competitive discount arena by acquiring a larger rival last year, Dollar Tree faces the task of turning its newly acquired muscle into bigger sales and profits.If it is to be successful, Dollar Tree (DLTR), now the biggest U.S. discount chain, needs to get a better performance from its Family Dollar Store outlets, which were struggling prior to the merger.Wall Street is tentative on Dollar Tree's prospects.""There are some natural synergies that came out of the deal with regard to buying and some expenses,"" Piper Jaffray analyst Peter Keith told Investor's Business Daily. ""But the jury is still out on whether Dollar Tree can drive material improvement at the Family Dollar business. At this point, I believe what investors will want to see is better sales productivity from Family Dollar stores, which should in turn drive improved operating margins and overall profitability.""Dollar Tree closed on the purchase of Family Dollar Stores July 6 after a heated takeover battle with rival deep discounter Dollar General (DG). It paid $6.8 billion in cash and 28.5 million shares of the company’s stock valued at $2.3 billion.Prior to the merger, Dollar Tree enjoyed a long-running streak of double-digit quarterly profit. The merger has the potential for synergies and productivity gains, and could enable Dollar Tree to serve a broader range of customers, tap new markets and enhance market share in existing ones while enhancing the company’s financial performance and improving its growth prospects, the company said at the time of the buy.“The draw (for investors) is the opportunity the company has to dramatically improve the earnings power of the Family Dollar segment,” Northcoast Research analyst Nicholas Mitchell told IBD.But the integration and turnaround processes present challenges, say followers. While analysts praise Dollar Tree management’s capabilities, opinions are mixed on the extent to which Dollar Tree will achieve its objectives.“I think Dollar Tree is a very successful retailer and they're very good operators,” Stifel analyst Taylor LaBarr told IBD. “But it was a big step acquiring a company that was bigger than they are, with even more employees, more distribution centers and more stores. It is a big acquisition and integration task for any situation, but they’re also trying to fix and turn around a struggling retailer. So we really like the core Dollar Tree business, but it’s going to be a tough integration.”Dollar Tree’s stock price rose 9.7% last year, though it’s been up and down so far this year. Its stock price has also soared 44% since the retailer announced its intent to buy Family Dollar on July 28, 2014.Dollar Tree operated 13,851 stores across 48 states and five Canadian provinces as of Jan. 30. Stores operate under the brands of Dollar Tree, Family Dollar, Dollar Tree Canada and Deals. It expects to have 217 of the 222 Deals stores converted to the Dollar Tree brand and five to Family Dollar brands by July. Dollar Tree converted 52 Deals stores to Dollar Tree stores in January.Dollar Tree operates fixed-price point stores, selling everything for $1 or less, while Family Dollar operates multiprice point stores, selling the majority of its products at $10 or less.Post merger, Dollar Tree faces new rivals.When it acquired Family Dollar, Dollar Tree gained more direct competition with Dollar General, convenience stores, the front end of drug stores, and to some degree giant discounters Wal-Mart Stores (WMT) and Target (TGT), says analyst Mitchell.“The acquisition made the business more complicated and levered up the balance sheet,” Mitchell said. “It used to be a very uncomplicated investment story that investors felt comfortable buying with the intention of holding the shares as a core position. These guys were so good at merchandising and real estate site selection that the cash flow could efficiently be reinvested in the business with expectations of earning a high return on the incremental capital.”Mitchell went on to say: “After it acquired Family Dollar, the story went from being a very clean investment story with very good unit economics and a strong competitive advantage to a story that's half the same and the other half a turnaround story. I would imagine that it has probably been a little more challenging than (management) thought it would be at the start, but they are making good progress cleaning up many of the underlying problems they inherited.”On the plus side, Dollar Tree has turned out two straight quarters of positive same-store sales for Family Dollar, which is a nice improvement, Mitchell says. It’s also cleaned up the Family Dollar stores, strengthened the end-of-the-aisle displays and improved the “in-stock” position in these stores, he says.“It’s going to take time to get the consumer back,” he added. “There’s a lot of work ahead that needs to be done. The final verdict on whether this was a smart move will be a function of execution in the next 12 to 18 months.”In the fiscal 2015 fourth quarter, which ended Jan. 30, Dollar Tree’s adjusted earnings fell 13% to $1.01 per share. Revenue surged 117% to $5.37 billion, boosted by $2.68 billion in sales from the Family Dollar segment. Family Dollar stores saw a low single-digit rise in same-store sales, driven by growth in both traffic and the average ticket.In a note to clients on Dollar Tree’s fourth-quarter results, UBS analyst Michael Lasser was upbeat about the company's prospects.“After parsing back the one-time items, (Dollar Tree) put together another solid (quarter) that puts it on pace to substantially grow its earnings over time,” he wrote.He notes that the company has now seen growth in same-store sales in each of the last seven months.“Its traffic is accelerating, and improvements are being made,” he added. “This provides a more stable base from which its (same-store sales) can accelerate.”

476,TGT,"Teens and tweens love shopping, and a weekly allowance stretches far at Five Below (FIVE).With its ever-rotating trendy offerings, the rapidly expanding store chain is a haven for the adolescent set. There are shelves of cell-phone accessories, toys, fashions, sports gear, candy and seasonal items -- all for just $5 and below.To the average adult, it may sound like a pubescent-laced nightmare. But there's serious money behind catering to one of the more free-spending demographics out there.Dan Binder, an analyst with Jefferies, says he’s had a buy rating on the stock since its initial public offering in July 2012.“I like the story; I like the store concept,” Binder told IBD. “Most importantly my teenage girls like it too. I will regularly offer them the opportunity to go to movies or to go to Five Below. They usually pick Five Below.”And for those who would gladly leave the shopping at Five Below to their kids, consider this: It currently has 437 outlets in 27 states and has opened 70 of those in 2015 alone.""We’ve had a great year,” Chief Executive Joel Anderson said on a January 2016 conference call. The company says it will grow even faster in 2016, adding roughly 85 stores.Anderson says the company is growing using four strategies: opening new stores and new markets; smart merchandising; increased digital marketing and brand awareness; and building infrastructure and systems that scale. He says the company is now spending “2.5% to 3% of sales” on marketing.""We want to grow to 2,000 or so stores in the U.S.,” he said. “This concept is pretty simple. We think about it as '1/10/100,' less than a one-year payback (on investment in a store), 10 years of consistent comparable store growth, and 100% of our stores are profitable.”Net income for the company’s third quarter, ended Oct. 31, rose a hefty 30% to $4.3 million from $3.3 million. Diluted earnings per share rose 33% to 8 cents from 6 cents in the year-earlier quarter.In the third quarter of 2015, Five Below reported a rise in net sales of $31.7 million or 23% to $169.7 million from $138 million in Q3 2014. Comparable or same-store sales for the period increased 4.8%, the company said.On Jan. 7, 2016, Five Below reported net sales for the nine-week period ended Jan. 2, including the holiday season, rose 24% to $286.1 million from $230.7 million in the comparable nine-week period of 2014. It also said that same-store sales for the nine-week period were up 4.1% year over year.And Five Below also said its outlook for the full fourth quarter, with final results out by the end of this month, calls for net sales of $323 million to $326 million and earnings per share of 75 to 76 cents for the quarter. Zacks puts earnings per share for the company’s fourth quarter at 76 cents.Analysts are smitten with the company’s rapid growth, market positioning and its ability to make its new stores pay.“The payback on new stores is the shortest I’ve ever seen in retail -- they have been paying back their investment in under a year,” Matt Nemer, analyst with Wells Fargo Securities in San Francisco, told IBD.Nemer has an outperform rating on the company’s stock. He notes that growing and opening stores at this rapid a pace could be cause for concern.“What mitigates that is a pretty simple store concept, and then they cluster the openings,” Nemer said. By doing that, the company is able to “focus on that market, and leverage its advertising and marketing.”Analyst Binder from Jefferies also notes that the company has been smart about how it’s building out its network of stores: “They’re keeping it pretty tight; they’re not trying to build in California when they’re still trying to fill out in the East.”Five Below’s share price has had an up and down ride over the past 12 months. It hit a 52-week intraday high on June 23 of 41.47 per share. But it tumbled all the way down to close at 27.50 on Nov. 17, due to worries about retailer Christmas sales. Since then, the price has been climbing -- even in a tough market -- and it’s now trading around 39 a share.Like other retailers, Five Below has also been clever about finding what it calls “wow” items. At Christmas, it sold a remote control helicopter for just $5, which drove a lot of traffic to its stores, analysts said. These items keep tweens and teens coming back to hunt for treasures that usually sell out quickly.In January 2015, CEO Anderson brought in Michael Romanko as executive vice president of merchandising. Nemer says that Romanko has improved the merchandise Five Below sells by bringing in more fitness and electronics products and other products he considers compelling.Binder says the company doesn’t really have a direct competitor, but rather has several rivals, from Walmart (WMT) to Target (TGT) for some goods, and Dick’s Sporting Goods (DKS) for sports gear.But he said Five Below is “deep value.” And unlike dollar stores such as Dollar General (DG) or Dollar Tree (DLTR), Five Below doesn't offer food or household items.“Without a doubt, merchandising to teens is their sweet spot,” he said.A year ago, Anderson said the company was focused on “outlining its digital marketing campaign with TV, email, social media and mobile” all being pieces of it.Anderson understands that his core customers, “teens and tweens,” are “living online.”But Five Below is using its online marketing to drive retail store sales. Analysts say that at its product price point of $5 and less, the company doesn’t have to worry about competition from online retailers.“Five Below’s product prices are so low it would be very difficult to make money shipping them to someone’s home,” said Nemer.Five Below’s puny prices also give the stores the ability to “do well in a strong or a weak economy” when customers have less money to spend, noted Nemer.

477,TGT,"Smartwatches surpassed Swiss watches in unit shipments for the first time in the fourth quarter, according to research firm Strategy Analytics.Global smartwatch shipments reached 8.1 million units in the December quarter, compared with 7.9 million Swiss watch shipments, Strategy Analytics reported Thursday.Shipments of smartwatches, led by the Apple (AAPL) Watch, surged 316% from 1.9 million in Q4 2014. Meanwhile shipments of Swiss watches fell 5% from 8.3 million in Q4 2014, the research firm said.“Global demand for Swiss watches is slowing down, and major players like Swatch (SWGAY) are struggling to find growth,” Strategy Analytics analyst Steven Waltzer said in a statement.Strategy Analytics Executive Director Neil Mawston concurred.“The Swiss watch industry has been very slow to react to the development of smartwatches,” Mawston said in a statement. “The Swiss watch industry has been sticking its head in the sand and hoping smartwatches will go away. Swiss brands, like Tag Heuer, accounted for a tiny 1% of all smartwatches shipped globally during Q4 2015, and they are long way behind Apple, Samsung and other leaders in the high-growth smartwatch category.”Smartwatches are growing rapidly in North America, Western Europe and Asia, the research firm said.Apple Watch captured 63% of the global smartwatch market in the fourth quarter, followed by Samsung with 16%.“Apple and Samsung together account for a commanding eight in 10 of all smartwatches shipped worldwide,” Strategy Analytics analyst Cliff Raskind said in a press release.Wall Street analysts estimate that Apple sold 4.9 million units of Apple Watch in the December quarter. Strategy Analytics estimates that Apple shipped 5.1 million units of Apple Watch in Q4.Apple is expected to unveil new Apple Watch software and wristbands at a media event next month. At the same event, Apple is likely to unveil a new 4-inch iPhone 5SE and iPad Air 3, according to 9to5Mac.It's unknown when Apple will release a second-generation Apple Watch. But some are speculating that it could be soon because retailers are discounting many current Apple Watch models, presumably to clear out older inventory. The Apple Watch is being discounted by $100 at Best Buy (BBY), Target (TGT) and other stores. The entry-level Apple Watch Sport model is selling for $249, 29% off the regular price of $349.Image provided by Shutterstock.

479,TGT,"Stocks maintained solid gains in late morning trade Thursday, led by Macy's (M) and other department stores.The Nasdaq was up 0.4% and the S&P 500 rose 0.5%, while the Dow Jones industrial average climbed 0.6% in the stock market today, hitting a fresh all-time high. Volume was mixed, trading higher than the same time Wednesday on the NYSE, while the Nasdaq was trading lighter.Macy's gapped up 17% after it reported second-quarter earnings of 54 cents a share, a 16% decline from a year earlier but still beating the Wall Street consensus estimate of 48 cents. Sales came in at $5.87 billion, besting estimates of $5.77 billion.The company also announced that it would close 100 stores out of 728, mostly by early 2017, and that it will heighten its brand with exclusive products and will improve the shopping experience, as well as promote its digital business.IBD'S TAKE: Are department store stocks worth the investment? Find out with IBD's Stock Checkup.Department store stocks have been laggards in recent years as consumers turned to online purchasing, and all the stocks are well off their highs.Macy's earnings beat was infectious: Nordstrom (JWN), JCPenney (JCP) and Target (TGT) were all higher, even though they haven't reported yet.Nordstrom reports after the close Thursday. Analysts expect 56 cents a share, a 40% decline from a year earlier. Penney reports Friday morning, and Target reports Wednesday.The department store group was one of the day's best performers out of 197 indusries, with a gain of 9%. Several other retail and consumer groups rose sharply.Alibaba (BABA), which gapped out of a consolidation Wednesday, jumped another 5% Thursday after reporting better-than-expected earnings of its own.

480,TGT,"The median salary for a cybersecurity job is 2.7 times that of average wages in Australia, France, Germany, Israel, Japan, the U.K. and the U.S., yet 82% of organizations in those countries are experiencing a shortage in skilled cybersecurity workers, chipmaker Intel (INTC) found in a poll by its Intel Security business.More than half (53%) of respondents say the cybersecurity skills shortage is worse than talent deficits in other IT professions.Piper Jaffray analyst Andrew Nowinski agrees. Cybersecurity firms ""can't hire people fast enough,"" he told IBD.A major challenge is that cybersecurity jobs require much more than a degree and applicable coding abilities, says Candace Worley, vice president of enterprise solutions marketing for Intel Security. Some of the best cybersecurity workers, she says, have hacking backgrounds, a skill with a questionable reputation in the industry. But it's a skill she calls crucial.IBD'S TAKE: Most stocks make their biggest gains fairly early in their publicly-traded lives, so IBD's IPO Leaders list is worth tracking. Security firm CyberArk Software is on the current list, making its IPO in September 2014 at $16 a share and now trading near 55.""Computer science and math degrees provide a certain intellectual skill set, but (they) don't necessarily hone the hunting and detective skills required for this industry,"" Worley told IBD. ""Coding, incident response ... there are a lot of skills required to play in the cybersecurity space.""Over the course of May, Intel Security teamed up with market research specialist Vanson Bourne to survey security staff at 775 companies and other organizations of 500-plus employees, in eight countries.Some jobs are especially hard to fill, Worley said. Jobs in intrusion detection, attack mitigation and software development -- creating software that is less susceptible to hacking -- are the ones that most often go begging, she says. Those skills are rarer than less-technical abilities like communications and management.To that point, Intel Security noted the highest technical security job last year in the U.S. paid $233,333 annually. That's $8,000 more than most chief information security officers (CISOs) make, according to job tracker Dice.Last year, the U.S. left 209,000 unfilled security jobs on the table, Intel said, citing a Peninsula Press analysis of U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data. That's about $41.8 billion in unpaid salaries, assuming a $200,000 average wage for each position. Nearly three-quarters of respondents (71%) say the shortage in skills left their organizations vulnerable to attack.The trend is continuing this year, but perhaps at a slower pace, according to Piper Jaffray's Nowinski. In June, there were 2,843 unfilled jobs at 13 cybersecurity firms in the U.S., according to job-postings information examined by Piper Jaffray. At, say, $200,000 a head, that's roughly $570 million in unfilled salaries. Among those with the most total open positions were KEYW Corp. (KEYW) (658), Fortinet (FTNT) (459) and Symantec (SYMC) (431).Overall, however, the number of unfilled positions at those 13 firms fell 28% in June vs. June 2015, and they fell 25% in May vs. a year earlier. In April, though, the number of unfilled jobs had risen 14%.Nowinski credits the fewer unfilled posts in June and May not just to companies filling slots, but also to some layoffs. Such was likely the case for Symantec. It had 71% fewer technical job openings this June vs. June 2015, but in May it announced 1,200 layoffs.""Cybersecurity firms can't hire people fast enough,"" he said.Networking companies such as Brocade Communications (BRCD), Cisco Systems (CSCO) and Juniper Networks (JNPR) can fill technical jobs more easily because the required skills are similar, Nowinski says. ""But (jobs at) Fortinet, Palo Alto Networks (PANW) (and) Check Point Software Technologies (CHKP) are all vastly different,"" requiring multiple specialists, he said.Organizations aren't all on the same page in terms of hiring practices, says Intel's Worley. The lion's share of respondents (68%) to the survey say hands-on experience is critical to developing cybersecurity skills. And though more than half require at least a bachelor's degree, 23% say education isn't properly preparing students.There is a lack of master's programs for cybersecurity, says Tim Ashford, IT director for Ashford Capital Management, an independent research and analysis firm. Ashford is working toward his master's of science in information security engineering with the SANS Institute.The SANS Institute provides cybersecurity training for more than 165,000 security professionals worldwide, and it offers two cybersecurity master's programs. Two summers ago, Ashford, a 19-year veteran of the IT industry, began looking for cybersecurity programs.""I hit up websites like MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) and Stanford (University) and saw courses here and there, but as far as programs for preparing people with hacking techniques, managed qualitative skills, I saw next to none of that,"" he told IBD.In December 2014, the SANS Institute had just six graduates of its program, Ashford says. But breaches like those of Target (TGT), Home Depot (HD) and LinkedIn (LNKD), dating back to 2013, have spiked interest, he says. Like Worley, he says there's a need for cybersecurity professionals who can ""break stuff.""Also like Worley, Ashford cites a need to reach younger minds.""You've got to find a way to get kids to think about cyber,"" Ashford said. ""It's part deconstruction, breaking things down. But there's always a delicate risk with kids. Let's teach them how to break stuff, but also educate them on the heart and soul of cybersecurity.""Workers at cybersecurity companies such as Palo Alto Networks, Check Point and Fortinet try to hunt down the origins of a breach, close it and then remedy the potential fallout.""That takes ability to deduct, it takes problem-solving, and it takes logic,"" Worley said. ""We're unlikely to see a decline in hacking and malware, so we're seeing the industry work with high schools and universities to build the curriculum.""Government also has a role to play. But 76% of respondents say their governments aren't investing enough in cybersecurity talent, and the same percentage say the laws and regulations surrounding security infrastructure in their nations are insufficient.In the U.S., Obama has pledged $19 billion for fiscal 2017, which starts Oct. 1, to bolster the government's aging security infrastructure. That could boost spending, but Piper Jaffray's Nowinski says that won't necessarily produce more qualified folks to fill cybersecurity jobs.Yet, 9 in 10 respondents say technology can help organizations fill the hole in skilled security workers. More than half (55%) say technology like automation and managed security service offerings will advance sufficiently in five years to meet the majority of a firm's security needs.Worley isn't as bullish on the rapid advance of security automation, but she says the idea is getting greater acceptance. Automation is a relatively nascent tool, relying on supercomputers like IBM's (IBM) Watson to hunt needle-in-the-haystack security abnormalities or automate update deployments.""If you go back a decade, most people were extremely uncomfortable with automation,"" she said. ""But now, and most companies are more tolerant of automation.""Still, she emphasized, ""skills that require significant analysis will continue to require human intervention.""RELATED:

481,TGT,"Even with Amazon (AMZN) Prime Day, retail sales were merely flat in July, with non-auto sales down 0.3%, the Commerce Department said Friday.While July's totals came in well below expectations for an overall 0.4% gain, and a 0.2% rise outside the auto sector, the disappointment was softened by an upward revision to June numbers. The overall gain was revised to 0.8% from 0.6%, with sales outside autos rising 0.9%, up from 0.7%.Still, the year-over-year gain in retail sales slowed to 2.3%, which may slightly ding confidence in the strength of the American consumer. While a 2.7% drop in gas station sales held down July spending, consumers didn't put the money to work elsewhere.Non-store retailers continued to stand out, with sales rising 1.3% on the month and 14.1% on the year. That was surely helped by Amazon's 24-hour sales event for Prime members. Amazon said Prime orders in the U.S. surged 50% from the company's inaugural event in 2015, but it didn't reveal its sales tally.But efforts by Wal-Mart (WMT), Target (TGT) and others to piggyback or cut into Amazon's big day may have fallen flat. General merchandise store sales dipped 0.1%, while department stores saw sales continue to decline, off 0.5% on the month and down 4.0% from a year earlier.Both Macy's (M) and Kohl's (KSS) slightly beat modest revenue expectations on Thursday, while Nordstrom (JWN) saw a much smaller drop in same-store sales than analysts expected. All three companies saw sales drop from a year earlier. JCPenney (JCP), a relative bright spot, said on Friday that same-store sales rose 2.2% from a year before, about as expected.IBD'S TAKE: While the consumer continues to be the main driver of U.S. economic growth, most retailers have underperformed the stock market because the retail sector is overbuilt and online competition is intense. Watch this IBD Video for tips on how to quickly identify and research leading stocks that may be ready to be bought.July is typically a slow month for retail before the back-to-school season kicks in, so it's possible the sales push could lead to an upside surprise. Two unknowns: Will Prime Day sales by Amazon and competitors eat into back-to-school shopping, and how will July sales look on a seasonally adjusted basis? The latter may depend on how much the Commerce Department has adjusted its seasonal models after last year's Prime Day.Building-materials and garden-equipment retailers like Home Depot (HD) saw sales ease 0.5% after an upwardly revised 4.2% surge in June. Home Depot and rival Lowe's (LOW) will report quarterly earnings next week.Sales at food services and drinking places continued to be soft, falling 0.2% after an upwardly revised 0.3% rise in June. The problem cited by McDonald's (MCD) and multiple industry players is that food at home is looking like an unusually good deal relative to the cost of food away from home. On Wednesday, Wendy's (WEN) scaled back same-store sales growth guidance for 2016 from 3% to a range of 1%-2%.

482,TGT,"Just how strong is the U.S. consumer and what did Amazon (AMZN) Prime Day mean for the broad retail sector last month?Those are two big questions going into Friday's retail sales report from the Commerce Department to be released at 8:30 a.m. ET.After a solid 0.6% rise in June, economists expect to see continued momentum, with overall sales rising 0.4% amid an uptick in auto sales from June levels. Yet, thanks partly to lower gas prices, sales excluding autos are expected to rise just 0.1%.But the latest signal on consumer spending offers a hint of possible upside in the retail report. Both Macy's (M) and Kohl's (KSS) slightly beat modest revenue expectations on Thursday when they reported earnings for the quarter ended July. But Macy's and Kohl's did report lower sales vs. a year earlier.A host of retailers, including Wal-Mart (WMT) and Target (TGT), offered bargains and free shipping in the week of Amazon's 24-hour sales event for Prime members. Amazon said Prime orders in the U.S. surged 50% from its inaugural event in 2015, but it didn't reveal its sales tally.IBD'S TAKE: While the consumer continues to be the main driver of U.S. economic growth, most retailers have underperformed the stock market because the retail sector is overbuilt and online competition is intense.

Home Depot and rival Lowe's (LOW) will report quarterly earnings next week.All signs, though, point to continued softness in sales at food services and drinking places after a 0.3% decline in June.

"
484,TGT,"The troubling takeaway from the surprisingly weak May jobs numbers is that the economy is stuck in slow-growth mode for the foreseeable future.While last month's overall gain of 38,000 jobs, including a 25,000 rise in private payrolls, was dragged down temporarily by the labor strike of 35,000 Verizon (VZ) communications workers, the weakness was broad-based. On net, just 51.3% of industries added jobs, the lowest since February 2010, Labor Department data showed.Considering that Verizon likely brought in some temp workers during the now-resolved strike, private payrolls were close to flat in May outside of health care, which added 45,700 jobs last month and just under a half million over the past year.Although there were some pockets of hiring strength, the weak job gains and downward revisions totaling 59,000 to the increases reported in March and April suggest that growth is getting much harder to come by as the economic expansion gets long in the tooth.The slowdown looks like more than a one-month blip: The 155,000 private-sector jobs added over the past two months is the worst stretch since January 2011 -- even assuming that the strike artificially knocked 25,000-35,000 off the total.As markets priced in a slower timetable for Federal Reserve rate hikes, shares of Bank of America (BAC), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Citigroup (C) and Wells Fargo (WFC) sold off hard on the stock market today.Instead of a likely hike in July, markets now see the Fed waiting until November, the CME Group FedWatch tool showed. The 10-year Treasury yield plunged to 1.71%, and the dollar fell 1.5% against other major currencies.One decent bit of news in the employment report is that the trend of firming wages remained intact, as hourly pay rose 0.2% from April and 2.5% from a year ago. That's consistent with anecdotal reports of companies having to pay more to attract or keep good workers, and many finding qualified workers in short supply.Wal-Mart (WMT), Target (TGT), Costco (COST), Panera Bread (PNRA) and Wendy's (WEN) have all said they've raised pay in recent months.The drop in the unemployment rate to 4.7% from 5% in April appears at first to be consistent with a tight labor market. Still, the sudden drop in joblessness, which reflected fewer people in the workforce rather than an increase in employment, should be taken with a grain of salt, given the household survey's higher margin of error.Yet the overriding problem is that employers, who are now paying new employees more, are seeing profit margins pressured and finding that opportunities for profitable growth have narrowed.""The 'disconnect' between weak real GDP growth and strong employment growth seems to be resolving itself as employers are defending profits (and trying to boost productivity) in a soggy environment by managing payroll costs,"" wrote IHS Global Insight economists Nariman Behravesh and Ozlem Yaylaci.The reality portrayed by the weak jobs report got some confirmation from the Institute for Supply Management's survey of non-manufacturing industries, with the index slipping to a 28-month low of 52.9 in May from 55.7 in April -- well below expectations. The employment gauge fell into negative territory, dropping 3.3 points to 49.7, just below the neutral 50 level.A range of other economic data points and industry trends suggest a similar conclusion that the much-anticipated pick-up in growth may not materialize.Analysts think U.S. auto sales are close to peaking, and those views were supported by lower sales in May for General Motors (GM) and Ford (F), even as Autodata reports that incentives have climbed north of $3,000 per vehicle.Construction spending fell a surprising 1.8% in April, more than reversing March's gain. To top off that bad news, the construction sector shed 15,000 jobs in May after losing 5,000 in April. Anirban Basu, chief economist at Associated Builders and Contractors, said that many private developers are concerned by possible overbuilding in commercial, office and lodging markets and sense that ""the current real estate cycle is now in its seventh inning or later.""Wal-Mart closed 154 U.S. stores at the start of the year, and Macy's (M) and other department stores are cutting their square footage as Amazon (AMZN) continues to eat into their business. Even Home Depot (HD), in one of the strongest retail sectors, hasn't added any stores in the U.S. in more than a year.Somehow, the retail sector has seemingly defied gravity when it comes to employment, adding 11,400 jobs last month and 323,000 over the past year. The explanation may be that the workweek has shrunk, since aggregate hours of work in the retail industry are down 0.3% over the past three months.Food services and drinking places added 22,200 jobs in May. But the accommodation sector shed 1,500 jobs, after cutting 2,300 the prior month.Manufacturers cut 18,000 jobs in May. While the sector has stabilized, there's little hope for an upturn, with the dollar still strong and global growth still weak.

489,TGT,"E-commerce leader Amazon.com (AMZN) is on pace to become the No. 1 U.S. apparel retailer next year, investment bank Cowen said Wednesday.Cowen analyst John Blackledge said recent earnings reports by Amazon and Macy's (M) painted a clear picture.“In light of Amazon and Macy’s recent results, we feel more confident that Amazon will displace Macy’s as the No. 1 U.S. apparel retailer by 2017,” Blackledge said in a research report. “Amazon’s Apparel & Accessories business is one of the key drivers of Amazon’s EGM (electronics and general merchandise) segment.”Blackledge first made his prediction about Amazon overtaking Macy's in apparel sales in a report last July.Amazon’s success in the apparel category is being driven by a dramatically larger selection, ramping brand relationships, superior fulfillment and technology innovations.Amazon is growing in the clothing business, while traditional retailers such as Wal-Mart (WMT) and Target (TGT) are in decline, Blackledge said.In the first quarter, the number of Amazon apparel purchasers increased 19% year over year, while apparel buyers at Wal-Mart and Target fell 1% and 5%, respectively, he said.“The longer-term trend also reflects a share shift in apparel purchasers, with Amazon apparel purchaser growth of 28% each quarter (on average) since 2014, while apparel purchasers fell 4% and 3% at Wal-Mart and Target,” he said. “In Q1, Amazon had 15% more apparel purchasers than Wal-Mart (vs. 24% fewer in Q1 2014) and 37% more apparel purchasers than Target (vs. 4% more in Q1 2014).”Macy’s on Tuesday reported soft Q1 sales and slashed its full-year forecast, sending its stock diving to a four-year low Wednesday.The Cincinnati-based company said its first-quarter sales fell 7.4% year over year to $5.77 billion. Analysts on average were looking for $5.93 billion in sales.For 2016, Macy’s now expects same-store sales to fall 3% to 4%, compared with its prior guidance for a 1% decline.Macy’s stock fell 15.2% to 31.38 on the stock market today. Amazon stock rose 1.5% to 713.23.On April 28, Amazon reported its highest sales growth in nearly four years. Its Q1 revenue jumped 28% to $29.1 billion, ahead of the $28 billion view.

490,TGT,"An 11% gap-up gain by Big Lots (BIG) early Friday sealed a strong week for discount and variety chains. Dollar Tree (DLTR) spiked 13% in its own gap-up move Thursday, following its quarterly report. Also on Thursday, Dollar General (DG) rumbled nearly 5% higher in high-volume trade. Five Below (FIVE) and Ollie’s Bargain Outlet (OLLI) caught the updraft, ending the week up…

491,TGT,"Deep-discount variety store chains Dollar Tree (DLTR) and Dollar General (DG) crushed first-quarter earnings estimates amid strong expansion, driving shares up early Thursday.Dollar Tree said Q1 EPS jumped 25% to 89 cents, compared to views for 71 cents. Revenue of $5.09 billion was more than double the same quarter in 2015 on a 2.3% increase in same-store sales and its $8.5 billion purchase of Family Dollar in July, which boosted sales.Dollar Tree shares shot up 12.8% to 88.37, rising above an 83.82 buy point of a flat base to a new all-time high.Revenue was below analysts' consensus of $5.1 billion. Still, Chief Executive Bob Sasser said in a written statement he was generally pleased with the company's performance in ""what continues to be a challenging economic environment.""The company projects second-quarter earnings of 66-72 cents a share and sees $5.03 billion-$5.12 billion revenue. Consensus of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters is for 75 cents earnings per share and $5.1 billion revenue.Meanwhile, rival Dollar General's first-quarter adjusted earnings climbed 23% to $1.03 a share, and revenue grew 7% to $5.27 billion. Wall Street expected 95 cents earnings per share and $5.28 billion revenue.It was the second quarter in row of better-than-expected earnings after the company missed in the prior three quarters last year amid strong competition from Amazon.com (AMZN) and big-box discount chains such as Wal-Mart Stores (WMT) and Target (TGT).For the quarter ended April 29, Dollar General's same-store sales at outlets open more than a year grew 2.2% vs. the same quarter a year earlier, and operating profit rose 16 basis points to 30.6%. The company said it plans to open 900 new stores this year.Dollar General has been forming a flat base with an 87.52 buy point, pushing it close to its all-time high at 87.42 set on April 1. Dollar General shares finished trading up 4.6% to 88.01 in the stock market today.

492,TGT,"Charcoal cleanser. BB creams. The 10-step Korean skin-care regimen.The modern woman's bathroom counter likely looks very different from her grandmother's, and Ulta Beauty (ULTA) knows it. Stocked with both higher-end prestige products and value-focused mass brands, the specialty beauty retailer has carved out a unique space for itself amid offerings from department stores, drugstores and the ever-looming 800-pound gorilla, Amazon (AMZN).While the beauty shopper of yesteryear might have frequented a favorite department store cosmetics counter for all her Estee Lauder (EL) or Lancome supplies, today's consumer doesn't feel as tied to specific brands.""The beauty bag is more diverse -- so there's category loyalty and interest but there is less buying across a single brand range,"" Piper Jaffray analyst Stephanie Wissink told Investor's Business Daily. The average shopper is ""mixing and matching brands more routinely.""As brand loyalty wanes, the rising concept of ""destination loyalty"" may begin to matter more, particularly as a plethora of competitors vie for attention, including not just department stores like Macy's (M) or privately held Saks but drugstores like CVS Health (CVS) and big-box retailers Target (TGT) and Wal-Mart (WMT).Ulta and rival Sephora, owned by Paris-based LVMH (LVMUY) have become the reigning specialty stores in the beauty space. Sephora lines its glossy black-and-white shelves only with prestige brands such as Dior, Nars and Yves Saint Laurent, while Ulta offers a mix.Conventional drugstore brands like Revlon and L'Oreal are featured alongside edgier titles at Ulta, such as Smashbox and Urban Decay. Ulta also offers both a full-service salon in every store and ""brow bars,"" or eyebrow treatment areas, at some of its almost 900 locations.Traditionally, customers who opted for a department store makeover would have to ""go home and try to figure out how she did it,"" said Wissink. But makeup trends once relegated to the service model are now accessible online and via other venues.Now, anyone can simply hop on YouTube and look up, say, a video tutorial from beauty guru Michelle Phan on contouring -- highlighting and shading facial features to the cosmetically challenged -- or head to their local Ulta for a makeup consultation.The sample-friendly ""test-and-trial"" nature of specialty beauty stores -- minus the salesperson pressure -- appeals to shoppers who want to experiment with a new look. Ulta has ""floating artists and salespeople who can talk intelligently about a beauty trend who aren’t (commissioned) to sell you a specific brand,"" said Wissink.""You might be buying a $3.99 compact of glittery eye shadow and a $49 base compact and putting on $7 mascara,"" said Wissink. ""That’s the Ulta way.""Ulta also has a rewards program, offering samples and perks in exchange for shopper loyalty. The Ultamate Rewards program membership has grown to over 18 million members, and those members offer the company precious insights into their shopping habits, including frequency of salon service use, spending patterns, favorite products, and other data.""That’s very valuable information,"" Ulta Beauty Chief Financial Officer Scott Settersten told IBD. ""It helps us position new stores, where we’re going to build those stores -- we like to go where we already have an existing customer base, so it’s very valuable.""In a bid to capture and keep customers, the company has been shifting from discounts and delving into direct email marketing with personalized messaging. Its hold over shoppers is proving to be strong: More than 80% of the company's sales come from loyalty program members, said Chief Executive Mary Dillon in last August's earnings call.Ulta's online sales, while a single-digit fraction of its overall net sales in 2015, has been growing at a 40% to more-than-50% clip every quarter without weighing on same-store sales.""It’s been incredible,"" says RBC Capital markets analyst Brian Tunick of Ulta's e-commerce growth. ""It’s been one of the biggest parts of the story. But at the same time, their store comps have been high single digits as well. In retail today, there’s not a lot of companies that are showing positive store traffic.""In the fourth quarter, reported on March 10, Ulta's e-commerce sales leapt 44.2%, while retail-only comps rose 10.4%. And the company's per-share profit climbed 25% to $1.69 on 21% revenue growth to $1.27 billion, both beating consensus estimates. Ulta also announced an accelerated share buyback program.Ulta shares continue to float in buy range after breaking out of a period of consolidation on March 11, gapping up past the key 50-day and 200-day levels.Following the results, a bevy of analysts upped their price targets, including those from Piper Jaffray, Nomura, RBC and Jefferies, though concern over the stock's apparently full valuation lingered.""We continue to like the strength of the business model, ULTA's unique market positioning and future growth prospects,"" wrote Jefferies' Randal Konik in March. ""However, we believe valuation already prices in these positives.""Nomura analyst Simeon Siegel called out the company's accelerating comps amid share gains in low- to -mid-tier markets. ""We continue to expect that with minimal mall and (e-commerce) penetration, ULTA remains isolated from the main issues facing retail as the company’s self-help initiatives drive ongoing top- and bottom-line growth,"" Siegel wrote in a note to clients last month.Any talk of e-commerce typically leads to talk of mega-retailer Amazon. But even after the online one-stop shop and known brick-and-mortar killer set up its own storefront in 2013, Amazon Beauty, the beauty space has not been subject to as much disruption as some initially feared.A mild assortment of higher-end brands means the e-commerce giant is still at a disadvantage to specialty players when it comes to the top-shelf stuff. And while one might think that Amazon would be a perfect place to conveniently restock supplies, most cosmetics and skin care shoppers actually like being in stores to play with samples and try out new makeup techniques.That appeals to Ulta's core customer, the ""beauty enthusiast and beauty enthusiast on a budget,"" says the company's Settersten.""(They're) not so prone to this replenishment concept, so when you think about our e-commerce business it’s not people just necessarily price shopping or looking for convenience,"" he said.Plus, consumers can't exactly get a haircut over the internet.""(Ulta is a place to) have your hair done, your nails done, your eyebrows waxed,"" said RBC's Tunick. ""That’s what’s unique here.""

493,TGT,"McKessson (MCK) announced up to $330 million in costs for restructuring, including layoffs, amid a consolidation wave led by Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) and CVS Health (CVS).McKesson said in a regulatory filing Friday that its restructuring will result in a $300 million to $330 million charge this year, mostly for severance and employee-related costs. The company expects the cost alignment to save about $170 million-$190 million in the coming fiscal year starting April 1, and about $70 million-$80 million the following year.The Dallas Morning News said Wednesday that McKesson will lay off approximately 1,600 people, or 4% of its workforce, as it consolidates offices in Irving, Texas. Earlier this month, McKesson also agreed to buy Canadian drug store operator Rexall for $1.9 billion.In January, McKesson cut its fiscal 2016 earnings outlook and sees next year’s EPS getting hit by 85 cents, citing weak generic drug prices and ""recent customer consolidation.""Last year, Rite Aid (RAD), with which McKesson has a distribution deal, agreed to be acquired by Walgreens Boots Alliance.Other upcoming headwinds include the end of a contract with UnitedHealth's (UNH) OptumRx health-services unit and the transitions of contracts with Ommicare and Target's (TGT) pharmacy business, which were bought by CVS.McKesson stock had been a steady performer for years, reaching an intraday high of 243.61 on May 19, 2015, before faltering. It's lost 35% of its value since then but rose 4.4% on the stock market today.Walgreens Boots Alliance closed up 0.8% on Friday. Rite Aid edged down 0.25%, and CVS Health climbed 0.5%.Meanwhile, Walgreens, which has a distribution partnership with AmerisourceBergen (ABC), exercised warrants to buy 22.7 million shares of the drug distributor for about $1.17 billion.Walgreens has the right to buy another 22.7 million shares beginning in March 2017.Amerisource shares rose 1.9%.

495,TGT,"Recent consumer IPOs were a more fitness-focused bunch than those of years past and have largely outperformed new-issue cohorts, offering a clue into who the hot newcomers may be when the current IPO chill starts to gradually thaw.Of the 15 consumer companies that went public in 2015, over half of them were tied -- directly or indirectly -- to the health and wellness trend. The Class of 2015 included fitness tracker maker Fitbit (FIT), gym operator Planet Fitness (PLNT) and SkinnyPop popcorn maker Amplify Snack Brands (BETR).“If you add fast-casual to your list, a lot of these have a focus on health,” said Kathleen Smith, co-founder of IPO research firm Renaissance Capital. “It resonates. Some of it is that the younger people realize they’re going to live longer and if you’re going to live longer you’ve got to be healthy and eat well and exercise.”Next up could be SoulCycle, an upscale spin-studio operator with a celebrity following. The prospective IPO, a popular choice for hipsters and workout junkies looking for an Instagrammable workout, most recently took its rave-like studio classes to SXSW, hosting ""cardio parties"" in partnership with Spotify.Even Fido’s in on it. July IPO Blue Buffalo (BUFF), which makes natural dog and cat food, is an extension of the consumer demand for more health-conscious, less-processed fare. And on the tech side, Mindbody (MB) went public last June with its class-booking and appointment-scheduling software for gyms and spas.One could even include the outdoorsy Duluth Trading (DLTH), a clothing company that caters to the “modern, self-reliant American” with plaid shirts and waterproof cargo pants for those who live a “hands-on lifestyle.”As more companies sprout from the soil of demand for health-conscious products, many of them tap the IPO market to fund growth, said Smith. That includes Shake Shack (SHAK), the fast-casual purveyor of antibiotic-free and hormone-free Angus burgers that went public at the start of 2015, and David’s Tea (DTEA), the Canadian chain that offers over 150 types of tea -- and not a single espresso drink.While a number of them are trading below their IPO prices, their performance has outpaced that of last year's new issues.Of the 170 companies that went public in 2015, the average return has been a 19.6% decline as of Monday's close, according to Renaissance Capital. But shares of the 15 consumer IPOs from last year, which includes all of the above names except Mindbody, have experienced a collective rise of about 1.1%.Planet Fitness, which went public at 16 last August, is up 18% from the market's low point of Feb. 11 this year to 15.60 by Monday's close. Amplify, which priced at 18 less than a year ago, has rebounded 44% from Feb. 11 to 13.60. Blue Buffalo has leapt 60% to 24.77, above its initial offering of 20 a share.That compares to the S&P 500's 11% rise in the same period. And investors have shown an eagerness to hop on board, though not all stocks have been cooperating with hopes for a fitter future.Within a few months of trading, Shake Shack’s stock more than quadrupled to a high of 96.75, and Fitbit more than doubled from its initial offering price. But they collapsed soon after that. Shake Shack lost two-thirds of its value and Fitbit three-fourths. Both are essentially flat since Feb. 11.“The investor interest is very high in fitness (and) healthy eating, but I think people struggle with exactly how to play the trend, as it is really relatively broad-based,” said Piper Jaffray analyst Sean Naughton, who covers Planet Fitness, Amplify and other consumer stocks.Plus, recent market volatility has put a damper on enthusiasm for privately owned businesses looking to take to the market. Only seven companies have gone public this year, said Renaissance Capital's Smith, vs. 28 during the same time frame in 2015.SoulCycle filed last July to go public but has yet to start trading. The company declined to comment, as it remains in a quiet period.“I think, overall, (SoulCycle has) performed rather well,"" said Smith. ""It’s not like there isn’t competition in this area.""The New York City-based chain raked in $112 million in 2014 revenue from its 38 locations, growing sales by nearly 49% from the prior year.But if the current market rally continues, the window for IPO issuance might be on the verge of reopening, after closing in December.Smith predicts that investors will see a trickle of companies ready to start trading sometime in April. With it might come names like SoulCycle or Honest Company, the baby and home product company founded by actress Jessica Alba.“When the market opens up, it will not be a tsunami wave of IPOs,” said Smith. ""(It will be) slow, steady, below-average.""She expects that health care, technology and consumer companies will likely lead the new-issue market this year, with a similar health-bent possibly flowing throughout.""The SoulCycles and Honest Companies -- we'll see more of it,"" she said. ""(And) more fast casuals.""But as competition heats up, smaller companies riding the health and wellness trend -- newly public or not -- have to watch out for traditional heavyweights fighting back.Legacy names like General Mills (GIS), Kroger (KR) and Target (TGT) have have been adapting to the consumer shift toward natural and organic foods, putting pressure on the likes of Whole Foods Market (WFM), Sprouts Farmers Market (SFM) and others.""Generally speaking, the better-for-you food players and the better-for-you grocery stores -- they’ve under-performed their traditional peers, really over the last eight months,"" said Piper Jaffray's Naughton.Image provided by Shutterstock.

496,TGT,"Amazon (AMZN) has solidified its position as an e-commerce leader, and its global takeover may happen sooner than you think.A Cowen & Co. report out Wednesday forecasts Amazon displacing Macy’s (M) as the No. 1 U.S. apparel retailer by 2017, driven by selection, fulfillment and brand relationships. Amazon’s momentum in apparel is also seen leading to retailer mergers and acquisitions, as well as store closures.Cowen also projects that Amazon will displace Target (TGT), Walgreens (WBA) and CVS (CVS) to become the No.2 company in consumables, behind Wal-Mart (WMT), by 2018. The report calculates a compound annual growth rate of 27% for the e-commerce giant’s consumables market.Meanwhile, Social Capital has set a very bullish $3 trillion, 10-year valuation on the stock, with the venture capital firm citing strength across retail and its Amazon Web Services segment. Amazon’s current market cap is about $314 billion, while Apple -- the most valuable public company -- has about a $515 billion market cap.IBD's take: How does Amazon stack up vs. its peers? Find out at IBD Stock CheckupAfter gapping up on its strong earnings report last week, shares are now extended 9% from a cup-with-handle buy point initially cleared in mid-April. The stock is trading about 5% below its all-time high reached at the end of last year, and it closed down 1.8% Thursday.Meanwhile, Wal-Mart recently plunged below its 50-day line and has yet to retake that level, as it ended virtually flat. Shares are sitting 15% below their 52-week peak.And Macy’s shares are trading nearly 50% below their all-time high reached last July. They fell 2%.

497,TGT,"After the weakest stretch of economic growth in three years, a pick-up in income and employment tax receipts to the fastest pace in six months may be a sign of better things to come.Over the past month through May 3, federal income and employment taxes withheld from paychecks are up 4.5% from a year ago, an IBD analysis of daily Treasury statements shows. That's the best year-over-year growth since the first week in November and more than double the rate of growth seen in February and early March.Economists have been puzzling over why GDP growth has been so slow in the past two quarters even as job growth has remained so solid. But if you look at federal tax withholdings, the broadest, most timely gauge of the job market, there's a pretty logical explanation: Growth has slumped because of meager income gains.Even 4.5% growth in withheld taxes, though more or less consistent with payrolls rising 2% from a year ago and average hourly wages up 2.3%, is no better than mediocre. By comparison, withheld taxes rose about 5.5% from a year ago during the first half of 2015, and growth exceeded 7% for most of 2006.The real economic mystery, considering the reported gains in payrolls and wages, is how the year-over-year gain in withheld taxes fell as low as 2% this winter. Labor Department data offer one partial explanation: The average worker has been clocking fewer hours. While average hourly wages were up 2.3% from a year ago in February, average weekly earnings were up just 1.7%.Still, there's no doubt that tax withholdings, which aren't seasonally adjusted or subject to revision, are a more reliable indicator than government estimates of employment and wage gains.The year-over-year growth in withheld taxes has been rising steadily since early March, helped along by pay hikes at Wal-Mart (WMT), Costco (COST) and Target (TGT). While the uptrend hasn't been in place long enough to sound the all-clear signal, it's a pretty safe bet that consumption will follow the growth in income — and, thus, the growth in withheld taxes.April's rebound in auto sales, with solid gains seen by Ford (F) and Fiat Chrysler (FCAU), may be a sign that economy is speeding back up — if only into second gear — rather than stuck in an oil slick.

498,TGT,"The Federal Reserve convinced markets that a June rate hike is on the table. Warren Buffett disclosed a big Apple (AAPL) stake. Home Depot (HD), Lowe's (LOW) and Wal-Mart (WMT) reported strong results, but Target (TGT), Gap (GPS) and Ross Stores (ROST) were among those with weak results or outlooks. Cisco (CSCO) and Salesforce (CRM) had upbeat reports that were good news for IT spending. General Motors (GM) and Uber tested self-driving cars on the road, joining Alphabet (GOOGL) Google cars, while Google held a major developers conference.The major averages continued to move sideways in a choppy fashion as the market remains under pressure. The Nasdaq rose 1.1% for the week after falling for the prior four weeks. The S&P 500 eked out a 0.3% rise while the Dow Jones industrial average lost 0.2%, its fourth straight weekly decline. The S&P 500 and Dow moved back above their 50-day moving averages on Monday as Apple rose on Buffett's stake, but then fell back as near-term Fed rate hike buzz took hold, pushing up the dollar. Thanks to Friday gains, the S&P 500, Dow and Nasdaq are slightly higher for the week.While some stocks broke out -- Salesforce and Lowe's -- older breakouts struggled. Facebook (FB) closed just below a buy point Thursday, though it regained its entry point on Friday. McDonald's (MCD) fell below its late March entry area.Minutes from the Federal Reserve’s April meeting showed policymakers are close to raising benchmark interest rates again next month, surprising Fed watchers who priced in an increase later in the year. But before raise rates for a second time, the Fed wants to see signs growth is picking up in Q2, along with stronger labor markets and inflation heading for the 2% target.New York Fed President William Dudley said the next day a rate hike in the June-July timeframe is reasonable, unless the economy stumbles. He said a June rate hike is ""definitely live."" Other policymakers made similar comments. The next meeting will be held June 14-15, followed by another on July 26-27.April consumer prices had their biggest monthly gain in three years. Weekly jobless claims fell sharply after spiking to the highest since February 2015 in the prior week. Industrial production was strong in April, but manufacturing surveys for May from the New York Fed and Philly Fed showed unexpected deterioration.Existing-home sales and housing starts rose for April, while builder sentiment was steady in May.Mega-investors piled into Apple. Warren Buffett disclosed on Monday May 13 that Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) bought 9.8 million shares of Apple last quarter, valued at about $1.07 billion at quarter’s end. Midweek, Greenlight Capital disclosed it raised its stake in Apple 30.7% to 8.2 million shares, and billionaire George Soros' Soros Fund Management said it took a 3,100-share stake in Apple. Buffett's investment reflects confidence in Apple's pipeline of products, including future iPhones or even a rumored Apple Car. But it also suggests a shift in Apple's lifecycle from a growth company to a value play.Apple stock rose 5.2% for the week after hitting a 23-month low in the prior week.Playing catch-up, Alphabet's Google introduced a voice-activated Wi-Fi speaker system with built-in search. Google Home, expected to ship in 2016, will compete with the Amazon.com (AMZN) Echo. Google’s new “Allo” messaging app features artificial intelligence, like Facebook's new “chat bot.” Google’s upcoming Android N upgrade to its mobile operating system will feature a virtual reality mode. However, Google did not unveil a VR competitor to Facebook’s Oculus Rift. Apple rival Xiaomi plans to ship its Android-based TV set-top box to the U.S. in 2016.Both home improvement chains topped estimates on strong housing market growth and favorable spring weather, raising guidance. But Home Depot fell 2.5% on Tuesday and 1% for the week, as same-store sales growth cooled from 10.2% in Feb. to 6.7% in March and 4.3% in April. Meanwhile, Lowe’s shares climbed 6.4% to an all-time high, breaking out of a nearly four-month long consolidation.Salesforce.com reported Q1 EPS and revenue that topped views as the business software provider signed more big deals with enterprise customers. Billings rose 31% year over year, accelerating from 28% in Q4. Salesforce.com increased its full-year revenue guidance slightly to $8.2 billion. On its earnings call, management touted a new cloud alliance with Amazon Web Services. Salesforce stock jumped 6.1% for the week, breaking out of a base and nearly hitting an all-time high.Cisco Systems reported a 6% adjusted EPS gain for its fiscal Q3, with revenue up 3%, both edging past analyst forecasts. Profit and sales guidance was also bullish. Analysts had lowered expectations ahead of Cisco earnings due to the growing number of companies outsourcing to cloud computing service providers such as Amazon Web Services, reducing demand for Cisco’s networking gear. The lowered expectations also reflected lower spending on information technology overall.Well aware of the trends, Cisco is diversifying into newer, higher-growth segments such as software, data centers, security, wireless and the Internet of Things market.Cisco stock rose 5.4% for the week.The Energy Information Administration reported a domestic stockpile increase of 1.3 million barrels vs. a 3 million barrel decline expected by analysts. The American Petroleum Institute reported a drawdown of 1.14 million barrels. U.S. production continues to fall while gasoline demand ramps up.Oil prices hit fresh seven-month highs during the week. U.S. futures closed the week at $47.75 a barrel, up 3.3%.Goldman Sachs said that oil could hit $50 per barrel later this year as the market “likely shifted into deficit in May,” earlier than Goldman expected. But the supply deficit will be short-lived and will swing back to surplus next year.FMC Technologies (FTI) and France’ Technip announced a merger that would rival oilfield service giants Schlumberger (SLB) and Halliburton (HAL).Occidental Petroleum (OXY) reportedly offered to buy Apache (APA). But Oxy said it didn’t “have any knowledge” about an offer. In November, Anadarko (APC) withdrew a bid to buy Apache, which had rejected the offer.Wal-Mart and Target moved in opposite directions after issuing their quarterly earnings reports.Target’s Q1 EPS increased 17% to $1.29, beating views for $1.19. But sales dropped 5% to $16.2 billion, missing estimates. Same-store sales grew 1.2%, short of predictions for a 1.6% gain. Target’s Q2 EPS guidance of $1 to $1.20 widely missed expectations for $1.36.Shares plunged 7.1%, hitting their lowest levels since late 2014.Wal-Mart’s Q1 profit fell 5 cents to 98 cents a share but beat estimates by 10 cents. Sales rose 0.9% to $115.9 billion vs. forecasts for a drop to $113.2 billion. U.S. same-store sales climbed 1%, the seventh straight gain. For Q2, Wal-Mart sees EPS of 95 cents to $1.08, with the midpoint above estimates for 98 cents.Shares popped 7.6% for the week, retaking their 200-day and 50-day lines after gapping down in sympathy with Target on Wednesday.Outshining its ailing department store peers, TJX (TJX) Q1 EPS and sales rose 10% to 76 cents and $7.54 billion, comfortably topping. Comps rose 7%. The off-price retailer guided full-year EPS up to $3.35-$3.42, still shy of estimates. Off-price peer Ross Stores edged past Q1 EPS views with a 6% gain, but revenue's 5% gain to $3.09 billion missed. Comps grew 2%. Q2 and full-year EPS guidance fell short of consensus. Ross Stores fell 3.4% for the week, while TJX climbed 3.7%.General Motors acquisition Cruise Automation confirmed that its self-driving technology was being tested on Chevy Bolts after photos of the all-electric cars surfaced online. Uber on Thursday also posted a photo of a hybrid Ford (F) Fusion outfitted with self-driving technology that it said would be undergoing testing.GM and Lyft plan to road-test autonomous Bolt taxis in the coming months, and Ford has established a subsidiary focused on autonomous-car technology and ride-sharing. But the carmakers face stiff competition from the likes of Toyota (TM), Tesla (TSLA) and Alphabet, which recently inked a tech deal with Fiat Chrysler (FCAU).Red Robin Gourmet Burgers (RRGB) plunged 21% this week to a 3-year low on weak sales and slashed revenue guidance. Sonic (SONC) said it would miss its own fiscal Q3 same-store sales target, triggering an 8.65% weekly stock loss. The reports, which followed a weak May 11 sales outlook from Wendy’s (WEN), intensified fears about burger competition as both value and upscale offerings spread. Wendy’s stock fell 2.8%. Shake Shack (SHAK), which popped on solid results earlier this month, slid 6.9%. McDonald’s lost 4.9%.Campbell Soup (CPB) and Hormel (HRL) reported disappointing quarterly results, perhaps indicating that sluggish consumer spending is spilling over into the foods group.

499,TGT,"Stocks rallied to session highs, with the Nasdaq rising as Apple (AAPL) and Tesla (TSLA) scored heavy-volume gains. That offset sharp retailer losses on poor Target (TGT) results.The Nasdaq rallied 0.7%, while the S&P 500 climbed 0.3% and the Dow Jones industrial average 0.2% in the stock market today.

500,TGT,"Target (TGT) fell as much as 9.3% in early trading after first-quarter sales missed analysts’ estimates and the discount chain delivered a disappointing forecast, adding evidence that the biggest U.S. retailers are suffering from a slump.Target’s same-store sales gained 1.2% in the period, which ended April 30, the Minneapolis-based company said in a statement Wednesday. Analysts had predicted 1.6% growth, according to Consensus Metrix.Chief Executive Officer Brian Cornell said the company faces “an increasingly volatile consumer environment,” adding his voice to the chorus of retailers complaining of sluggish demand. As it copes with the slowdown, the company expects same-store sales to range from flat to down as much as 2% in the second quarter. Earnings will be $1 to $1.20 a share, excluding some items. Analysts had estimated $1.36 on average, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.The results follow a string of weak earnings reports from some of the country’s largest retailers, including Macy’s (M) and Gap (GPS). Even Home Depot (HD), a bright spot in the retail industry, saw its shares sink this week over concerns about slowing growth. While the U.S. Commerce Department reported stronger retail sales for April, Americans appear to be shifting spending away from traditional retailers. Instead, more of them are putting their money toward online shopping or investing in homes, vehicles or technology.Still, Target has successfully used cost cuts to bolster profit. It reported earnings of $1.29 a share last quarter, beating the average analyst estimate of $1.19.“We plan to successfully implement our long-term strategy, even in the face of a challenging short-term consumer landscape,” Cornell said in the statement.Prior to Target’s earnings release on Wednesday, analysts had been raising concerns that the retailer might not be able to keep up with Wall Street’s growth expectations. Analysts at Wolfe Research and Cleveland Research downgraded the company, citing a slowdown in sales last month.“The overall retail climate remains generally underwhelming,” said Scott Mushkin, an analyst for Wolfe Research who downgraded the stock to hold from buy. “The climate appears to have deteriorated to a certain degree across retail from late March and into April.”A key challenge ahead for Target will be revamping its grocery department and improving the quality of its fresh foods and supply chain, Mushkin said. It will also have to battle increasing competition from Amazon.com Inc., which recently announced it would start offering a monthly Prime membership and is continuing to expand its same-day delivery.

502,TGT,"Amazon.com (AMZN) fell just shy of Q4 sales expectations when the company reported its earnings results late last month, but in many ways, the holidays were very very good to the e-commerce leader.The e-tailer's lead grew last holiday, according to a new report from Slice Intelligence.  The research firm says Amazon's revenue rose 12% for the holiday period -- Nov. 1 through Dec. 27 -- vs. just 10% of online sales overall.Because of Amazon's massive market share, that 12% accounted for more than half the total online-sales dollar growth, according to Slice. Amazon is so dominant that it's market position might be close to impenetrable, some observers say.Amazon even dwarfs walmart.com, the Web property of No. 1 overall retailer Wal-Mart (WMT). Amazon late last month said Q4 revenue jumped 22% year over year to $35.7 billion, but Wall Street had modeled nearly $36 billion.The biggest percentage growth for the holidays, though, goes to much smaller Wayfair (W), a website dedicated to selling furniture and accessories for homes. Slice says its Q4 sales soared 150%, and says it is stealing shoppers from Amazon, Restoration Hardware (RH) and Macy's (M).Retail giant Target (TGT) had a good holiday season, says the Slice report, with Q4 sales rising 52%, spurred by a strong inventory, aggressive promotions and its offer of free shipping for every order. Target and Wayfair both report Q4 earnings results next week.As IBD has previously reported, the Slice report also indicated that the holiday shopping season is stretching out, with a greater percentage of the season's sales taking place before Thanksgiving.Amazon stock rose 1.9% Friday, to 534.90, after touching a record high of 696 in late December.

In fact, shares of Hasbro might actually be getting a bit of a stock boost Tuesday as a result of this viral video.For the unfamiliar, #HappyChewbacca first went online late last week, with Texas mom Candace Payne unboxing and donning a Chewbacca mask that emits the Wookiee's trademark growl every time she opens her mouth. That sets off a cycle of hysterical laughter and Wookiee growls.""I'm such a happy chewbacca.."" This lady is still making me smile. Lovely video to come out on my birthday 🙂 pic.twitter.com/khUizi6nFf— Peter Mayhew (@TheWookieeRoars) May 21, 2016The mask is now sold out almost everywhere online, including Target (TGT), Wal-Mart (WMT), Amazon (AMZN), and of course Kohl's, where Payne first bought it. And that, in turn, led investment bank Piper Jaffray to say today that the video might fuel demand for over 1 million units of the $30 mask, which translates to roughly $18 million-$19 million in potential gross sales, or a 2-3 cent near-term earnings-per-share contribution for Hasbro.Shares of Hasbro rose as much as 3% earlier in the day, bringing it closer to its 88.63 buy point, before closing up 2.1%.Who else stands to laugh from Happy Chewbacca?There’s Facebook, whose live-streaming platform has gotten a nice publicity boost from the video. The previous record holder for most-watched video is a BuzzFeed video of an exploding watermelon that hasn't gotten even a tenth of the views. Then there are all the retailers that are selling out of at least this one item on the heels of some very lackluster earnings results over the last couple of weeks.And then there's Disney, obviously, which owns Lucasfilm and ""Star Wars."" Piper Jaffray said the video highlights the new face of ""Star Wars"" superfans and the power of viral videos, which ""are rarely anticipated but can catalyze significant demand for an item"" -- just like the mask seen in Happy Chewbacca.

506,TGT,"April’s 160,000 payroll gain, the weakest in seven months, should be no surprise.The prior six months saw the weakest economic growth in more than three years. But combined with faster wage growth, the hiring slowdown raises big questions about the economic outlook. Is the U.S. getting close to full employment and stuck on a modest growth track?Clearly, jobs were on a shaky path. Even as the economy cooled from September through March, private-sector employers added nearly 234,000 jobs per month, not far off the best levels since the recession. Payrolls can only grow faster than the real economy for so long. Eventually the profit squeeze from having less productive workers forces employers to react.Financial markets didn’t seem to know what to make of the April jobs report. Key stock indexes initially sold off, but they rallied to close Friday with modest gains. The 10-year Treasury yield rose. For now, investors aren’t pricing in a Federal Reserve rate hike until December.Many economists, including Fed policymakers, had predicted that the previously solid job growth would trigger stronger economic growth as the financial turmoil earlier in the year moved further into the rearview mirror.But April’s employment report “raises the concern that GDP may be the better signal,” wrote Wells Fargo economists John Silvia and Sarah House.They see the acceleration in wage growth as evidence that the labor market is tightening, noting that “the unemployment rate remains around estimates of full employment.”Yearly wage gains accelerated in April, though to a still-modest 2.5%.Companies like Wal-Mart (WMT), Costco (COST) and Target (TGT) have hiked pay in recent months, helping to lift wage growth. In addition, April’s job gains seemed tilted more to higher-paying industries than the past several months in which low-wage fields like retail and leisure and hospitality were the workhorses.Professional and business services firms added 65,000 jobs in April, while the finance sector added 20,000. Other gains came in health care (44,200), leisure and hospitality (22,000), manufacturing (4,000) and construction (1,000). Retailers shed 3,100 jobs.A real conundrum for the economy is that productivity has been in a slump over the past couple of quarters. It’s been weak for years, rising just 0.4% over the past half-decade, compared with 2.4% over the prior 20 years.With weak economic growth and low productivity, it’s hard to make a case for continued hiring.“Given the weak productivity figures, we should see upward pressure on inflation, even with more modest gains in the labor market,” the Wells Fargo economists wrote.Harm Bandholz, chief U.S. economist at UniCredit Research, also sees cause for caution.""Potential growth in the U.S. has slowed perceptibly over the past several years,"" he wrote recently. ""Due to the combination of slower population growth and weaker productivity gains, potential growth is now probably between 1.5% and 2%.""Some economists say April’s wage uptick could serve as fuel for the economy to reaccelerate.Noting that the average workweek ticked up 0.1 hour to 34.5 hours, Nariman Behravesh, chief economist at IHS Global Insight, said that he’s expecting job growth to rebound to 200,000 a month as the economy gradually accelerates to a 3.1% growth rate by the fourth quarter.But in the prior two quarters, employers scaled back work hours and reined in compensation.Compensation costs for private industry workers rose 1.8% in the year through March, compared to 2.8% a year earlier, the Labor Department reported last month. While wage gains slowed, benefits growth slowed even more, to 1.2% from 2.6% the prior year.The crimp on compensation, and a shift in health insurance costs to workers via high deductibles, may help explain why consumers have been saving more and slowing consumption.Lakshman Achuthan, co-founder of the Economic Cycle Research Institute, doesn’t see April’s pickup in average hourly earnings as a real boost to consumption because inflation has picked up as well, “eating into wage gains.”Corporate profit growth “will have a hard time without the economy starting to reaccelerate, and we don’t see any clear signs of a reacceleration,” Achuthan said.

513,TGT,"Macy's (M) dismal first-quarter results and guidance Wednesday bolstered views of Amazon's (AMZN) unrelenting dominance, sending shares of the department store chain -- and most stocks in the retail and consumer sectors -- down.Companies ranging from Wal-Mart (WMT) to Michael Kors (KORS) to Nike (NKE) to Tiffany (TIF) to Williams-Sonoma (WSM), sold off. But Amazon stock rose 1.45%, hitting a fresh high.Macy's report followed Gap's (GPS) forecast late Monday of a 5% drop in Q1 same-store sales and weak earnings. The chain also noted a ""tepid macro environment for apparel retail.""""In light of AMZN and M's recent results, we feel more confident that AMZN will displace M as the #1 US Apparel retailer by '17,"" wrote Cowen analyst John Blackledge in a Wednesday note, doubling down on his assessment from last year.Macy's earnings fell 29% to 40 cents a share, 4 cents above views, on a 7% revenue decline to $5.77 billion that fell short of estimates for $5.93 billion.Same-store sales -- sales at facilities open more than a year -- at both Macy's-owned outlets and licensed operators dropped 5.6%.

Shares of companies not in direct competition with Amazon dropped as well, including McDonald's (MCD) and Panera (PNRA).""We are seeing continued weakness in consumer spending levels for apparel and related categories,"" Macy's Chief Executive Terry Lundgren said in a statement. ""In particular, our sales trend relative to expectations meaningfully slowed beginning in mid-March, and first-quarter results are below our original outlook.""The company now sees full-year per-share profit of $3.15-$3.40, down from its previous outlook of $3.80-$3.90 and far below Wall Street estimates for $3.80 a share. It also expects 2016 same-store sales on an owned-plus-licensed basis to fall 3%-4%, vs. prior outlook for a 1% decline.""We are not counting on the consumer to spend more,"" Lundgren said, so the department store is ""working harder to give customers more reasons to buy from us by delivering outstanding style, quality and value.""For the second straight year, tourist spending is falling in the double digits, he said, and noted a slowdown in some ""center core"" categories. But he also said that the first quarter is a ""relatively small portion of the total year"" and sees a chance to play catch-up over the next three quarters.Still, Macy's isn't exactly the next Sears Holdings (SHLD), which has seen years of falling sales and store closures.""That's a leap,"" laughed Perkins, though he also said the department store's current struggles are more than just a bump in the road.But like Sears, Macy's is evaluating real-estate proposals for joint ventures or similar arrangements. Macy's has been under pressure to spin off its real estate holdings to raise cash.

514,TGT,"A sprawling tax-fraud scheme duped Seagate Technology (STX) and Snapchat into dispensing thousands of W-2 forms, highlighting a major fissure in the cybersecurity industry, a Proofpoint (PFPT) representative said Thursday.The breach exposed nearly 10,000 former and current Seagate employees, according to a statement from the data storage firm. The breach was discovered March 1 on the heels of a similar attack on photo-sharing app Snapchat.Seagate stock fell 3.5% Tuesday as the news made headlines and fell a fraction Wednesday before rising 2.2% Thursday, and shares were up nearly 2% early Friday. Seagate confirmed the breach in an email to IBD.""The information was sent by an employee who believed the phishing email was a legitimate internal company request,"" Seagate said. Released information includes Social Security numbers and addresses of anyone employed by Seagate in 2015.Phishing attacks on businesses are becoming more prevalent, Ryan Kalember, Proofpoint senior vice president of cybersecurity strategy, told IBD. He refers to it as ""impostor fraud."" The W-2 attack is just the most recent iteration, he said.Snapchat admitted to a similar attack on Feb. 28 in a blog post titled ""An Apology to Our Employees."" The scammer impersonated CEO Evan Spiegel, successfully asking for payroll information. Internal systems and user information remained secure.Both Seagate and Snapchat reported the attacks to the FBI, which recorded more than $215 million lost in phishing attacks between October 2013 and December 2014, according to a report in January. Both firms also offered two years of credit monitoring for the victims.""When something like this happens, all you can do is own up to your mistake, take care of the people affected and learn from what went wrong,"" Snapchat wrote.Tax fraud phishing is seasonal, Kalember noted. Wire transfer requests are also popular -- and thrifty -- modes of generating a lot of money. Networking firm Ubiquiti Networks (UBNT) found that out the hard way last August after a phisher tricked it into wiring $46.7 million overseas.And scammers are becoming more sophisticated, says Slawek Ligier, Barracuda Networks’ (CUDA) vice president of product development. ""Spear-phishing"" and ""whaling"" involve targeting someone with either money or access.Tricky email tactics -- changing the ""N"" in Barracuda Networks to ""M"" or spoofing a CEO's email address -- tend to reap the most success, Ligier told IBD. From there, scammers indulge in a series of social engineering measures.""They don't want to waste their time on people who won't fall for it,"" he said. ""But the scammer will really invest a lot of time and effort to slowly reel their victim in.""Stickier yet, there are legitimate reasons to spoof a CEO's email, Kalember says. A company will allow a third-party to spoof an email -- make it appear as if the email is coming from that CEO -- for marketing purposes. A spoof can use any display name that the spoofer chooses.Traditional email protection services can't deal with spoofs, Kalember says.""Defenses are looking for malware, and they are not equipped for this,"" he said. ""There is no malware. There is no payload. And the tricky part is, there's also legitimate business emails from people who need their W-2s.""Agari CEO Patrick Peterson says his privately held company aims at this problem. Cisco Systems (CSCO) IronPort business veterans (Cisco bought IronPort in 2007) founded Agari, which uses proprietary technology to filter out phishing emails, Peterson told IBD. It differs from Proofpoint, which plans this quarter to flag phishing emails in the same vein as spam and ""adult content.""""When (executives) see these stories about Seagate, I imagine they break out into a cold sweat, thinking they have no solution,"" Peterson said.Spear-phishers differ from mass phishers. The latter sends a blast email hoping to dupe a few vulnerable people. The former involves more research and relies on social engineering to persuade a target of its legitimacy.""The best defense we have today -- which is a pretty crappy one -- is telling people to be careful,"" he said.At the annual cybersecurity RSA Conference last week in San Francisco, Calif., executives were most concerned about phishing scams, he said. Malware detection has become so sophisticated that scammers have been forced to rely on the weak human link.So far, it's working. Recent breaches of the Office of Personnel Management, Anthem (ANTM), Sony (SNE) Pictures Entertainment and Target (TGT) also began with a phishing email; they account for about 90% of all attacks, Peterson said.""This really serves as a wake-up call to the tech industry to dig deep and find solutions,"" he said. ""Unfortunately, my crystal ball says we're going to see a lot more of these notices.""
"
515,TGT,"Ever heard the term ""extreme value retailer""? You're about to, if Ollie’s Bargain Outlet Holdings (OLLI) has its way.That's the moniker Ollie’s gives itself as it sells brand-name merchandise at prices of up to 70% below department and specialty stores. It also offers discounts of up to 50% below mass-market retailers, including the likes of giant discounters such as Wal-Mart Stores (WMT) and Target (TGT).Publicly traded for only eight months, Ollie's is banking on feeding the appetite of American consumers, who in good times and bad remain hungry for bargains. The strategy seemed to work over the 2015 holiday period, as many retailers struggled in the face of strong competition from Amazon.com (AMZN) and others. Abnormally warm weather also left shelves bulging with seasonal merchandise like apparel, leading to heavy markdowns and in turn pressure on margins.Ollie's, meanwhile, reported strong holiday sales and upped its full fiscal 2015 outlook in an early report issued Jan. 11. It reported total sales rose 23% from a year earlier, with a same-store sales increase of 5.6% vs. a year earlier for the nine-week period ended Jan. 2. Ollie's 2015 fiscal year ended Jan. 30, and it plans to report results in early April. It still considers January part of the 2015 fiscal year.“We had a really good flow of merchandise into our stores, (which is) a by-product of the amount of calls coming in from manufacturers offering us products,” Ollie's Chief Executive Mark Butler told IBD. “For us, the weather pattern was very favorable. We have no exposure to any fashion or warm-weather related clothing. Overall, the consumer was in a good place because gas prices were actually lower than the year before.”Ollie’s sells a variety of brands in virtually every department, from housewares to sporting goods to flooring and food. About 70% of the company’s business is what Butler calls “opportunistic,” which includes closeouts and products from liquidations and bankruptcies. The retailer sells brand-name products, but often they'll be last year's colors, patterns or packaging that traditional retailers have stopped selling.The formula seems to be working, as Butler believes Ollie’s can grow to upwards of 950 stores nationwide -- more than quadruple the 203 Ollie's in 17 states across the eastern U.S. as of Feb. 18. He looks to keep Ollie’s moving on the fast track by following the same growth strategy the company followed prior to its initial public offering July 16.""We’ve announced we’re committed to annual unit (sales) growth in the mid teens, which is what we’ve done over the last decade,"" Butler said.As many stores face intense competition from Amazon, Butler says: “We think we’re in a very unique spot because it’s very difficult to duplicate (our) brick and mortar treasure hunt shopping experience online.”“With the business continuing to grow and the improved visibility from the IPO, we have seen better access to merchandise,” Butler said in a statement. “This is allowing our buying team to be more selective in their purchases, and we can offer our customers even greater value every time they step into one of our stores. We believe our merchandise selection has led to increased traffic, ticket and merchandise margin, therefore driving our top and bottom lines.”KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst Bradley Thomas told IBD that while the stock dropped after its IPO, it showed strength later on and is up 20% thus far this year. He echoed Butler's ultimate store count estimate and said the company continues to capitalize on closeout buying opportunities and geographic expansion.“The stock performed well right after Ollie’s went public and then traded off with the weakness in the broader market,” Thomas said. “The stock has since recovered and moved beyond the IPO price as they posted a strong third quarter and holiday results, and we believe they can have 950 stores across the U.S. or about five times its current store base.”Piper Jaffray analyst Peter Keith offered a similar take and even projects as many as 964 Ollie's stores within the next 10 years.""Investors like the unit growth opportunity,” Keith said. “In today’s environment, there are not a lot of retail growth stories as consumer (shopping) preference continues to shift online. Also there was a lot of store growth from 2000 to 2008, and certain parts of retail are over-stored. It’s unique that Ollie’s has a substantial amount of store growth to come.”The company's first set of official numbers show promise. When it gave preliminary holiday results on Jan. 11, Ollie’s also gave estimates for the fiscal year. It now expects total sales to increase approximately 19% from a year earlier to $760 million. That compares with its prior guidance of $745 million in sales.Ollie's expects net income per share of approximately 66 cents. That compares with a prior estimate of 63 cents a share. It sees adjusted net income increasing about 42% to $39 million, and adjusted earnings per share at roughly 69 cents a share. The updated adjusted earnings estimate compares with prior guidance of 66 cents a share.It also sees same-store sales growth -- growth at outlets open more than a year -- of about 5.5% from a year ago. Analysts are concerned about that but say if Ollie's keeps its relationships with vendors strong, it could sustain that.“Historically, over the long term, this is a company where comps have averaged 1% to 2%,” Keith said. “The debate is whether the same-store sales trend (of roughly 5% growth in the fourth quarter) that they’re experiencing is sustainable at a level above the historic 1% to 2% growth, or will it ultimately revert back to 1% to 2% growth? In the next one to two years, there’s probably a sustainable benefit from working more directly with suppliers.”

516,TGT,"With events such as Apple's (AAPL) recent wrangling with the feds pushing the issue of digital security to the forefront, it's no wonder payment processor Vantiv (VNTV) is growing more prominent in the ongoing battle against cybercriminals.The No. 2 company in its field by volume, Vantiv continues to reap the rewards of merchants' and financial institutions' move to chip cards and their corresponding terminals. Its suite of other cybersecurity products continues to play a key role in the company's upward climb.Vantiv processed $842 billion in transactions last year, and this is showing up in the company's numbers. Fourth-quarter results surpassed analyst estimates as adjusted earnings jumped 23% to 65 cents a share, marking a third straight quarter of accelerating growth. Net revenue increased 13% to $453 million.“Vantiv has strong secular tailwinds, in our view, spanning digital payments, security, software and e-commerce with little exposure to macro headwinds like (currency exchange), gas, regulation, credit or discretionary spending,” Pacific Crest analyst Josh Beck said in a recent note to clients. He also notes that Vantiv has ""above-average industry growth.""Vantiv can thank a number of entities for lifting awareness of cybersecurity, with the most recent example being Apple. The tech behemoth brought the issue of smartphone security front and center in recent days with its controversial refusal to assist the FBI in unlocking an iPhone that could contain terrorism evidence. The company says it wants to protect customer privacy.Cyberhacks have also struck customer databases at such merchants as Target (TGT) and Home Depot (HD) in recent years, and the threat they'll keep scouring the Internet for further vulnerability persists.One relatively new security measure in the U.S. payments space is that of chip cards and terminals known as EMV. Named for the three consumer credit companies that originated the technology -- Europay, Mastercard (MA) and Visa (V) -- EMV uses a chip embedded in the card, rather than the traditional black strip, in an attempt to process payments in a much more secure way.The card-and-terminal upgrade cycle is driving significant growth for Vantiv, which plays on both sides of the equation. Some 80% of the company’s revenue comes from merchants, via the sale of new terminals, as well as other e-commerce, mobile, compliance and data analytics products. Clients include Macy's (M), Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA), Kroger (KR) and the U.S. Postal Service.The other 20% comes from financial institutions, with Vantiv behind the reissuance of the cards that contain EMV chips. Partners include Comerica Bank (CMA), Fifth Third Bank (FITB), Discover Financial Services (DFS) and Capital One Financial (COF).Fortunately for Vantiv, the EMV upgrade cycle has a long way to go. Vantiv said last month during its fourth-quarter earnings call that, as of the end of 2015, more than two-thirds of the terminals of its merchant clients still needed to be upgraded. And more than half the debit cards of its bank clients still needed to be reissued as chip cards.""Some 15% of Vantiv's merchant transactions are chip-on-chip, meaning a chip card used by a consumer at a merchant that has a chip terminal,"" Beck told IBD. ""That gives you a sense that we're still pretty early, and my view is that this a multiyear cycle for Vantiv.""Further, the urgency for financial institutions and merchants to convert is growing. October 2015 marked a shift in liability to whichever party -- card issuers or merchants handling payments -- has the weaker technology. Prior to that, the card issuers were primarily responsible for cyber fraud liability.The company expects to see continued growth from EMV-related sales at least through early 2017, with an even longer tail from smaller clients on the merchant side, according to Vantiv Chief Executive Charles Drucker.""On the financial institution side, we're seeing the large banks adopt fast and reissue the cards,"" Drucker told IBD. ""The mid-size banks, as you pull into early 2017, you're going to see a lot of the cards out there with chips in them.""Along with upgrades, Vantiv is helping guide clients through the ever-changing regulatory environment, Drucker says. And its large clients are implementing Vantiv’s entire security suite, including end-to-end encryption and tokenization, a process that removes the credit card number completely from the retailer’s system.Beyond that, a number of merchants are buying terminals that also have near-field communication, or NFC, technology, which enables payments from the likes of Apple Pay, Samsung Pay and Google-owner Alphabet’s (GOOGL) Android Pay.The introduction of Apple Pay in September 2014 helped create a turning point in the payment processing industry, with nearly 1 in 5 point-of-sale terminals in the U.S. now enabled to accept billions of dollars in mobile payments, according to Juniper Research.""Most of the merchants, when they are designing their system, they're designing it in a way that when they get EMV, they are able to implement NFC inside of it,"" Drucker said.Another area of growth for Vantiv has been in the integrated payments space. For example, when a server enters an order into a restaurant's software system, Vantiv is embedded in that process. Plus, Vantiv is expanding into new verticals in the integrated payment category, including health care.Vantiv earns a near-best IBD Composite Rating of 98 out of 99. Shares are trading 1%-2% below a cup-shaped base buy point of 53.46, with the stock retaking its 50-day line several weeks ago.Vantiv also has less exposure to the current volatile economic environment because of its concentration in everyday spending categories, including grocery stores and drug stores. The company doesn’t have much foreign exposure at this time, but in the long term, Drucker sees an international investment in the e-commerce space.And with the vast amount of information its transactions contain, Vantiv sees data analytics as a long-term growth driver as well.""Merchants and banks continue to be more interested in data analytics -- whether it’s banks using it to activate customers or see trends inside their base, or merchants using it to give a better customer experience, or to improve ticket sales that they have,"" Drucker said.

517,TGT,"Utah-based Vista Outdoor (VSTO) is aiming to diversify its outdoor-products business so it’s not so reliant on ammunition and guns.The company’s pending acquisition of a slew of cycling, snow sports and other sports-action gear from BRG Sports for $400 million, announced on Feb. 25, would go a long way toward that goal. Vista's also getting an added lift from its core traditional business.The BRG acquisition happens to coincide with an up cycle in ammunition and gun sales in the aftermath of the Dec. 2 San Bernardino, Calif., massacre and increased chatter over Second Amendment rights in the presidential campaign.“Any time there’s the threat of increased gun control, people go out and buy firearms and ammunition,” Jim Chartier, an analyst with Monness, Crespi, Hardt, told IBD. “They’re afraid gun control legislation would prevent them from buying them in the future.”President Obama talked about the merits of more gun control in last month's State of the Union address and front-running Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton wants to put more restrictions on some gun purchases, including new rules on background checks and closing certain loopholes.""If Democrats win, it’s better for gun sales,"" Chartier said. ""The Democrats are more for gun control than Republicans, who generally are pro-Second Amendment.""Shootings such as those in Newtown, Conn., in 2012 and in San Bernardino usually spur calls for more gun control measures, driving up demand for firearms and related products.Witness results for firearm company Sturm Ruger (RGR), which reported a 24% year-over-year gain in fourth-quarter revenue late Wednesday, sending shares up 7.8% the next trading day. It beat views on both the top and bottom lines.Vista Outdoor’s shooting-sports sales jumped 15.4% in its Jan. 3-ended third quarter vs. a year earlier, and 5% from the prior quarter, to $356.5 million. Outdoor products’ revenue jumped 19.2% to $236.1 million, including $41 million in added sales from two acquisitions made in 2015 for its outdoor products’ category – paddle-board supplier Jimmy Styks and CamelBak, which provides backpacks, drink holders and reusable bottles.Total revenue climbed 17% to $592.6 million. Most of the sequential gain in shooting products’ sales was from higher ammunition volumes, not prices, analyst Greg Konrad of Jefferies said in a note to clients.“There has been an uptick in ammunition shipments following the San Bernardino tragedy in early December,” he wrote. But he and other analysts say volume growth is more than a short-term trend due to increased interest in target shooting as a sport and lower consumer inventory levels following a period of de-stocking and falling ammunition sales.“The tragedy of Newtown in December 2012 brought gun control to the forefront, so there was a surge (in gun and ammunition sales),” Chartier said. Then sales declined for most of 2014 and into 2015, he added.“This year should be positive for ammunition and firearm sales,” he said, citing uncertainty around more gun control in an election year.  He says wait times at shooting ranges are increasing and that more shooting ranges are opening.Vista CEO Mark DeYoung points out that newfound interest in firearms is increasing.“There are a lot of new shooters that have come into the market,” he said in a conference call with analysts in mid-February, pointing to women and young people in particular. He says their increased participation is part of a shift from hunting to target shooting, a trend that bodes well for the company’s ammunition-heavy business. Target shooters use more ammunition than hunters.""(That) benefits our factories, which run more efficiently obviously when we have higher volumes,” DeYoung said.Vista Outdoor sells to mass market, specialty and independent retailers, including privately held Bass Pro Shops, Cabela’s (CAB), Dick’s Sporting Goods (DKS), Gander Mountain, Target (TGT) and Wal-Mart (WMT).Vista was spun off from Alliant Techsystems -- now part of Orbital ATK (OA) -- last February. Shares have climbed more than 30% since then.The company competes in a highly fragmented market, along with the more diversified Jarden (JAH), which sells sports and outdoor gear such as Rawlings baseball gloves and Coleman camping supplies.“They are the two largest in the space, and each one has only 5% market share,” Chartier said.In the nine months ended Jan. 3, Vista Outdoor’s shooting sports segment accounted for 62% of sales; outdoor products made up the other 38%. Once the firm’s purchase of BRG closes, shooting sports will account for a more balanced 51% of sales, Chartier says.“It wants to be a more diversified consumer products company to balance out some of the cyclicality in shooting sports,” he said.Vista's shooting sports products include ammunition, rifles, shotguns and range systems. Outdoor covers a wide range of mostly hard goods products -- protective eyewear, clay targets, hunting arrows, game calls, duck decoys, hunting blinds and holsters. With the BRG portfolio added in, it’ll have protective helmets and other sports equipment from brands Bell, Giro, C-Preme and Blackburn.Even though industry sales in shooting products were sluggish last year, Vista Outdoor reported positive results in the past three quarters, on both the top and bottom lines, Chartier says.Per-share earnings rose sequentially in each of the three quarters. In the third quarter, the company reported 70 cents a share vs. an adjusted 61 cents in the year-earlier period.Management said it expects a “solid” fourth quarter. The firm raised its forecast for the full fiscal year to $2.24 billion-$2.26 billion in revenue from $2.17 billion-$2.24 billion previously and to $2.40-$2.50 a share in earnings from $2.05-$2.30 previously.Vista Outdoor has targeted organic revenue growth of 6% to 8% annually.“Acquisitions are on top of that and are certainly a key part of their strategy,” Chartier said. “I would expect more in 2016.”

518,TGT,"The one-fifth of U.S. mobile phone users that buy prepaid wireless services stand to get much better data deals as AT&T (T), T-Mobile US (TMUS), and Sprint slug it out.“The prepaid market is heating up with surprising deals,” said Roger Entner, chief analyst at consulting firm Recon Analytics.So-called postpaid wireless subscribers historically got the most bang for their money. Postpaid subscribers had two-year service contracts and were billed monthly. Service contracts have been phased out recently along with retail subsidies for Apple (AAPL) iPhones and other high-end smartphones. Most postpaid subscribers now buy phones in monthly installment plans.Prepaid customers, who typically bought less pricey phones upfront, generally were provided slower data services. But that’s changing.“Prepaid users are getting more 4G data at cheaper rates than ever,” Entner said. “When you look at the fighter brands (Cricket and MetroPCS, the most aggressive), you see the old days of prepaid being more expensive (per megabyte) than postpaid are gone.”Entner says MetroPCS customers get unlimited voice calls, texting and 3 gigabytes of 4G data for $40. A similar deal at Cricket provides 2.5GB of data. T-Mobile sells prepaid services under the MetroPCS brand, while AT&T has Cricket.AT&T acquired Leap Wireless and its Cricket brand for $1.2 billion in March 2014. Since then, AT&T has stepped up Cricket advertising while opening more retail stores. AT&T has expanded Cricket’s marketing reach through deals with Wal-Mart (WMT), Target (TGT) and GameStop (GME).T-Mobile acquired prepaid specialist MetroPCS in 2013 and has kept the brand alive.Both T-Mobile and AT&T, by coincidence, said they added 469,000 prepaid subscribers in the December quarter, while Verizon Communications (VZ) shed 157,000 and Sprint (S) lost 491,000. Some of Sprint’s prepaid subscribers upgraded to postpaid plans.On T-Mobile’s Q4  earnings conference call Feb. 10, CEO John Legere said that he expects the prepaid battle to heat up.“We’re killing it in prepaid,” Legere said. “The majority of our growth is on MetroPCS, as opposed to our other brands.“Cricket has had some success, but AT&T is bleeding postpaid subscribers. We see MetroPCS’ main target not to be Cricket per se but to be Sprint. And I think you’ll see a lot more competition between MetroPCS and Sprint.” Sprint owns prepaid brands Virgin Mobile and Boost Mobile.AT&T has lost postpaid phone subscribers for five quarters in a row, including 256,000 shed in Q4.Marketing lines have blurred between the prepaid and postpaid customer segments, analysts say. Many prepaid plans renew automatically every month. Phone financing plans still lock in postpaid subscribers, though it’s easier for consumers to exit deals.“We’ve seen a shift in consumers from low-end, pay-as-you-go type (prepaid) plans to higher-quality plans,” Legere said.Prepaid plans start at around  $25. America Movil’s (AMX) TracFone subsidiary, with 25.6 million U.S. customers, focuses on the lower-spending part of the prepaid market. TracFone’s growth has stalled, though.Analysts say the prepaid market could be more important strategically if the U.S. economy slows down. Most economists do not forecast a recession in 2016.Some of T-Mobile's postpaid subscriber growth has come from prepaid users converted to postpaid plans, with monthly installment plans for phone upgrades.Sprint in the second half of 2015 began adding postpaid phone subscribers for the first time in five years, including its Nextel brand. Some of Sprint's prepaid subscribers also have migrated to postpaid plans.One concern among investors, said Oppenheimer analyst Tim Horan in a 2016 outlook research report, “remains that T-Mobile and Sprint are financing low-credit-quality customers and will get hurt in any potential economic weakness.”In Q4, T-Mobile reported “bad debt expense” of $228 million, up 52% from the year-earlier period.But Craig Moffett, an analyst at MoffettNathanson, says that worries could be overblown.“T-Mobile has never been able to fully shake the perception that its subscriber base is of lower credit quality than that of its peers,” said Moffett in a report. “Those customers would be hard hit in a recession.""The counter-argument is equally compelling. (It) holds that in a recession price sensitivity generally rises and that T-Mobile would actually benefit.""T-Mobile has gained share with its Uncarrier-branded marketing and price cutting.In November, T-Mobile launched “Binge On Demand,” which offers free video streaming.In Q4, T-Mobile added 917,000 postpaid phone subscribers. Verizon added 449,000, while Sprint added 366,000.In 2015, T-Mobile added 4.5 million postpaid subscribers, including about 1 million tablet users, and it added 1.3 million prepaid customers.AT&T lost 1.27 million postpaid phone subscribers, while gaining 1.36 million prepaid subscribers in 2015.“We expect AT&T will continue to be active with prepaid Cricket promotions while focusing on profitable, high-value customers in postpaid,” said UBS analyst John Hodulik in a report.Image provided by Shutterstock.

519,TGT,"Amazon.com (AMZN) shipping got more expensive Monday, as the company announced it was raising its free shipping minimum 40% to $49.The move, of course, only pertains to non-subscribers of its Amazon Prime loyalty program, since those subscribers get free shipping on any order. Orders that include at least $25 of books remain free-shipping eligible.Amazon's latest move is likely intended to drive more Prime subscription growth and also cut down on shipping costs.Amazon stock rose 4.6% to 559.50 on the stock market today, moving back above its 200-day moving average for the first time since plunging below that mark on Feb. 3.Rival Wal-Mart (WMT) has a $50 threshold for free shipping. E-tail startup Jet.com uses $35 as its minimum, while Target (TGT) has a $25 minimum. Wal-Mart stock rose 1.5% on Monday while Target edged up 0.2%.Amazon's shipping costs have been ballooning as the company offers increasing rapid delivery times -- including one-hour delivery in certain markets via Amazon Prime Now. Those costs rose 37% year-over-year in Q4, to $4.7 billion.Rumors continue to swirl about the firm's long-term plans for its shipping program, as investors and analysts speculate that Amazon is interested in competing with established delivery companies such as UPS (UPS) and FedEx (FDX).Internal documents seen by Bloomberg seemingly support that theory. And, there have been reports of Amazon getting into the ocean freight business -- which one observers said could generate upward of $100 million in free cash flow -- as well as leasing cargo jets and making a large purchase of trucks to haul packages between its fulfillment centers. The documents seen by Bloomberg suggest Amazon is gearing up to compete more with China e-com leader Alibaba (BABA).Besides delivery costs, Amazon has spent billions of dollars on its fulfillment and sortation centers, the last step in the delivery process.Wells Fargo analyst Matt Nemer says Amazon.com captured 51% of all retail growth in Q4 2015.Amazon's Prime loyalty program offers free two-day shipping, as well as free streaming audio and video, among other perks.Analysts in general peg Amazon's Prime customer count near 40 million, with some estimates coming in as high as 50 million. Prime members, on average, spend about twice as much on Amazon.com than regular shoppers.Prime members accounted for 57% of Amazon's North American sales in Q4, and Prime members spend about 12% more every year, according to ITG Investment Research analyst Steve Weinstein.Nemer has told IBD that Prime is the biggest reason for Amazon's growth, which during the past two quarters has exceeded 20%.

520,TGT,"New ad formats helped Alphabet (GOOGL) -owned video wing YouTube attract more ad revenue throughout last year, even as YouTube's share of the market is expected to recede as competitors led by Facebook (FB) muscle in to the segment, according to an eMarketer report released Wednesday.U.S. video ad revenue growth for YouTube in the U.S. will fall 6.2% in 2017, eMarketer estimates, and YouTube's share of the video ad market will slip. The decreases reflect growing competition as Facebook, Twitter (TWTR), Yahoo (YHOO), Vimeo and others push further into ad-supported video. YouTube, however, will remain No. 1, with a 17.7% share of the total U.S. video ad revenue pie in 2017, says the report.Wal-Mart (WMT) and Target (TGT) were the biggest ad spenders on YouTube in 2015, the report said, citing Pixability, the YouTube ad-buying and video-marketing platform that examined how much the National Retail Federation's top-10 U.S. brands spent quarter by quarter on YouTube last year.Wal-Mart upped its spending from $600,000 in Q1 to $2.5 million in Q4, and spent $5.2 million for the year, according to the report. Target shelled out $57,000 in Q1, $1.8 million in Q4 and $2.8 million for the year, the report said.Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) also increased its spending during the year, from $12,000 in Q1 to $88,000 in Q4, and a total of $151,000 for the year.In April, YouTube introduced Trueview, a video ad ""buy button"" that lets users buy items by clicking on a banner inside the ad. Trueview has boosted ad spending, says the report.But not every brand boosted their spending on YouTube last year, eMarketer found.Amazon.com (AMZN), Lowe's (LOW), The Home Depot (HD) and CVS (CVS) decreased their spending during the course of 2015. E-commerce king Amazon spent about $1.7 million on digital video advertising on YouTube in Q1, but just $162,000 in Q4, the report said.In U.S. digital advertising, Google's share is expected to dip nearly 5% to 36.6% in 2015, according to estimates from eMarketer. That follows a 3% drop to 38.4% in 2014.

521,TGT,"McKesson (MCK) on Monday cut its fiscal 2016 earnings-per-share outlook and sees next year's EPS getting hit by 85 cents, citing weak generic-drug prices and ""recent customer consolidation.""The drug distributor's grim forecasts come after Rite Aid (RAD), with which McKesson has a distribution deal, agreed last year to be acquired by Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA), which has a distribution partnership with AmerisourceBergen (ABC). The merger cast into doubt McKesson's long relationship with Rite Aid.For the fiscal year ending March 31, McKesson now expects EPS of $12.60-$12.90, down from an earlier forecast of $12.50-$13.00, saying that its profits will be lower than expected during the second half of the year. Analysts expected $12.83.McKesson also expects fiscal 2017 EPS growth of 7%-12%, from the 2016 forecast issued Monday. Analysts expect 13% growth. The company will update 2017 guidance when it reports Q4 results, likely in May.Shares gapped down and finished 10.3% lower in the stock market today. Rival AmerisourceBergen fell 4%. Cardinal Health (CAH), another distributor, fell around 5.5%.Walgreens ended essentially unchanged, while Rite Aid dipped 0.3%. CVS Health (CVS) rose 1.5%.McKesson's headwinds for 2017 also reflect the expiration of its contract with health services company Optum and ""the transition of its contracts with (elder-health company) Omnicare and Target (TGT)."" But McKesson expects its current partnership with Rite Aid to ""continue through the end of fiscal 2017.""The forecasts could signify a considerable misstep for the company, FBR analyst Steven Halper said in a note Monday.""Over the years, MCK has rarely had an operational hiccup such as this in its core pharma segment,"" he wrote. ""It remains to be seen if the issues are temporary or more structural in nature.""The company, which buys drugs, holds them and supplies them to drugstores, said that it was reviewing its administrative cost structure for the fourth quarter. Drug distributors' profits hinge on the difference between the prices that manufacturers charge them to buy the drugs and the prices that they can charge in selling the drugs to retailers.The EPS outlook for 2016 does not include any restructuring that the review may bring, the company said.McKesson reports third-quarter earnings on Jan. 27.Follow Bill Peters on Twitter @IBD_BPeters.

525,TGT,"Wearable fitness device maker Fitbit (FIT) late Monday beat Wall Street's sales and earnings targets for the holiday quarter, but its guidance for the current quarter came up well short of analyst expectations.Fitbit shares were down 14% in after-hours trading following the earnings news. During the regular trading session Monday, Fitbit stock climbed 5.9% to 16.52.For the fourth quarter, Fitbit earned 35 cents a share, excluding items, on sales of $712 million. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected Fitbit to earn 25 cents a share ex items on sales of $648 million in the December quarter. On a year-over-year basis, sales jumped 92%, and non-GAAP earnings per share rose 67%.But for the current quarter, Fitbit is targeting non-GAAP earnings per share of 1 cent on sales of $430 million, based on the midpoint of its guidance. Analysts were modeling earnings of 23 cents a share on sales of $485 million in Q1.Fitbit Chief Financial Officer Bill Zerella told IBD that Q1 is a product-transition quarter, with the company launching its Blaze smart fitness watch and Alta fitness wristband in March, while discontinuing the Fitbit Charge.“Literally, a few weeks makes a difference,” he said. “We stopped shipping the Fitbit Charge, and the channel has been draining all of its inventory levels in preparation for the Alta.”The company will incur higher sales and marketing expenses this quarter as it launches the Alta and Blaze globally. Plus, Fitbit will see additional manufacturing expenses in Q1 as it seeks to maximize production of the new products, the company said in a press release.Fitbit’s full-year guidance is more indicative of the company’s outlook, Zerella said.For 2016, Fitbit expects to earn $1.14 per share minus items on sales of $2.45 billion, based on the midpoint of its guidance. The EPS goal is in line with the consensus of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. The sales goal is slightly higher than the $2.42 billion forecast by Wall Street.Preorders for the Blaze and Alta are exceeding the company's forecasts in both devices and attach rates for accessories, such as swappable wristbands, Zerella said.Another positive for Fitbit is companies buying activity trackers for employees as part of corporate wellness programs, he said. Fitbit added 1,000 new enterprise customers to its corporate wellness platform in Q4. Unit orders from enterprise customers can range from 500 for small and medium companies up to retailer Target (TGT) buying devices for all of its 330,000 employees.San Francisco-based Fitbit leads the wearable fitness tracker space, but it's facing heightened competition. For instance, Garmin (GRMN) on Friday announced two new fitness wearables that are slated to ship in the second quarter.Other competitors include Apple (AAPL), Fossil (FOSL), Jawbone, Microsoft (MSFT) and Under Armour (UA).Fitbit ended 2015 with 16.9 million active users, up more than 150% from 6.7 million at the end of 2014. It added 18 million new registered device users in 2015, of which 13 million, or 72%, were active users at year-end. It ended the year with 29 million registered device users. Fitbit sold 8.2 million connected health and fitness devices in Q4. The U.S. accounted for 75% of Q4 revenue. Europe, the Middle East and Africa accounted for 12% of sales. The Asia Pacific region contributed 8% of sales.“Much of our success is due to the power and size of our user community,” James Park, Fitbit co-founder and CEO, said on the company's conference call with analysts. “People are more likely to buy our products because their friends and family are already users. And they’re less likely to leave to a competitive ecosystem due to the same dynamics. This is a powerful competitive moat for our business.”

526,TGT,"Big Pharma player Allergan unveiled what it expects to be its final full year of operation as an independent drug maker before merging into Pfizer, reporting fourth-quarter 2015 earnings that beat expectations and revenue that barely topped Wall Street estimates.Before the market open, Allergan (AGN) said non-GAAP earnings rose 33% to $3.41 per share on a revenue gain of 74% to $4.2 billion. Both metrics exclude discontinuing operations, notably Allergan's Global Generics business that it agreed to sell in July.The Global Generics unit carries the old Actavis name and generic drugs lines of business. Actavis had purchased specialty drug and Botox maker Allergan, a deal that closed in March, and renamed itself Allergan.Allergan stock rose 3.7% in the stock market today, to 285.82, 16% off its all-time high of 340.34, touched July 29. Pfizer (PFE) stock rose 1.9% Monday to 30.05, 18% below a nearly 12-year high set July 31 at 36.46.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected Q4 EPS of $3.34 minus items, down 14.6% from $3.91 in 2014, on revenue of $4.192 billion, up 3.4% from Q4 2014's $4.057 billion, although analyst numbers apparently were not uniformly adjusted for discontinuing operations. Allergan presented the pro forma year-earlier numbers as adjusted EPS of $2.57 and revenue of $2.4 billion.For the full year, Allergan said non-GAAP EPS from continuing operations increased 78% to $13.43 on revenue from continuing operations up 124% to $15.07 billion. With varying adjustments, for the full 2015 analysts expected $15.43 per share minus items, up 66% from $9.29 in 2014, on sales of $18.206 billion, up 117% from $8.380 billion in 2014.Allergan reported a Q4  GAAP loss from continuing operations of $2.13 per share, compared to a GAAP loss from continuing operations of $4.48 per share in the prior-year period. It said full GAAP results were impacted by amortization and acquisition expenses, license agreements, impairments, and severance related mainly to the acquisition of Allergan on March 17,  and Kythera on Oct. 1, as well as research and development expenses resulting from the purchase of R&D assets of Mimetogen.Allergan had declined to freshen its guidance upon issuing its Q3 performance Nov. 4, citing early merger discussions with Pfizer back then. But Monday it guided 2016 revenue to about $17 billion, with ""no material changes to gross margins"" from current levels and a non-GAAP tax rate ""normalized"" to about 14%. Management didn't specify EPS for the year nor offer Q1 guidance other than suggesting Q1 performance would be the weakest of the year and fall below Q4 2015 results.Allergan's 2015 results were an analyst's challenge, influenced by its extraordinary M&A dance card. In Q3, it began discontinuing operations of the renamed Actavis generic lines, which it agreed to sell to Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA) in July for $40 billion.By Nov. 23, Allergan's board agreed to Pfizer's offer of 11.3 Pfizer shares for each Allergan share, then valuing Allergan at $363.63 a share, or $160 billion for the entire deal, expected to take nine months to close. CEO Brent Saunders told analysts in a conference call following the Q4 earnings release that he still expects the Pfizer buyout to close in the second half of 2016. It would be the second-largest acquisition ever, after the sale of Vodafone AirTouch in 1999 to Mannesmann for $202 billion. Dell's October offer to buy EMC (EMC) is valued at $67 billion. The Pfizer acquisition of Allergan is another in a thinning number of tax inversion deals that allow American companies to domicile in Ireland, Allergan's home base, where the buyer may enjoy a lower tax base. The Obama administration has criticized the practice and thrown up speed bumps, if not road blocks.On Feb. 8,  Pfizer said it plans to reorganize its two broad lines of business into three after the merger with Allergan is complete.Allergan CFO Tessa Hilado told analysts that debt stood at $42.7 billion on Dec. 31 and that $8 billion would be paid down after the close of the Teva sale. She put revenue from top-seller Botox at $656 million in Q4, with eye drug Restasis at $365 million, and Namenda XR at $190 million.  She said the CVS (CVS) purchase of Target (TGT) pharmacies ""had an effect in Q4"" on revenue, but that it didn't and wouldn't impact earnings.

528,TGT,"Shares of The Fresh Market (TFM) soared more than 20% Thursday before trading was halted on a report that the natural and organic grocery chain is in talks to be bought by supermarket giant Kroger (KR).The Fresh Market has been exploring a sale of the company, Reuters said, citing people familiar with the situation.Kroger is said to be a bidder in the second round of an auction process for the specialty grocery chain. Apollo Global Management (APO), KKR (KKR) and TPG Capital are also believed to be participating in the bidding, Reuters said.Shares of The Fresh Market closed 22.1% higher at 22.68 after trading resumed on the stock market today. Its stock had plunged 56% since March 2015 amid rising competition in organic foods from mainstream supermarkets such as Kroger as well as from big-box discounters like Wal-Mart Stores (WMT) and Target (TGT).Kroger closed down 1.1%. Among other organic grocers, Whole Foods (WFM) was up 0.2% and Sprouts Farmers Market (SFM) rallied 0.4%. Wal-Mart fell 0.7% and Target eased 1%.Whole Foods late Wednesday reported fiscal first quarter earnings and revenue that topped estimates.

529,TGT,"Sales of $2 billion are a drop in the bucket -- if you’re IBM (IBM) or Cisco Systems (CSCO).That’s how much tech giant IBM drew in 2015 security revenue. Networking giant Cisco pulled in $1.75 billion in security revenue. But security sales accounted for just 2.4% and 3%, respectively, of those companies’ multibillion-dollar top lines.Both IBM and Cisco say their cybersecurity revenue rose 12% last year. The growth outstripped pure players Symantec (SYMC) and Check Point Software Technology (CHKP). And the total dollar sales for IBM and Cisco easily topped total revenue for leading security pure players Palo Alto Networks (PANW), Proofpoint (PFPT), Fortinet (FTNT) and FireEye (FEYE).Cybersecurity Ventures CEO Steve Morgan says it’s just the beginning of a series of “knockdown, dragout brawls"" among tech giants IBM, Cisco, Dell and others specifically in the security software-and-services arena in 2016.And companies like IBM and Cisco don't enter the ring with kid gloves. This bare-knuckle  donnybrook for cybersecurity superiority will be fought with well-padded M&A budgets. The steep decline in security software stocks of late, amid fears of slowing spending on enterprise software, only raises the stakes, making some buyout targets likely more affordable.Lower spending could hit security vendors, but there's no debate that cybersecurity needs have grown. Hackers stormed the digital bulwarks of Target (TGT), Home Depot (HD), Sony (SNE), JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and the Office of Personnel Management in 2013, 2014 and 2015. That drove a lot of what Piper Jaffray analyst Andrew Nowinski calls “panic spending.”More than 60% of 137 chief information officers recently polled by Piper Jaffray had refreshed their security firewalls within the past 12 months. And firewall security ranked only No. 5 on a list of CIO priorities. Endpoint security, compliance, protecting Web applications, and internal-access management topped CIO priorities.These latter four segments will be hot M&A sectors this year, Nowinski says.“A lot of enterprises, in light of all the mega-breaches that occurred in 2014 and 2015, really beefed up and spent a lot on their network perimeters,” he told IBD. “After getting more comfortable with your perimeter (by beefing up firewalls) . . . you need to invest in technology that protects what the hackers are going after.”Symantec, Trend Micro and Intel (INTC)-owned McAfee lead the endpoint protection sector, according to Gartner. The market tracker says Imperva (IMPV) and F5 Networks (FFIV) top the Web-application firewall market, while CyberArk Software (CYBR) leads the internal-access management segment.Valuations skyrocketed in the hyperactive 2015 threat landscape, Nowinski says. Thus, last year wasn't one of big consolidation for cybersecurity.""Companies were trying to figure out what were the most strategic assets they needed to add to protect against the changing threat environment,"" he said. ""The threat environment was evolving very quickly and valuations were going through the roof with these mega-breaches.""Valuations, however, have plunged lately. IBD's 26-company Computer Software-Security industry group was down nearly 40% as of Friday from its 2015 high achieved July 24 -- after the group plunged 7.4% on Friday. From the start of 2015 through July 24, the group had rocketed 33%.The group tacked on another 7.2% loss by the closing bell Monday, as techs tumbled on the heels of poorly received forecasts from LinkedIn (LNKD) and Tableau Software (DATA), whose stocks sheared off after their quarterly reports last week. Cloud securer Qualys added to the pressure when, late Monday, the firm reported Q4 and 2015 sales that missed consensus views, and issued Q1 guidance that lagged Wall Street expectations.The mass high-tech selloff also plagued IBD’s 26-company Electronics Semiconductor-Fabless industry group, which landed down 4% and 2.8% on Friday and Monday, respectively.Still, a lot of big dollars are up for grabs in cybersecurity, FBR analyst Daniel Ives says. He estimates that spending on next-generation security wares will jump 30% in 2016, though total IT spending is seen rising just 3%.Gartner estimates that IT security spending will soar from $75 billion-plus in 2015 to $101 billion in 2018. Research firm Markets and Markets sees the cybersecurity market hitting $170 billion by 2020.""It's such an enormous growth segment, in a very choppy environment,"" Ives told IBD. ""It's pent-up demand and it's the massive threat environment. . . . You look at the technology landscape and cybersecurity is a priority.""As nontraditional security firms jump on the cybersecurity bandwagon, no potential M&A is off limits, Cybersecurity Ventures' Morgan says.""If you look at the cybersecurity industry, there are not a lot of unicorns,"" he said. ""What we're seeing is (startups) will raise $10 million to $100 million . . . to ratchet up and get acquired by multimillion-dollar tech companies.""In January, FireEye stirred the M&A dust with a $200 million acquisition of cyberthreat intelligence firm iSight Partners, expanding its portfolio again after its $1 billion Mandiant acquisition in 2014.""That's where we're going to see the market,"" Morgan said. ""Any company that has successfully raised (venture capital) funding would be a takeover candidate.""Alan Kessler, CEO of privately held Vormetric, calls these ""tuck-in acquisitions.""""I think the pace of acquisitions is probably going to accelerate simply because of what's happening in the overall market demand for solutions,"" Kessler told IBD, ""but also the fact that some of the smaller players may have difficulty getting funding at a valuation that is appealing to their investors.""Vormetric falls into that ""tuck-in"" field. The encryption specialist is in the process of being acquired by Thales, a French company focused on ""creating a safer world,"" according to its website.Thales isn't a pure cybersecurity player but it touches 80% of online-processing payments, Kessler says. Vormetric will be threaded into Thales' data security group when the transaction closes, likely in late March.Kessler expects IBM and Cisco to continue adding new cybersecurity offerings to their portfolios. And the market recognizes that -- big tech firms know enterprise-level software, Enterprise Strategy Group analyst Jon Oltsik told IBD.""There's consolidation in the customers, the enterprise; they want to buy fewer tools from fewer vendors,"" Oltsik said. ""They want an integrated platform because what we've done in the past isn't working anymore.""And the efficiency of the technology has to be enterprise class, so that kind of speaks to the bigger vendors who know how to service the enterprise.""In the largest pure-tech merger ever, Dell last year agreed to acquire EMC for $67 billion in -- and thereby got its hands on EMC's RSA security business. In December, Dell confirmed rumors that it filed a $2 billion IPO for its SecureWorks business, which it acquired in 2011 for $612 million.""They single out cybersecurity and decide that's their spinoff?"" Morgan said. ""That says a lot about the market.""The pure players have done some tucking of their own. In 2015, Fortinet acquired Meru Networks for $44 million and Check Point spent $80 million on Lacoon Mobile Security.Also in 2015, Cisco followed up its $2.7 billion acquisition of Sourcefire in 2013 by acquiring OpenDNS for $635 million. And Raytheon acquired Websense for $1.9 billion, to create privately held Forcepoint.Between 2014 and 2015, Microsoft (MSFT) -- which Oltsik calls a cybersecurity ""wild card"" -- spent $600 million to buy three Israeli cybersecurity firms.""You would not call Microsoft a cybersecurity company,"" Morgan says. ""But you're starting to see them get very active in cyber. IBM would be another interesting company.""In 2015, IBM's total sales fell 12%, to $81.7 billion, even as its cybersecurity sales rose 12% to $2 billion.""That's a lot (of growth) when you're counting in the billions,"" Morgan said. ""That's not on a lot of people's radar. That gets lost a little bit in the context of much bigger companies.""FireEye's iSight acquisition is the only confirmed M&A in the sector this year. But CyberArk stock surged in January on rumors that Check Point is seeking to acquire it. Culturally, it makes sense --  they're both Israeli firms, Ives says.Should Check Point and CyberArk merge, such a deal would be larger than a tuck-in, Morgan says. Although Check Point is much larger -- with a $13.5 billion market value to CyberArk's $1.3 billion -- both are credible performers, he said.""I'm not sure we'd call that a merger or an acquisition,"" he said. ""CyberArk and Check Point, if that were to happen, I think you're looking at two companies coming together and looking to move into a much larger position in the market.""Cisco, Oracle (ORCL), IBM, Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) and Symantec will stoke 2016 M&A, Ives says. He lists Qualys (QLYS), CyberArk, Fortinet, FireEye and Imperva on his takeover list. He says the timing is especially ripe for Symantec to make an acquisition.Symantec completed its Veritas sale to the Carlyle Group on Jan. 29,  saying it received $5.3 billion in after-tax proceeds from the deal. Symantec acquired data storage firm Veritas for $13.5 billion in 2005, a deal that many analysts questioned.Mountain View, Calif.-based Symantec struggled in 2015, when revenue fell 2.4% to $6.54 billion. Now, Symantec will apply the cash from the Veritas sale toward an acquisition that strengthens its position, Nowinski said.Oltsik sees platform plays taking out Resilient Systems, Phantom Cyber, Invotas or ServiceNow (NOW) as automation becomes an increasingly important piece of cybersecurity. Smaller firms like Malwarebytes and Code DX also could be swept into the M&A frenzy, Morgan says.""In a different tech sector, where there's not as much M&A activity, you have to be doing some very cutting-edge things to be an acquisition target,"" he said. ""Here, if you walk and talk and raise money in the cybersecurity space, you're a target.""

559,TGT,"Amazon (AMZN) has ""unmatched"" growth among buyers of clothing and consumables, according to Cowen & Co, as traditional brick-and-mortar retailers Target (TGT) and Wal-Mart (WMT) struggle to catch up to the e-commerce giant's gains.According the Cowen Consumer Survey, buyers of Amazon's clothing grew 35% year over year in November, marking an acceleration from the previous month and contrasting sharply to Wal-Mart's 8% decline and Target's 9% fall.Across three years of the firm's surveys, the number of Amazon apparel purchasers has grown about 30% on average, year over year. Meanwhile, Wal-Mart apparel purchasers have notched down about 4%, and Target has slipped 2.5%.The apparel retail space, in particular, has been struggling amid a promotional environment and competition from online sellers. Cowen projected in July that Amazon would knock out Macy's (M) as the top U.S. apparel retailer by 2017.Buyers of the e-commerce seller's consumables, which includes household, personal care, pet and children's and baby products, have accelerated ""meaningfully"" in 2015.Amazon consumables customers grew 26% in November from the same period last year, while Wal-Mart's declined 6% and Target slipped 4%.Over the last seven quarters, buyers of Amazon consumables have risen an average of 27%, year over year. Meanwhile, Wal-Mart's consumables purchasers have fallen an average of 4%, and Target customers have slipped about 1%, year over year.The average Amazon customer has a household income of about $62,900, found Cowen, about 12% higher than the average Wal-Mart customer and about 6% lower than the average Target customer, and 19% and 21% lower than Costco (COST) and Macy's customers, respectively.Prime subscribers — which make up almost half of all Amazon purchasers domestically — are seen as a driver of U.S. household penetration, said the firm, which estimates that there about are 41 million Prime subscribers in the U.S.Prime subscribers tend to be a bit wealthier and a bit younger than the average Amazon customer, with an average income of $69,300 and an average age of 36.5 years old. The average Amazon purchaser is about 40 years old.""Amazon continues to grow its Prime subs in the US at a very healthy rate, despite more than 1 in 3 Internet connected households indicating they live in a Prime household,"" wrote Cowen analysts. ""Since the inception of our Survey, Amazon Prime (households) have more than doubled, growing from 18% in December '12 to 39% in November '15.

560,TGT,"With the Federal Reserve set for a two-day, no-action meeting, Chairwoman Janet Yellen has reason to smile: Finally, investors and central bankers are on the same page.Despite the universal view that the Fed won't touch rates this week and the strong sense that policymakers won't sound any less dovish after another quarter of dismal growth, Treasury yields just rose for the sixth straight day, albeit to a historically low 1.91%, from 1.75% on April 15.In other words, markets are doing the Fed's work for it -- without throwing a tantrum. That, in turn, may give Fed policymakers a bit more patience to stick with their recent shift toward erring on the side of being too dovish.The first real test of the Fed's messaging won't come this week, but in June. That's when policymakers will have to show their cards by updating their expectations for the trajectory of Fed rate hikes. The big question then will be whether the Fed is on track for two quarter-point hikes this year, as indicated after the March meeting, or just one -- as financial markets currently predict.The CME Group's FedWatch page shows that markets see a 0% chance of a rate hike this week. November is the first meeting with better-than-even odds of a rate hike, at 53%, but Sept. 21 meeting odds are just a whisker below 50%.On Monday, the U.S. dollar index dipped a quarter-point to 94.8, having barely budged after a two-day tumble set in motion by Fed policymakers cutting their 2016 rate-hike plans in half in March. An abbreviated dollar rally got its legs cut out from under it two weeks later when Yellen gave a speech signaling that the Fed has become the world's central bank -- at least for the moment.Yellen highlighted the economic and financial risk tied to China's link to the dollar, and she noted the plight of other commodity-dominated emerging economies that borrow in dollars. The stronger dollar, after its biggest rise in decades starting in late 2014, had exacerbated those international pressures while also depressing the earnings of U.S. multinationals.In the same speech, Yellen said that the level of the fed funds rate, still close to zero, left central bankers low on ammunition, but she said that it's a reason for greater caution against raising rates too quickly.The modest weakening of the dollar, especially if it continues, is good news for the earnings of corporations from Wal-Mart (WMT) to Apple (AAPL), General Electric (GE) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL). All have cited the negative impact of currency swings in recent quarters.A weaker dollar should, over time, be positive for net exports and business investment, two economic soft spots that the Fed highlighted. A weaker greenback has also helped push up the price of dollar-denominated commodities, including crude oil.Despite some lackluster data recently, including disappointing retail sales and a slower rise in core inflation in March, Harm Bandholz, chief U.S. economist at UniCredit Research, sees renewed rate hikes no later than September.Because the June meeting comes just a week before the Brits vote whether to leave the European Union, the Fed's decision will be a close call, Bandholz says.""The tightness in financial conditions (early in the year) has been reversed,"" he said.With payrolls growing by about 2% a year and a little bit of real wage growth on top, the Fed's outlook is ""fundamentally all on track.""Incoming data, particularly faster wage growth, could shift up the timetable of rate hikes. Last week, Target (TGT) hiked its minimum wage to $10 an hour, following recent wage boosts from Wal-Mart and Costco (COST).

561,TGT,"Sellers battered retailers on Wednesday on a range of company and earnings news, but discount chains have held up better.In late trading, retail and apparel industry groups had 16 of the day’s 20 worst losses among the 197 groups tracked by IBD.That’s a tough day.The stock market has been hard in general on the retail sector, with retail groups holding four of the 10 worst industry rankings. One exception has been discount and variety stores, essentially the dollar-store chains. Those were in the top five rankings on Wednesday and have held top-20 rankings for nearly eight straight weeks.Dollar stores for the past several years have offered a combination of defensive and offensive plays. Like Wal-Mart (WMT) and Target (TGT), the stores tend to attract more customers when economic times turn tough, as consumers hold down spending. At the same time, they have provided a growth story as the once highly fragmented industry consolidates into a smaller numbers of larger players.But the group wasn’t immune to Wednesday’s selling pressure.Get a closer look at Macy's fine points using IBD's Stock Checkup feature.Five Below (FIVE), Big Lots (BIG), Dollar Tree (DLTR), Ollie’s Bargain Outlets (OLLI) and Dollar General (DG)  slid.But none of that really caused any chart damage within the group, with one exception. Five Below pared its losses after diving almost 8% in opening trade. It had already tripped a sell signal last week, after falling more than 8% below a 42.36 buy point. Wednesday's action showed the stock losing its grip on its 50-day moving average. It also sent shares more than 8% below a prior buy point of 41.57, triggering a sell rule for investors who bought at that level.Ollie’s has been the group’s barn-burner, ripping ahead 27% from a March 18 breakout to a peak on April 28. Anywhere above a 20% increase from the buy point would have been a good place for investors to book profits. Those who held on rode a pullback over the past three weeks. Shares are now testing support at the 10-week moving average and about 10% above the stock's buy point.If the stock rises off its 10-week line in strong trade, it would present an add-on buying opportunity. If it cuts that line in heavy trade, it could mark a sell signal, depending on how severely the stock breaks support.Ollie’s sells name-brand goods -- from clothing to sporting goods to flooring and food -- at steep discounts. The bargain chain operates some 200 stores across the East.Dollar General took a light bounce off support at its 10-week moving average. It is working on the sixth week of a flat base with an 87.52 buy point. It is in a base-on-base pattern, with its low sitting around the high of a prior base. Dollar General broke out of that pattern after reporting its Q4 results on March 10. The company plans to report Q1 results on May 19.All the companies in the group operate on a January year-end calendar.Dollar Tree had outflanked Dollar General last year, spending $8.5 billion to win over Family Dollar and bump Dollar General out of a bid for market dominance. The deal left the dollar-store market with two peers of essentially equal size: Dollar Tree-Family Dollar with nearly 14,000 stores and Dollar General with just under 13,000.Dollar General's revenue for fiscal 2015 was $20.4 billion. Dollar Tree-Family Dollar booked revenue of $15.5 billion. In terms of earnings, analysts' consensus is for a 15% rise in Dollar General’s EPS this year in what would make a tenth straight advance.Dollar Tree’s outlook: a 55% jump in EPS and a 35% surge in revenue as the company fully digests Family Dollar. Next year estimates slow to a 23% earnings gain and a 6% sales rise.Despite the sharp upturn in financials, the jury is still out among investors with regard to the Dollar Tree-Family Dollar combo. Shares have traded sideways since January after recovering from an October low, but they remain about 6% below their March 2015 high.Big Lots is the group’s struggling turnaround story. Quarterly earnings and revenue have wobbled up and down. The stock continues to trade at about 14% below a November 2014 high.The stock is basing, but fundamentals continue to look weak. Earnings are forecast to grow 11% this year on a 1% revenue gain, rising to a 14% gain next year with revenue growth holding steady.

563,TGT,"The contentious issue over whether the U.S. government should be able to force tech companies to weaken security on their smartphones and software apps so that law enforcement agencies can access private data isn’t likely to be resolved soon.But it could be.All it would take is for President Barack Obama to make a statement supporting strong encryption on tech devices and Internet services.Obama holds himself up as a tech-savvy president, but his lack of leadership on the encryption issue has prolonged the dispute between the federal government and tech firms, tech groups and privacy advocates say.“The White House should be leading on this issue,” said Cindy Cohn, executive director of the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF). “President Obama is trying to be the best tech president ever. He’s got really good technical consultants, and the idea that he wouldn’t listen to them is shocking.”The tech industry is united in its call to keep encryption strong, saying that weakening software security or creating back doors for authorities to bypass privacy protections opens the door for hackers and criminals.“The math doesn’t change,” Cohn said. “The math is the problem that the FBI has, which is: They cannot build a back door that only they can use. It doesn’t matter which technical expert you bring to bear on it. … This isn’t controversial in the tech community.”The FBI has sought court orders in two criminal cases to try to compel Apple (AAPL) to unlock password-protected iPhones. In both cases, the FBI ultimately backed down when it found other ways to access data on the devices. One involved paying a third party to hack the phone, and the other was resolved when the phone’s owner provided the password.Last September, EFF, Access Now, and a coalition of nonprofit and industry groups launched a public petition calling on President Obama to defend strong encryption and oppose back doors. They used the We The People API, Obama’s preferred petition tool, and quickly surpassed 100,000 signatures.Despite the White House’s pledge to respond to petitions with 100,000 signatures within 60 days, it has remained quiet and is now four months overdue in its response.But if Obama doesn’t support strong encryption for businesses and consumers, perhaps the next president will. On Wednesday, 13 U.S. tech industry groups representing companies such as Apple, Amazon.com (AMZN), Facebook (FB) and Uber Technologies urged the two presumptive major party presidential nominees to support strong commercial encryption.The encryption stance is among a list of tech industry requests made in an open letter to Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican Donald Trump.The trade groups asked the candidates to strengthen cybersecurity and encourage other governments to do the same. The letter urged the candidates to recognize the importance of encryption as a critical security tool and to advance policies that enhance data privacy.Groups signing the letter included the Consumer Technology Association, the Business Software Alliance, the Internet Association and the Semiconductor Industry Association.The encryption issue made headlines earlier this year when the FBI secured a federal court order to force Apple to unlock a smartphone belonging to deceased San Bernardino, Calif., shooter Syed Farook. Apple fought the order, saying it would set a dangerous precedent.To help educate the public, Apple CEO Tim Cook stepped up to become the face of consumer data security. He gave high-profile media interviews and made public statements about the importance of strong encryption.Apple’s fight to protect its encryption is about securing the data on all iPhones in use from bad guys, Cook said. That means securing customers’ data, including financial and health information, confidential business documents, private communications and photos.The FBI might have retreated in the cases of the San Bernardino terrorist and a Brooklyn drug dealer, but it is likely to pursue similar cases against tech companies in the future. Unless the White House tells it not to.Meanwhile, law enforcement supporters on Capitol Hill are crafting legislation that could force tech companies to comply with all law enforcement demands for customer data.Sens. Richard Burr, R-N.C., and Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., have proposed the “Compliance With Court Orders Act of 2016.” As drafted, the legislation would require any individual or company to comply with any U.S. court order and hand over data to authorities, including data that is encrypted. The bill has been roundly criticized by civil liberties and digital privacy groups.“I don’t think anything will happen in this session of Congress,” said Gary Shapiro, president of the the Consumer Technology Association. Political gridlock, especially during an election year, will ensure that no encryption bill is passed in Congress, he said.It is more likely that a court case will work its way up to the Supreme Court over the next couple of years, he said.Even if the FBI gets what it wants from the courts or Congress, the law would only be enforceable in the U.S. Foreign companies and their encrypted products would be unaffected, putting U.S. tech firms at a competitive disadvantage, Shapiro said.Public support for encryption is growing, especially in light of major data breaches at companies like Anthem (ANTM), eBay (EBAY), Home Depot (HD), JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Target (TGT), as well as at government agencies, Cohn said.“We don’t live in a world where computer security is abstract and the damages and problems it causes for people are something that’s theoretical anymore,” Cohn said. “I think it strikes a lot of people as absurd that the government is engaging in trying to attack our security and undermine it and convince companies to give less of it when it should be their job to promote it.”Weakening security on mobile devices and software, says Shapiro, would destroy the confidence people have in businesses to keep their private data secure.

565,TGT,"After crawling ahead at just a 0.5% annual pace in the first quarter, the slowest in two years, the American economy is due for a bounce -- but how high?The jury is out whether the economy has simply hit another speed bump or is facing a more fundamental slowdown, but some details in Thursday's Commerce Department report point to the latter.U.S. GDP also fizzled at the start of 2014 and 2015, shrinking 0.9% in the former and edging up 0.6% last year, only to come charging back in the second quarter, growing 4.9% and 3.9% respectively. But the momentum didn't last, with full-year GDP rising a moderate 2.4% in both 2014 and 2015.Yet it's iffy whether the economy can rebound to the same extent this year and offset the impact of a weak first quarter. Something has to give: If the economy doesn't speed up in a big way, it's hard to see how employers can keep adding 200,000-plus jobs per month.On the plus side, some really bad news is out of the way.Financial markets have rallied from an early 2016 rout after hitting bottom on Feb. 11.After crashing well below $30 a barrel, oil prices have climbed back above $45. That should mean a gradual easing of the sector's hit to capital spending, though ConocoPhillips (COP) on Thursday cut its capex forecast yet again. Overall, business fixed investment fell at a 5.9% annual rate in Q1, the worst decline since Q2 2009, at the tail end of the last recession.Inventory destocking, which subtracted one-third of a percentage point from GDP growth -- and acted as a drag for the third straight quarter -- may be less of an issue going forward.Lastly, the 3.6% drop in defense spending looks like an anomaly, according to Nariman Behravesh, chief economist at IHS Global Insight. ""Given the end of the sequester on spending,"" budget analysts expected an increase in spending, he wrote.Behravesh thinks 3% GDP growth the rest of the year is likely, with growth of 2% or more this quarter.Yet there are reasons to question whether the economy will be quite as resilient.Although this year's headline Q1 GDP figure wasn't especially weak relative to the starts of 2014 and 2015, real final sales to domestic purchasers rose just 1.2%, the weakest annualized gain since Q2 2013. Real sales, which strip out net exports and inventory investment, is ""about as core a measure of GDP as there is,"" wrote Steve Blitz, chief economist at ITG Investment Research.His point is that U.S. final demand has been softening more than it did at the start of the past two years. Personal consumption expenditures rose a mild 1.9% from Q4, the weakest in a year. And spending on goods rose just 0.1%, the worst in nearly five years. Spending on durable goods, such as autos, fell 1.6%. It's unclear whether General Motors (GM) and Ford (F) can continue to propel sales higher to help fuel the economy this year.Blitz noted that 41% of the increase in consumer spending went toward rent and health, leaving modest gains in the rest of the consumer sector.Meanwhile, the Commerce Department said that the saving rate rose to 5.2% of disposable income, tied for the highest since 2012.Little wonder that a wide swath of corporations, from Wall Street banks to food companies and big industrial firms, are redoubling efforts to squeeze costs to boost earnings with domestic and global demand so sluggish.Residential fixed investment surged 14.8%, the best in four years and good news for the likes of Home Depot (HD). That contributed 0.49 percentage point to the rise in GDP growth -- basically the whole thing.Whether the economy bounces back as strongly as last year will ultimately depend on income growth, and so far the data don't look great, despite solid job gains. One problem may be that those gains have been tilted toward lower-pay jobs.Despite recent pay hikes from Wal-Mart (WMT), Costco (COST) and Target (TGT), federal income and employment taxes withheld from paychecks are up 3.3% from a year ago since mid-March. That's an improvement from growth below 3% earlier in the year, but still well below the 5%-plus gains that helped the economy rebound a year ago.

567,TGT,"Fitbit (FIT) stock went on a post-Thanksgiving turkey trot on Monday after getting an analyst upgrade. Barclays analyst Matthew McClintock on Monday upgraded Fitbit stock to overweight from equal weight with a price target of 49. Fitbit was up more than 2.5%, near 28.50, in afternoon trading on the stock market today.Fitbit, the top maker of activity trackers and fitness bands, went public on June 18 at 20. It climbed as high as 51.90 on Aug. 5 before investors got vertigo. Its shares tumbled on concerns about increased competition and profit erosion.Fitbit's recent stock decline is unwarranted, McClintock said in a research report. The company has ""meaningful catalysts"" ahead including holiday season sales, the CES trade show, new product launches and corporate wellness deals, he said.""Considering that Fitbit is the fastest-growing meaningful consumer company in the world at 140%+ revenue year over year in 2015 (in a world lacking true growth stories), we believe the current valuation levels are just too compelling to ignore,"" he said.Wearables appear to be one of the winning product categories this holiday and Fitbit is the brand of choice, according to retail channel checks, he said. Plus, Fitbit was less discounted than its peers over the Black Friday weekend, McClintock said.Retailers Best Buy (BBY), Target (TGT) and Kohl's (KSS) cited strong wearable device sales in recent reports.""We estimate that Fitbit can grow annual revenue by at least 40% over the next several years, which could ultimately prove conservative (our upside case is for Fitbit to grow revenue almost 70% over the next several years),"" McClintock said. ""Our estimates for revenue growth are entirely driven by overall category growth/consumer adoption as well as geographic expansion (Fitbit's global operations currently represent less than 25% of sales).""Pacific Crest Securities analyst Brad Erickson said his retail channel checks on Black Friday indicated soft in-store fitness tracker sales. However, online sales may have offset weaker brick-and-mortar sales.Fitbit saw ""slightly disappointing in-store demand,"" Erickson said in a report Sunday.""Our checks indicate that wearable devices overall, and Fitbit specifically, underperformed store expectations on Black Friday, driven by strong Apple Watch sales and a likely channel shift toward online,"" he said. ""Historically, Fitbit has done as much as 40% of its sales through online channels, and we think this holiday could index above those levels. So while we're noting the in-store feedback as a modest negative, we're not ruling out that the fitness category's likely higher proclivity toward online channels may have provided Fitbit some offset to this softness.""Erickson rates Fitbit stock as overweight with a price target of 47.Fitbit likely didn't see any meaningful market share loss to rival activity trackers from Garmin (GRMN) and others over Black Friday weekend, he said. But Apple 's (AAPL) Apple Watch smartwatch, which was discounted by some retailers, could have impacted wearables demand, he said.RELATED:Fitbit, Apple Watch demand up ahead of holidaysFitbit takes ill as secondary stock offer cuts value.

The one-day promotion drove thousands to buy the $99-a-year loyalty program, which includes perks such as free two-day shipping, access to streaming video content and free e-books. Prime Day added 1% to Amazon's overall sales, the company said on its Q3 earnings conference call.Prime shoppers buy more than non-Prime shoppers.Wells Fargo analyst Matt Nemer, asked to identify one reason for Amazon's ongoing growth, pointed to Prime.""That's their weapon right now (fulfillment),"" Nemer told IBD in an interview about Amazon's competitive position in the market.

574,TGT,"Special Report: CES 2016 Tech Show NewsA burgeoning class of consumer electronics devices at CES 2016 features sensors that can analyze your breath for odors and sniff the air around you for pollutants.Let's call this new group of gadgets ""smell tech"" for lack of a better term.Portable BreathalyzersOne of the pioneers in the field is BACtrack, which has been selling portable breathalyzers for measuring blood alcohol content (BAC) for 12 years. The company's current device is the $99 BACtrack Mobile, which connects wirelessly with a smartphone app.It's as accurate as the professional devices police use, said Keith Nothacker, founder and CEO of San Francisco-based BACtrack. The product is sold online and through major retailers like Best Buy ([STOCK[BBY]]), Costco ([STOCK[COST]]) and Target ([STOCK[TGT]]).BACtrack has about 65% market share in the category, Nothacker said. One reason for this is because rival products aren't very good, he said.""It's hard to make an accurate alcohol test,"" he said.BACtrack sees two main types of customers: serious buyers and curious buyers. The serious buyers include people who drink alcohol and want to make sure they're OK to drive. This includes sales people who drink socially while on the job, Nothacker said.Curious buyers include people who just want to find out how many drinks it takes for them to be over the legal limit, he said.Checking For Bad BreathBurlingame, Calif.-based Breathometer got its start making devices to test for alcohol but has since expanded its mission.In the second quarter, Breathometer plans to release the Mint wireless oral health monitor. Sensors in the device measure biomarkers that come with bad breath.But Breathometer is broadly interested in oral health care because certain compounds in breath correlate to disease, such as gum disease, says Royal Wang, senior R&D engineer for Breathometer.The Mint device will cost $99. A Philips branded version of the product will be available in the third quarter bundled with other oral health care products, Wang said.Sniffing Out Fat BurnSeattle-based Medamonitor used CES to introduce a device called Levl that can tell how much fat you're burning by measuring the acetone in your breath.""What Levl is trying to do is change the conversation about weight loss from the scale to metabolism,"" said Joe Anderson, a breath science expert for Levl.Bathroom scales can't tell you what's going on in your body. They can't distinguish between weight associated with water, muscle or fat.Levl uses breath pods that are inserted into a base station for analysis. The device pairs with a smartphone app for presenting results about fat-burning metabolism.The Levl device is expected to go on sale later this year. Pricing is still to be decided.Air Pollution MonitorsA number of companies at CES 2016 were showing off devices that measure indoor and outdoor air quality. They include Luxembourg-based Foobot and Shenzhen, China-based Quality Air [PAGE[Technology]].The Foobot is packed with sensors for measuring indoor air pollutants that can adversely impact your health. They include chemicals like formaldehyde and benzene, dust, carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide. The Foobot indoor air quality monitor costs $199.Quality Air sells a wearable air quality detector and a wearable air purifier.

And the feedback we're getting from customers (is positive).""The Fitbit Blaze fills a gap in the company's product lineup, he said. It's targeted at fitness enthusiasts who want a device with a bigger screen that has more general-purpose capabilities.For Fitbit, the device will provide a higher average selling price and offers high-margin accessories.Fitbit Blaze will cost $199 when it goes on sales in March. That's a ""sweet spot"" for consumers, Park said. By comparison, the entry-level Apple Watch costs $349.People like to speculate about how competitive Fitbit is with Apple, but Park says that's not his concern.""Ultimately we are focused on our customers,"" Park said. ""General-purpose smartwatches really haven't taken off. There's confusion about what they're good for. Consumers are confused by the shear amount of stuff that these devices can do.""So, look, our focus is: Fitness first. Our mission is around digital health, having devices and services that address people's lifestyle health goals, and in the future, hopefully more chronic conditions.""Meanwhile, new competitors in the fitness tracker space emerged at CES including Under Armour ([STOCK[UA]]), Fossil ([STOCK[FOSL]]) and New Balance.Fitbit has successfully fended off such rivals as Nike ([STOCK[NKE]]) and Philips, Park said. It will continue to focus on its competitive advantages of its large user base and community features.Park says it's still early days for market penetration of wearable fitness devices.Fitbit also is facing a consumer class-action lawsuit about the accuracy of the heart-rate monitors on its fitness bands. Park said the lawsuit is without merit.""Consumers are really happy with the device,"" Park said. ""All you have to do is go to Amazon ([STOCK[AMZN]]) and see the reviews for Charge HR. Regardless of what the litigation says from the plaintiffs' attorneys, you have to look at the true consumer sentiment and I think people are pretty satisfied.""Fitbit stock fell 6.1% to 21.50 on the stock market today, hitting a record low for a third straight day. Fitbit stock fell 18.4% on Tuesday and 5.8% on Wednesday, as the stock market overall corrected. On Thursday, Fitbit came close to hitting its IPO price of 20 from last June, but it closed its first day of trading near 30.

577,TGT,"CyberArk Software (CYBR) launched an alliance Wednesday, tapping FireEye (FEYE), Intel (INTC) and Symantec (SYMC) for what it called tighter best-of-breed integration, which offers an alternative to security platforms from such companies as Palo Alto Networks (PANW), Check Point Software Technology (CHKP) and Fortinet (FTNT).In total, the C3 Alliance has 15 members across cybersecurity, enterprise software and infrastructure. They include Qualys (QLYS), Rapid7 (RPD), Varonis Systems (VRNS) and Belden (BDC)-owned Tripwire. CyberArk tech will be integrated into the partners' software.Megabreaches like that of retailer Target (TGT) in 2014 have highlighted the need to secure credentialed accounts, says Adam Bosnian, CyberArk's executive vice president of global business development. Privileged account protection is at CyberArk's core.""We saw more and more organizations becoming aware of being exposed by these power accounts,"" Bosnian told IBD. The C3 Alliance aims to ""solve these challenges and leverage the valuable data that comes off that security.""CyberArk's technology will be integrated in a variety of ways, Bosnian said. C3 member Tenable Network Security, a continuous monitoring and vulnerability management company, requires credentialed access to perform deep-dive hunting for vulnerabilities, Tenable strategist Cris Thomas told IBD.A hacker needs only one credential to wreak havoc.""When a hacker attacks an organization, they compromise one specific point,"" Thomas said. ""To move, they need a Zero Day (vulnerability). ... The easiest way to do it is to steal credentials. Those are the prized goals of an attacker.""Integrating technology from CyberArk and Tenable lets Tenable's 20,000 customers store credentialed passwords using CyberArk software, he said. It also gums up any holes existing between the vendors' software, making intrusion that much more difficult.Bosnian doesn't foresee ""one-off, snowflake"" integrations. He sees CyberArk tech, in conjunction with partners' software, providing a platform-like infrastructure, constantly evolving as new integrations are added to the mix.Customers are still leery of the platform, which might be ""best-of-breed in one piece of the platform but not in another,"" Bosnian said. The C3 Alliance, however, is comprised of best-of-breed tech woven into one unified solution that shares data bidirectionally, he says.C3 is not a monolithic alliance, he said.""These partners are improving how they use privileged accounts in their environment,"" he said. ""The real magic is when there are use cases built on top of that to solve real problems. That's what we're trying to do.""CyberArk stock was up 2% in midday trading in the stock market today.

578,TGT,"It’s hard for many coffee lovers these days to imagine the world before Starbucks (SBUX). It’s a bit less difficult to recall life before Perfumania (PERF).The two companies went public six months apart in 1991-92. Both had hot starts on the market. Yet today, Starbucks trades at what feels like a skillion times its June 29, 1992, IPO price and has underwritten many a happy retirement.Today, Perfumania trades at a fraction of its Dec. 20, 1991, launch price. The stock has risen briefly above its starting level only three times in the past 25 years.Were those fortunes apparent in the stories of the two stocks at their christenings? The answer is ""somewhat yes"" and highlights the importance of understanding the story of an IPO -- in order to judge the degree of risk you are taking on before you jump into early-stage, unproven stocks.The period of 1991-92 was busy for IPOs. Snapple (now Dr Pepper Snapple (DPS)) went public at 20 on Dec. 15, 1992. It ran up 100% in eight days, slumped into a five-month IPO, then broke out to spike another 200% in four months. Bed, Bath & Beyond (BBBY) went public on June 5, 1992. It formed a tight seven-week cup base, broke out and scorched out a 272% rally in 15 months.Starbucks may have been a hard sell for a lot of folks. Founded in 1971, it ended 1987 with 11 stores. Over the next three years, it grew to more than 125. It spread from Seattle north to Vancouver, B.C., south to Los Angeles and east to Chicago. The growth was impressive, but for some consumers, the idea of standing in line for a $3 cup of coffee was tough to imagine.Additional uncertainty came from existing brands, such as Folgers and Maxwell House, which were reportedly working on premium brands at the time.Perfumania, on the other hand, was perhaps an easy-to-digest concept: discount perfume sold at specialty stores, aimed at stealing market share from the pricey department store market. Like Starbucks, it expanded quickly: from three stores to 70 stores in the three years up through 1989. As a result, it carried a heavy debt burden that forced maneuvers such as paying 24% interest to a Japanese financier in order to purchase inventory.Perfumania lost money in 1989 and 1990. Its two quick public offerings in 1991 and 1992 brought in $42 million and solved the debt problem. But the company remained vulnerable due to buying its product on an international “gray market” -- distribution channels that, while technically legal, are not authorized by brand manufacturers. They are the same channels that Wal-Mart (WMT) and Target (TGT) use. But the risk was higher for a monorail retailer like Perfumania.Perfumania was trading 153% above its IPO price in June 1992, when allegations of selling fake name-brand perfume hit shares hard. The stock lost 67% of its value in four weeks and never fully recovered. Starbucks, meanwhile, had climbed 118% by the end of 1992. The stock ended that year with an 84 EPS Rating, an 88 RS. Very respectable. Today, an investors who had placed $10,000 on Starbucks' IPO would have nearly $1.7 million plus dividends to show for it.

580,TGT,"As a leading operator of work-site child-care centers, Bright Horizons Family Solutions (BFAM) is happiest when the labor market is thriving.When employers dangle perks to attract and retain talent, the company benefits. After all, work-site child care is one of those perks.""The competition for professional talent has continued to be a tailwind for us,"" CEOe David Lissy told IBD. ""We do business with companies in every sector of the economy.""Since its founding in 1986, Bright Horizons has operated child-care and early-education centers for large companies, mostly in on-site centers. Many of its early customers were big investment banks and money centers.JPMorgan Chase (JPM) remains one of its biggest clients. Other large customers include Comcast (CMCSA) NBC Universal, General Mills (GIS), Target (TGT) and Home Depot (HD).Many of the firm’s newest clients are smaller companies and in technology, higher education, biotech and health care, Lissy says. Recent new customers include visual computing firm Nvidia (NVDA) and Dignity Health, the largest hospital company in California.At year-end, Bright Horizons operated 932 child care and early education centers. Most are in the U.S., with others in the U.K., Ireland, Canada, the Netherlands and a single location in India.JP Morgan analyst Andrew Steinerman notes that demand for high-quality licensed child care such as Bright Horizons' is driven by a ""high proportion"" of dual-income families.""Once employers offer child care, the benefit is difficult to take away,"" he wrote in a research report.The company’s core users are mostly the preschool-age children of professional working parents, who typically have household incomes above $100,000 a year, Lissy says. Employers subsidize a portion of the costs, about 25% on average.A growing number of its centers are off-premise hybrids called lease consortiums, which take in kids from parents working for multiple employers as well as from the community. These centers are typically in urban markets such as New York and San Francisco.Unlike its other centers, Bright Horizons usually builds lease consortiums. Until five years ago, it had been opening only a small number each year, but in the past five years it’s been opening 15 to 20 a year for a total of around 250.""We saw an emerging need in and around major cities,"" Lissy said.Analyst Jeff Silber of BMO Capital Markets says such new office complexes with onsite child-care centers typically offer tenants in the building first dibs and discounts.""If they can’t fill them up, they open (spaces) to the outside. It’s been a nice growth area for (Bright Horizons),"" he told IBD.Acquisitions – long part of Bright Horizons’ DNA  -- will continue to complement organic growth. Of the 8% to 10% top-line annual growth the company expects this year, 2% to 5% of that will likely come from acquisitions, both in and outside the U.S., Lissy says.Last year, the company acquired Hildebrandt, a 40-center chain operating in the mid-Atlantic. In 2013, it acquired a chain of 64 nurseries in the U.K. and 49 corporate-sponsored centers in the U.S., called Children’s Choice.Management sees the bulk of its growth coming from new child-care centers (an expected 20 to 25 net new centers this year), new enrollments in existing centers and price increases of 3% to 5% a year.In addition, it’s seeing faster growth from two smaller business lines -- in temporary backup care and education advisory services to help employers manage tuition reimbursement programs.""Companies in the U.S. spend about $17 billion a year on tuition reimbursement benefits for their employees,"" Lissy said. ""We do this for about 150 clients. It’s about a $30 million business for us and growing 20% a year.""In the highly fragmented market for temporary backup dependent care for young children and the elderly, Bright Horizons offers the service at its own centers or through a contracted network of home caregivers.Employers buy the backup service on behalf of their employees for a limited number of days. Employees pay a small co-payment ranging from $5 to $20 a day, Lissy says.These other services, added or expanded in the past several years, come with higher margins than the firm’s core business and have helped earnings grow faster than revenue.Per-share earnings in Q4 grew 21% over the earlier year and 28% for the full year. Analysts expect earnings this year to rise 18% to $2.19 a share, according to Thomson Reuters. That’s on the low end of the company’s forecast for 18% to 20% adjusted EPS growth.Since employers typically build out and equip the child-care centers, Bright Horizons’ capital costs are relatively low. Its biggest expense is staffing for teachers and assistants. Labor accounts for about 75% of costs, Lissy says.Revenue growth from Bright Horizon’s core child-care centers started accelerating in the first quarter of 2015 and have picked up steam in every quarter since, Lissy says.Fourth-quarter revenue grew 10% over the earlier year to $372 million. That was a step up from the third quarter’s 9.2% gain. For the full year, revenue rose 8% to $1.46 billion. Shares, meanwhile, have jumped 27% in the past 12 months.Management forecasts revenue growth of 8% to 10% this year.""It is going to be tough to keep that accelerating top-line growth, but it should grow at a faster rate than the overall economy,"" said analyst Silber.He says employer-sponsored child care is a late cycle business.""As unemployment declines and labor markets tighten, more companies use services like this for recruiting and retention,"" Silber said.

581,TGT,"Drugmaker Allergan (AGN) got a price-target cut from Canaccord Genuity Thursday after the company hit a delay in its merger with Pfizer (PFE), among other issues.Analyst Corey Davis noted that on Wednesday, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) had asked for additional information on the Pfizer-Allergan merger, which was first announced in November. The companies also have to wait until Allergan finishes divesting its generic-drug business to Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (TEVA), which itself hit a delay this month that caused Teva to push the expected closing date from Q1 to June. Pfizer and Allergan still expect to close their $160 billion merger in the second half of this year.""In the meanwhile, we are lowering our Q1 estimates (EPS drops from $3.43 to $2.89) as it's always the weakest quarter for specialty pharma, and we feel the rest of the Street is also too high,"" Davis wrote in his research note lowering his price target on Allergan stock to 320 from 340. ""This has been a trend in the past several years and is partly because of the reset of Medicare Part D.""Davis added that the merger of Target (TGT) and CVS Health (CVS) should hit Allergan's distribution business to the tune of $500 million a year, and the launch of bowel-disease drug Viberzi has increased spending.Davis wrote that he is nonetheless maintaining his buy rating due to the high likelihood that the deal will close. There has been some skepticism among investors over whether the Pfizer-Allergan deal is going to close this year -- besides the signals from Allergan's falling stock price, a buy-side survey by Evercore ISI analyst Mark Schoenebaum this month found that a fifth of respondents place the odds at less than 50%. Along with the FTC's backlog, there's concern that the incoming president and Congress might do something to limit tax-inversion deals like this one, as some candidates have threatened to do.Pfizer's leadership and Wall Street analysts have been more confident, however. On March 8, Deutsche Bank analyst Gregg Gilbert wrote that the gap between Pfizer's offer price and Allergan's stock price -- then $47 -- presents a buying opportunity as it will likely narrow as the deal closing nears.Allergan stock was down a fraction in morning trading on the stock market today, near 274.

582,TGT,"Amazon.com (AMZN) is suing logistics and supply chain expert Arthur Valdez, whom Target (TGT) recently hired, alleging that Valdez violated the noncompete clause in his contract, according to the Wall Street Journal.Valdez had been an Amazon employee for 16 years and signed a noncompete agreement in 2012 requiring him to wait 18 months before taking a similar position at a rival.The lawsuit, filed Monday in King County Superior Court in Washington, according to the Journal, says that Valdez has already disclosed secrets to Target such as an analysis of Amazon's holiday operations and its same-day grocery and package business.Valdez’s appointment at Target was announced in February, according to Reuters. Its report says that according to Valdez’s attorney, he isn’t scheduled to start until March 28.Amazon.com stock was up almost 1% in afternoon trading on the stock market today, near 558.50. The stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 66, where 99 is the highest. Shares are up 18% from a recent three-month low of 474.The Journal quoted a Target spokeswoman as saying that the company has taken significant precautions to ensure that proprietary information stays confidential and that Target believes the suit is without merit.

583,TGT,"So the mkt does the dance (again).....we woke up yesterday with a renewed disaster story in oil - the commodity came under immediate pressure and by the opening bell - it was trading 4.% lower, which then caused all of the algo's to hit the sell button on stocks...and why again? Why is it that stocks are so connected to oil? Why are stocks trading in lockstep with oil?How about - the talking heads have married to the two - thereby forcing the movement on a daily basis...the thinking goes like this: If oil is weak then that MUST mean that the global economy is weak. Period - The end. Let's not even discuss the absurdity of this argument at all.....this is NOT a lack of demand issue, it is all about a huge over SUPPLY issue - and this issue is not going away anytime soon - the Saudi's have made that quite clear.The lunacy could not have been more obvious yesterday.....you see - we woke up to a buildup in crude oil supplies and the negative banking story about how JP Morgan (JPM) and others are building up reserves to cushion the blow of failing oil and gas companies and what is expected to be the next disaster for the global economy. Add in the not so vague commentary by the Saudi oil minister that they are prepared to slaughter the competition and you have every reason to think - 'Hey - this could get a bit ugly....' (never mind that none of this is new news - but that's another story).The mkt opens lower and then proceeds to trade even lower from there....by 10:30 am - the DOW was down 266 pts or 1.6%, the S&P down 30 pts or 1.5%, the Nasdaq lost 77 pts or 1.74%.....and then we got 'The News' that ignited the fire....sending oil and stocks higher.....The US Dept of Energy reported that the gasoline inventory drawdown from last week as 2.236 million barrels vs. the expected drawdown of 1.033 million barrels....so essentially we used double the amount of gasoline in one week vs. what the brain trust predicted...and this one piece of data, this one piece of fairly 'irrelevant' data (in the big scheme of things) sent the algos into a buying frenzy....Why? Because the geeks who program the computers can only think A or B. If A then do X, If B - then do Y.. in this case A & B are:IF: drawdown is bigger than expected - then initiate BUY ordersIF: drawdown is less than expected - then initiate SELL ordersSo - folks - this one data point - which on the face of it appears 'bullish' - bigger drawdown means that we are using more gas - which then means that businesses must be doing more business and consumer must be spending more money, and construction companies must be building more houses and car companies will surely be selling more cars and the summer driving season most assuredly will be full of families packing up their cars with bikes and surfboards and luggage racks and once again driving to the oceans and lakes around he country to celebrate a strengthening economy.... which then means that hotels and motels will raise prices to take advantage of this surge and KMart, Target (TGT) & Nordstrom (JWN) must be gearing up to sell more bathing suits and summer outfits and restaurants will have to remodel to handle the onslaught of Americans going out to eat.....(See how I did that...I connected all those dots with one weekly gasoline report)REALLY? We get all that out of one weekly gasoline inventory report? I mean what happened to oversupply in crude inventories that is about to bankrupt the country? It's almost comical, isn't it?Bottom line is that crude oil prices once again survived the $30 support level and now faces another test. That test is a challenge of the 50dma which is at $34.44.....A failure for oil to pierce this resistance level will ensure that oil and stocks will hit another road block. An advance up and thru the 50 dma will ignite another rally in stocks - taking us up and thru the 50 dma at 1946 on the S&P - which will then cause sellers to back off as the bulls will push the mkt back to 2000 - in what I still think is a 'counter cyclical rally inside of a bearish longer term trend - due to all of the uncertainty around the FED policy decision.Any more suggestions of multiple rate hikes will kill any move higher....one single hike will be hard enough for the mkt to swallow while other central banks move to negative rates. Multiple hikes in the face of weakening European and Asian mkts will cause investors to punish stocks in order to re-price them.And this morning we get these headlines:""Pressure on ECB Mounts as Euro-Area Inflation Revised Lower""""The Big NEW Threat to Oil Prices: A GLUT of Gasoline - Several refineries in the Midwest have opted to reduce activity for economic reasons..."" We are swimming in crude and refined gasoline products - which should only further undermine prices.....""Banks Brace for Potential Energy Losses - Drop in oil prices is hitting lenders' energy loans; latest figures are a grudging admission of the truth..."" - this is more of the Jamie Dimon story...but this time the featured bank is Wells Fargo (WFC)....and they released this statement:""If oil prices remain low for a prolonged period of time, there could be addition performance deterioration in our oil and gas portfolio resulting in higher criticized assets, nonperforming loans, allowance levels and ultimately credit losses...""Translation of that very sophisticated statement: ""We are .....(insert word that begins with ?).And so - what do the smart logic algo's think about that? Do they even have the definition of that word programmed into their memory banks? I mean that word has so many meanings.....based on how it is used, so..... I'm just sayin....
"
584,TGT,"Now this morning we are seeing European mkts in rally mode......after we saw that strong demand for gasoline yesterday....Reuters puts it this way:""Markets have taken comfort from the fact that US crude oil futures held steady in early trading on Thursday as strong demand for gasoline was offset by a new record in crude stockpiles...""How crazy is that? European investors are jumping in on stocks because Americans used more gas than expected. You can't make this up...who would really believe it? Never mind that Eurozone inflation was just revised lower - which only forces Uncle Mario's to consider MORE stimulus.....FTSE + 2.38%, CAC 40 + 2.41%, DAX + 1.47%, EUROSTOXX +2%, SPAIN +2.7% and ITALY +2.7%.US futures are now up 4 pts - teasing 1934.....resistance (1946) is now only 12 pts away....This will be the third time that we challenge it....(we challenged it on the 22nd and the 23rd) ...I would not be surprised to see us pierce it today.....It just feels like it wants to.....(it's a gut thing, nothing more).Today we will hear from Dennis Lockhart (Atlanta FED) at 8:15 am and San Francisco's John Williams at noon.Take Good Care

586,TGT,"The off-price channel continues to show strength as TJX (TJX) posted fourth-quarter results that comfortably topped expectations and announced a dividend hike and share buyback. Separately, big-box retailer Target (TGT) missed views but its same-store sales and better-than-expected guidance were enough to reassure Wall Street.TJX's Q4 earnings rose 6.5% to 99 cents per share, a nickel above views. Revenue grew 8% to $8.96 billion, ahead of forecasts for $8.73 billion. Same-store sales rose 6%, with positive comp growth in all segments. TJX is the parent company of T.J. Maxx, Marshalls and HomeGoods.Comps and EPS growth ""significantly"" exceeded the company's own expectations, said CEO Ernie Herrman.""Once again, customer traffic drove our entire consolidated comp increase,"" he said in prepared remarks. ""It was also the primary driver of our comp increases at every division in the fourth quarter and full year as we continued delivering consumers a differentiated offering at extreme value. We are convinced that we are gaining market share profitably around the world.""TJX also announced plans to hike its regular quarterly dividend by 24% to 26 cents a share and said it will repurchase $1.5 billion to $2 billion in shares during the year.For 2017, TJX sees $3.29 to $3.38 in diluted per-share earnings, which includes the impact of currency exchange and a previously announced wage initiative. Analysts currently expect $3.61.The company expects the same factors to weigh on Q1, and is expecting 68 cents to 70 cents in earnings per share for the quarter, below current Wall Street views for 74 cents.That doesn't worry Cowen & Co. analyst Oliver Chen.""Though we acknowledge FY17 guide was below St, we believe stock should hold up given history of conservatism in guide and quality/sustainability of (off-price) business model,"" he wrote Wednesday.TJX shares closed up 2.1%. Rival Ross Stores (ROST) shares added 1.6% in the stock market today.Meanwhile, Target said it earned $1.52 per adjusted share in Q4, a 1% rise from last year and 2 cents below views. Sales dipped 0.6% to $21.63 billion, just shy of consensus estimates for $21.75 billion.Comps grew 1.9%, above estimates and driven by 1.3% traffic growth. That gain was offset by the impact of the sale of its pharmacies and clinics to CVS Health (CVS), said Target. Online sales climbed 34%.Despite the earnings and revenue misses, Target shares rose 4% as investors focused on the better-than-expected comp and digital growth, as well as guidance. Chen wrote in a separate note that he was ""impressed"" by Target's Q4 traffic-led comp beat, ""digital outperformance"" and continued strength in its signature categories of baby, wellness, kids and style.He reiterated an outperform rating on the stock, as Target is ""gaining share in a difficult backdrop.""For the year, the retailer expects to earn an adjusted $5.20 to $5.40 per share, well above current analyst forecasts for $5.16 a share. For Q1, Target sees $1.15 to $1.25 in adjusted earnings per share, the midpoint of which is a penny above views for $1.19 a share.Major competitor Wal-Mart (WMT), by contrast, cut its sales guidance for the year and missed Q4 revenue forecasts when it reported in mid-February. Shares rose 1%.

594,TGT,"The Cybersecurity Act of 2015 doesn't create backdoor access, but it more closely resembles the Senate version of the bill — the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act (CISA) — that tech heavyweights Apple, Netflix (NFLX), Facebook (FB), Twitter (TWTR) and Google owner Alphabet derided in October.
"
595,TGT,"Piggybacked onto the larger spending bill, the cybersecurity provision will probably pass, FBR analyst Daniel Ives told IBD. Key to passage: The bill doesn't zero in on encryption and backdoor access, both of which were hot-button issues in 2015.

In a September 2014 statement, Apple CEO Tim Cook said that his company would never create such a government loophole.Seen Likely To PassThe Cybersecurity Act of 2015 doesn't create backdoor access, but it more closely resembles the Senate version of the bill — the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act (CISA) — that tech heavyweights Apple, Netflix (NFLX), Facebook (FB), Twitter (TWTR) and Google owner Alphabet derided in October.Piggybacked onto the larger spending bill, the cybersecurity provision will probably pass, FBR analyst Daniel Ives told IBD. Key to passage: The bill doesn't zero in on encryption and backdoor access, both of which were hot-button issues in 2015.""I think right now there's a big focus within Silicon Valley as well as within the Beltway in terms of what the shape of encryption and cybersecurity are going to look like in 2016,"" he said. ""I think, clearly, there's going to be a lot of changes and the need for collaboration.""He projects 18%-20% growth in federal cybersecurity spending in 2016, prompted, in part, by new or potential legislation.The Electronic Frontier Foundation, a nonprofit civil liberties advocate, has deemed the House omnibus package ""a dangerous cybersecurity information sharing bill.""""The bills ignore the fact that companies and security experts can already share the much-needed technical information to stop computer security threats,"" EFF spokesperson Mark Jaycox wrote Dec. 8.None of the three bills nor the patchwork version, Jaycox wrote, addresses unencrypted files, poor computer architecture, un-updated servers and employees clicking malware — all central to recent high-profile breaches.""The cybersecurity bill in the omnibus package is similar to CISA, and our core problems with the bill remain,"" Jaycox wrote. ""Ramming through such legislation is not only bad politics, it's bad for representative democracy.""Connect with Allison Gatlin on Twitter @IBD_AGatlin and on Facebook.

604,TGT,"Black Friday is nearly upon us, and the National Retail Federation says that 136 million Americans plan to shop on Thanksgiving weekend.According to Cowen & Co., there will be deeper promotions this year amid elevated cold-weather apparel inventory and pricing investments by retailers.Cowen says most early promos are online as retailers try to gain ""mindshare"" earlier versus their peers and compete against Amazon (AMZN), Target (TGT), Kohl's (KSS) and Best Buy (BBY) are among big-box stores who've been running early promos.As consumers become more savvy and sophisticated, there's less need for standing in line waiting for in-store deals. Cowen says these Black Friday ""doorbusters"" are losing their appeal.Even still, retailers from Wal-Mart (WMT) to Macy's (M) to JCPenney (JCP) are opening their doors on Thanksgiving Day in anticipation of the traditional holiday shopping rush.Amazon shares rose 0.6% on the stock market today, close to Monday's record high.

643,TGT,"Though Amazon.com (AMZN) stock has had a rough week, shares more than doubled in 2015 and touched a record high of 696.44 on Dec. 29. But analysts are beginning to question whether investors have already priced in the e-tail leader's growth potential.Wall Street expects earnings per share gain to nearly triple to $1.65, but Canaccord analyst Michael Graham says most of the positives that have sparked Amazon's recent growth already are baked into its current stock price. On Wednesday, Graham reiterated a hold rating on Amazon stock.""I've been a fan of Amazon forever,"" Graham told IBD. ""They are doing so many things right, continuing to gain market share — becoming a key place households go to spend a lot of their income. But at this point in time, a lot of that positive stuff is reflected in the stock price already.""Amazon.com stock gapped down on Monday, piercing its 50-day moving average on double its average daily volume. That was a sell signal, and so is the stock's 8% decline from its most recent flat-base buy point of 684.92, touched last month.In afternoon trading in the stock market today, Amazon stock was down 0.8%, near 629. Amazon has an IBD Composite Rating of 95, where 99 is the highest.On Monday, Monness Crespi Hardt downgraded the stock from to neutral from buy, citing slimming margins and intense competition in the cloud computing sector.Canaccord rates Amazon a triple-plus — the best possible rating, and up from a double-plus in Dec. — citing three positive indicators across quantitative factors, metrics, and investor sentiment. Graham said that this method of rating stocks is common among buy-side analysts.""They recognize that competition on price is not the best long-term strategy,"" Graham said, ""and that having an efficient, modernized fulfillment network — which required a tremendous investment — is something that few companies are going to be able to match. ""Retailers such as Wal-Mart (WMT) and Target (TGT) have invested in order fulfillment but do not yet have the same capabilities. Because eBay (EBAY) relies on third-party sellers for its listings, fulfillment times vary — and that's not likely to change in the immediate future.Amazon Web Services (AWS), the e-tailer's cloud computing division, has also been a source of growth. ""AWS has the potential to lift overall margins,"" Graham said. But he points out that AWS faces two large opponents — Microsoft (MSFT) and Google (GOOGL) — with deep pockets, huge balance sheets and growth ambition.Many analysts disagree, however. According to a poll conducted by Thomson Reuters of 44 analysts surveyed, 37 rated Amazon a buy or strong buy.

685,TGT,"Target (TGT) topped on revenue and boosted its profit outlook, but that wasn't enough to fortify investor confidence in the big-box retailer as online sales slowed ahead of the holiday shopping season.
"
686,TGT,"Online sales grew 20%, a deceleration from the previous quarter's 30% growth. Target's Q3 digital sales missed management's earlier guidance for 30% year-over-year growth, said Cowen & Co. analyst Oliver Chen in a Wednesday report.
"
687,TGT,"But he also noted that Wal-Mart's (WMT) digital sales growth slowed to 10% in Q3, ""so TGT is clearly gaining share.""
"
688,TGT,"The slowdown comes amid a key online push. In a bid to compete with Amazon (AMZN) — and every other retailer that allows shoppers to order online — Target is offering free shipping on all Target.com orders made between Nov. 1 and Christmas Day, the second year in a row it has done so. Last year, the company offered free shipping on all online orders through Dec. 20.
"
689,TGT,"Shares tumbled 4.3% by Wednesday's close in the stock market today, after rising as much as 3.9% before the opening bell. Wal-Mart rose 1.7%, and Amazon climbed 3.2%.
"
690,TGT,"Target raised the lower end of its full-year earnings guidance range to $4.65-$4.75 a share, up from $4.60-$4.75 a share. Analysts predict EPS of $4.72. For the current holiday quarter, the company sees $1.48-$1.58 in per-share earnings, with the midpoint a penny shy of forecasts for $1.54 a share.
"
691,TGT,"In the third quarter, profit jumped 8.6% to 86 cents a share, meeting analyst predictions, as revenue edged down less than 1% to $17.61 billion, topping forecasts for $17.57 billion.
"
692,TGT,"""We would be aggressive buyers on potential weakness if investors choose to sell on solid numbers,"" added Chen, who maintains an outperform rating on the stock. ""Investor focus could be on weaker (gross margin), slower growth in the digital channel, and the slight inventory build, but we believe TGT outperformed in the current retail environment.""

720,TGT," No. 1 online retailer Amazon.com (AMZN) drew more than a third of Americans' Black Friday and Cyber Monday e-commerce spending by one estimate, while a Wednesday tally called Cyber Monday the heaviest U.S. online spending day in history.Amazon, however, actually appears to have lost a little Cyber Monday market share.Official numbers aren't in from Amazon yet on holiday sales, but by analytics firm Slice Intelligence's tally, Amazon accounted for 35.7% of e-commerce spending on Black Friday, Nov. 27, followed by Best Buy (BBY) with 8.2%, Macy's (M) with 3.4%, and Wal-Mart (WMT) at 3.3%.Amazon's Black Friday share was way up from 31.5% last year in the tally, and Slice estimated that Amazon Black Friday sales rose 23.2% from a year ago.Slice spokeswoman Jaimee Minney told IBD that Cyber Monday ""was bigger than Black Friday and bigger than Cyber Monday last year.""The Black Friday estimate comes primarily from an analysis of about 876,000 email receipts provided by Slice's panel of 3 million shoppers.Amazon garnered a 36.1% share of U.S. e-commerce sales on Cyber Monday by Slice's estimate, down 2.7 percentage points from a year earlier.Also by its estimate, ""the retailer's sales were down 1.3% vs. the same day last year,"" Minney said in an email.Wal-Mart was the only store in the top five to gain share on Cyber Monday by that tally — up half a percentage point, to 3.8%.Cyber Monday SoarsWednesday, online tracker comScore said Cyber Monday reached $3.12 billion in online spending, up 21% from last year's Cyber Monday.ComScore's mobile figures aren't final, but it said desktop online spending set a record, at $2.28 billion.ComScore said that for the first 30 days of the holiday season, $27.9 billion has been spent online by desktops, up 6% from a year ago.""The weekend after Thanksgiving also reached a major milestone as it saw its first ever billion-dollar online shopping day on Sunday,"" it said in a report Wednesday, ""while Saturday sales reached the $1 billion mark for a second year in a row.""Overall, Cyber Monday online sales set a record with $3.07 billion in spending across the U.S., up 16% from last year, according to Adobe Systems' (ADBE) Adobe Index, as Amazon leveraged its e-commerce dominance. But Thanksgiving weekend sales looked weak at brick-and-mortar retailers.Apple (AAPL) iPad and iPhone doorbusters were hits for Target (TGT) and others, while Wal-Mart announced booming mobile sales.Retail analytics provider ShopperTrak, however, estimates that U.S. physical stores took in 10.4% less than a year earlier over Thanksgiving, Black Friday and the weekend — an estimated $20.4 billion that does not include Cyber Monday.Amazon's Black Friday showing wouldn't be out of line with the IBD Leaderboard company's heft in online shopping — the company ""makes up about 69% of total U.S. retail traffic,"" Canaccord Genuity analyst Michael Graham said in a research report this week. Minney said Amazon's Black Friday crowd ""doesn't surprise us.""Amazon said that it had a record Thanksgiving weekend for selling Amazon devices, triple last year's result. Its top-selling products across all those available on Amazon.com on Black Friday were Amazon devices, the company said — No. 1 was Fire (its tablet line), and No. 2 was the Fire TV stick for streaming video online.Where People Shop OnlineIn October, the latest month tallied, Amazon drew over 160 million online visitors, up 19% from a year ago according to comScore (SCOR) and Canaccord estimates.

The stock gained 118% in 2015.Cakmak sees four major reasons why Amazon stock will come under pressure in 2016:Gross profit growth may slow down — mostly due to greater investments in businesses such as original video content and Prime Now, the company's same-day delivery app.Amazon Web Services may suffer as competition heats up and industry pricing faces downward pressure.India will be a costly market to enter because the lack of infrastructure makes logistics a challenge.New products: Aside from artificial intelligence investments, Cakmak is unsure what to expect, though he wrote, ""We are reminded (of) the Fire Phone,"" referring to the company's tech foray that many consider a failure.Amazon.com did not return an email request for comment.Cakmak added that the downgrade from a ""Buy"" rating to ""Neutral"" might be ""premature"" due to strong Q4 earnings. A poll of analysts by Thomson Reuters projected Amazon's fourth-quarter earnings per share are projected to rise 267% to $1.65. The analysts forecast full-year 2015 sales of $36 billion and EPS of $1.88 after a 52-cent per-share loss in 2014, and they expect a 198% EPS gain in 2016.PayPal DowngradedIn his research note, Cakmak downgraded PayPal (PYPL) from ""Neutral"" to ""Sell,"" writing that he ""sees PayPal's prospects diminishing relative to the rest of the field."" Citing strong competition from Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL), Samsung and each firm's mobile payments solution, Cakmak wrote that he thought it was possible those offerings could eventually bypass PayPal as a payment option.Large retailers such as Wal-Mart (WMT) and Target (TGT) are also building payments solutions and not relying on PayPal, Cakmak wrote.The analyst is also skeptical of PayPal via its Braintree subsidiary and its ability to continue snap up business from so-called ""unicorns"" such as privately held Uber and Airbnb. ""Unicorn"" is Silicon Valley jargon for startups that investors have valued at over $1 billion.""We see PayPal's long-term prospects boiling down to one core avenue, and that is peer-to-peer payments supported by the important Xoom deal,"" Cakmak wrote. Xoom is a money-sending service that PayPal has acquired.

740,TGT,"Special Report: Personal Finance Action Plan For 2016New year, new beginnings. While many people make promises to eat better or exercise more, others look to land a new job or switch careers. If the latest jobs report is any indication, the employment landscape seems promising for 2016.The U.S. economy added 211,000 new jobs in November, while the unemployment rate held steady at 5%. Wages were up an average 2.3%, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.What does this mean? It's a job hunter's market, with employers struggling to fill positions with qualified workers, says Tony Lee, editorial vice president of the Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM).If finding a new boss is among your top financial goals for 2016, then check out these ideas on where the top jobs can be found:• Grasp the landscape. Total employment in the U.S. will grow nearly 11% and add 15.6 million jobs by 2022, the BLS says. The fastest growth will occur in health care, health care support, personal care fields and recovering industries like construction.""In 2016, we will continue to see emerging job titles that combine skills in business, mobile technology and Internet security,"" said Scott Dobroski, career trends analyst at Glassdoor, a job search firm.Glassdoor lists business systems analyst as the job with the highest wage increase in 2015. Folks who had that job earned $83,000 in 2015, a 10% bump from 2014.Business systems analysts are sought after because they must be highly skilled in multiple areas and are needed across many industries, including retail, health care and technology, Dobroski says.""Retail is one area people don't really think about when job searching in this field,"" he said. ""But big retailers like Target (TGT) and Wal-Mart (WMT) need people who can analyze data, because many people today are searching online for clothes and other consumer goods they want to buy.""• Be the needle in the haystack. The SHRM and CareerCast, a job search firm, recently published a report listing the 10 toughest jobs to fill in 2016.Data scientist topped the list. About 6,000 companies are expected to hire for an estimated 4.4 million IT jobs directly tied to data analysis, CareerCast reported, based on data from tech research firm Gartner. The reason for the high demand: We've gotten really good at collecting tons of information, but few know how to crunch the data to make sense and use of it.""What's interesting about data scientist is that it crosses many industries,"" Lee said. It's not just tech companies that are hiring. As the health care industry continues to grow and automate its services, it also will require data scientists, for example.Other tech-related jobs cited in the report: electrical engineer, with 17 openings for every candidate; information security analyst, driven by the proliferation of cloud computing; and software engineer, with three jobs available for every new computer science college graduate in 2016.• Follow population trends. As aging baby boomers retire in droves, they'll affect the number of job openings and the kinds of jobs that will be available based on their needs.High-level management jobs are set to open up. Among the 10 toughest jobs to fill in this category is general and operations manager. The BLS sees 12.4% growth, which means 613,000 open positions through 2022. Also on the list is marketing manager, thanks to the meteoric growth in digital marketing.""Health care is still the largest sector hiring the most people,"" said Todd Johnson, an economist at the BLS. ""A lot of those jobs are well paid."" Johnson says peak demand persists for high-paying careers like physicians, surgeons and dentists.Health care is a big concern for aging boomers, so rounding out the list of most difficult jobs to fill is home health aide, with openings projected to jump 48% over the next seven years, according to the BLS. The catch: Pay is still low, with the median salary around $21,000, which is part of the reason hiring has been slow.But don't overlook typically low-paying jobs altogether, Lee says. Take physical therapists, which also made the list.""For years it did not pay well, but that has changed in recent years,"" Lee said. ""When you can't find physical therapists, you raise the salary, and you do more to keep them when you find them.""Also, physical therapists are getting a higher level of education these days. A decade ago, a PT would typically have a bachelor's degree; today, many complete graduate work.""Their salary expectations are higher, and their annual increases are going to outpace the average,"" Lee said.Other hot health care jobs: medical services manager, for which the BLS projects 73,300 new hires, and registered nurses, with more than a million new hires needed by 2022.• Look for salary growth. Wages for many low-paying positions are also on the rise. Minimum-wage increases likely helped baristas make the list. Their wages rose 6% to $23,600 in 2015.Pharmacy technicians enjoyed a healthy salary boost at 6%, but they're still earning a meager $26,000 a year.""Even though pharmacy technicians are not earning a lot right now, we will likely see their salaries go up, because they are in high demand,"" Dobroski said.Firms' increased focus on worker safety and data protection no doubt helped boost demand for security officers and their salaries. Security officers earned $24,000 on average in 2015 vs. $22,460 in 2014, a 7% jump, according to Glassdoor. Data security specialists often earn double, sometimes more.

Powerwall is automated and requires no maintenance, the automaker says on its website.A wall-mounted Powerwall for home use costs $3,000 for a 7-kilowatt-per-hour model.

743,TGT,"Amazon.com (AMZN) is in a better position than its competitors to capitalize on last-minute Christmas shoppers, says ITG analyst Steve Weinstein.The e-tail leader's Amazon Prime loyalty program carries free two-day and low-cost same-day shipping perks — and this year with the launch of Prime Now, shoppers in some big markets can get free two-hour delivery and pay $7.99 for one-hour delivery.Such fast delivery could make Amazon a go-to shopping destination for last-minute gifts, Weinstein says.""If you go back to the origins of e-commerce, you used to need a minimum of a week to get gifts in time for Christmas,"" Weinstein told IBD. ""E-commerce firms were locked out of last-minute shopping.""Now, online retailers can take orders much later and still guarantee delivery by Christmas, but Amazon.com probably has the latest such deadline of them all, he says.""Amazon has taken it to a whole new level,"" the analyst said. ""With Prime Now, if an item is in its warehouse, you can get it. I haven't crunched the numbers, but it's going to give them an edge"" very late in the shopping season.Nobody else can execute last-minute delivery on such a large scale as Amazon, Weinstein says.Prime memberships have been among the chief drivers of Amazon.com's explosive growth, according to Wells Fargo analyst Matt Nemer. Prime members receive additional perks such as free access to Amazon's growing collection of streamable video and audio content, free e-books and other offerings. One-day delivery is currently available in 16 major U.S. markets.Other companies have struck deals that offer expedited shipping. One example is Etsy (ETSY), which announced a deal with startup Postmates for same-day delivery in New York City.Last-minute shoppers looking for gifts at Wal-Mart (WMT) and Target (TGT) can always go to a physical store — if the items are in stock.Target is offering free standard shipping and returns on Target.com orders through Dec. 25, company spokeswoman Jamie Bastian told IBD via email. Customers can upgrade to one-day (Express) or two-day (Premium) shipping options at a cost that depends on the size of the order.""To receive by Christmas, orders must be placed by Dec. 21,"" Bastian said.Wal-Mart did not respond to IBD's inquiry about shipping deadlines.On Tuesday, Amazon.com said that sales of its electronic gadgets had more than tripled over Thanksgiving weekend from the year-earlier weekend. Amazon said that its own Fire tablet and Fire TV stick were its Nos. 1 and 2 top-selling individual products on Black Friday.Amazon stock rose 2.2% Tuesday, to 679.06, and rose as high as 681, just below the stock's record high of 682.77, touched on Nov. 23.

744,TGT,"Never mind ""Let It Snow."" Heading into the crucial holiday shopping season, retailers are more likely singing ""Let It Go"" from the movie ""Frozen"" as they try to shake off disappointing quarterly earnings results and a bad week that collectively sank merchant stocks.Nordstrom (JWN), Macy 's (M), J.C. Penney Co. (JCP) and Kohl's (KSS) were among those that reported the week of Nov. 9, with Nordstrom and Macy's turning in weak results and discounted forecasts, and J.C. Penney and Kohl's shares falling despite beating consensus views.An October retail sales data miss — a worse-than-expected 0.1% gain — didn't help either, though Amazon (AMZN) and other e-commerce sellers notably logged a 7.1% rise from the previous year as consumers continue to do much of their shopping online. Cowen & Co. predicted in July that Amazon would knock out Macy's as the top U.S. apparel retailer by 2017.Even much-lauded off-pricers haven't been immune to the pummeling that retail stocks were subjected to over the past week. Shares of TJX (TJX), the parent company of T.J. Maxx, Marshalls and HomeGoods, lost 12% over the past week.In a possible sign of things to come, Q3 same-store sales at Nordstrom's off-price arm, Nordstrom Rack, fell 2.2%.""This type of miss from Rack is surprising to us, and we acknowledge the Rack's off-price slowdown could be a negative indicator for TJX,"" wrote Cowen & Co. analyst Oliver Chen on Friday.But he added that TJX, which reports Tuesday, could ""offset some secular weakness"" based on a few factors, including the strength of the company's sourcing and buying teams, home goods offerings and international reach.The company is expected to report a slight earnings dip of 1% to 84 cents a share. That would mark the third straight quarter of earnings deceleration and a swing from earnings gains of 7%, 8% and 15% in the three preceding periods.Revenue is seen rising 5% to $7.73 million, which also would reflect a slowdown.With a 75 IBD Composite Rating, TJX is the highest ranking member of IBD's Retail-Apparel/Shoes/Accessories group, which ranks a feeble 144 out of 197 groups.Peers in the group include Ross Stores, Foot Locker (FL), L Brands (LB) and American Eagle Outfitters (AEO).Fellow off-pricer Ross Stores (ROST) gapped down ahead of its Thursday earnings release, losing 11% for the week. Analysts expect over 6% EPS growth to 50 cents on 6% sales growth to $2.77 billion.And what about the big-box retailers?Target's (TGT) earnings are seen accelerating, with a predicted 59% climb to 86 cents a share on a 1% revenue dip to $17.57 billion. Shares retreated 6.9% last week.And Wall Street expects Wal-Mart (WMT) earnings to slide 15% to 98 cents a share on a 1% revenue decline to $117.79 billion.

The shopping event bumped Q3 revenue up by two percentage points, which contributed to the company's third consecutive quarter of escalating revenue year-over-year revenue gains. The company's Q3 revenue jumped 23% to $25.4 billion, beating analyst expectations.""Prime is certainly a huge factor"" in the growth, Wells Fargo analyst Matt Nemer told IBD. ""What's amazing on this scale is to see it (revenue) accelerate. If I had to isolate one (reason for faster growth), it's the adoption of Prime and utilization of Prime, driven by the incremental attributes of Prime.""Amazon's Amazon Prime service gives members such perks as free two-day delivery and access to its video streaming service, for $99 a year.According to a forecast by Adobe Systems (ADBE)'s Adobe Digital Index, U.S. online sales on Cyber Monday — the Monday after Black Friday — will reach $3 billion, up 12%.

Dow futures traded 14.6 points above fair market value and had halved their gains over the prior hour. Nasdaq 100 futures doubled their hour-earlier gains to 18 points. S&P 500 futures were steady, showing a 3.6-point gain.The stock market today is expected to put in a short, quiet session. Stock markets close at 1 p.m. ET instead of the usual 4 p.m. Calendars show no significant economic releases and only a dribble of quarterly earnings reports due. And a sizeable segment of the trading population has seized the day to complete a four-day holiday weekend, so trading volume is likely to remain quiet.The Nasdaq opens the day with a mild 0.2% gain for the week. The S&P 500 starts 0.3% in the hole. Both are trading sideways, below early November highs and above their 50- and 200-day moving averages.It's been a stronger week for small caps. The small-cap S&P 600 starts Friday with a 1.6% gain and just back above its 200-day line. The broader Russell 2000 has climbed a shade less than 2% since Monday, but is still well below its 200-day level.Premarket action was subdued among most Dow and S&P 500 stocks. Walt Disney (DIS) dropped nearly 2%, the Dow's biggest move and the largest loss among S&P 500 companies. A regulatory filing late Wednesday showed Disney's profitable ESPN franchise had lost 3 million subscribers from the start of 2015 through October, putting the channel's two-year subscriber loss at 7 million.Citigroup (C), Xerox (XRX) and Target (TGT) led the S&P 500 before the open with gains of just over 1%.China-based issues were seeing some selling pressure after a tough day in China's markets.Online retailer JD.com (JD) dropped more than 3%, marking the widest loss among Nasdaq 100 companies. The stock ended Wednesday in a struggle to hold support at its 10-week moving average as it attempts to build the right side of a five-month cup base.On the IBD 50 list, premarket gains held to less than 1%. China-based social networking platform YY (YY) fell more than 2% to the bottom of the list. The stock is also working to climb the right side of a five-month consolidation.On IBD's Your Weekly Review list, Ireland-based Ryanair (RYAAY) popped 2% before the open. The budget airline tripped two sell signals on Tuesday, falling below its 10-week line in strong trade and undercutting a flat-base buy point of 82.81 by more than 7%.Overseas, China's markets careened lower, with the Shanghai Composite diving 5.5% Friday and Hong Kong's Hang Seng down 1.9%. Investors were apparently raising cash ahead of next week's re-entry of IPOs to the Chinese markets and reacting to news late Thursday that regulators were investigating the country's largest brokerage firm.

778,TGT,"""Margins will be better than last year, dollar volume will be up, and retailers will be a little more in control of inventories,"" he said.Stores have beefed up digital efforts to try to stop the shift in spending to Amazon. But several dismal reports and holiday outlooks suggest that their efforts are just slowing the decline.Stores continue to power up with enhanced digital offerings and amenities like in-store pickup and free shipping. As more shoppers use their smartphones to browse and buy, retailers such as Wal-Mart (WMT) and Target (TGT) are adapting with new, holiday-focused mobile apps:Wal-Mart is rolling out mobile check-in this season, by which a customer can check in using their phone when they arrive to pick up their online order.The Target Kids' Wish List app has updated features, including a kid-friendly browser, search and scan abilities, as well as easier ways for parents to manage and share lists.Some JLL-managed malls are using messaging via Wi-Fi which lets shoppers opt-in for push promotions on their smartphones.""Traditional retailers have finally started to invest in their technology to try to compete with the pure-play retailers online,"" said Joel Bines, managing director of the retail practice of AlixPartners. ""They're trying to beat them at their own game . .. instead of ignoring them.""Consumers who shop online and pick up their purchases in the store spend 75% more than those who buy only in the store, says Rod Sides, vice chairman of Deloitte LLP and leader of its U.S. retail and distribution sector.Are the efforts paying off? Target on Wednesday reported solid overall results. But online sales growth slowed and was weaker than its projections. Wal-Mart said Tuesday that U.S. same-store sales rose for a fifth straight quarter, and it guided Q4 EPS views up. But it too saw slower e-commerce growth.Macy's Parade Of PainMacy's (M), a leader in promoting ""omnichannel"" sales, on Nov. 11 reported weak Q3 results and forecast lower Q4 same-store sales.The next day, Nordstrom (JWN) — another well-regarded omnichannel retailer, with an expanding Nordstrom Rack off-price chain — missed profit and sales views. The upscale department store operator also cut its full-year sales and same-store sales targets.Could Have Been Worse""The results are reflective of how difficult it is in the department store space — as consumers change their spending habits away from apparel and fashion accessories — and the extremely warm fall, which has resulted in excess inventories,"" Ken Perkins, president of Retail Metrics told IBD.

783,TGT,"Mobile commerce sparked Cyber Monday as it did Black Friday and the start of a holiday season in which online sales are outperforming last year's.From midnight through 3 p.m. EST Monday, online sales were up 18.1% from the year-earlier period, according to IBM (IBM). That's way up from IBM's tally of an 8.5% sales gain for full-day Cyber Monday last year.Mobile users accounted for 46% of all online traffic, up 16% over 2014, IBM said.""Mobile continues to be the story,"" Anuj Nayar, senior director of global initiatives at online transaction company PayPal (PYPL), told IBD.Adobe Systems' (ADBE) Adobe Digital Index, which says that it measures 80% of transactions for the top 100 U.S. retailers, projected U.S. Cyber Monday sales to hit $3 billion and be the largest online sales day of the year.Adobe said that mobile traffic accounted for 53% of shopping visits and 32% of sales.ITG analyst Steve Weinstein told IBD he sees three trends:• Heavy shopping has started earlier in the season.• Mobile buying has changed shopping behaviors.• And retailers, especially Amazon.com (AMZN), that have heavily invested in fulfillment infrastructure, will do well and lengthen their selling season.From Thanksgiving Day through Sunday, U.S. shoppers spent $8.03 billion online, up 17%, says Adobe. Baird analyst Colin Sebastian wrote in a research note that initial shopping data appears ""positive"" for Amazon, Google owner Alphabet (GOOGL), ChannelAdvisor (ECOM) and PayPal.""We're all pretty excited here,"" Scot Wingo, executive chairman of ChannelAdvisor, told IBD. ChannelAdvisor tracks third-party sales on e-commerce sites such as Amazon and eBay (EBAY).Big-screen and ultrahigh-def (4K) TV sets are among this year's top sellers, says IBM's Justin Norwood.""In particular, Samsung seems to have hit a chord across the 4K picture and sound price point, and has taken a leadership position,"" Norwood told IBD.The Apple (AAPL) Watch is another big seller, ""but that trend goes back three months now, from our data,"" Norwood said.Hoverboards — single-axle, self-balancing scooters — also are hot. EBay says that it sold two hoverboards a minute on Thanksgiving. ""If there were a breakout item, that's it,"" Hal Lawton, senior vice president of eBay North America, told IBD.ChannelAdvisor reported that as of 3 p.m. EST, Cyber Monday sales were up 16.8% over the year-earlier period, but a small percentage from last year's growth.EBay ""is offering very unusual promotions,"" said Wingo. ""They seem to be saying that we're going to opt-out of competing with the big guys on the latest GoPro (GPRO) camera, for example.""ChannelAdvisor said third-party sales were up 22% at Amazon but less than 2% at eBay, though it represents just a small percentage of eBay sellers.Lawton, in a statement, said eBay is making ""an aggressive push"" for daily deals on Apple products.No. 4 U.S. retailer Target (TGT) suffered a website outage at 10 a.m. EST Monday on heavy traffic. The company ran an aggressive promotion, offering 15% off any item on its website. Target had to get a lot of product makers onboard for such an offer, Wingo said, ""and that required a lot of planning in advance.""PayPal, too, suffered a morning outage that Nayar described as brief, declining to go into detail.

869,TGT,"'Force Friday' Fuels 'Star Wars' Fans, Disney SalesThe Millennium Falcon could find a new landing pad in Latin America if Walt Disney (DIS) and Netflix (NFLX) greenlight a deal to stream all of the ""Star Wars"" theatrical sequels in the region, according to the Wall Street Journal, whose sources said that the two companies are currently in talks.The potential deal would cover five out of the six films (21st Century Fox (FOXA) has the rights to the original 1977 movie), bringing R2D2 and C3PO to Latin American viewers ahead of the December release of ""Star Wars: Episode VII — The Force Awakens.""A similar streaming deal in the U.S. and Europe is unlikely, said the Journal, since most Americans and Europeans are already well-versed in the Lucasfilm franchise and may not need a streaming version.This news follows Monday's announcement that Tencent Holdings (TCEHY) would make the entire six-film series available online to China viewers, having struck agreements with both Disney and Fox.Disney shares closed up 0.2% at 104.20 on the stock market today. Netflix edged up 0.1% and Fox ended up 0.15%, while Tencent fell 1.7%.Disney's push to promote the seventh installment in the franchise has been ""Force""-ful. Among its other initiatives was a Sept. 4 ""Force Friday"" merchandise rollout that included midnight releases at Target (TGT), Wal-Mart (WMT) and Toys ""R"" Us, in addition to new products on Amazon (AMZN).The high-profile promotion has so far brought strong results. An NPD Group analysis found that about $1 of every $11 spent on toys for the week ending Sept. 5 went to a ""Star Wars"" toy. Analyst Juli Lennett said that the campaign ""provided a phenomenal lift for 'Star Wars,' growing sales by six times its recent average weekly sales.""RELATED:'Star Wars' Toy Sales Show The Force AwakensDisney, Tencent Deal Will Stream 'Star Wars' In China'Force Friday' Fuels 'Star Wars' Fans, Disney Sales

"

"
892,TGT,"""The Apple Watch is one to watch this fall,"" Ben Bajarin, Creative Strategies' consumer technology analyst, told IBD, noting that the addition of new color and band options should prove appealing.
"
893,TGT,"Wearables as a whole are likely to do well, say analysts.
"
894,TGT,"""This year, I think wearables will continue to be a big category,"" Telsey Group analyst Joseph Feldman told IBD. He said that the Apple Watch ""has certainly made a splash and gotten people interested.""
"
895,TGT,"Bajarin and Feldman also pointed to the Fitbit (FIT) fitness tracking band as a popular seller. Bajarin, who predicts at least 10 million in overall wearable unit sales this holiday quarter, said that Fitbit should have a ""blowout quarter.""
"
896,TGT,"The iPhone 6S and 6S Plus, unveiled at Apple's much-hyped event on Wednesday, come equipped with a higher-res rear camera, haptic 3D touch display and aluminum case. Both are available for pre-order on Saturday and hit shelves on Sept. 25.
"
897,TGT,"The Apple Watch is more likely to be a stocking stuffer than an iPhone — Bajarin calls the wearable ""a good gift to give."" But because updating a smartphone may be more pressing than getting a new smartwatch, the latest iPhones should still do decently — even despite tough year-earlier comparisons — as shoppers buy for themselves and loved ones.
"
898,TGT,"The tech heavyweight is expected to sell about 76 million smartphones in its December quarter, according to Cowen's estimate, up slightly from last fiscal Q1's 74.5 million units. ""S"" (as in 6S) years are usually bigger sales years, said Bajarin.

"
904,TGT,"""Star Wars is expected to be quite big this holiday season,"" said Feldman. ""It's already got a pretty loyal fan base. I think a lot of people are banking on that to help.""
"
905,TGT,"""Quite big"" could be an understatement. Macquarie analyst Tim Nollen projected in late August that ""Star Wars"" could generate $5 billion in merchandise sales in its first year, netting Disney about $500 million in licensing and retail revenue. Analysts estimate that the film itself will bring in about $2 billion in ticket stubs globally.
"
906,TGT,"The most talked-about item, so far, seems to be Sphero's smartphone-controlled BB-8, a round little droid that has an ""adaptive personality,"" records and plays back holographic images, and interacts via voice command.

907,TGT,"The toy, which costs $149.99, appears to be back-ordered on Amazon (AMZN) and ships within 2-3 months, according to the product page. The company's PR rep told IBD that it doesn't have official sales predictions, but the BB-8 is expected to ""overperform all sales expectations.""
"
908,TGT,"Even ahead of the new ""Star Wars"" flick, Disney's consumer products have been performing well. NPD Group analyst Juli Lennett wrote in late July that toys for runaway hit ""Frozen"" are among the items helping 2015 become ""a particularly robust year for toys.""

"
922,TGT,"This year alone, hackers gained access to millions of personal records, including Social Security numbers from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management and other personal data from Anthem (ANTM), one of the nation's largest health insurers. More than 30 million e-mail addresses were infamously stolen from extramarital-affairs website Ashley Madison.

"
925,TGT,"""There will be more,"" said Jonathan Ho, an analyst with William Blair & Co.
"
926,TGT,"Santa Clara, Calif.-based Palo Alto Networks is one of the fastest growing of all the cybermilitia forces and claims to be the fastest growing in next-generation network firewall security.
"
927,TGT,"It launched its first next-generation network firewall security product in 2007 and has since expanded to encompass advanced threats, endpoints and the cloud. Meanwhile, it keeps enhancing existing products and rolling out new ones.
"
928,TGT,"Palo Alto competes with established names in network security such as Cisco Systems (CSCO), Check Point Software (CHKP), Juniper Networks (JNPR) and Fortinet (FTNT).
"
929,TGT,"Disrupting The Legacy Players
"
930,TGT,"""We were a disruptive company,"" said Palo Alto Chief Marketing Officer Rene Bonvanie in an interview with IBD. Legacy players ""did not understand apps, new mobile devices and the cloud. So they couldn't make it safe (everywhere). Our technology makes the use of applications safe no matter where they live.""
"
931,TGT,"Palo Alto's next-generation firewall platform is still core to the company's mission: to make it safe for people working in private or public enterprises to use any application from any kind of device.
"
932,TGT,"The company has more than 26,000 customers worldwide and says that it's added at least 1,000 new ones every quarter for the last 15 quarters. It sells to private enterprises, governments and service providers.
"
933,TGT,"In the last quarter, the U.S. government comprised 13% of its business, spread across civilian, intelligence and defense sectors. More than 10% came from service providers, with the rest largely enterprise accounts.
"
934,TGT,"The problem with traditional firewall products was that they became obsolete over time as hackers found ways around them, Ho says.
"
935,TGT,"Next-generation firewall solutions have more and better defenses, including analytics, intrusion prevention and anti-malware to thwart ""lots of different bad things that affect your computer,"" he said.
"
936,TGT,"Legacy players are adapting, but it takes longer for big companies to change course than small ones. Meanwhile, Palo Alto is ""rapidly catching up"" to the leaders in network security, Cisco and Check Point, Bonvanie says.
"
937,TGT,"""We are now the third-largest player in the enterprise security market after Cisco and Check Point,"" he said, adding that his firm's share is around 9%.
"
938,TGT,"Palo Alto has been growing revenue more than 50% on average the last two years. In its fiscal fourth quarter, ending in July, revenue jumped 59% to $283.9 million, billings 69% to $393.6 million — both well above analysts' estimates.
"
939,TGT,"Excluding items, it earned 28 cents per share in Q4, 3 cents above views, up from 11 cents last year.
"
940,TGT,"Revenue is expected to slow some from a robust 50%-plus rate, but it's still seen growing in strong double-digit percentages. Palo Alto expects revenue to increase 46%- 48% in the current Q1, ending in October, to $280 million-$284 million. Analysts expect revenue for full fiscal 2016, ending next July, to increase 39% to $1.29 billion.
"
941,TGT,"Earnings for the new year are seen rising 99% to $1.71 per share, according to Thomson Reuters.
"
942,TGT,"Investors Are Beneficiaries
"
943,TGT,"Shares have climbed about 49% this year and are up 336% since the company went public in July 2012.
"
944,TGT,"Firewall solutions still make up ""(the) vast majority of our business,"" Bonvanie says.
"
945,TGT,"Ho says that Check Point has lost ""the least (market) share,"" while Fortinet is still early in next-generation firewall products.
"
946,TGT,"Cisco started stemming market-share losses starting late last year as it integrated products from its acquisition SourceFire in late 2013, according to Nomura Securities analyst Frederick Grieb.
"
947,TGT,"Based on a recently published Nomura survey of 30 security professionals asked about their buying plans for this year and next, Palo Alto and rival FireEye (FEYE) could be expected to gain the most in spending dollars.
"
948,TGT,"The survey indicated that the No. 1 priority for security spending this year is for advanced persistent threat protection, which plays into Palo Alto's WildFire product. WildFire's customer base increased 140% by the fourth quarter vs. a year ago to more than 7,000.
"
949,TGT,"Endpoint protection — whether for a desktop, laptop, tablet, smartphone, cash register, ATM or other computerized hardware — was the second priority. Target, for example, was attacked at the endpoint — through its cash registers.
"
950,TGT,"Palo Alto's even newer Traps product, which addresses endpoint security, ended the last quarter with 150 customers.
"
951,TGT,"FireEye competes with Palo Alto in both advanced persistent threat protection and endpoint security.
"
952,TGT,"Wild West Exotic Tech
"
953,TGT,"Endpoint security ""has become the Wild West of security,"" attracting startups with ""exotic technology,"" said Palo Alto's Bonvanie. ""Everybody has figured out that the original products are not very useful.""
"
954,TGT,"Palo Alto's large installed base of customers using its firewall products ""gives us a competitive advantage over the smaller guys"" in endpoint security, he said.
"
955,TGT,"Other endpoint security players include privately held Bit9 + Carbon Black, Invincea and Bromium.
"
956,TGT,"Symantec (SYMC) and McAfee dominate endpoint security. Nomura's survey of security professionals was ""generally negative"" for Symantec, Grieb noted in the survey report, ""with customer perception of the company and its road map continuing to deteriorate over the past 12 months.""
"
957,TGT,"Similar Endpoint Opportunities
"
958,TGT,"Said Ho: ""Palo Alto is the main beneficiary of the next-generation transition on the firewall side, and we think they could have similar opportunities in the next-generation endpoint side.""
"
959,TGT,"Nomura's survey suggested that IT security spending will grow 14% this year and 17% next year.
"
960,TGT,"In a recent research note, JPMorgan analyst Sterling Auty said that Palo Alto's platform ""is increasingly resonating with customers"" and that demand for its products ""remains robust.""Big-box retailers, investment banks, health insurers, governments, universities: No enterprise seems immune from cyberattacks.

Legacy players ""did not understand apps, new mobile devices and the cloud. So they couldn't make it safe (everywhere). Our technology makes the use of applications safe no matter where they live.""Palo Alto's next-generation firewall platform is still core to the company's mission: to make it safe for people working in private or public enterprises to use any application from any kind of device.The company has more than 26,000 customers worldwide and says that it's added at least 1,000 new ones every quarter for the last 15 quarters. It sells to private enterprises, governments and service providers.In the last quarter, the U.S. government comprised 13% of its business, spread across civilian, intelligence and defense sectors. More than 10% came from service providers, with the rest largely enterprise accounts.The problem with traditional firewall products was that they became obsolete over time as hackers found ways around them, Ho says.Next-generation firewall solutions have more and better defenses, including analytics, intrusion prevention and anti-malware to thwart ""lots of different bad things that affect your computer,"" he said.Legacy players are adapting, but it takes longer for big companies to change course than small ones. Meanwhile, Palo Alto is ""rapidly catching up"" to the leaders in network security, Cisco and Check Point, Bonvanie says.""We are now the third-largest player in the enterprise security market after Cisco and Check Point,"" he said, adding that his firm's share is around 9%.Palo Alto has been growing revenue more than 50% on average the last two years. In its fiscal fourth quarter, ending in July, revenue jumped 59% to $283.9 million, billings 69% to $393.6 million — both well above analysts' estimates.Excluding items, it earned 28 cents per share in Q4, 3 cents above views, up from 11 cents last year.Revenue is expected to slow some from a robust 50%-plus rate, but it's still seen growing in strong double-digit percentages. Palo Alto expects revenue to increase 46%- 48% in the current Q1, ending in October, to $280 million-$284 million. Analysts expect revenue for full fiscal 2016, ending next July, to increase 39% to $1.29 billion.Earnings for the new year are seen rising 99% to $1.71 per share, according to Thomson Reuters.Investors Are BeneficiariesShares have climbed about 49% this year and are up 336% since the company went public in July 2012.Firewall solutions still make up ""(the) vast majority of our business,"" Bonvanie says.Ho says that Check Point has lost ""the least (market) share,"" while Fortinet is still early in next-generation firewall products.Cisco started stemming market-share losses starting late last year as it integrated products from its acquisition SourceFire in late 2013, according to Nomura Securities analyst Frederick Grieb.Based on a recently published Nomura survey of 30 security professionals asked about their buying plans for this year and next, Palo Alto and rival FireEye (FEYE) could be expected to gain the most in spending dollars.The survey indicated that the No. 1 priority for security spending this year is for advanced persistent threat protection, which plays into Palo Alto's WildFire product. WildFire's customer base increased 140% by the fourth quarter vs. a year ago to more than 7,000.Endpoint protection — whether for a desktop, laptop, tablet, smartphone, cash register, ATM or other computerized hardware — was the second priority. Target, for example, was attacked at the endpoint — through its cash registers.Palo Alto's even newer Traps product, which addresses endpoint security, ended the last quarter with 150 customers.FireEye competes with Palo Alto in both advanced persistent threat protection and endpoint security.Wild West Exotic TechEndpoint security ""has become the Wild West of security,"" attracting startups with ""exotic technology,"" said Palo Alto's Bonvanie. ""Everybody has figured out that the original products are not very useful.""Palo Alto's large installed base of customers using its firewall products ""gives us a competitive advantage over the smaller guys"" in endpoint security, he said.Other endpoint security players include privately held Bit9 + Carbon Black, Invincea and Bromium.Symantec (SYMC) and McAfee dominate endpoint security. Nomura's survey of security professionals was ""generally negative"" for Symantec, Grieb noted in the survey report, ""with customer perception of the company and its road map continuing to deteriorate over the past 12 months.""Similar Endpoint OpportunitiesSaid Ho: ""Palo Alto is the main beneficiary of the next-generation transition on the firewall side, and we think they could have similar opportunities in the next-generation endpoint side.""Nomura's survey suggested that IT security spending will grow 14% this year and 17% next year.In a recent research note, JPMorgan analyst Sterling Auty said that Palo Alto's platform ""is increasingly resonating with customers"" and that demand for its products ""remains robust.""

1036,TGT,"Retail sales disappoint in SeptemberRetail sales rose just 0.1% last month after an unchanged August. Auto sales were strong, but outside of the sector, sales slid 0.3%, the worst showing since January. Sales were unchanged excluding both autos and gas stations. Cheaper gas prices are hitting gas station revenue, but should be bolstering discretionary income for other spending. Nonstore sales — mostly ecommerce — fell 0.2%. So did electronics and appliance store sales.Several retailers' stocks fell sharply intraday as Wal-Mart Stores (WMT) announced that earnings in the next fiscal year will fall 6%-12% due to its heavy tech spending, wage increases and weak sales. Wal-Mart shares fell 9.3% to a 3-1/2-year low. Target (TGT) lost 3.7% and Dollar General (DG) 2.9%. But concerns about consumer spending spread further, with Best Buy (BBY) down 5% and Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) 4.4%.Producer prices fall sharplySeptember's producer price index slid 0.5%, the biggest fall in 8 months and more than the 0.2% drop expected. Wholesale energy prices fell 5.9% after August's 3.3% tumble. But core PPI, which excludes food and energy costs, still retreated 0.3% vs. views for a 0.1% increase. Year over year, wholesale prices fell 1.1%, with core wholesale inflation up 0.8%.Business inventories flat againBusiness stockpiles were flat in August after an unchanged July, revised down from a 0.1% gain. Retail inventories excluding autos, which are part of the GDP calculation, advanced 0.4% after July's 0.3% gain. Sales at all business levels fell 0.6% after July's 0.1% uptick. At the current sales pace, it would take 1.37 months for businesses to clear shelves.EU industrial production fallsExcluding construction, the European Union's industrial production fell 0.5% in August vs. July, matching views. Monthly output has expanded only once in the past five months. Year over year, growth slowed to a 0.9% gain in August from July's 1.7% gain. That's a four-month low. Analysts expected a gain of 1.8%. The U.K. jobless rate hit a 7-year low of 5.4% in the three months to August, the Office for National Statistics said. Workers' total earnings rose 3% from a year earlier, slightly less than expected. The Bank of England is considering rising pay as a factor in when it will raise the U.K.'s interest rates.

1044,TGT,"Sephora and Ulta (ULTA) are stealing market share from CVS (CVS) and other drugstores as teens gravitate toward ""authentic indie"" brands, according to Piper Jaffray's latest Taking Stock With Teens survey, out late Tuesday.Mass beauty brands are ceding share to indie brands and labels that get social media backing, said analysts. A quick peek on Facebook's (FB) Instagram yields about 885,000 results for #Revlon and fewer than 499,000 for #CoverGirl — both drugstore brands — but more than 2.5 million results for #UrbanDecay, a popular cosmetics label that can be purchased at both Ulta and Sephora.CoverGirl has steadily slipped down the rankings with upper-income female teens, falling to fourth place from second place, year over year, while Urban Decay's share has risen with all teen girls.Tied to that is the increased preference for specialty beauty retailers. Sephora nabbed a significant 38% chunk in Piper Jaffray's latest survey, climbing from 19% in the spring and up from 22% in fall 2014's poll among upper-income teenage girls. Sephora is owned by LVMH, which trades on the Paris exchange.While Target (TGT) took top honors in the spring, Ulta knocked it down to third place this fall, taking the No. 2 spot behind Sephora with 19% share of the vote, up from 13% last year. Target has 14% share.Drugstores that mostly carry mass beauty brands have also slipped down the rankings. CVS ceded about half its share, sliding to 6% at the No. 4 spot from 14% in the spring and 13% last fall. Wal-Mart (WMT) and Walgreens (WBA) have also slipped down the Top 10 list over the last 12 months.Ulta has a solid history of double-digit earnings and revenue gains, and has a strong IBD Composite Rating of 96. Piper Jaffray carries an overweight rating on the stock.Ulta shares closed down 2.8% to 159.26 in the stock market today.

The company says it works by reducing the ever-increasing ""attack surface,"" which is the sum of all the access avenues an individual can use to get into a network.It counts among its customers 74 Fortune 100 companies and all 15 of the top global network equipment manufacturers.Since coming public in October 2000, the stock has had a volatile history. Earnings have been cyclical.EPS fell from 73 cents a share in 2013 to 36 cents a share last year, and 2014 revenue was flat.Analysts at Wunderlich downgraded the stock Oct. 19 from buy to hold on worries that Brocade Communications (BRCD) might take some of Ixia's business with AT&T; (T).

This year, Palo Alto Networks bought CirroSecure, which specializes in securing software-as-a-service applications.These acquisitions have added layers to Palo Alto Networks' already strong infrastructure, Scott Gainey, the company's vice president of product marketing and industry initiatives, told IBD.""Our larger customers who have made a very strong commitment, they're looking to deploy to protect mobile, Internet perimeter, their data center perimeters and their virtualized information centers,"" Gainey said. ""They don't want to deal with 11 different vendors to protect their organization, they want one or a couple strategic partners to help them protect all corners of their organization.""A total security package needs that robust infrastructure, but also the flexibility to incorporate new protections as threats become increasingly complex, Proofpoint's Kalember said.""In an ideal platform, not only do you have to cover all these pieces ... but they all have to play nice with all the other players out there,"" he said.That's not easy, he says.""The products don't tend to work all that well together,"" he said. ""And a lot of them produce a huge amount of noise for all the signal you get.""It's Not If, But WhenThe hacking of the computer network of huge U.S. health care provider Anthem (ANTM), revealed in February, was another pivotal event. As many as 80 million accounts might have been compromised.""At the end of the day, this affects everybody, so the person on the street is actually interested in health care protection,"" CyberArk's Mokady said. ""One in four people received a letter telling them their health care records were stolen.""Historically, IT professionals had to fight for companies to take cybersecurity seriously, Palo Alto Network's Gainey said. No longer.""A lot of people have really woken up to this notion that they're not immune to a cyberattack,"" he said.Follow Allison Gatlin on Twitter @IBD_AGatlin and on Facebook.

1169,TGT,"As cybercrime strikes with worrisome frequency, Visa (V) is deploying new technology and services to keep digital thieves at bay and secure its position as the world's largest money card processor.
"
1170,TGT,"The late-2013 data security breach at Target (TGT) was a game changer for American merchants, exposing 40 million debit and credit card accounts, costing the big-box retailer tens of millions of dollars and the CEO his job. It accelerated the move to chip-embedded cards in the U.S., which had lagged behind foreign money-card innovation.
"
1171,TGT,"Target wasn't the only big victim. Home Depot (HD), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Michaels (MIK), Berkshire Hathaway's (BRKB) Dairy Queen and others also have been badly compromised in the last two years.
"
1172,TGT,"Fighting cybercrime has become an endless war as hackers grow more sophisticated, but Wednesday is the last day of blame-sharing. Beginning Thursday, Oct. 1, more liability for money card fraud shifts to merchants and retailers if they don't use the tech to handle the new chip cards from Visa or its rivals.
"
1173,TGT,"""The U.S. was the last major global economy that hadn't moved to chip and PIN,"" said Andrew Jeffrey, an analyst at SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. ""That made us the weak link in the chain from a security perspective.""
"
1174,TGT,"Banks reportedly had issued more than 142 million new Visa chip cards in the U.S. by Sept. 1, but still have a way to go. It had 2.2 billion money cards issued globally in 2013, including 702 million in the U.S.
"
1175,TGT,"Easing Out The 16 Digits
"
1176,TGT,"That's a major change for certain, but a bigger one may be afoot. The 16-digit account number, once as much of a staple of credit cards as landlines were for telephones, is being phased out for online and mobile payments by the big payment card companies.
"
1177,TGT,"Visa is among the companies that have begun using ""tokens,"" which substitute the 16-digit number with a randomly generated sequence of alphanumeric characters for each transaction. They make it more difficult for cybercrooks to steal identities.
"
1178,TGT,"Moving American consumers from point-of-sale cash transactions to higher-tech digital sales, Visa is clearing the path. The Foster City, Calif.-based company has inked deals with Apple (AAPL), Samsung and Google (GOOGL) to deploy the tokenization tech.
"
1179,TGT,"It's the wave of the present. Its rival MasterCard (MA) recently unveiled its own tokenization system for use in so-called digital wallets. Smaller competitors American Express (AXP) and Discover Financial Services (DFS) also have joined the tokenization transition.
"
1180,TGT,"Pushing Visa further into the digital world is CEO Charles Scharf, a former JPMorgan executive who took over Visa in 2012.
"
1181,TGT,"Chip-and-PIN cards, tokenization and opening up Visa's network beyond bread-and-butter partnerships with banks are shaping up as hallmarks of Scharf's tenure.
"
1182,TGT,"One recent product push to digital is Checkout, an online payment service that integrates Visa plastic cards on the Internet via merchants' websites and mobile shopping apps. Yum Brands (YUM) restaurants and Under Armour (UA) are among the 250,000 merchants offering this service. Visa also is extending the service to China, Australia, the United Arab Emirates, Canada and Colombia. It says Checkout has 6 million registered users with average monthly enrollment growing more than 30% in June and July.
"
1183,TGT,"Benefits In The Middle
"
1184,TGT,"The company is so ubiquitous, Visa seems to be at the center of almost every transaction short of real estate.
"
1185,TGT,"""The beauty of Visa's business is they get a very small part of every transaction done on a Visa card,"" said Gil Luria, an analyst at Wedbush Securities. ""All Visa has to do is be in the middle and coordinate with everybody.""
"
1186,TGT,"Visa consistently ranks among top corporate performers, with at least 19 consecutive quarters of double-digit earnings growth. Its shares have risen about 518% since going public at 44 in 2008, splitting 4-for-1 this year and now trading at about 68. Visa has a stellar IBD Composite Rating of 96 out of 99.
"
1187,TGT,"""We look at it like we've had this amazing past,"" Scharf told IBD. ""We sit here today and think our future is more exciting than the past we've had.""
"
1188,TGT,"What's perhaps even more remarkable is that despite Visa's dominant position, cash still rules much of the world. Cash is used in about half of U.S. transactions. Outside the U.S., 85% of consumers are estimated to pay with cash.
"

1191,TGT,"Defying The Larger Market
"
1192,TGT,"In a volatile, down year for the market, Visa has been a leader in boosting value. Visa shares are up 3.7% so far this year, while the S&P 500 is down about 8.3% in 2015.
"
1193,TGT,"Visa's net revenue in fiscal '14 rose 8% to $12.7 billion, and analysts expect 2015 to settle up at $13.87 billion. Adjusted net income in 2014 rose 15% to $5.7 billion, yielding earnings per share up 19% to $2.27 adjusted for the split. Analysts expect a 15% rise to $2.62 EPS in 2015, ending Sept. 30.
"
1194,TGT,"Visa has its challenges beyond hackers. Merchants have sued Visa, accusing it of unfairly charging excessive fees. Currently, Target, Amazon (AMZN) and other retailers are suing in federal court, asking for a $5.7 billion antitrust settlement to be vacated.
"
1195,TGT,"They argue the settlement forces them to give up rights to sue over some of Visa's practices and policies. The merchants also claim that Visa and MasterCard fixed the fees they were charged each time customers used their cards. About 8,000 merchants opted out of the settlement, approved in 2013, and more than 30 lawsuits against Visa and MasterCard are still pending in that case.
"
1196,TGT,"A federal appeals court in New York is currently weighing whether to approve the settlement.

1198,TGT,"""Merchants are as important to us as the banks are, as are the acquirers,"" he said.As cybercrime strikes with worrisome frequency, Visa (V) is deploying new technology and services to keep digital thieves at bay and secure its position as the world's largest money card processor.The late-2013 data security breach at Target (TGT) was a game changer for American merchants, exposing 40 million debit and credit card accounts, costing the big-box retailer tens of millions of dollars and the CEO his job. It accelerated the move to chip-embedded cards in the U.S., which had lagged behind foreign money-card innovation.Target wasn't the only big victim. Home Depot (HD), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Michaels (MIK), Berkshire Hathaway's (BRKB) Dairy Queen and others also have been badly compromised in the last two years.Fighting cybercrime has become an endless war as hackers grow more sophisticated, but Wednesday is the last day of blame-sharing. Beginning Thursday, Oct. 1, more liability for money card fraud shifts to merchants and retailers if they don't use the tech to handle the new chip cards from Visa or its rivals.""The U.S. was the last major global economy that hadn't moved to chip and PIN,"" said Andrew Jeffrey, an analyst at SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. ""That made us the weak link in the chain from a security perspective.""Banks reportedly had issued more than 142 million new Visa chip cards in the U.S. by Sept. 1, but still have a way to go. It had 2.2 billion money cards issued globally in 2013, including 702 million in the U.S.Easing Out The 16 DigitsThat's a major change for certain, but a bigger one may be afoot. The 16-digit account number, once as much of a staple of credit cards as landlines were for telephones, is being phased out for online and mobile payments by the big payment card companies.Visa is among the companies that have begun using ""tokens,"" which substitute the 16-digit number with a randomly generated sequence of alphanumeric characters for each transaction. They make it more difficult for cybercrooks to steal identities.Moving American consumers from point-of-sale cash transactions to higher-tech digital sales, Visa is clearing the path. The Foster City, Calif.-based company has inked deals with Apple (AAPL), Samsung and Google (GOOGL) to deploy the tokenization tech.It's the wave of the present. Its rival MasterCard (MA) recently unveiled its own tokenization system for use in so-called digital wallets. Smaller competitors American Express (AXP) and Discover Financial Services (DFS) also have joined the tokenization transition.Pushing Visa further into the digital world is CEO Charles Scharf, a former JPMorgan executive who took over Visa in 2012.Chip-and-PIN cards, tokenization and opening up Visa's network beyond bread-and-butter partnerships with banks are shaping up as hallmarks of Scharf's tenure.One recent product push to digital is Checkout, an online payment service that integrates Visa plastic cards on the Internet via merchants' websites and mobile shopping apps. Yum Brands (YUM) restaurants and Under Armour (UA) are among the 250,000 merchants offering this service. Visa also is extending the service to China, Australia, the United Arab Emirates, Canada and Colombia. It says Checkout has 6 million registered users with average monthly enrollment growing more than 30% in June and July.Benefits In The MiddleThe company is so ubiquitous, Visa seems to be at the center of almost every transaction short of real estate.""The beauty of Visa's business is they get a very small part of every transaction done on a Visa card,"" said Gil Luria, an analyst at Wedbush Securities. ""All Visa has to do is be in the middle and coordinate with everybody.""Visa consistently ranks among top corporate performers, with at least 19 consecutive quarters of double-digit earnings growth. Its shares have risen about 518% since going public at 44 in 2008, splitting 4-for-1 this year and now trading at about 68. Visa has a stellar IBD Composite Rating of 96 out of 99.""We look at it like we've had this amazing past,"" Scharf told IBD. ""We sit here today and think our future is more exciting than the past we've had.""What's perhaps even more remarkable is that despite Visa's dominant position, cash still rules much of the world. Cash is used in about half of U.S. transactions. Outside the U.S., 85% of consumers are estimated to pay with cash.""There is a lot of growth potential in the United States and it is more pronounced internationally,"" said Sanjay Sakhrani, an analyst at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. ""There is still a long runway for growth.""In terms of growing shareholder value, a possible $20 billion merger with Visa Europe, spun off from the main company just before Visa's IPO, may steepen Visa's growth trajectory.

""That's why the stock was down this morning.""Yarbrough says if same-store sales gains would have come in the way they did and earnings guidance had stayed the same, ""the shares most likely would have reacted positively.""On the conference call, CFO Charles Holley said the lowered guidance reflected Wal-Mart's investments in wages — which it's increased — training, additional hours in its stores and in global e-commerce would have on earnings.The company also said Wal-Mart U.S. pharmacy gross margin was experiencing more pressure than it expected.Wal-Mart was seeing margin pressure from shrink, a term used to refer to a loss of products for reasons such as theft.Separately, the battle between Wal-Mart and Amazon.com (AMZN) heated up last month prior to the back-to-school shopping season as the industry giants one-upped each other with rival Black Friday-like sales on the same day.Amazon held its Prime Day on July 15, offering special mega deals to new and existing Amazon Prime members that day.

1319,TGT,"Upscale grocer Whole Foods Market (WFM) is expected to report slowing earnings and revenue growth after the close Wednesday, but one analyst sees potential to grab market share in the online grocery delivery space.Wall Street anticipates earnings rising about 10% to 45 cents a share, which would mark a slowdown from 16% growth last quarter. Revenue is seen growing 9% to $3.69 billion vs. 10% growth in Q2.Oppenheimer analyst Rupesh Parikh expects same-store sales to miss consensus views, which could weigh on the grocer's stock.""Based on our work, we believe comps could come in around 2.5%, slightly below a 2.9% Street figure,"" said Parikh in a Monday note. ""Historically comp shortfalls have represented negative catalysts for shares.""Shares have been falling since July 17, edging down 0.9% to 40.07 in the stock market today. The stock has been trading below its 50-day line since breaking support last week.Parikh cut his price target to 48 from 50 ""to reflect increased risks with the company's new strategy, as well as what appears to be a step up in the competitive environment for natural/organic lately.""As more stores widen their selection of natural and organic fare, Whole Foods has faced pressure from traditional grocers like Kroger (KR) and big-box retailers such asTarget (TGT).Part of the company's ""new strategy"" also includes an attempt to draw the millennial market. In June, it unveiled 365 by Whole Foods Market, a ""streamlined, value-focused brand"" that will open shop next year.The millennial-focused concept didn't sit well with some analysts. Cowen and Co. analyst Jerry Gray reduced his price target on the company to 46 from 53 on July 13 on the ""increased risk"" the new chain poses.""Although our proprietary survey data suggests the market opportunity for 365 is massive, we see elevated risk to sales and margin due to competition with the core Whole Foods brand and online search data points to slowing mind share among consumers,"" Gray wrote.But delivery — a feature more companies are rolling out — could be a sweet spot for the company.Gray wrote Monday that Whole Foods, which has a partnership with grocery delivery service Instacart, is ""best positioned to gain share"" in the online grocery delivery market. Instacart also offers delivery from membership warehouse store Costco (COST).Panera Bread (PNRA), Starbucks and Whole Foods Market ""are best positioned to benefit as these brands have favorable perceptions among higher income and urban demographics and have demonstrated the most willingness to grow the delivery channel,"" he said.Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) has also recently introduced its own delivery options.Last month, Whole Foods came under fire for allegedly overcharging New York City shoppers, though it has denied doing so.

1459,TGT,"Follow James DeTar on Twitter: @IBD_JDeTar.Hot young companies like CyberArk Software (CYBR) and Palo Alto Networks (PANW) usually grow profits and sales at a faster pace than older, more established companies.Today's Screen Of The Day is Young Guns, stocks of top-rated companies that have gone public within the past 15 years.The list includes five companies with a strong cloud focus — ones that provide software and services via the Internet.CyberArk SoftwareCyberArk, which launched its initial public offering Sept. 24, specializes in protecting ""privileged accounts"" of executives and others with access to critical corporate data. It blocks attacks after they've already made their way inside the corporate network.Cybersecurity is in the spotlight after a series of high-profile hacks at JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Target (TGT) and Sony (SNE), and the theft of data of some 18 million government employees and prospective employees from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management.CyberArk's earnings per share rose 200% in the second-to-last quarter and 1,500% last quarter on 81% and 89% increases in revenue, respectively. Its stock has a best-possible 99 IBD Composite Rating, which means that it's outperformed at least 99% of all stocks on key metrics such as sales and profit growth.Palo Alto NetworksSilicon Valley-based Palo Alto Networks provides various levels of security for corporate networks including hardware, software and subscription virus protection on network gear, PCs and mobile devices.RBC Capital Markets analyst Matthew Hedberg last Thursday raised his price target to 200 from 180 and maintained an overperform rating, citing expanded partnerships that are expected to spur further growth.The IBD Leaderboard stock has rarely dipped to its 50-day moving average since crossing above it in May 2014 at 66.99 a share. Its stock has risen about 172% since then to a 181.93 close in Tuesday trading in the stock market today, extended above both its 50-day and its 10-week lines.Paycom SoftwareThis 2014 IPO provides cloud-based human resources management software that helps companies with everything from recruiting to retirement. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) has added new facets to health care benefits, and Paycom Software (PAYC) recently rolled out Enhanced ACA to help companies comply with ObamaCare regulations.Paycom's revenue growth has accelerated for the last four quarters, and it's delivered a few quarters of triple-digit earnings gains. Its relative strength line has climbed into new high ground. It's formed a flat base with a 39.85 buy point.QualysThe third cloud security provider on the list, Qualys (QLYS) helps simplify security operations and cut costs by delivering critical security intelligence on demand. More than 7,700 customers in over 100 countries use its products, and its flagship Qualys Cloud Platform performs more than 1 billion Internet scans a year, the company says.Its stock plunged 33% to 37.03 on May 5 after it reported lower than expected Q1 revenue and its guidance undershot Wall Street's target. It immediately began forming the right side of a cup base, and it's climbed 27% from that point, closing up 1% Tuesday at 46.90.Arista NetworksThe provider of cloud networking software and hardware systems is in a fast-growing market and is forming some powerful partnerships. Arista Networks' (ANET) cloud networking gear manages Internet traffic for customers like Facebook (FB), Yahoo (YHOO) and eBay (EBAY). Its stock got a boost when it announced on June 2 that it's teaming up with computer and services giant Hewlett-Packard (HPQ) on bundles of data-center hardware and software.

1617,TGT,"Goodbye to ""Mod"" boy brand Ben Sherman, a relic from London's swinging '60s.
"
1618,TGT,"Hello Lilly Pulitzer, another name from that era, but from another continent and generation — in this case, Palm Beach, Fla.'s affluent resort set, which took up the brand's breezy pastels as its casual-attire uniform.
"
1619,TGT,"While apparel company Oxford Industries (OXM) tries to find a buyer for its struggling Ben Sherman brand, it plans to step up nationwide expansion of Lilly Pulitzer, now popular among women across generations as well as incomes.
"
1620,TGT,"It will also keep growing Tommy Bahama, its No. 1 brand, globally.
"
1621,TGT,"'Foundation Brands'
"
1622,TGT,"Oxford, with roots in men's suits and button-down shirts, is all about beachy casual wear now.
"
1623,TGT,"In the firm's fiscal fourth-quarter earnings release on March 26, CEO Thomas Chubb called Tommy Bahama and Lilly Pulitzer ""foundation brands.""
"
1624,TGT,"And in a conference call that followed, he said: ""In both Tommy Bahama and Lilly Pulitzer, we believe we have cultivated a deep and powerful emotional connection with our customers.""
"
1625,TGT,"After Oxford announced in the Q4 report that it was looking for a buyer for Ben Sherman — and that earnings in the quarter grew 21% from the prior year — the company's shares jumped 19% the next trading day.
"
1626,TGT,"Tommy Bahama is targeted to an older and more affluent demographic than Ben Sherman's edgy, young male demographic. It markets to men and women 35 and older who, as Oxford likes to say, ""embrace a relaxed and casual approach to daily living.""
"
1627,TGT,"Ben Sherman ""is a little bit out of their wheelhouse,"" said Pamela Quintiliano, an analyst with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, who described the brand's heritage as ""60s rocker working class.""
"
1628,TGT,"""It's more of a mid-tier brand and they tried to stretch the price point too high and alienated customers,"" she said.
"
1629,TGT,"If Lilly Pulitzer was alienating to certain women outside of Palm Beach in its early years, that's not the case now.
"
1630,TGT,"""There is a feeding frenzy for the (Lilly) product,"" Quintiliano said, driven by its ""aspirational"" appeal from its tony heritage and limited distribution in full-priced stores, largely in the East. ""Lilly has almost a cult following.""
"
1631,TGT,"Lilly also happens to be in the ""sweet spot"" of current fashion trends, which are all about ""color, prints and patterns,"" said Quintiliano. ""And obviously that's what Lilly Pulitzer is about.""
"
1632,TGT,"Analyst Eric Beder of Wunderlich Securities notes that Lilly ""has pretty much been a winner for Oxford from the get-go."" He also says that Oxford added much-needed retail expertise after it bought the brand in 2010.
"
1633,TGT,"Lilly's growing appeal is partly the result of a national ad campaign launched this year by Target (TGT) .
"
1634,TGT,"The campaign counted down the days until Target's April 19 launch of Lilly Pulitzer products. Target's limited, one-time launch gave customers the chance to buy into the brand for prices as low as $10 to $20.
"
1635,TGT,"Too Hot To Handle
"
1636,TGT,"The promotion essentially ended the same day it started. Items sold out within minutes at besieged Target stores as well as on the company's website, which went down from too much traffic.
"
1637,TGT,"Target got bad press for being unprepared (again) to handle heavy volumes. But Oxford ended up sitting pretty. It got free publicity and enhanced consumer awareness for the brand.
"
1638,TGT,"""Target spent more on the ramp up of that launch than Lilly spends in a year,"" said Beder. ""To get the Lilly name in front of consumers positions Lilly for more aggressive growth.""
"
1639,TGT,"The Target promotion also lets Lilly know where demand is strongest for potential store openings and test how well certain products for the home did, Quintiliano says.
"
1640,TGT,"Lilly Pulitzer operates 28 company stores. Another 70 ""Signature"" stores are franchised. All sell resort-wear-inspired apparel and related merchandise for women and girls. Many items in the new summer collection are priced from $100 to well over $200.
"
1641,TGT,"Oxford plans to push Lilly stores farther West. Six store openings are planned for this year, the most that Oxford has ever opened in a year since it bought the brand.
"
1642,TGT,"""Lilly Pulitzer has a lot of runway to go beyond the East Coast,"" Quintiliano said.
"
1643,TGT,"Oxford also intends to open eight to 10 Tommy Bahama stores in the U.S. and internationally, including Japan and Australia. A planned store in Honolulu's Waikiki neighborhood will include a restaurant.
"
1644,TGT,"Tommy Bahama ended last fiscal year with 157 retail stores globally, up from 141 a earlier year.
"
1645,TGT,"Its stores carry casual apparel and beachwear as well as sandals, home goods and gift items. Most are full-price stores; 15 have linked restaurants.
"
1646,TGT,"Tommy and Lilly also license various products. Both brands are also sold wholesale to select specialty and department stores, including Macy's (M) and Nordstrom (JWN).
"
1647,TGT,"Chubb noted in the conference call that the company has stayed focused on its full-price strategy, bucking a trend toward discounting, and said that it has ""worked.""
"
1648,TGT,"Same-store sales at Tommy were up 8% year over year in the fourth quarter, which ended Jan. 31. Same-store sales at Lilly rose 9%.
"
1649,TGT,"Oxford's total revenue during the quarter rose 10% from a year earlier to $274.5 million, with Tommy Bahama accounting for $186 million and Lilly Pulitzer $34.8 million.
"
1650,TGT,"The rest came from Ben Sherman and Lanier Clothes' branded and private-label men's suits, sportcoats, separates and dress slacks.
"
1651,TGT,"Oxford has been trying to fix Ben Sherman ahead of the brand's sale. Though Ben Sherman's sales have improved, it's still losing money, just not as much as before.

1653,TGT,"Oxford's total revenue for the full year climbed 9% to $997.8 million. Earnings also rose in the single digits but are expected to climb in double digits this year with Ben Sherman out of the picture.
"
1654,TGT,"Oxford excluded Ben Sherman from this year's forecast, which calls for net sales of $965 million to $980 million and adjusted per-share earnings of $3.45 to $3.60. That's up from an adjusted $920.3 million and $3.46, respectively, in 2014, excluding Ben Sherman.

1713,TGT,"Best Mutual Funds 2015: April Performance Report
"
1714,TGT,"The $5.9 billion American Century Heritage Fund has been in a groove.
"
1715,TGT,"Its return this year through April 30 was 6.42%. That topped 91% of its midcap growth rivals tracked by Morningstar Inc.
"
1716,TGT,"That was a big step up from the fund's performance over the past 12 months. Its 16.89% gain in that period beat 79% of its peers.
"
1717,TGT,"And it's a giant step up from its performance over the past three years.
"
1718,TGT,"In that span, the stock mutual fund's 13.61% average annual gain outran just 35% of its peer group.
"
1719,TGT,"Managers David Hollond and Greg Walsh have not changed their approach. It's the stock market that's changed, the managers say.
"
1720,TGT,"The market is rotating back toward the high-quality, low-debt stocks that this fund likes and that have made it a top stock mutual fund over the past decade.
"
1721,TGT,"Lead manager Hollond, 45, and senior investment analyst Nalin Yogasundram, 39, discussed from their offices in Kansas City, Mo., what the Heritage management team has been doing to return to the front ranks of successful investors.
"
1722,TGT,"IBD: Why is the mutual fund's relative performance improving?
"
1723,TGT,"Hollond: The weak economy and low-interest-rate environment were difficult for us.
"
1724,TGT,"In that environment the past several year, there was a high correlation between stocks. Investors did not differentiate between stocks. Lower-quality, highly leveraged companies would not do well without access to cheap capital.
"
1725,TGT,"Though the Federal Reserve has not acted yet, now it feels like (the start of interest rate hikes) is not far away, although it's not clear exactly when that will begin.
"
1726,TGT,"So the prospect of higher rates is turning into a headwind for lower-quality, highly leveraged companies. It's a tailwind for the type of higher-quality companies we like.
"
1727,TGT,"IBD: So the outlook for normalization of interest rates has helped the fund, right?
"
1728,TGT,"Hollond: So long as things normalize, that should benefit this fund. It's already benefiting.
"
1729,TGT,"IBD: For people who may not know your basic approach, take a moment to describe it, please.
"
1730,TGT,"Hollond: We are growth managers. What we look for is early recognition of acceleration in a company's growth rate. We try to find companies at the inflection of their fundamental improvement. We try to find companies growing faster today than in the recent past, and which will continue to grow faster. The key is, we look for catalyst-driven acceleration. We look for a driver that explains why the growth rate has picked up, a driver we can analyze and be confident that is sustainable for the foreseeable future.
"
1731,TGT,"IBD: You invest bottom up, not based on sectors. Yet sector weights reflect where you've been expecting to find buys. Why were consumer discretionary, technology and industrials your three biggest sectors as of March 31?
"
1732,TGT,"Yogasundram: We look for bottom-up ideas. But consumer discretionary and tech have dispersion. You can find companies doing well vs. companies doing badly. It's unlike energy, where it's much harder to find dispersion.
"
1733,TGT,"IBD: Is your stake in Harman International Industries (HAR) a play on U.S. economic expansion fueling more car purchases?
"
1734,TGT,"Hollond: Harman does infotainment in car systems. Years ago, you found that only in high-end cars. It's been moving down market. So Harman has been improving its content per car.
"
1735,TGT,"Yes, they're benefiting from a cyclical trend. But Harman is also a secular story, independent of the economic cycle. There's this secular trend toward infotainment and people wanting all of their (digital) devices to connect with their car's entertainment system and GPS. People are willing to spend more money on that. Harman has gained share and dollar content per car, getting paid more per car.
"
1736,TGT,"IBD: What did you see in LinkedIn (LNKD) that made you boost the fund's stake to 326,000 shares as of Dec. 31 from 281,000 as of Oct. 31?
"
1737,TGT,"Yogasundram: LinkedIn is the professional network that has the most and very accurate data on professionals like us. They're layering in more services (that they can sell) to take advantage of that data. They started by helping recruiters find better candidates for jobs. Now they're laying in services to help corporate marketing divisions sell to other businesses.
"
1738,TGT,"And they're selling services to China. They're leveraging data well. And they're expanding services from human resources and recruiting to sales and marketing, and they're going international. It's a solid secular growth company.
"
1739,TGT,"IBD: Thoughts on last Friday's price plunge on a disappointing outlook?
"
1740,TGT,"Yogasundram: LinkedIn is a solid company with a good long-term outlook. However, a combination of an acquisition-related write-off and some sales reorganization drove a temporary headwind.
"
1741,TGT,"IBD: Chipmaker Avago Technologies' (AVGO) growth has picked up. Earnings per share went from an 8% decline eight quarters ago to quarterly gains of 3%, 16%, 29%, 39%, 70%, 124% and 149%. Is it sustainable for now?
"
1742,TGT,"Yogasundram: There are two reasons their EPS growth accelerated and will continue to improve. First, they have a top-notch management team that bought good companies in the past. Most recently, they bought LSI, which was a badly run, high-cost company with a bloated infrastructure. They made it more efficient. Those gains dropped straight to their bottom line, which you've been seeing in their EPS.
"
1743,TGT,"Avago is the leading provider of communications devices to the iPhone and Samsung smartphones. As phones get more complex, Avago is a share gainer. And they've increased their dollar content on phones. That will continue with the iPhone 6 and 6+ and new Samsung phones as well.
"
1744,TGT,"IBD: AmerisourceBergen (ABC) is another holding with accelerating EPS growth. Is this a beneficiary of ObamaCare?
"
1745,TGT,"Hollond: The Affordable Care Act means more people are covered by insurance, so more people get health care and drugs. The ACA is a driver, but not the full story.
"
1746,TGT,"AmerisourceBergen is a pure play on drug distribution. If that's what you want to invest in, you can get that solely through AmerisourceBergen.
"
1747,TGT,"They've got some favorable fundamentals driving long-term attractiveness. With generics, after this year there will be robust acceleration in the generics launch calendar. That will provide a lift.
"
1748,TGT,"IBD: What about specialty pharmaceuticals?
"
1749,TGT,"Yogasundram: That's another area for them. They have key expertise. And there's robust growth in the specialty area. And it's higher margin. So it's an increasingly larger part of their business.
"
1750,TGT,"Let me mention one last thing. They acquired MWI Veterinary Supply, which presents an increasing market they can go after.
"
1751,TGT,"IBD: Palo Alto Networks (PANW) is a play on heightened concerns about network security, right?
"
1752,TGT,"Yogasundram: You're right. What you have today is an installed base of security that is woefully behind the threats.
"
1753,TGT,"Palo Alto is a next-generation security company, enabling customers to better defend themselves. Palo Alto is a secular share gainer. And it provides many more services than its layered defenses.
"
1754,TGT,"Their initial sale to a customer is an appliance. The second, third and fourth sales are higher margin. Their services can tell a customer exactly what happened (when a security breach occurs) and how to prevent that breach.
"
1755,TGT,"IBD: Lighting sounds dull. What's attractive about Acuity Brands (AYI)?
"
1756,TGT,"Yogasundram: Acuity is the largest lighting equipment company in the U.S. Adoption of LED lights is accelerating, especially as costs go down, so customers are layering in more products with LEDs.
"
1757,TGT,"When you have both cyclical and secular drivers, we really like that. That's what we have here.
"
1758,TGT,"IBD: What's your outlook for Electronic Arts (EA), which plans to release its next ""Star Wars Battlefront"" game about a month before December's scheduled debut of the next ""Star Wars"" movie?
"
1759,TGT,"Yogasundram: We started investing a couple of years ago when a new management team came in. They found a heavily bloated infrastructure. In the past couple of years they've reduced costs, reduced the number of (game) titles. Margins expand from 9% and 10% to 25% in the four or five quarters.
"
1760,TGT,"IBD: Is your stake in Hain Celestial (HAIN) a play on the growing appeal of organic and healthful foods?
"
1761,TGT,"Yogasundram: Correct. They've been in organic foods for some time. But we're really seeing two things happen. One is that organics is not just a Whole Foods (WFM) story (which the fund also owned as of its latest disclosure). It is also a Kroger (KR) story. It is a Target (TGT) story. Organic food is going from early adopters to more mainstream consumption.
"
1762,TGT,"That's a trend we're playing in a few different directions, including Whitewave Foods (WWAV) and Constellation Brands (STZ).
"
1763,TGT,"With Hain, they're selling more to Whole Foods and to Target and Kroger, so they're expanding distribution. And they're layering in more products. So it's a solid organic secular growth story.
"
1764,TGT,"IBD: Constellation isn't an organic play, so what is your thesis?
"
1765,TGT,"Yogasundram: There is a consumption change. Millennials and people in general are drinking beer less and wine and spirits more.
"
1766,TGT,"Constellation was part owner of Corona, the largest U.S. beer brand, and they brought the brand in-house and a few others like Pacifico. Since then, they've boosted advertising and brand awareness, and really started to grow that business. Beer is a 1% to 2% grower, but they've been growing it 10% to 11% to 12% the past couple of years.
"
1767,TGT,"They've seen better margins and better capital allocations and buybacks, but the crux is that they're a share gainer.
"
1768,TGT,"Corona grows faster than the U.S. market. There's a growing U.S. population of Latin Americans, and their favorite (beer) is Corona. But the mainstream U.S. is also drinking more Corona.
"
1769,TGT,"Constellation is also bringing Pacifico and Modelo as alternate brands to the U.S.
"
1770,TGT,"IBD: Is Middleby (MIDD) a play on growing U.S. GDP growth?
"
1771,TGT,"Yogasundram: It is a play on the U.S. economy in general. But you're also getting refreshes (in commercial kitchen equipment). For example, Chipotle (CMG) wants not only Mexican food, but also to move into pizza. McDonald's (MCD) wants to change their mix of items to more health friendly. So changing consumer tastes drives changes in equipment.
"
1772,TGT,"And Middleby sees growth in emerging markets.

There's a growing U.S. population of Latin Americans, and their favorite (beer) is Corona. But the mainstream U.S. is also drinking more Corona.Constellation is also bringing Pacifico and Modelo as alternate brands to the U.S.IBD: Is Middleby (MIDD) a play on growing U.S. GDP growth?Yogasundram: It is a play on the U.S. economy in general. But you're also getting refreshes (in commercial kitchen equipment). For example, Chipotle (CMG) wants not only Mexican food, but also to move into pizza. McDonald's (MCD) wants to change their mix of items to more health friendly. So changing consumer tastes drives changes in equipment.And Middleby sees growth in emerging markets. If Yum (YUM) wants to grow in China, it needs more restaurants, more ovens.

1794,TGT,"Two weeks after kicking its CEO to the curb, Redbox parent Outerwall (OUTR) reported better-than-expected earnings and sales for the fourth quarter.Outerwall stock rose more than 6% Friday, closing above 65.Outerwall late Thursday also declared its first-ever quarterly dividend and announced an additional $250 million stock buyback plan.Outerwall earned $2.44 a share, up 45% year over year, on sales of $601 million, up 1%. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected $2.37 and $600 million.On Jan. 20, Outerwall announced that Scott Di Valerio had stepped down as CEO and resigned from the board. Board member Nora Denzel was appointed interim CEO.In a statement Thursday, Denzel said the company is pleased with its Q4 results and is focused on optimizing its core businesses (Redbox and Coinstar) and scaling its ecoATM business. EcoATM operates kiosks that allow people to trade in used smartphones and other mobile devices for cash. As of Dec. 31, it has installed 1,890 ecoATM kiosks nationwide, including 380 in Q4.In Q4, Redbox accounted for 82% of Outerwall's revenue. Redbox generated $494 million in sales, flat with Q4 2013. It benefited from price increases for movie rentals and a strong release slate in December. It operated 43,680 Redbox kiosks in Q4.Effective Dec. 2, Redbox raised its daily rental rate for DVDs to $1.50 from $1.20 and for Blu-ray Discs to $2 from $1.50. Effective Jan. 6, it raised its daily rental rate for video games to $3 from $2.Outerwall also announced Thursday that it is shutting down its Redbox operations in Canada because the business didn't meet its performance expectations. It's not the only U.S. retailer leaving Canada. Target (TGT) announced last month that it is shutting down its 133 stores in the Great White North.Outerwall's Coinstar coin-redemption kiosks generated $82 million in revenue in Q4, up 1.5%. Coinstar accounted for 14% of Outerwall's revenue in Q4. It operated 21,340 Coinstar kiosks in Q4.For 2015, Outerwall expects sales to rise 4% to $2.39 billion, based on the midpoint of guidance. It did not give an earnings-per-share target, but Wall Street has modeled a 17% rise to $7.50. Outerwall no longer gives quarterly guidance.Pacific Crest Securities analyst Andy Hargreaves rates Outerwall stock underperform. He sees ""significant risk"" that declining movie rental volume will drive rapid declines in free cash flow going forward. Rental nights per average Redbox kiosk fell 9% year over year in the fourth quarter.""We believe Q1 average rental nights per kiosk are on pace to decline at a high teens rate year over year, which represents significant deceleration from Q4,"" Hargreaves said in a research note Thursday. The recent rental price increases could accentuate the broader secular decline in DVD demand, he said.Outerwall CFO Galen Smith said the company remains committed to its current policy of returning 75% to 100% of annual free cash flow to shareholders. As part of this commitment, Outerwall declared a quarterly cash dividend payment of 30 cents a share to be paid on March 18 to stockholders of record at the close of business on March 3.Directors also approved an additional share repurchase authorization of up to $250 million of its common stock, bringing the total available for repurchases to $413.7 million.""Our 2015 annual guidance reflects our ongoing focus on managing the business for profitability while continuing to make disciplined growth investments, including scaling ecoATM,"" CFO Smith said in a statement.Dougherty analyst Steven Frankel sees many reasons for concern. They include the surprise exit of CEO Di Valerio and the erosion in the Redbox business. He rates Outerwall stock as neutral.""It will take the appointment of a new CEO and the execution of a strategy which improves the prospects at Redbox to get us more excited about Outerwall,"" Frankel said in a note Friday. ""In the near term, we continue to believe the stock is a value trap.""Redbox faces a secular headwind in its business, but volume declines likely will be more ""slow bleed"" than ""fall off a cliff,"" Piper Jaffray analyst Michael Olson said in a note Thursday. He rates Outerwall stock overweight with a price target of 75.

Office Depot shares climbed over 6% Wednesday after surging 22% Tuesday.""This is a transformational acquisition which enables Staples to provide more value to customers, and more effectively compete in a rapidly evolving competitive environment,"" said Staples CEO Ron Sargent in the release.Staples expects to see at least $1 billion of synergies from the deal by the third full fiscal year after closing the deal, and it looks to grow its business past just office supplies amid competition from Amazon (AMZN), Target (TGT) and Wal-Mart (WMT).Activist investor Starboard Value, which owns 6% of Staples and 10% of Office Depot, has been pushing for a merger since January.Combined, the companies have about 4,000 stores and annual sales topping $35 billion.The deal could face tough scrutiny from antitrust regulators, which blocked a merger between Staples and Office Depot in 1997. But Office Depot bought rival Office Max in 2013 without regulatory issues.Follow Gillian Rich on Twitter: @IBD_GRich.

But he doesn't plan to slash prices across the board.""We're not in the game of looking at (price) rollbacks for the sake of rollbacks. It has to be measured,"" he said.Price reductions could be challenging to Wal-Mart's bottom line after it recently announced broad wage increases.Wal-Mart CEO Doug McMillon on Feb. 19 announced an immediate raise in the entry wage to at least $9 an hour in April. By February 2016, all employees will earn at least $10 an hour.""We're also strengthening our department manager roles and will raise the starting wage for some of these positions to at least $13 an hour this summer and at least $15 an hour early next year,"" he said.Wal-Mart will spend $1 billion to raise wages of half a million store employees.Wal-Mart is also putting pressure on suppliers to reduce joint marketing and use the savings to cut prices instead, the Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday.Foran said in his talk Wednesday that Wal-Mart is studying other ways to increase customer traffic amid weak profit and sales growth.He added that the company will focus on merchandising practices in weaker departments such as consumer electronics, where it struggles to compete with rivals such as Best Buy (BBY), Target (TGT) and Costco (COST).""Assortment is key to operating our business. You can run the cleanest, nicest, tidiest store you've ever seen, but if you don't have the right merchandise"" it doesn't matter, he said.Wal-Mart launched Project Reboot last year to improve merchandising, just before Foran was named U.S. CEO in July.He gave the program a mixed review: ""We made some adjustments to increase (merchandise) in this area and not in some others. I don't think we went far enough.""Foran indicated that Wal-Mart will emphasize department managers with merchandising and store-layout skills.Wal-Mart stock fell 1.9% to 80.71.

1909,TGT,"Before CEOs such as Apple (AAPL), Intel (INTC), American Express (AXP) and many other companies, government leaders, law enforcement, educators and students, Obama said the country's economic prosperity, national security and individual liberties depend on a collaborative commitment to securing cyberspace and maintaining a reliable, interoperable, secure, yet open Internet.""Government cannot do this alone,"" he said. ""The fact is that the private sector can't do this alone, either. It's government that often has the latest information on these new threats. We're going to have to be smart and efficient and focus on what each sector does best, and work together.""The president signed an executive order aimed at making it easier for the government to share classified information with companies.The summit and order reflect the urgency that the White House is giving the issue. On Tuesday, it created the Cyber Threat Intelligence Integration Center to streamline and sort cyberthreats collected by various intelligence agencies.Apple's Cook Still SteamedApple CEO Tim Cook agreed that cybersecurity is a shared responsibility. But he criticized government violations and touted encryption, something intelligence officials have objected to.""History has shown us that sacrificing our right to privacy can have dire consequences,"" Cook said. ""We shouldn't have to trade our security for the convenience of having all this information at our fingertips.""The summit comes after a year in which companies such as Anthem (ANTM), Home Depot (HD), Target (TGT) and Sony (SNE) have suffered costly and embarrassing breaches.Sharing For SecurityObama lauded efforts underway by network security firms such as Palo Alto Networks (PANW), Fortinet (FTNT) and Symantec (SYMC) to share information by forming the Cyber Threat Alliance.Palo Alto CEO Mark McLaughlin said in a panel discussion that the alliance is an example of how rivals can work together.""The more we're sharing, the less chance that these attacks will be successful, while dramatically increasing the costs (for cybercriminals),"" he said.Obama called for Congress to pass legislation that gives liability protection to companies that share information and helps streamline the way companies alert customers of breaches.Attendee Muddu Sudhakar, CEO of Palo Alto, Calif.-based cybersecurity startup Caspida, told IBD that he supports such legislation, possibly with tax incentives to encourage businesses to proactively share.""The question is how are we going to make this happen?"" he said.Obama said he chose to hold the event in the heart of Silicon Valley, where much of the innovation in next-generation cybersecurity tools is taking place.CEOs of some Silicon Valley companies such as Google (GOOGL) and Facebook (FB) chose not to attend, reflecting strained government-industry ties over surveillance exposed by ex-National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden.Cyberattacks have benefited security companies such as FireEye (FEYE), CyberArk (CYBR) and Qualys (QLYS), which all reported strong results this week.

Excluding special costs, it produced earnings per share of 16 cents on revenue of $123 million, up from 12 cents per share on sales of $96 million a year earlier.For the fourth quarter, company executives projected EPS of 26 cents to 27 cents on revenue ranging from $127 million to $129 million. In the final quarter of 2013, LifeLock produced EPS of 22 cents on sales of $102 million.Improved Security At A PriceLifeLock in July starting selling new premium levels of security packages to its then 3.4 million customers. LifeLock did not respond to an interview request, but CEO Todd Davis said on the company's earnings conference call in October that initial reaction to the new offerings was ""solid.""He said that the company's consumer segment powered revenue growth, with such sales in the third quarter up 31% from a year earlier. The segment accounted for 94% of LifeLock's business and the enterprise segment the rest.The company, Davis said, added roughly 264,000 new customers in the quarter. More than 40% signed up for one of the premium offerings, helping to bolster revenue.""We are still optimizing the messaging and rolling the new offerings through the channel. But we're quite pleased with the performance so far,"" Davis said.The newer offerings include personalized activity alerts on credit card, checking and savings account transactions.LifeLock Advantage alerts customers about unusual transactions by text or email for $19.99 a month. LifeLock Ultimate Plus, at $29.99 per month, provides financial alerts and messages customers on their brokerage and retirement accounts. These protections are triggered when withdrawals, purchases or balance transfers exceed pre-set personalized limits.With each level up in protection packages, customers also get greater levels of insurance on stolen wallets and cash. The Ultimate Plus package provides coverage up to $1,000 and $300 for lost cash.A more basic package, LifeLock Standard, continues to sell for $9.99 per month. It warns consumers of signs that a criminal may be trying to open a new financial account with the customer's name and Social Security Number. The higher levels also provide this service.""(We) are seeing about 1 million transactions a week coming through these consumer offerings,"" Davis said.He added that LifeLock is beta-testing a new privacy-monitoring service that the company hopes will connect it to more potential customers. LifeLock Privacy Monitor helps consumers find their personal information on people-search websites and in Internet-based advertising companies' databases. Clients can then opt out of or remove their information from those databases, he said.""The amount of data collected today is exploding as consumers increasingly live their lives online, and consumers are looking for a solution to help them take back control of their personal information and protect their identity,"" Davis said on the earnings call. ""This beta offering is currently free for consumers and will be used as a tool to drive traffic and engagement with LifeLock as we look to enhance and extend our leadership in the identity theft protection marketplace.""Going MobileAdditionally, this fall, LifeLock relaunched its mobile wallet application for major mobile app stores,Apple's (AAPL) App Store and Google's (GOOGL) Android app store Google Play, as another way to reach prospective and potentially younger customers. It provides free services such as digital copies of payment and identification cards for access on smartphones, and the ability to reach LifeLock's paid services.""The technology piece is important, but you have to think of this more as a channel to new subscribers,"" Sterne Agee analyst Robert Breza said in an interview.He says that the typical LifeLock customer has been over 50 years of age with a substantial amount of wealth to protect. But the world is changing quickly thanks to mobile technology, giving LifeLock opportunities to tap into a younger and broader realm of customers.""So it is about trying to appeal to that person who is 30 or maybe 35 years old, who is more technically savvy and who is putting everything into his or her phone"" and wants protection on that front, he said.The relaunch of the wallet app also confirmed to Wall Street that LifeLock could swiftly correct a substantial mistake that dogged it earlier this year. In May, a few months after the company paid nearly $43 million to acquire mobile wallet specialist Lemon — the initial source of the app — LifeLock removed the app from online stores after learning that it did not fully comply with payment card industry security standards.""They obviously had a tough lesson to learn,"" Breza said.LifeLock's management proved that it could learn quickly, he says, by updating the product for full compliance and re-launching the app in October, ahead of the year-end relaunch that some analysts had anticipated.""The management team is very sound,"" he added.Breza said that LifeLock is not trying to own the ""digital wallet"" space — which is populated by tech and finance giants — but can carve out a niche and ride the important mobile wave by partnering with the likes of Visa (V) or Apple and its Apple Pay.""It's about where the world is going,"" Breza said.LifeLock stock, recently trading around $17 per share, is up only about 8% so far this year. But it has risen about 25% over the past three months and is riding momentum that many on Wall Street think it could sustain into 2015.LifeLock gets a Composite Rating of 98 out of a possible 99 from IBD, taking into account factors such as earnings and stock-price growth.It has the second-highest Composite Rating in its industry group after Envestnet (ENV), a provider of investment technology for financial advisers, which gets a 99. The Financial Services-Specialty industry group, where both reside, is ranked No. 37 in performance among 197 that IBD tracks.Of eight analysts who cover LifeLock, Thomson Reuters reports three have a buy rating, two a strong buy and one a hold. The consensus average price target is 21.Given the company's growth trajectory, ""the stock is absolutely cheap,"" Breza said.

1999,TGT,"Often, it's not how well you do, it's how well you do relative to expectations. The same applies to earnings reports. A company that crushes earnings estimates often enjoys a big stock gain, as a surprise Wall Street sets a higher valuation. It also suggests the company has a stronger growth trajectory that bodes well for long-term share price gains.IBD's Screen of the Day is Estimate Beaters. These are highly rated companies with the biggest earnings per share outperformance in the latest quarter. Today's screen includes three security-related companies.CyberArk Software (CYBR) is one of several cybersecurity firms benefitting from companies' recognition that online security is a priority, not a luxury. That follows high-profile breaches from Target (TGT), Home Depot (HD) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM).The Newton, Mass.-based company claims to be able to deal with threats proactively, before they become major threats.CyberArk beat EPS estimates by 1,900% in its first earnings report as a public company.

Taser topped EPS estimates by 56% in the last quarter, with actual earnings growth of 40%.Now Taser sees a chance to expand its business with wearable cameras for law enforcement, in an effort to get a clear picture of police-suspect incidents, especially in officer-involved fatalities. Recent unrest of two such fatalities, along with other claims of excessive force, have helped make cop cameras a higher priority. President Obama last week called for funding to help local police departments buy wearable cameras. That's sent shares of Taser, Digital Ally (DGLY) and video processing chipmaker Ambarella (AMBA) sharply higher in recent weeks.Taser shares hit a fresh high on Friday, but fell 6% Monday on an analyst downgrade, seeing little ""upside"" given the sharp run-up.

Shoppers can pay as they go, at $4.99 per eligible order.""Across all our cities, more than 7 million people can now access our same-day delivery service, and in Northern California almost 12 million can use our next-day service,"" Brian Elliott, head of partnerships for Google Shopping, said in a blog post.Evercore analyst Ken Sena estimates it would cost Google about $3 billion a year to reach the 100 largest U.S. metropolitan areas, or about 10% of Google's forecast 2015 earnings before interest and taxes, according to the Wall Street Journal.Google launched the delivery service last year, offering same-day delivery from local stores and merchants in San Francisco and Silicon Valley, before expanding the program to New York and Los Angeles.Google's service competes with Amazon.com's $99-a-year Amazon Prime, which includes an Internet streaming video service, the ability to borrow books from the Kindle Lending Library and unlimited free two-day shipping for eligible purchases.Amazon.com is also opening temporary physical stores during the holidays in Manhattan and elsewhere.Google stock was up 2% in midday trading in the stock market today, near 551.

2039,TGT,"Let the gobbling begin. Turkey Day signals tasty sales, and service with a smile sticks to shoppers' ribs.• Wine and dine.  Capturing consumer interest isn't enough. Businesses must offer a great experience to keep them coming back.That's one takeaway from a recent survey by Tenet Partners, a brand innovation and marketing consultancy. ""More than half of consumers surveyed said they stopped using a brand because of poor service,"" Tenet CEO Hampton Bridwell told IBD.• Be gracious. The study looked at brand performance for Apple (AAPL) Best Buy (BBY), J.C. Penney (JCP), McDonald's (MCD), Starbucks (SBUX), Target (TGT), Verizon (VZ) and Wendy's (WEN).It takes time, money and effort to build a good name, ""but it's all wasted whenever a customer encounters bad service,"" Bridwell said.Being helpful, knowledgeable and caring increases a brand's value to consumers. ""This is especially important to keep in mind during the holiday season, as employees and customers are stressed and impatient,"" Bridwell said.• Serve it up. There's no more harried day than Black Friday.""Many shoppers set up their day as a mission,"" said Kevin Leifer, vice president with customer service consultancy ICC/Decision Services. Make it easier by putting deals front and center, instead of burying them in the store's back.• Fill the table. More retailers are slashing prices beyond Black Friday. Those planning door-buster specials are wise to offer alternatives for items in short supply. Some big boxes like Wal-Mart (WMT) guarantee product availability during specific sale times, and offer to ship the product for free when on-site supplies run out. Not every retailer can follow through like that, but ""let's have a prepared list of options,"" Leifer said.• Manage expectations. If quantities are limited, say so in ads.You might make a few customers happy with a rare deal, but ""you're disappointing far more than you're satisfying,"" Leifer said.• Make it clear. Be precise about pricing. Customers get annoyed trying to guess what the deal is — or finding out the numbers are different at the register. ""You want to be completely transparent for your customers,"" Leifer said.• Mind manners. Teach employees — especially newbies helping out at holidays time — how to treat shoppers. ""You can't forget the basics of customer interaction,"" Leifer said. ""Every one of those touch points, that is the brand.""• Keep good company.  Smart retailers employ the cream of the crop. ""You're hiring for attitude, not skills. If an applicant doesn't smile during the job interview, don't hire him."" So advised John Tschohl, customer service expert and author of ""Moving Up.""• Chat them up. ""This is your chance to make a hell of a first impression,"" said Tschohl.Teach workers to introduce themselves and address customers by name. Doing so makes the experience more personable.""You cannot own the customer only on price. There are too many options out there,"" he said. ""People buy relationships.""• Solve sticky situations. Give frontline workers tools to keep cool when tempers flare. ""Most employees have never been trained to handle irate customers,"" Tschohl said. Empower staff to make decisions in the moment.Then back them up.""The number one reason people will not use empowerment is because they know in their hearts they will lose their jobs,"" Tschohl said.• End with gratitude. ""It does not take extra time,"" said Tschohl, ""to smile and say: 'Thank you for coming.'""

2060,TGT,"In the battle to lure online shoppers with savory deals on Black Friday, Amazon.com (AMZN) came out a clear price winner against giant discounters Wal-Mart Stores (WMT) and Target (TGT).That's the finding of a Nov. 28 survey by Deutsche Bank analyst Paul Trussell. The survey, which compared online prices of 65 identical items at Amazon.com, Walmart.com and Target.com, showed that Amazon's basket was 8.3% less expensive than Wal-Mart's, and 8.4% lower than Target's.The survey also found that Wal-Mart's basket was 0.2% below Target's. Including Target's REDcard discount, Amazon was 3.6% below Target, and Wal-Mart was 5.1% above Target.Amazon was the price leader in nearly every category, including electronics, movies/books/music, accessories/jewelry and home/sporting goods, but Wal-Mart had the lowest prices on toys. Including REDcard, Target would have been the leader in accessories/jewelry, the survey found.Amazon's deepest discounts were in the movies/books/music category, with 33.8% price leadership vs. Wal-Mart and 29.5% vs. Target.Trussell compared this year's Black Friday study with an Oct. 31 study and found that in a ""like-for-like basket"" of 60 items, this year prices were down 9.2% at Amazon vs. a year earlier, 5.9% at Wal-Mart and 4.6% at Target.""We believe this is a good proxy for the average level of promotional activity on nondoorbuster items on Black Friday vs. typical selling days,"" Trussell noted.This year, Black Friday featured ""major savings"" year over year on the same items when comparing a similar basket of 38 items with a Dec. 12, 2013, holiday pricing study. The survey found that prices were 11.5% lower at Wal-Mart this year, 9.7% less at Amazon and 3.3% lower at Target.""We think this demonstrates that Black Friday was incrementally more promotional this year for all three retailers online, with AMZN lowering prices the most (year over year) followed by WMT and TGT,"" he noted.

Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect Visa's year-over-year earnings to rise at least 15% over the next three years.McCrohan initiated Visa with a 12-month price target of 265. Shares of the San Francisco-based company were near 214 in early morning trading in the stock market.Also Tuesday, McCrohan initiated Purchase, N.Y.-based MasterCard with a 12-month price target of 85. The stock currently trades near 75.MasterCard ""has momentum in private label cards,"" McCrohan said, including those issued by Target (TGT) and Sam's Club, which is owned by Wal-Mart (WMT) .He sees high-teen EPS growth as realistic for MasterCard. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters see MasterCard earnings rising 15% this year and 20% in both 2015 and 2016.In terms of global growth, McCrohan expects Japan to figure prominently in Visa's plans over the next couple of years.""Japan represents the fourth largest economy in the world, yet it's still a cash-based society,"" McCrohan noted. ""Visa recently acquired 100% of GP Net, a joint venture between Visa and seven leading Japanese issuers, which we believe is a clear indication of Visa's interest in this region.""Meanwhile, MasterCard is also making a big push into new markets.""MasterCard has introduced non-cash payments to several countries (e.g., South Africa and Nigeria) that previously had no electronic payment infrastructure,"" McCrohan said. ""These early successes in Africa have potential to be a difference maker in several years.""Visa has an IBD Composite Rating of 81, while MasterCard has a Composite Rating of 77.

Security now makes up about 3% of Cisco's total revenue, but that percentage is expected to rise quickly.Cisco Systems is accelerating its push into corporate security.On Tuesday, the No. 1 maker of computer networking gear is expected to launch a set of revamped hardware and software security products to help thwart growing cyberattacks against companies worldwide and beef up its offerings vs. growing competition from rivals including Check Point Software Technologies (CHKP), Palo Alto Networks (PANW) and Fortinet (FTNT).The Cisco Systems (CSCO) product launch comes nearly a year after its $2.7 billion acquisition of security vendor Sourcefire. That deal closed in October.The new products integrate Cisco's firewall products with Sourcefire's next-generation intrusion-prevention systems and advanced malware protection designed to stop cyberattacks from breaching company networks, says Martin Roesch, chief architect of Cisco's security business group and Sourcefire's founder.""We are bringing all of these under one roof, so it's really a strong offering that showcases the integration of the companies' technologies and our new direction forward,"" Roesch told IBD.Cisco is expanding further into security, wireless and data-center products to offset declining sales of its core network switches and routers.

2181,TGT,"Palo Alto Networks (PANW) is expected late Wednesday to report triple-digit earnings growth for the second consecutive quarter, but revenue growth is forecast to hit record deceleration.For its fiscal Q4 2015, the consensus of 34 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters sees Palo Alto Networks pulling in 25 cents earnings per share ex items, up 127% vs. the year-earlier quarter. Revenue is forecast to increase 44% up to $256.25 million.While still robust, the revenue increase would be Palo Alto Networks' smallest percentage gain since the company's IPO in December 2010. Over the past year, the Silicon Valley firm has posted revenue growth above the 50%-mark every quarter.Santa Clara, Calif.-based Palo Alto Networks has handily beat consensus earnings and revenue estimates every quarter this year.Wall Street's Q4 forecast mostly mirrored the company's. During its Q3 earnings conference call, Palo Alto Networks guided to between 24 and 25 cents non-GAAP EPS on $252 million to $256 million in revenue.CEO Mark McLaughlin expressed revenue optimism during a recent company sales event, Wells Fargo analyst Gray Powell wrote in a research report.McLaughlin claimed revenue would breach $2 billion over the next two years, Powell wrote.The growth will happen organically, McLaughlin said. But, Powell points out, analysts don't see Palo Alto Networks nearing the $2 billion line. For the year, the consensus models $900.6 million in revenue.""PANW's unofficial target is some 20% above current Street forecasts and implies 40% per year growth vs. the Street (estimate) at 29% for the next two years,"" Powell wrote.Powell acknowledged the comments were likely aspirational, but ""we view the fact they were made just three weeks after the close of FQ4 '15 as an indication that current trends remain strong.""The company's position on Wall Street hasn't been strong recently, however. Palo Alto Networks stock has declined 18% over the past six weeks vs. the Nasdaq drop of 8%.Powell saw the silver lining.""We think this creates a compelling entry point into a high quality/high growth security company that benefits from favorable secular trends,"" he wrote.Palo Alto Networks' marketing efforts have paid off, Powell wrote. Currently, the marketing focus is on endpoint software Traps, the next generation firewall and WildFire, a cloud-based malware analysis machine, he wrote.Powell maintained his outperform rating on Palo Alto Networks stock.Palo Alto Networks closed up fractionally Friday at 162.39. With the market in a correction, Palo Alto stock dropped 3.3% for the week after hitting a four-month low at 140.39 on Aug. 24.The same day, IBD's Computer Software-Security industry group fell 3.4%, hitting a seven-month low.Palo Alto Networks leads the group with a 97 Composite Rating out of a best-possible 99.

2198,TGT,"Patent expiration often heralds slower growth for innovative firms.Such has been the case with Keurig Green Mountain (GMCR), which sells single-cup coffee brewers along with single portion K-Cups of their own and licensed brands of coffee.The expiration of key patents in September 2012 let unlicensed rivals win share in the lucrative K-Cup market.Keurig, which boosted sales at a compound annual clip of roughly 55% from 2009 to 2013, was forced to make do with more pedestrian low double-digit growth levels. Some bearish observers wondered if the market for single cup-coffee was as robust as Keurig claimed.But Keurig, on the verge of introducing two major products, thinks it has the solution to slowing growth. And Wall Street seems convinced. Keurig stock, which ended 2013 priced just under $75, recently fetched over $120.Keurig's Composite Rating — 98 of a possible 99 —puts it first among the eight firms in IBD's Wholesale-Food industry group. With a market value of just over $20 billion, it ranks second in size only to Sysco (SYY) among those eight.Still, the company has had to weather declining revenue growth in the past two years. Sales growth, which as recently as the quarter ended Sept. 30, 2012, stood at 33%, was just 10% in the quarter ended March 31. Even with slower revenue growth, Keurig has been able to expand earnings per share nicely: EPS rose 16% last quarter.Later this year, Keurig will unveil a new system that brews whole carafes of coffee as well as its familiar one-cup servings. Perhaps more important, the Keurig 2.0 brewers threaten to lock out unlicensed purveyors of K-Cup compatibles.Coca-Cola StakeNext year Keurig will carve out new product territory with its Keurig Cold system for at-home carbonation of soft drinks.Coca-Cola Co. (KO) has invested in the at-home carbonation concept by purchasing 16% of Keurig shares. Coke's share purchases seem to validate Keurig's carbonation product plan. They've also fueled speculation of a buyout.Akshay Jagdale, analyst with KeyBanc Capital Markets, makes the bullish case. ""We think the company can triple to quadruple its earnings in a three to five year period. It has the potential to do that,"" he said in a phone interview.He believes Keurig's core brewing business is far from saturation and that Keurig Cold will offer new capabilities beyond those of existing home-carbonation platforms.""Five years from now, they have the potential to earn $8.20 from the hot platform and $3.50 from the cold,"" he said. Jagdale has a price target of $150. If Keurig's hot and cold businesses flourish as he anticipates, the stock would be ""a steal"" at his price target of $150.Others have their doubts. Theo Brito, an analyst with BTIG, a New York-based trader for hedge funds, mutual funds and other institutional clients, begins by throwing cold carbonated water on the notion of a Coke buyout, which he terms ""very unlikely."" His fundamental skepticism is centered on Keurig's core brewing business.Pods And ProfitKeurig brewers are in roughly 18 million U.S. households. Suzanne DuLong, Keurig vice president of investor relations, notes that there are 90 million coffee-drinking households in America. ""We think there's still ample opportunity with our Hot systems,"" she said.Brito questions whether all those 90 million households have the income or inclination to purchase a Keurig brewer, which can run from $80 to $189.Brito claims that as Keurig has expanded sales, the average number of cups brewed on its machines — the attachment rate, in industry lingo — has declined.""Over the last five years, there's been an annual decline of around 10%,"" Brito told IBD. ""I expect the decline to continue.""That's important because Keurig derives the bulk of its profit from K-Cups, not brewers. Declining K-Cup sales would definitely pinch margins, he contends.Still, Wall Street bulls have been winning the argument on Keurig this year. And KeyBanc's Jagdale tackles the bearish doubts head-on. He contends that Keurig has the potential to vastly increase the household presence of its brewers.In Europe, he notes, single-serve brewers are in 30%-35% of households. Keurig currently has just 20% penetration.And Jagdale foresees huge gains in single portion coffee as the new Keurig 2.0 locks out unlicensed packet providers. In just the last year and a half, unlicensed sellers have gone from zero to roughly 14% of the K-Cup market, he notes.""The Keurig 2.0 brewer will not allow any unlicensed cups to work with it,"" he said.Jagdale sees signs that the strategy is already working. He notes that several retailers — including Target (TGT) — that had been unlicensed have recently entered into licensing arrangements with Keurig. He suggests that retailers prefer sharing coffee packet revenue with Keurig to being locked out of the business entirely.Jagdale does not venture to predict the likelihood of Coca-Cola expanding its equity ownership in Keurig Green Mountain. ""It's hard to predict what will happen with buyouts,"" he said.He does think the likelihood of buyout ""will increase with the success of Keurig Cold.""The Cool FactorKeurig Cold systems will hit the market in 2015. Keurig spokeswoman DuLong says that at $80 to $189, Keurig Cold units will carry similar pricing to Keurig brewers.Consumers have other choices for at home carbonation, including products from market leader SodaStream International (SODA).Still, the market is in its infancy and Jagdale is impressed with one expected Keurig Cold feature: ""It will be the only product that can produce a cold beverage.""The Keurig carbonators could begin to contribute as much as $3.50 in EPS just three years after their 2015 introduction , Jagdale estimates. That's one reason he expects Keurig to get back on the fast growth track.""You're going to see an acceleration in top-line growth for Keurig,"" he said.

"
2200,TGT,"The company said ""Apple Pay"" will be available in October as a free update to its iOS 8 software.
"
2201,TGT,"Apple's (AAPL) push into mobile payments isn't expected to power earnings growth, analyst say. But Apple's digital wallet will likely re-energize the iOS ecosystem's cool factor, amid rising smartphone competition. That, of course, depends on how many iPhone users tap-to-pay, instead of pulling out cash or swiping credit cards in retail stores.
"
2202,TGT,"Apple didn't disclose terms with credit-card companies that will support the payment system. JPMorgan speculates Apple may collect a small transaction fee, perhaps pennies, each time iPhone users wave their device to pay at check-out terminals.

Almost all mobile wallets today rely on credit-card networks to authorize and clear payments, says Goldman Sachs. PayPal, which uses a clearinghouse system set up by banks, has more than half of transactions linked to traditional credit cards.

IPhone users will be able to load eligible credit cards into the Passport app.IPhone users are prime candidates for ushering in the mobile wallet age, says Jordan McKee, an analyst at 451 Research.""Not only do iPhone owners earn more than their Android counterparts, they also spend more,"" McKee told IBD. ""IPhone owners are the most advanced users of mobile transaction services across a wealth of categories. An iWallet would simply be a natural extension of how iPhone owners already use their devices.""The number of iTunes accounts has ballooned from 575 million to 800 million in a year, with many of those accounts having a credit or debit card associated with them. While most vendors are clutching at straws for new ways to increase cards on file, Apple trumps them from day one by a significant factor.""Apple, which acquired Beats Electronics' music streaming service in May for $ 3.2 billion, aims to diversify from hardware into services.At around a penny per transaction, Apple's payment revenue would amount to a few hundred million dollars annually, analysts estimate. A JPMorgan report says the ""impact to Apple's earnings would be immaterial.""McDonald's, Macy's On BoardApple's biggest benefit would be ""significant platform lock-in"" amid fierce competition from Google-Android based smartphones and other rivals, JPMorgan analyst Rod Hall said. Mobile payments, said Goldman Sachs analyst James Schneider in a report, will ""increase the stickiness of the iOS platform over time.""Apple says its payment system will work with Visa (V), MasterCard (MA) and American Express (AXP), as well as credit cards from six banks.Apple Pay can be used at McDonald's (MCD), Starbucks (SBUX), Macy's (M), Bloomingdale's, Walgreen (WAG), Walt Disney (DIS), Staples (SPLS), Duane Reade and Subway. Some 22,000 retailers are equipped to accept the payment system, Apple said.Some speculate that Apple may launch a rewards program with partners to encourage use of the payment system. Analysts say it's unclear if Apple will be able to garner revenue from advertising or special product offers.Retailers have been testing Apple's iBeacon wireless technology, which provides customer location data in stores. Analysts say retailers hope to whisk coupons or other discounts to shoppers via iBeacon.Analysts say Apple made a good move in teaming with credit card companies. Visa, MasterCard and American Express have a strong presence in the mobile market. Almost all mobile wallets today rely on credit-card networks to authorize and clear payments, says Goldman Sachs. PayPal, which uses a clearinghouse system set up by banks, has more than half of transactions linked to traditional credit cards.Apple has taken years to cobble together a digital payments strategy. It bought security firm AuthenTec in 2012 and began testing iBeacon last year. But mobile wallets are off to a slow start.PayPal has tried to expand its online payment processing business into retail stores. Consumers with PayPal accounts use a plastic card or mobile phone number and PIN combination to make purchases at checkout.Yet, fewer than 5% of PayPal's nearly 120 million online users are forecast to use its retail payment system by 2015.MCX, a consortium backed by Wal-Mart (WMT), Best Buy (BBY) and 60 other retailers, might not be ready to launch its smartphone-based digital wallet until 2015, analysts say. MCX members hope long term to reduce the credit-card transaction fees they now pay, analysts say.A mobile payments joint venture formed by AT&T (T), Verizon Communications (VZ) and T-Mobile US (TMUS), rebranded as Softcard last week, has struggled to gain traction.The three firms formed the joint venture in 2011, but early partners Barclays and Capital One (COF) have backed out of the venture.

2231,TGT,"Amazon.com seems to be eyeing a lot of possibilities with Prime Pantry, a service that lets Amazon Prime members order up to 45 pounds of canned or packaged items — cereal, paper towels, soft drinks, etc. — and get it shipped to their homes for a flat rate of $5.99.The service, which launched in late April, targets the mass market for nonperishable groceries. Analysts say it's a stab at rivals such as Costco (COST) and Wal-Mart (WMT).Observers say it also lays the groundwork for a national grocery delivery service along with AmazonFresh, a test program that offers same-day or next-day delivery of perishables and other groceries. That service is being tested in Seattle, Los Angles and San Francisco.Prime Pantry offers an additional perk for Amazon Prime members, at a time when Amazon (AMZN) is pushing to keep people in the program after this year's hike in the annual membership fee, to $99 from $79.Basically, Pantry is ""part of Amazon's larger strategy to become a much bigger player in grocery"" deliveries, says Bill Bishop, chief architect of retail technology consulting firm Brick Meets Click.Tried By 3% Of RespondentsBut there's evidence Pantry is falling a bit flat with consumers, who either don't know about the program or don't plan to try it.A mid-May survey by research firm Bizrate Insights, a unit of online retail site Shopzilla, found that 66.7% of 1,762 consumers polled nationwide didn't know about Amazon Pantry, while fewer than 3% had tried out the service. Only 7.5% said they planned to try the service, though only 23% totally ruled it out, the poll found.About 25% of the respondents were Amazon Prime members.""The majority of Amazon Prime members in our survey didn't know what Amazon Pantry is,"" Hayley Silver, vice president of Bizrate, told IBD. ""There was confusion over other Amazon offers like AmazonFresh or grocery subscriptions.""There's not a lot of knowledge and awareness. (Amazon Pantry) can't move the needle if it lacks awareness.""Silver says Prime members could be confused by the many recent announcements from Amazon touting new services and perks for Prime. ""Some Prime members recalled getting an email from Amazon about Pantry, but it just didn't resonate,"" Silver said.Among those who said they had no plans to try Pantry, Silver says some may have been turned off by the $5.99 delivery fee.4-Cubic-Foot BoxAlso, she says, it might be difficult for some users to calculate how many grocery items equal 45 pounds of goods and can fit into the 4-cubic-foot box in which Pantry items are delivered.Silver also says Pantry's market could be limited.""It seems the audience for Amazon Pantry would be somebody without a car or who lives very far from stores like CVS or Target, or with another inhibitor that would stop them from getting these items on their own,"" she said.On the upside, analysts say Prime Pantry offers a way for Amazon to popularize online sales of items like pet food, diapers and canned soup, which before had to be ordered in bulk to qualify for free, two-day shipping under Prime.Prime Pantry items are being offered with special discount coupons, helping cut costs for users.Brick Meets Click's Bishop says a survey of 22,000 customers conducted by his firm at the end of 2013 showed that the AmazonFresh grocery service was used by 39% of households who had bought groceries online from various providers in the 30 days before the poll.""This was mainly to buy one or two items that couldn't easily be found in another place,"" Bishop said.But that 39% was by far the highest tally among all the vendors, he says. ""Amazon dominates in this space,"" Bishop said.Bishop judges Amazon Pantry a success. He says it provides a nice benefit for those open to online grocery shopping and boosts Amazon's market share in this sector.Coupon ClickingBut Silver sees other weaknesses in Pantry. She says Prime members need to click each coupon separately to qualify and do the math to compare the prices with other online delivery services.""It's an extra step consumers have to take,"" said Silver, who notes that typical loyalty programs at regular grocery stores automatically apply such discounts at the register without the need for such online coupon clipping.Based on website checks, Silver says some online grocery items sold by Target (TGT) are cheaper than identical items discounted on Amazon Pantry. Target offers free deliveries for eligible online orders that total $50 or more.Amazon is doing more in the grocery field. In April, it unveiled Amazon Dash, a wand-shaped device that lets users add grocery items and household goods to their AmazonFresh online grocery shopping lists by speaking into the device, which is equipped with voice-recognition technology.Users can reorder by scanning the bar codes on the wrappers of products already delivered.The device is being distributed free to consumers participating in AmazonFresh's pilot program. Such a device could also be used to place orders for Amazon Pantry, though that's not yet the case.AmazonFresh, Amazon Pantry and Amazon Dash could merge into a national online delivery service, with analysts expecting more announcements from the company.

2246,TGT,"Shoppers spent at a healthy clip last week as they unleashed pent-up demand for spring and early summer goods after hibernating during the cold winter, leading to an uptick in a key chain-store sales gauge released Tuesday.The International Council of Shopping Centers-Goldman Sachs chain-store sales index rose by 0.4% for the week ended June 14 from the prior week's adjusted level. That followed a 2.8% decline for the week ended June 7.Last week's gauge increased a strong 3.1% vs. a year earlier on a seasonally adjusted basis. That followed a 3% year-over-year rise for the prior week and a 3.1% gain for the week before that.The ICSC-GS consumer tracking survey found that business last week was up sharply year-over-year for wholesale clubs, and up ""appreciably"" for apparel, dollar, furniture, discount, office and department stores.That was likely good news for warehouse club operators such as Costco Wholesale (COST), discounters such as Wal-Mart Stores (WMT) and Target (TGT) as well as deep discounters like Dollar Tree (DLTR) andDollar General (DG). Office supply retailers such as Staples (SPLS), furniture retailers such as Haverty Furniture (HVT) and Ethan Allen Interiors (ETH) and department store operators includingMacy's (M) also likely benefited from the positive business trend.""The overall retail strength was impressive, especially given the weather drag on sales,"" said the report.Last week's weather was somewhat cooler than last year and above the long-term ""normal average"" for the week, it noted.May same-store sales reported on June 5 moderated from April but were still up a strong 4.6% from a year earlier for the 11 major chains tracked by Michael Niemira, chief economist for the ICSC.""It appears that after a winter when consumers deferred spending due to adverse weather, the consumer spring arrived as they picked up their spending pace in April and May,"" the report said.Niemira forecasts that June monthly same-store sales will rise by about 3.5% from a year earlier with a ""slightly tougher year-ago comparison than was the case for May.""

2295,TGT,"Related: Can Big March Thaw In Retail Sales Grow The Economy?Shoppers spent less freely last week as cool weather in the eastern part of the U.S. dampened demand for seasonal goods, leading to a decline in a key chain-store sales gauge released Tuesday.That follows the news out Monday that retail sales overall grew in March at the fastest pace in 18 months, in what was hoped to be a warming trend from a rough and cold fall and winter.Tuesday the International Council of Shopping Centers-Goldman Sachs chain-store sales index slipped by 0.3% for the week ended April 12 from the prior week's adjusted level, after two straight weekly increases. It followed a 1.5% rise for the week ended April 5. But the gauge rose a strong 2.3% vs. a year earlier on a seasonally adjusted basis.Shopping behavior was a mixed bag.

"
2296,TGT,"Retail sales grew at the fastest pace in 18 months during March, suggesting that consumers and the economy may be finally emerging from winter hibernation.
"
2297,TGT,"Sales rose a seasonally adjusted 1.1% from February, the Commerce Department said, more than the 0.7% expected. It was the strongest month-to-month gain since September 2012.
"
2298,TGT,"Auto sales, which rose 3.1%, helped propel sales overall. But even with auto sales stripped out, the resulting 0.7% increase was the best since February 2013. Most sectors saw a rise, and February data were revised up strongly.
"
2299,TGT,"Retail sales figures can be volatile from month to month but have been trending higher the past few years. Economists watch the data closely, as consumer spending accounts for about two-thirds of the economy.
"
2300,TGT,"Other recent economic data offer convincing reasons for the March bump. Aggregate wages rose 0.7%, the Labor Department said earlier in the month. Gasoline prices fell, said Stuart Hoffman, chief economist at PNC Financial Services Group, giving consumers a little extra discretionary money. Stocks and home values both rose, contributing to a wealth effect, he says.
"
2301,TGT,"""This is real consumer spending, real demand,"" Hoffman said.
"
2302,TGT,"Debating Winter's Impact
"
2303,TGT,"After two months of harsh winter weather, says National Retail Federation chief economist Jack Kleinhenz, those consumers were releasing some pent-up demand when they went shopping in March.
"
2304,TGT,"""Improving economic conditions and consumer confidence should push consumers to return to spending habits this spring,"" he said in a statement. ""We remain optimistic that retail sales will continue their positive march this spring.""
"
2305,TGT,"With the winter in the rearview mirror, a combination of factors bode well for the economy in 2014. Hoffman thinks the second quarter will compensate for the weakness in the first, and the second half will mark a ""break out of the 2% zone that we've been in for years.""
"
2306,TGT,"Some economists disagree on how much the weather has impacted the economy. Hoffman thinks that weather as an explanation for sluggish activity in January and February ""hits the nail on the head"" and that the thaw in March proves it.
"
2307,TGT,"Jeffrey Rosen, chief economist for Briefing.com, is more skeptical. Internet sales — a category that the weather is not likely to influence — rose 1.7% on the month in March, he noted. ""I've always been in the camp that says winter was overblown,"" Rosen said.
"
2308,TGT,"Rosen thinks that wage growth accounts for most of the sales gains. The length of the workweek and hours worked rose, the latter to a multiyear high. It means that businesses will need to step up hiring and boost hours and wages more than they have in the past few years. 
"
2309,TGT,"""We've had low growth and businesses at record high profits, suggesting they can run lean,"" he said. ""But in the end, consumers can only buy if they have income growth.""
"
2310,TGT,"But other economists believe that sluggishness in the winter will result in pent-up demand being pushed forward into 2014.
"
2311,TGT,"Sal Guatieri, senior economist with BMO Capital Markets, wrote in a note to clients that the March data bring expectations of spending growth from a 2.0% gain in Q1 to ""a complete recovery"" in Q2, setting up an annualized 3 1/2% increase in 2014. That will help boost GDP, Guatieri noted.
"
2312,TGT,"Michael Niemira, chief economist at the International Council of Shopping Centers, said that the rosy March data were received with relief. ""It's a story we all hoped would be in the numbers,"" he said.
"
2313,TGT,"""We knew that weather depressed January and held back February, and we were looking for that rebound in last week's chain-store sales numbers. But the weak weather-induced chain-store sales numbers didn't make the case as strongly and as convincingly as the retail sales did today.""
"
2314,TGT,"He says the Commerce Department report showed nice gains in retail sales in several store categories, such as general merchandise, clothing and building materials.
"
2315,TGT,"Sales at general-merchandise stores, which include giants such as Wal-Mart Stores (WMT) and Target (TGT), increased 1.9%, while building-materials and garden-supply stores, such as Home Depot (HD) and Lowe's (LOW), rose 1.8%.
"
2316,TGT,"Another housing-related category, home-furnishings stores, posted a 1% gain. It was likely good news for retailers such as Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY), Restoration Hardware Holdings (RH) and Williams-Sonoma (WSM).
"
2317,TGT,"Sales at clothing and accessories stores, which include giant apparel retailer Gap (GPS) and women's clothier Ann (ANN), rose 1% in pent-up demand from the prior two months.
"
2318,TGT,"The Discount Dilemma
"
2319,TGT,"Two big-ticket consumer questions remain. Auto sales bounced back nicely in March, to an annualized 16.4 million pace, the fastest in more than seven years. But automakers had to offer deep discounts to entice consumers in March. Still, most economists think that while the pace will ease a bit, it will stay strong, since the average age of cars on the road remains high. Hoffman expects sales of 16 million in 2014.
"
2320,TGT,"The housing market is another question. Rosen said that the combination of higher interest rates and higher home prices is ""concerning"" in its impact on demand. Declining sales mean less demand for construction and less price appreciation for current homeowners. It also hits retail sales, since homebuying tends to lead to increased demand for home furnishings, building materials and electronics.
"
2321,TGT,"Still, the March pop in retail spending jibes with other brightening economic data. Consumer sentiment rose to a nine-month high last week. Producer prices also rose faster than expected in March, a positive sign of more demand in the economy.
"
2322,TGT,"Even mortgage-purchase applications rose 3.0% in the week ended April 4, the third straight week of gains and a possible sign that winter's grip on the housing market may be easing. Homebuying is ""the most weather-sensitive of all,"" Hoffman said. ""I think we'll see a pretty good rebound in homebuilding and homebuying, and that would be the icing on the cake,"" he added.Retail sales grew at the fastest pace in 18 months during March, suggesting that consumers and the economy may be finally emerging from winter hibernation.Sales rose a seasonally adjusted 1.1% from February, the Commerce Department said, more than the 0.7% expected.

That would follow a 1% rise in Q1, but also would be the third straight quarter of single-digit profit gains. Revenue is seen rising 7.2% to $26.67 billion. That would be a faster pace than the prior quarter's 5% increase.Nomura analyst Robert Drbul initiated coverage on Costco with a buy rating in a Feb. 12 report. But he noted some challenges: ""While we are positive on the name, we note that head winds from FX have had a material impact on company results and anticipate this to continue throughout 2014,"" he wrote.On a positive note, he said: ""We admire the business model, membership fee renewal rates, consistent traffic gains, global square footage opportunity, and prospects for higher penetration of margin accretive private label products. We believe a premium valuation is warranted. We are also drawn to the warehouse club industry's membership fee structure, as it provides high visibility and predictability into the company's earnings.""Drbul is ""optimistic"" about the company's expansion opportunity. Costco aims to add 5% in total square footage this year, or around 30 new warehouses both domestically and overseas, he says. He expects a run rate of 30 to 35 new stores through 2016, with roughly half opening internationally.""We view international expansion as a great opportunity for both top-line growth and margin expansion as international stores are more profitable,"" he said.He pegs Costco's Q2 earnings at $1.18 a share.Retailers have faced some tough sledding this holiday-quarter earnings season with disappointing results the past week or so from many top chains, including giant discounters Wal-Mart Stores (WMT)andTarget (TGT)and upscale department store operator Nordstrom (JWN).Overall, Q4 retail earnings are expected to fall 6.1% from a year earlier, according to Ken Perkins, president of Retail Metrics.

2354,TGT,"Amazon.com, the No. 1 online retailer, tries to ensure organizational excellence in part by raising the bar with its executive and technical hires.
"
2355,TGT,"To reduce hiring errors, Amazon (AMZN) specially trains some staffers, known as ""bar raisers,"" to be interviewers, the Wall Street Journal pointed out in a recent article. These folks, who also hold other jobs at Amazon, are separate from the regular hiring team. But they wield veto power over job candidate and can block a hire.
"
2356,TGT,"""The bar raiser exists to ensure that the next hire should increase the company's collective IQ, capacity and capability — not decrease it,"" said John Rossman, a former Amazon executive.
"
2357,TGT,"Rossman was director of enterprise services at Amazon, where he helped manage global enterprise for clients such as Target (TGT) and Toys ""R"" Us. Now, he's a managing director with Alvarez & Marsal Business Consulting, a professional services firm based in Seattle. He's also writing a book called ""The Amazon Way: The 14 Leadership Secrets Behind The World's Most Disruptive Company.""
"
2358,TGT,"Rossman says the Amazon hiring process also includes all interviewers writing up a report and gathering to debrief one another following a candidate's job interviews. Notes from the interviews are written up by hiring-team members and the bar raiser (there is one bar raiser per candidate). All submit ""yes"" or ""no"" votes.
"
2359,TGT,"Rossman reveals more details about Amazon's hiring policies in this interview with IBD.
"
2360,TGT,"IBD: What does the bar raiser do after a candidate's job interviews?
"
2361,TGT,"Rossman: The bar raiser, along with the hiring manager, works to make sure everybody gets timely and deep reviews put back into the interviewing system. Amazon wrote its own interview management system software. It's called MRT, which stands for Matt Round tool. Matt was an engineer at Amazon who wrote this program. It basically is a tool that helps manage interviews and all the feedback. The bar raiser reviews all this feedback on the interviewees and decides if a debrief (among all interviewers) is needed.
"
2362,TGT,"The expectation for everybody on the team is that you are providing really deep feedback in both the content of the interview and why it did or didn't meet certain expectations for the job candidate.
"
2363,TGT,"IBD: Was providing feedback easy?
"
2364,TGT,"Rossman: I often felt that I needed to be a court reporter. I'm a sort of summary person. But (the process) put an emphasis on being able to write really deep reviews on what the conversation covered and how the candidate reacted.
"
2365,TGT,"It's like anything in life. There's a certain degree of good processing, but taken over a certain line of reasonableness, it at times got kind of ludicrous and absurd.
"
2366,TGT,"IBD: What do other hiring team members do? Do they do anything different from the bar raiser?
"
2367,TGT,"Rossman: It's really a partnership between the hiring manager, the bar raiser and other hiring-team members. It's a consensus test, but the bar raiser has a clear veto. If everybody else says yes but the bar raiser says no, it's a no.
"
2368,TGT,"IBD: Job interviews can be subjective. How does Amazon ensure objectivity?
"
2369,TGT,"Rossman: Amazon does this by asking very real, problem-solving questions. The best way to make things objective is to ask a candidate, ""How would youo solve this problem?""
"
2370,TGT,"IBD: Can you give an example?
"
2371,TGT,"Rossman: One would be a classic elevator shaft problem, such as how would you optimize the number of floors or stops that an elevator would make, given a set of circumstances, while explaining what the logic would be. Another would ask, 'How would you parse a set of code to count the number of words and the number of letters in a paragraph or document?'
"
2372,TGT,"IBD: What kind of direct bar-raiser hiring situations involved you?
"
2373,TGT,"Rossman: I dealt with a lot of account-management and program-management types. We would have real-life scenarios about how you would manage a project where you ran into certain challenges or questions. Candidates would also have to tell where they had had circumstances like this before, and how they handled it.
"
2374,TGT,"Part of it is trying to appreciate the job candidate's background and part of it is to put them under pressure and see how they deal with certain circumstances in real time.
"
2375,TGT,"IBD: Were you subjected to the Amazon interview process when you were hired?
"
2376,TGT,"Rossman: When I was first interviewed at Amazon, I had been a partner at (prominent accounting firm) Arthur Andersen and I had run a professional services and sales organization. I had people in the hiring process asking me statistics and logic questions and it was partially funny and partially insulting. I was a 20-year professional at that point and I was being interviewed like someone out of college.
"
2377,TGT,"IBD: Are bar raisers used in hiring all Amazon employees?
"
2378,TGT,"Rossman: They are used primarily for what I call corporate staff. They are not used for warehouse, temporary or labor workers at Amazon.
"
2379,TGT,"IBD: So we're not talking about all of Amazon's roughly 30,000 employees?
"
2380,TGT,"Rossman: No.
"
2381,TGT,"IBD: How many applications or resumes does Amazon typically get for the corporate posts you refer to?
"
2382,TGT,"Rossman: It wasn't uncommon that you would refer to 100 resumes to identify five to 10 people you would want for a phone interview. Out of those phone interviews, you would call in a couple for a day of interviews at Amazon. Out of that you would hire one.
"
2383,TGT,"IBD: What are the hardest posts to fill at Amazon?
"
2384,TGT,"Rossman: The technical jobs. There are technical project managers, technical leaders.
"
2385,TGT,"For more business-oriented roles like supply chain or vendor management, it is slightly easier to find and recruit the correct talent. But technical talent is the top of the food chain at Amazon as it is at most of tech companies, like Google (GOOG).
"
2386,TGT,"IBD: What's the bottom line when it comes to Amazon's bar-raiser hiring strategy?
"
2387,TGT,"Rossman: I think using the bar raiser as part of a process and a commitment to recruiting and attracting the right talent is probably the magic of Amazon. Probably the biggest risk Amazon has culturally is losing that focus on hiring great talent.
"
2388,TGT,"IBD: Who came up with the idea for the bar raiser, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos?
"
2389,TGT,"Rossman: I don't know where the initial idea came from. But I can say Bezos from the very first day (of the company) put a ton of personal emphasis into screening and recruiting the best talent, and quickly correcting mistakes. He definitely set the expectations about recruiting the best.Amazon.com, the No. 1 online retailer, tries to ensure organizational excellence in part by raising the bar with its executive and technical hires.To reduce hiring errors, Amazon (AMZN) specially trains some staffers, known as ""bar raisers,"" to be interviewers, the Wall Street Journal pointed out in a recent article.

"
2460,TGT,"""One mega breach can be worth 50 smaller attacks,"" Haley told IBD.Hackers who've long used malware to slip inside company computer networks are hunting down administrative and other privileged accounts, enabling them to go undetected for months, says a cybersecurity expert in a look ahead to the top threats of 2015.""Two hundred days of unfettered, malicious activity is a lot of time where hackers can really steal vital information, establish back doors, come in and out as they wish,"" said Ehud Mokady, founder and CEO of CyberArk Software (CYBR), a security firm that specializes in defeating cybercriminals who've made their way undetected into networks.Compromised privileged accounts are among the top threats facing enterprises in 2015, say not only Mokady but also experts at Palo Alto Networks, Symantec (SYMC), Intel (INTC), FireEye and other cybersecurity vendors.Most companies are unaware how many privileged accounts they have or that attackers can easily use them to set up additional users to blend into normal network traffic, security executives say.Hackers Eye New TargetsNew threats are popping up as new technologies emerge. Digital payment systems will provide fresh targets. Hackers will go after Internet of Things connected devices, from IP cameras with weak security controls to smart meters with basic encryption flaws.FireEye (FEYE) is investigating hackers who collect information from publicly traded companies. Attackers with extensive knowledge of industry nuances and financial practices are after insider information to get a clear advantage and ""play the stock market,"" said Dan McWhorter, FireEye vice president of threat intelligence.Long-used tactics such as phishing — tricking users into opening email attachments — and ransomware — forcing users to pay ransoms for virus fixes or decryption — will continue.Retailers can expect continued attacks next year, including credit and debit card ""skimmers"" hidden at gas pumps or ATMs to gather card details and PINs. Hackers will go after smartphones, tablets and other mobile devices.Year Of 'Broken Trust'Investigators are learning of new threats after a rapid succession of breaches in 2014, which might be remembered as ""the year of shaken trust,"" said Mike Sentonas, chief technology officer of the McAfee Security Connected unit of Intel Security.But high-profile data thefts against Sony Pictures, JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Home Depot (HD), Target (TGT) and other companies have heightened awareness.The number of reported cybersecurity incidents at businesses and other enterprises in 2014 rose 48% from 2013 to 42.8 million, or 117,339 attacks per day, according to PricewaterhouseCoopers. The average financial loss from these cybersecurity incidents was $2.7 million, up 34% over 2013, an annual PwC survey found. Big losses were more common in 2014, as the number of financial hits of $20 million or more soared 92%.Sony Hack A Turning Point?What was particularly disturbing about the Sony (SNE) attack was that sensitive, private information was made public to discredit and damage the company and its executives, analysts say.The sophistication and scope of cyberattacks has created a sense of urgency among top executives and inside boardrooms, says Palo Alto Networks (PANW) CEO Mark McLaughlin.""Historically, a lot of companies thought about security the same way they would think about general administrative stuff — like facilities,"" McLaughlin told IBD. ""It was something that was important, that had to happen in the company, but it wasn't rising to the level of being a top-three strategic issue. That's no longer the case.""Real-Time IntelTo ferret out and share information about attackers and their strategies, Palo Alto Networks formed Unit 42, a cybersecurity team to research, analyze and share up-to-the-minute threat intelligence. The team already has found a wide range of malware, with names like Kuluoz and Asprox, that have affected the health care, retail and financial services industries.In December, PA Networks discovered a backdoor in millions of Android-based mobile devices sold by Coolpad, one of the world's largest China-based smartphone makers. The backdoor, dubbed ""CoolReaper,"" exposes users to malicious activity.Corporate executives and IT specialists are focusing on ways to thwart cyberattacks in 2015.Enterprise spending on information security goods and services is expected to increase 8.2% to $76.9 billion in 2015, market tracker Gartner predicts.

2494,TGT,"By reconfiguring buildings and landing expansion-minded national discounters, specialty grocers and other chains, landlords have pared the average vacancy to 6.3% nationwide from a peak of 10.2% in the first quarter of 2009, according to Garrick Brown, research director for commercial real estate brokerage Cassidy Turley.
"
2495,TGT,"That's better than the overall retail property sector — including malls, grocery-anchored neighborhood centers and lifestyle shopping centers — which has an average vacancy of around 8.7%, says Brown.

2496,TGT,"In the midst of the recession, most retail prognosticators couldn't have imagined such a dramatic occupancy rebound in power centers, a concept that emerged in the late 20th century to accommodate big-box or ""category killer"" retailers that sell a group of related goods such as electronics or office supplies in copious amounts of space.

"
2501,TGT,"Among their other adjustments, power center landlords have shifted their attention to retailers less susceptible to online poaching and more agreeable to occupying a space that may fall short of their preferred specifications, he adds. Landlords are signing TJX Cos.' (TJX) T.J. Maxx, Ross Stores' (ROST) Ross Dress for Less, Five Below (FIVE), Nordstrom (JWN) Rack, and other discount or off-price clothing and soft goods retailers.
"
2502,TGT,"Power center owners also are adding more grocers, which like the traffic that national retailers in the centers generate, said Joseph Tichar, senior vice president of corporate operations for Cleveland-based DDR (DDR), a real estate investment trust that owns 117 million square feet of primarily power center space in the U.S., Puerto Rico and Brazil.
"
2503,TGT,"Traditional power center anchor tenants Wal-mart (WMT) and Target (TGT) have been expanding their grocery offerings into more stores, he said, while specialty grocers like Whole Foods (WFM), Sprouts Farmers Market (SFM) and Trader Joe's continue to proliferate.

"
2506,TGT,"Regardless of what type of tenant they're hunting, power center owners are paying particular attention to identifying retailers with strong balance sheets, cash flow and credit — traits that the defunct big boxes too often lacked. To a large extent, those requirements have put the focus on national chains in favor of either local or regional operators, Tichar says.
"
2507,TGT,"Power center landlords also are rearranging space to accommodate new tenants or to reduce the footprint of anchor tenants. In Chicago, for example, DDR spent $11.6 million to consolidate several small shops and construct more space in its Brookside Marketplace power center to make room for T.J.

"
2510,TGT,"To cut down on overhead, discount retailers generally want rent to represent about 6% of revenues versus the 10% to 12% that more traditional retailers have historically aimed for, she says. Plus, certain power center tenants such as bookstores and electronics sellers still face a rather daunting e-commerce threat.
"
2511,TGT,"""I think there's a lot of pressure on the sector,"" she said. ""These tenants are being forced to compete with Amazon (AMZN), and as Amazon increases its speed of delivery to customers, it has the potential to erode market share materially.""
"
2512,TGT,"Tichar acknowledges that the changing retailing landscape had pressured power center rents. Typically the REIT aims for tenants to pay a rental rate that reflects about 10% of revenues, on average, across its properties. It's now at about 8%, he says.
"
2513,TGT,"Future Of Shopping
"
2514,TGT,"Yet a host of retailers and grocery concepts are still in expansion mode and virtually no new power center construction is taking place, he says. So as tenants see their year-over-year sales and market share grow, DDR will have more opportunities to achieve its 10% goal.
"
2515,TGT,"Additionally, hundreds of leases at below-market rental rates with weaker retailers are set to expire over the next few years, he adds, and the company is proactively marketing the space to line up better tenants at higher rents. In one example, the company suggests that it could increase rents in 11 Barnes & Noble locations by 25% to 75% when the retailer's leases end in 2016, according to an investor presentation.
"
2516,TGT,"""In retail, especially in the power center space, people like to talk about the death of the big box and the fact that there are a lot of retailers that have had to close their doors,"" Tichar said.

So as tenants see their year-over-year sales and market share grow, DDR will have more opportunities to achieve its 10% goal.Additionally, hundreds of leases at below-market rental rates with weaker retailers are set to expire over the next few years, he adds, and the company is proactively marketing the space to line up better tenants at higher rents. In one example, the company suggests that it could increase rents in 11 Barnes & Noble locations by 25% to 75% when the retailer's leases end in 2016, according to an investor presentation.""In retail, especially in the power center space, people like to talk about the death of the big box and the fact that there are a lot of retailers that have had to close their doors,"" Tichar said. ""What people seem to miss is that while there are some retailers that are slowly going away or that have gone away, the list of retailers that are looking to grow is far stronger and has much more depth.""

2534,TGT,"Top brand builder Christine Day has simple advice for corporate managers and executives:
"
2535,TGT,"Once you've reached the top of your game, don't flaunt it while on the job. Never act like you've earned it.
"
2536,TGT,"Instead, she says, become a ""servant leader,"" one who inspires employees toward the top while turning customers into repeat shoppers.
"
2537,TGT,"That principle has helped Day shine at Starbucks (SBUX) — where she joined the coffeehouse giant in the mid-1980s as employee No. 3 — and at Lululemon Athletica (LULU), where she served as the company's first woman CEO from July 2008 to the end of 2013 and oversaw a stock rise of 3,700%.
"
2538,TGT,"Now she's trying to cook up a winner as CEO of food maker Luvo.
"
2539,TGT,"At Starbucks, Day knew a senior executive who took an expensive limousine car to the airport and meetings, rather than a simple taxi. When the exec went on business trips, he stayed only at five-star hotels.
"
2540,TGT,"It was obvious to Day that her colleague felt the status of the hotel and other perks properly telegraphed his status within the company. But ""this mattered more than the quality of the work and the quality of the relationships he was generating,"" Day, 52, told IBD. ""He treated it as his due rather than understanding he served the organization and the people.""
"
2541,TGT,"The Day Way
"
2542,TGT,"She tried to greet each workday with humility.
"
2543,TGT,"Her first job: office manager of Howard Schultz's new five-store company. Over a 20-year stint through the mid-2000s, she rose all the way up to president of Starbucks' Asia-Pacific group.
"
2544,TGT,"By 2007, the company operated several hundred stores across China, Thailand, Australia, Japan and Singapore.
"
2545,TGT,"Throughout that journey, Day made a point of learning vital skills from mentors.
"
2546,TGT,"At Starbucks, she had three major ones — current CEO Howard Schultz, former CEO Orin Smith and former Starbucks International head Howard Behar. Day took the first letter of each man's first name and called them her H-2-O.
"
2547,TGT,"Schultz taught her how to create a vision, how to build a brand and how to develop a product ""that is so good and combining it with a purpose so that it causes market disruption,"" she said while attending the Expo West natural products industry show this past March in Anaheim, Calif.
"
2548,TGT,"Smith gave Day lessons on how to turn a business model into delivering 20% growth in return on capital and 5% increases in same-store sales quarter after quarter.
"
2549,TGT,"He taught her how to run business units and maintain disciplined accounting at overseas units.
"
2550,TGT,"Behar brought Day on board with the concept of the servant leader.
"
2551,TGT,"Day said that along the way she grasped the importance of becoming an ""effective people coach"" and ""how to develop internal talent by creating mentoring programs.""
"
2552,TGT,"In 2008, Day made her most dramatic career move when she took over Lululemon. Fulfilling her dream of heading a high-growth company, she helped build the yoga-inspired firm, started by Chip Wilson in 1998 in Vancouver, British Columbia, into a multinational powerhouse in athletic apparel.
"
2553,TGT,"The company's results were as fit as its products.
"
2554,TGT,"From fiscal 2008 to fiscal 2014, ended in January, Lululemon's earnings per share jumped 730%. Sales rose 489% over the same time frame, from $270 million to $1.6 billion. Along the way, its stock soared from a 2009 low of 2.17 to as high as 82.50 in June 2013.
"
2555,TGT,"Born in Northern Ireland, Day moved to Western Canada in 1964 after her father, a former pro soccer player, changed course after a sports injury and pursued a career in mechanical engineering.
"
2556,TGT,"Going to America for college, Day got a business degree at Central Washington University in 1984 and quickly joined a firm in the Evergreen State that specialized in private placement investments.
"
2557,TGT,"While working in a state that would turn into America's coffee hub, she met Starbucks' Schultz on the job and joined his fledgling company, then known as Il Giornale, in 1986. A year later, Schultz acquired the Starbucks company.
"
2558,TGT,"At Lululemon, Day worked hard on brand-building campaigns that inspired professional yoga instructors and world-class athletes to work for the company as product ambassadors.
"
2559,TGT,"""They have an incredible sponsorship program that radiates their self-improvement culture out into the community and impacts the best athletes' lives in a huge way,"" Chandra Crawford, a Canadian gold medalist in women's cross-country skiing at the 2006 Turin Winter Olympics, told IBD.
"
2560,TGT,"Crawford met Day in the late 2000s, when the skier became one of what Lululemon calls their elite ambassadors. That tag gave Crawford and fellow athletes a chance to join Lululemon-hosted retreats and share ideas for product innovation. She paddled a two-woman kayak with Day through the inlets of Vancouver Island and developed a strong personal relationship.
"
2561,TGT,"Top Training
"
2562,TGT,"""I learned two things (from Christine): One, we share practices like yoga to balance and sustain our drive. Two, the level of understanding people in order to be successful in business is equivalent to multiple Ph.D.s,"" said Crawford, who now runs Fast and Female, a nonprofit organization based in Alberta that promotes well-being through sport for girls 9 to 19.
"
2563,TGT,"Day grasps that good store managers have a huge impact on building brand loyalty among customers.
"
2564,TGT,"With Lululemon, she made sure a store-based community was more than where staff talked with customers or gave free yoga lessons.
"
2565,TGT,"She wanted managers to have unparalleled knowledge about the product — be it yoga pants featuring high-tech fibers, a tank top for exercise or a cold-weather running jacket — and customer needs.
"
2566,TGT,"Day resisted excessive shifting of store managers among locations, as it would undermine continuity at a store. So she created rules:
"
2567,TGT,"• 1. A store manager had to work at Lululemon at least six months before opening a new store on his own at a different location.
"
2568,TGT,"• 2. Assistant managers should be promoted in their store if the top gun moves to a new store.
"
2569,TGT,"Homey
"
2570,TGT,"""Your store is a community,"" Day said. ""When a manager moves too often, it breaks down the relationships with the community, the staff and the operating results of the store."" The firm's in-house studies showed that having the same manager for two years increased profitability by 20% on average.
"
2571,TGT,"Two weeks ago, on June 12, Lululemon shares dropped 16% in heavy volume after the company reported quarterly earnings and sales that reflected an ongoing slowdown in growth. Earnings beat the consensus estimate, but rose just 6% year over year.
"
2572,TGT,"The stock has rebounded in recent days, but analysts have shaved their full-year profit estimates.
"
2573,TGT,"When Day announced she would leave Lululemon in 2013, Stephen Sidwell, the founder of Luvo, pounced. He contacted Day and asked her to take the CEO post. His goal: Find the right person to take the young firm to the next level.
"
2574,TGT,"""She had had two phenomenal brand-building experiences,"" he said. ""At Starbucks, she really helped Howard (Schultz) build the organization to what it is today. What she did for beverages is what we're doing for food.""
"
2575,TGT,"Sidwell, a former investment banker, says it was easy to convince Day about his company's mission. The harder part: asking Day to give up plans to take a year off from the corporate grind. She signed up, taking the new CEO post on a full-time basis this past April 1.
"
2576,TGT,"""She is an incredibly collaborative leader and has a really wonderful demeanor when it comes to leadership,"" Sidwell said. ""She really gets the vision of what we're trying to do, and has been able to put that vision into plans and organize it in an efficient way. People can see it and understand it.""
"
2577,TGT,"Luvo, which has drawn an investment from New York Yankees superstar Derek Jeter, aims to raise the quality of frozen food by using ingredients such as quinoa, kale and whole grains.
"
2578,TGT,"Luvo's frozen chicken chile verde won a Best of the West press award at this year's Expo West.
"
2579,TGT,"In January 2013, the firm started distribution to 91 grocery stores owned by Safeway (SWY). That has swelled to 6,500 stores, including top retailers Kroger (KR), Target (TGT) and Publix, plus the Home Shopping Network.

2620,TGT,"The term creative destruction is thrown around a lot, but Amazon truly ushered in a new industry while disrupting several others. It wrote the book on e-commerce, spreading from its bookselling roots into a behemoth that brought down brick-and-mortar rivals with superior service and execution, to linking new and unlikely businesses in novel ways. 
"
2621,TGT,"Amazon (AMZN), founded in 1994 by CEO Jeff Bezos in his garage, started as an online bookseller and sold its first book in July 1995. Customers could get rare books they couldn't find anywhere else and current titles more cheaply than from rivals.
"
2622,TGT,"The e-commerce firm expanded into electronics, toys, music and home improvement products and went public in 1997.
"
2623,TGT,"Amazon sales exploded from well under $1 million in 1995 to $2.76 billion in 2000 and $74.5 billion last year.
"
2624,TGT,"Shares leapt 8,526% from their 1997 low to their initial December 1999 peak.
"
2625,TGT,"Building The Brand
"
2626,TGT,"Amazon wasn't making money — but that was the plan. Bezos realized from the start that building the brand, infrastructure and market share was crucial, so his strategy was to forgo profits for years.
"
2627,TGT,"""There's nothing about our model that can't be copied over time,"" Bezos told Inc. magazine in 1997. ""But you know, McDonald's got copied. And it still built a huge, multibillion-dollar company. A lot of it comes down to the brand name. Brand names are more important online than they are in the physical world.""
"
2628,TGT,"While Bezos is hailed as a visionary now, nobody wanted to hear about money-losing Internet companies after the dot-com bust. Losses continued to mount while sales growth slowed to 13% in 2011.
"
2629,TGT,"Shares crashed 95% from December 1999 to October 2001.
"
2630,TGT,"In 2000, Ronald Unkefer, CEO of West Coast electronics retailer Good Guys, told IBD that he wasn't worried about Amazon, saying that Amazon and consumer electronics don't mix.
"
2631,TGT,"But Amazon sales growth ramped back up and the company soon became profitable.
"
2632,TGT,"Within a few years, Good Guys was out of business, followed by Circuit City and bookseller Borders. Barnes & Noble (BKS) and Best Buy (BBY) are often derided as de facto Amazon showrooms and are still trying to adapt. In February, Best Buy's CEO said his company was an ""online first"" retailer.
"
2633,TGT,"Amazon shares rose 7,306% from their 2001 low to their March 2014 peak — or 31,050% for their entire run.
"
2634,TGT,"The key to Amazon's success was in creating a no-hassle, no-worry experience, building trust with customers in the new realm of online shopping.
"
2635,TGT,"""Amazon looks like a highly efficient company today,"" Mark Mahaney, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, told IBD. ""But they slogged through years and years building up customer base and product offerings.""
"
2636,TGT,"The company offers no-hassle returns, one-click ordering and a customer call center with a minimal wait time.
"
2637,TGT,"""Customers want to go somewhere they trust,"" Raymond James analyst Aaron Kessler said. ""There aren't many companies you would save your credit card information at. But you would at Amazon. It's frictionless to shop there.""
"
2638,TGT,"Recent data breaches at retailers like Target (TGT) and Neiman Marcus highlighted the risk. But Amazon so far hasn't had any major security problems despite its high volume of customer traffic.
"
2639,TGT,"Craig Berman, VP of Global Communications, said in an email that Amazon takes ""protection of data very seriously"" and said it works every day to keep promises to customers to keep their trust.
"
2640,TGT,"Amazon's online reviews gave users the chance to rate and describe products that gave other potential customers the sense they were feeling out the product before buying it.
"
2641,TGT,"Low prices also kept customers coming back. Until recently, Amazon didn't collect sales tax, a sizable advantage over brick-and-mortar stores. Amazon also doesn't have the expense of running a physical store with limited options and quantities.
"
2642,TGT,"But building up warehouses and distribution networks isn't cheap and can't be done quickly, instead it is an ongoing process. Amazon's massive infrastructure spending — still ongoing — is a key reason why profitability took a long time and has continued to remain spotty.
"
2643,TGT,"Getting products from Amazon warehouses to its customers also has been an enormous lift to UPS (UPS) and FedEx (FDX). Both have seen their delivery businesses explode with Amazon and e-commerce.
"
2644,TGT,"Amazon also added third-party sellers to its site, giving smaller retailers the opportunity to reach a large audience for a fee, while allowing customers to find nearly everything imaginable under one website.
"
2645,TGT,"""Customers can add a Kindle book, headphones, a cocktail dress and diapers into a single shopping cart,"" Berman said. ""Avoiding long checkout lines or the fight for a parking space are a couple of reasons Amazon customers love the convenience of shopping online.""
"
2646,TGT,"Free Shipping
"
2647,TGT,"Amazon offers free shipping for orders over $35. That hits margins but in return gives Amazon a revenue boost.
"
2648,TGT,"Amazon launched its Prime service in 2005, offering customers free 2-day shipping and lower prices on one-day shipping for a flat yearly rate, encouraging the consumers to buy even more products from the company.
"
2649,TGT,"Amazon has had an uncanny ability to see new opportunities.
"
2650,TGT,"In the early aughts, Amazon ran into computer capacity problems. When it began to standardize its retail computing online, the company realized it could offer virtual servers as a service.
"
2651,TGT,"Bezos explained the decision to Wired in 2011:
"
2652,TGT,"""The common question that gets asked in business is, why? That's a good question, but an equally valid question is, why not? This is a good idea, we have a lot of skills and assets to do this well, we're already going to do it for ourselves — why not sell it, too?""
"
2653,TGT,"Amazon Web Services became part of the vanguard of the cloud-computing movement. Its clients include startups like Airbnb, Pinterest and Spotify that could start small and scale up as needed. AWS also serves established companies like General Electric (GE), Netflix (NFLX) and Unilever (UN).
"
2654,TGT,"""AWS allows customers to move away from managing technology infrastructure so they can focus on investing and innovating for their own customers,"" Berman said.
"
2655,TGT,"Amazon doesn't break out revenue from Amazon Web Services, but analysts estimate it topped $1.5 billion in 2012. The contribution to the bottom line may be even more important.
"
2656,TGT,"""Profit is something to worry about but Amazon at its core is a retailer,"" Mahaney said. ""With Amazon you should expect single-digit operating margins, but when they get into other segments like ad revenue and Amazon Web Services then you see higher margins.""
"
2657,TGT,"Making Lemonade
"
2658,TGT,"Amazon has largely given up trying to avoid collecting state and local sales taxes. But once again, it's turning lemons into lemonade. No longer minimizing physical presences to avoid tax issues, Amazon is building more distribution centers, close to big cities, as it pushes toward next-day and same-day delivery. The move still puts pressure on brick-and-mortar retailers to adapt.
"
2659,TGT,"The company is also branching out into online grocery with its AmazonFresh service, available in Southern California, San Francisco and Seattle.
"
2660,TGT,"Mahaney doesn't see a new online rival to Amazon in the next five to 10 years.
"
2661,TGT,"""Amazon is extremely hard to replicate. It would be extremely expensive to set up distribution centers and master logistics,"" he said.
"
2662,TGT,"Amazon introduced the Kindle e-reader in 2007, followed by full-fledged tablets.
"
2663,TGT,"Amazon hopes consumers fill up the devices with e-books, videos and other media from its site. And if users are buying media from Amazon, they are more likely to also buy other goods such as diapers or clothing.
"
2664,TGT,"""Amazon has an extremely competent management team that have been able to see around the corner,"" Mahaney said. ""For example the digital reading Kindle, that was far seeing on their part.""
"
2665,TGT,"In March, Amazon announced it would raise the annual membership fee of its Prime service to $99 from $79, but customers are still signing up for the service to take advantage of shipping and other perks, like online video streaming.
"
2666,TGT,"Lumping Amazon Instant Video, a service similar to Hulu and Netflix, and free shipping into the same deal doesn't seem to make a lot of sense up front.
"
2667,TGT,"But Amazon has the ability to see what a wide range of customers might want and then deliver.
"
2668,TGT,"On April 2, it unveiled its Amazon Fire TV, a $99 streaming video set-top box. Recent reports say Amazon will launch a smartphone this summer.
"
2669,TGT,"But despite its continued long-term focus, Amazon delivered strong profit growth in 2013.

"
2730,TGT,"Despite early success, the time came for a fresh perspective. Gap's performance had begun to lag, and ""change was necessary,"" says Howard Davidowitz, chairman of retail-consulting and investment-banking firm Davidowitz & Associates.
"
2731,TGT,"So in 1983, the Fishers hired Millard (Mickey) Drexler, a savvy merchandiser dubbed the ""Merchant Prince,"" whose innovations sparked rapid growth at Gap (GPS) — and in its stock price.

"
2732,TGT,"A Generation Of Gap
"
2733,TGT,"Drexler was hired because the Fishers wanted someone who had turned around an apparel chain. Drexler had spruced up Ann Taylor — which today is the public company Ann (ANN).
"
2734,TGT,"As executive vice president for merchandising and president for the Gap brand, and eventually as company CEO 1995-2002, Drexler ""reinvigorated"" Gap, Davidowitz said, and ""put the people and systems in place that could execute what he wanted to do.""
"
2735,TGT,"The overhaul ran from merchandising, store layout and marketing to clothing design, and Gap transformed the retail landscape in the process.
"
2736,TGT,"""One of Drexler's talents is the ability to select people, motivate them and manage them effectively. He built an in-house team of designers who developed products, communicated with the factories and were a key part of the planning process that determined merchandise assortment, quantity and flow,"" Davidowitz said. ""This gave Gap a significant competitive edge.""
"
2737,TGT,"On the sourcing side, Drexler used his familiarity with apparel manufacturing in China to select reliable factories that provided consistently high quality and shipped on time. He also put in place a planning and distribution method that supported frequent changes of merchandise sets at stores to keep things fresh.

""The company has grown, first in North America and now around the world, by making fashion accessible for all customers and generations. Our mission is to become the world's favorite for American style.""
"
2740,TGT,"Gap introduced its own clothing label in 1972, but the big transformation began when Drexler came onboard a little more than a decade later. The company acquired a two-store mail-order business called Banana Republic, which became the high end in Gap's innovative segmented approach to retailing. Old Navy would later become its low end. In 2003, Drexler moved on to helm preppy J. Crew.
"
2741,TGT,"1980s Power Brand
"
2742,TGT,"Retail began a period of transformation in the 1980s and early 1990s, and Gap led it, says Lawrence Creatura, vice president and portfolio manager at Federated Investors.
"
2743,TGT,"""The foundation of their success and innovation was a lucky intersection of correct personalities and strategies in a world when systems and distribution were becoming simultaneously more sophisticated, so that great people with great ideas could power these concepts broadly in an efficient manner and reap economies of scale,"" he said. ""That's what led to an explosive experience for shareholders of Gap.""
"
2744,TGT,"During its high-growth period in the 1980s, Gap ""pioneered"" an approach to retail that took into account the ""psychology"" of its customers, Creatura says.
"
2745,TGT,"""They were better at looking at the shopping experience through the customer's eyes and maximizing the fulfillment a customer got when they walked into the store, including everything from the layout and fixtures to the color palettes used,"" he said.
"
2746,TGT,"Prior to the changes in the Gap store experience in the 1980s, Creatura adds, stores weren't ""customer-centric.""
"

"
2748,TGT,"'Newfound Flair For Fashion'
"
2749,TGT,"How important was Gap in the transformation of the American clothing-store landscape?
"
2750,TGT,"NPD Group chief industry analyst Marshal Cohen said, ""They were at the beginning of the apparel surge we saw in the 1980s. They had a really good run at the beginning of that and were part of the impetus to create that run. They were one of the catalysts to help drive the newfound flair for fashion because they made it affordable and convenient (with so many locations) and so simple for people to engage in fashion.""
"
2751,TGT,"Underpinning its marketing, Gap leveraged technology to track costs and plan product development, manufacturing and distribution.
"
2752,TGT,"""Decisions were made based on the information gleaned from the ERP (enterprise resource planning) software,"" Creatura said. ""ERP was fairly new as Gap was ascending — Gap was among the first retailers to leverage its capabilities.""
"
2753,TGT,"The approach let Gap scale up, putting a ""homogenous retail concept in many different locations, in a cookie-cutter fashion, rolled out in similar spaces in malls across America,"" Creatura said.
"
2754,TGT,"In merchandising, Drexler's approach was to bring ""key items"" such as jeans, khakis and T-shirts that had fashion flair and were cost-efficient, says Cohen. They produced in big quantities so they could sell at good prices. They had a high margin, Cohen adds.
"
2755,TGT,"Cohen says that Gap took casual dressing to the ""street"" and made it a lifestyle rather than a category.
"
2756,TGT,"""They were able to say: This is the best (pair of) khakis or jeans, and this is how to put them together,"" he said. ""They made dressing simple.""
"
2757,TGT,"A Lock On The Look
"
2758,TGT,"The biggest thing that Drexler did for Gap was create a ""gigantic"" in-house design staff, Davidowitz says. Drexler closed the New York office and brought designers to Gap's San Francisco home base, where they developed simple, casual clothes.
"
2759,TGT,"Another innovation came with Gap's ability to ""exploit niches"" in the marketplace, says Davidowitz.
"
2760,TGT,"First came buying Banana Republic in 1983 to cater to higher-end tastes. Later, he says, Gap perceived retailers such as Target (TGT) as a ""real threat and underselling"" Gap stores with low prices. So in 1994, Gap developed a concept to attack low-priced chains: Old Navy. It later developed other niche concepts such as GapKids and babyGap.
"
2761,TGT,"""All the niches they were able to exploit in the marketplace beyond their core business were key to making them successful,"" Davidowitz said.
"
2762,TGT,"Today, Gap has more than 3,500 stores in almost 50 countries and is the largest apparel-specialty retailer in the U.S. by revenue .

""ERP was fairly new as Gap was ascending — Gap was among the first retailers to leverage its capabilities.""The approach let Gap scale up, putting a ""homogenous retail concept in many different locations, in a cookie-cutter fashion, rolled out in similar spaces in malls across America,"" Creatura said.In merchandising, Drexler's approach was to bring ""key items"" such as jeans, khakis and T-shirts that had fashion flair and were cost-efficient, says Cohen. They produced in big quantities so they could sell at good prices. They had a high margin, Cohen adds.Cohen says that Gap took casual dressing to the ""street"" and made it a lifestyle rather than a category.""They were able to say: This is the best (pair of) khakis or jeans, and this is how to put them together,"" he said. ""They made dressing simple.""A Lock On The LookThe biggest thing that Drexler did for Gap was create a ""gigantic"" in-house design staff, Davidowitz says. Drexler closed the New York office and brought designers to Gap's San Francisco home base, where they developed simple, casual clothes.Another innovation came with Gap's ability to ""exploit niches"" in the marketplace, says Davidowitz.First came buying Banana Republic in 1983 to cater to higher-end tastes. Later, he says, Gap perceived retailers such as Target (TGT) as a ""real threat and underselling"" Gap stores with low prices. So in 1994, Gap developed a concept to attack low-priced chains: Old Navy. It later developed other niche concepts such as GapKids and babyGap.""All the niches they were able to exploit in the marketplace beyond their core business were key to making them successful,"" Davidowitz said.Today, Gap has more than 3,500 stores in almost 50 countries and is the largest apparel-specialty retailer in the U.S. by revenue .""We transformed retail before, and we're now ready to transform it once again with world-class digital capabilities, helping us bridge digital and physical worlds and empower customers to fully experience our brands whenever and wherever they choose,"" said Chandler.

2832,TGT,"While the holiday shopping season got off to a weak start for some retailers, that wasn't the case with Wal-Mart Stores (WMT).The world's biggest retailer recently announced record results for Black Friday and Cyber Monday. With Black Friday actually starting on Thanksgiving evening, Wal-Mart rang up more than 10 million transactions within the first four hours. Towels, which shoppers fought over, were the best sellers. TVs and tablets were also hot items.Wal-Mart's momentum carried over to Cyber Monday. The retail giant noted that this year's Cyber Monday was its largest online sales day in history. LG's 50-inch LED high-definition televisions and Apple (AAPL)'s iPad 2s were among the top sellers.The company's strong start to the holiday shopping season followed last month's mixed Q3 results and lukewarm outlook.Wal-Mart has delivered higher earnings year after year. It has a five-year Earnings Stability Factor of 2, signaling a rock-steady stream of income. Its current fiscal 2014 earnings are expected to rise 3% to $5.17 a share. Profit for fiscal 2015 is slated to grow 9%.Besides consistent growth, the company has also rewarded investors with dividends. Wal-Mart is a member of the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats index, which tracks large-cap companies that have paid rising dividends for the last 25 years. The retailer has raised its dividend each year since it declared its first-ever dividend in 1974.The company last announced a dividend hike in February, when it raised its annual payment to shareholders by about 18% to $1.88 a share. Wal-Mart has a yield of about 2.3%, slightly lower than that of lagging rival Target (TGT)'s 2.7%.Wal-Mart has retreated this week after rising for eight straight weeks. The stock is near a 79.10 early buy point in a long consolidation that goes back to mid-May.

2833,TGT,"Are men becoming fashionistas?
"
2834,TGT,"Not exactly. But sales of men's clothing are growing faster than women's. And man, they've really needed pants, overcoats and socks.
"
2835,TGT,"Total men's apparel U.S. retail sales grew 5% to $60.8 billion in 2013 vs. a year earlier, thanks in large part to double-digit gains in sales of outerwear, pants and socks.
"
2836,TGT,"But guys have a long way to go to catch up with spending by the ladies. While the women's apparel market grew by only 4% last year, sales totaled $116.4 billion, or more than double the men's total.
"
2837,TGT,"Sales of men's pants rose 12% to $4.8 billion, and socks grew by 14% to $2.8 billion. The only one of the 13 categories tracked by the market-research group NPD in men's apparel to see dollar sales decline was men's tops, with a 2% decrease.
"
2838,TGT,"""Innovation and men's perception of fashion contributed to an increase in spending in 2013,"" said Marshal Cohen, chief industry analyst for NPD. Another notable reason for the rise included colder than usual weather conditions, which helped the sales of men's outerwear grow 12%.
"
2839,TGT,"Most channels benefitted from total men's apparel sales in 2013. Strong sock and pants sales helped drive an increase at specialty stores, while outerwear sales trended upward at department stores and mass merchants.
"
2840,TGT,"Department stores, off-price retailers, warehouse clubs and mass merchants all saw a 6% rise in dollar sales of men's clothing in 2013. Likely beneficiaries of the uptick in men's clothing sales were department-store operators such as Macy's (M) and Nordstrom (JWN), and discounters such as Target (TGT), Wal-Mart Stores (WMT) and Costco Wholesale (COST).
"
2841,TGT,"Website purchases, which represented 14% of men's apparel sales, saw some of the highest growth for the year, increasing 19% over 2012. Meanwhile, the average price of an in-store purchase grew 3% for men's apparel, while online prices declined 7%.

2842,TGT,"""To remain competitive, brick-and-mortar retailers must step up their game,"" said Cohen. ""They need to disregard antiquated marketing and sales strategies, and adjust their tactics to better accommodate the whims of online shoppers, including the development of more dynamic pricing models, enhancing selections and addressing convenience.""Are men becoming fashionistas?Not exactly. But sales of men's clothing are growing faster than women's. And man, they've really needed pants, overcoats and socks.Total men's apparel U.S. retail sales grew 5% to $60.8 billion in 2013 vs. a year earlier, thanks in large part to double-digit gains in sales of outerwear, pants and socks.But guys have a long way to go to catch up with spending by the ladies. While the women's apparel market grew by only 4% last year, sales totaled $116.4 billion, or more than double the men's total.Sales of men's pants rose 12% to $4.8 billion, and socks grew by 14% to $2.8 billion. The only one of the 13 categories tracked by the market-research group NPD in men's apparel to see dollar sales decline was men's tops, with a 2% decrease.""Innovation and men's perception of fashion contributed to an increase in spending in 2013,"" said Marshal Cohen, chief industry analyst for NPD. Another notable reason for the rise included colder than usual weather conditions, which helped the sales of men's outerwear grow 12%.Most channels benefitted from total men's apparel sales in 2013. Strong sock and pants sales helped drive an increase at specialty stores, while outerwear sales trended upward at department stores and mass merchants.Department stores, off-price retailers, warehouse clubs and mass merchants all saw a 6% rise in dollar sales of men's clothing in 2013. Likely beneficiaries of the uptick in men's clothing sales were department-store operators such as Macy's (M) and Nordstrom (JWN), and discounters such as Target (TGT), Wal-Mart Stores (WMT) and Costco Wholesale (COST).Website purchases, which represented 14% of men's apparel sales, saw some of the highest growth for the year, increasing 19% over 2012.

2843,TGT,"Troy Alstead is no stranger to the old joke about there being a Starbucks on every corner — not after spending 22 years at the coffee retailer, where he now serves as its chief operating officer.
"
2844,TGT,"There's not really a Starbucks on every corner, of course. But the fact that people talk about it all the time speaks volumes about how the company has imprinted its brand into the American consciousness.
"
2845,TGT,"Alstead doesn't mind the joke. In fact, he takes it a step further, saying ""there's even a Starbucks inside every Starbucks.""
"
2846,TGT,"""There's no question physical expansion in both the U.S. and around the world has been an important component of our story over the last five years,"" he told IBD. ""And it will be an even bigger part over the next five years.""
"
2847,TGT,"If so, there may well be a Starbucks on every corner some day.
"
2848,TGT,"Since its founding as a single gourmet coffee shop in Seattle in 1971, Starbucks (SBUX) has grown into one of the biggest and most recognizable brands in the world and one of the top stocks of the past 30 years.
"
2849,TGT,"The company, which went public in 1992, has more than 20,000 stores in 60-plus countries worldwide. It boasts about $15 billion in annual sales. Around 70 million customers walk into its stores every week.
"
2850,TGT,"Among restaurant stocks, Starbucks ranks behind only McDonald's (MCD) in market cap. For that, it can thank a share price that has rocketed 12,771% from the low point after its 1992 IPO.
"
2851,TGT,"The No. 1 Barista
"
2852,TGT,"Starbucks' success through the years is the result of a vision, led by founder and CEO Howard Schultz, that combines innovation, execution and an aggressive growth plan that seems limitless in its scale.
"
2853,TGT,"The company has flexed its financial muscles by gobbling up competitors and carving out great swaths of market share both here and overseas.
"
2854,TGT,"It has embraced technology by offering high-speed Internet service in its stores and mobile payment apps. It incorporated music retailing into its coffee shops with its Hear Music brand. It developed ancillary products that include everything from coffee makers and bean grinders to flavored syrups.
"
2855,TGT,"Starbucks has also been a leader in providing access to as many customers as possible. It has placed coffee bars in big-box retailers such as Target (TGT) and bookstores such as Barnes & Noble (BKS). It has experimented with different designs and formats, opened drive-through and walk-up locations, put a Starbucks on a passenger train and even opened a ski-up location at the Squaw Valley resort in California.
"
2856,TGT,"""If you look back, Starbucks clearly innovated the specialty coffee retail market,"" said Morningstar analyst R.J. Hottovy. ""The whole idea of a coffee bar had never really existed before Starbucks, and nobody's done it as successfully or in the volumes they do.""
"
2857,TGT,"For all the company's innovation, however, it was something basic that helped Starbucks reinvigorate its brand — and stock price — over the last half decade: a renewed focus on customer service and core beverages.
"
2858,TGT,"After the 1992 IPO, Starbucks stock made its first big run into 2006 with a 6,142% advance. Then with decelerating earnings growth, the stock hit the kind of slump from which most big leaders never recover.
"
2859,TGT,"By November 2008, shares had plunged to a nearly seven-year low of 7.06 — down 82% from 40.01 two years earlier.
"
2860,TGT,"The company remained profitable. But growth was slowing, and many on Wall Street considered it a mature company that had run out of fresh ideas.
"
2861,TGT,"Schultz, who had stepped down as CEO in 2000, retook the helm in January 2008. Eighteen months later, profits began to grow again as they would for 17 out of the next 18 quarters.
"
2862,TGT,"""At the time, they were very good at opening new units and creating a brand, but they had problems operating them and innovating them,"" said Andy Barish, analyst at Jefferies. ""So they made a back-to-basics strategic shift.""
"
2863,TGT,"That shift worked. Starbucks stock recovered dramatically, by 1,069% from its 2008 bottom.
"
2864,TGT,"Partners In Profit
"
2865,TGT,"Rather than try to reinvent itself, Starbucks committed itself to improving the experience for its employees — which it calls ""partners"" — and the people they serve.
"
2866,TGT,"""When our market cap was way low we closed some stores to retrain our partners on excellent beverage execution,"" Alstead said. ""We wanted to make sure that when customers came in the next day or the next five years there was that deep focus.""
"
2867,TGT,"While that was going on, Starbucks also looked to innovate its product line. At the time, the company's innovation had become ""a little stagnant,"" Alstead says.
"
2868,TGT,"""Innovation was not as creative, not as dynamic, and certainly not as profit-driving as it needed to be,"" he said. ""So we turned that whole process upside down.""
"
2869,TGT,"The company went back to its earlier focus, honed in the 1980s and 1990s, of trotting out new products. This led to the introduction of items such as instant coffee and the Refreshers line of coffee-based juice beverages.
"
2870,TGT,"Starbucks also relaunched its Frappuccino blended beverage line with new ingredients and preparation methods.
"
2871,TGT,"The emphasis on new products — and new ways of selling them — has been a hallmark of Starbucks throughout its history and a big reason for its success, analysts say.
"
2872,TGT,"""They've taken their retail business and leveraged it into consumer packaged goods,"" Hottovy said. ""You're seeing more Starbucks products in grocery stores and other retail outlets. They have been innovative not just in coffee, but in new products to broaden the accessibility of the brand.""
"
2873,TGT,"Digital Growth
"
2874,TGT,"Meanwhile, the company has also expanded a digital platform that includes in-store WiFi, social media, its Starbucks Card and My Starbucks Rewards loyalty program, and its Mobile app.
"
2875,TGT,"Mobile payments now represent 14% of all in-store transactions in the U.S. More than one-third of all transactions are prepaid via the company's Mobile App or Starbucks Card.
"
2876,TGT,"""These are quicker transactions that help customer service and speed,"" analyst Barish said.
"
2877,TGT,"Starbucks is expected to use its digital platform to drive even more sales through one-on-one marketing that lets the firm send customers promotions and other incentives to their mobile phones.
"
2878,TGT,"""If you haven't been in in a while maybe they'll send you something to entice you to come in for a Refresher beverage, or send out introductory offers for new products,"" Barish said.

2956,TGT,"If a snapshot of some of the nation's biggest retailers' seasonal hiring plans is any indication, stores are adding about the same amount of jobs for the holiday period as they did last year, though Wal-Mart Stores (WMT) is planning a big increase.Value department store operator Kohl's (KSS) is hiring slightly more seasonal workers than last year, according to a report by Sterne Agee analyst Charles Grom.

Most of these incremental jobs for Kohl's, he adds, are at both the distribution centers and in credit operations.Wal-Mart, the world's biggest retailer, plans to increase its seasonal hiring by 10% this year to 55,000 from 50,000 in 2012. Giant discounter Target (TGT) is a bit more cautious, cutting its hiring goal by just over 20% from 88,000 last year to 70,000, Grom notes.Long-struggling midtier department store operator J.C. Penney Co. (JCP) plans to hire 35,000 seasonal employees this year, after not adding any new hires in 2012.Separately, outplacement consultancy Challenger, Gray & Christmas forecasts that while this year's seasonal job gains at retailers will not see a big decline from last year's ""robust"" numbers, they are likely to at best match the level of hiring that occurred in October, November and December 2012.In 2012, retail employment increased by a non-seasonally adjusted 751,800 between Oct. 1 and Dec. 31, the consulting firm said in a report.

The customers will also get the product description from these catalogs.The catalogs will be handed out to the customers at Whole Foods stores and mailed to the U.S. households as well.Increasing Focus on RetailAmazon’s aggressive retail strategy, expanding seller base and distribution strength will continue to benefit it in gaining traction in the retail space. The latest plan to publish toy catalog is sure to give the company a push in this regard.According to the latest report from Mordor Intelligence, the global retail industry is anticipated to grow at a CAGR of 5.3% between 2018 and 2023 and to reach $31.9 trillion by 2023. The positive growth projection bodes well for Amazon.The recent move of the company emulates Toys “R” Us which used to have a similar kind of catalog called “Big Book”.The over-utilization of technology, particularly smartphones, has been negatively impacting the health and wellness of kids. This has become a serious concern for parents as well as technology companies like Apple.Hence, Amazon’s move to publish a printed catalog is a welcome change for parents, in this regard.The adoption of traditional retail strategies like this is expected to drive growth of its e-commerce business as well. Amazon had tried out this strategy during the holiday season of 2007. Since then the company has been gaining traction in the market.Apart from toy retailing, the acquisition of Whole Foods has strengthened Amazon’s position in the grocery retail market. Further with the recent announcement of the acquisition of PillPack, the company has forayed into the pharmacy retail sector.We note that the company’s increasing focus toward strengthening retail e-commerce business with a plethora endeavors like the ones mentioned above will continue to help it to reap benefits from this growing sector.Amazon.com, Inc.

QuoteIntensifying CompetitionAmazon’s strong efforts to deliver the retail services via its e-commerce platform will continue to fortifying its competitive position in the retail market.    With the latest move, the company is likely to gain competitive edge against the likes of Walmart (WMT  -  Free Report), Target (TGT  -  Free Report) and other brick-and-mortar shops which are involved in the toy business.In fact, both Walmart and Target have already implemented steps like the one Amazon is planning to take. These companies provide toy catalogs to customers in order to sustain market share. Reportedly, Target is increasing the number of toy shelves for this holiday season.Now coming to market share, Amazon holds a dominant position in the online U.S toy sales per the latest report from Internet Retailer. Per the report, Amazon accounted for the highest share in the sale of four major toy brands namely — Lego, Mattel, Hasbro and Nintendo in 2017.Per the report, Toys “R” Us and Walmart were left trailing Amazon as the company’s shares in the above mentioned brands were 88.9%, 83.3%, 85.2% and 92.4%, respectively.Walmart accounted for 5.9%, 5.8%, 2.1% and 6.1% and Toys “R” Us accounted for 5.1%, 10.9%, 12.7% and 1.5%, respectively.Consequently, it can be concluded that the latest move of Amazon along with the recent bankruptcy of Toys “R” Us will help it in maintaining its dominant position in the U.S. toy market.Zacks Rank & Stock to ConsiderCurrently, Amazon carries a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).A better-ranked stock that can be considered in the retail-wholesale sector is PetMed Express (PETS  -  Free Report) carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

2985,TGT,"“Shop anything, anytime and anywhere” is the new mantra that U.S. grocery players are fervently following to provide consumers a seamless experience. From speedy deliveries to payment systems and from selling grocery to offering meal-kits, supermarket chains have been in a constant race against each other for quite some time now. Industry experts believe that the competition in the U.S. grocery market is going to intensify further in the digital space and players will have to constantly revisit their strategy in order to counter the same.Clearly, either you “shape up or ship out”. The Kroger Co. (KR  -  Free Report) has taken the stock of the situation and has been steadily creating a niche in the burgeoning online grocery space. The latest deal with Nuro — the maker of driverless road vehicle — to deliver groceries at customers’ door steps using autonomous vehicles is just another game plan to take on rivals.Grocery Delivery GameThe grocery industry has been grappling with stiff competition, higher input costs, aggressive promotional environment and thin margins. The industry witnessed a major shake-up when the news of Whole Foods takeover by Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) surfaced. This amalgamation of online marketplace with physical stores caused a tectonic shift in the grocery landscape. Amazon can now leverage Whole Foods’ fresh foods procurements expertise with its own data mining techniques.Amazon has been trying to exploit nook and cranny of the online grocery delivery space, quite evident from its free two-hour delivery of Whole Foods products to Prime customers. It is going an extra mile by helping small businesses or entrepreneurs in establishing a delivery business under its Amazon Delivery Service Partner program and utilizing the same as a delivery tool.Experts believe that Amazon is leaving no stone unturned in its effort to counteract any threat stemming from Walmart, which holds a dominant position in the U.S. food market and has been gradually building up its e-commerce muscle.Walmart (WMT  -  Free Report) has been proactive in expanding in the fast-growing online grocery space. The company extended alliance with last mile logistics entity, Deliv, to support same-day delivery for groceries. It also acquired delivery start-up company, Parcel Inc. to extend same-day deliveries. The company also partnered with ride hailing services Uber and Lyft for speedy online grocery deliveries. The company also teamed up with Postmates for grocery delivery.Another player, Target (TGT  -  Free Report) is deploying resources to enhance omni-channel capacities and expanding same-day delivery options. To this end, the company has undertaken rationalization of supply chain with same-day delivery of in-store purchases for a flat fee along with technology and process improvements. Further, the company acquired Shipt to expand same-day delivery service. Apart from this, the company’s Target Restock program and Drive Up service deserve mention, when talking about its efforts to join the online delivery bandwagon.How Kroger Plans to Take on Amazon & Walmart?It’s quite apparent that competition among grocery retailers is far from subsiding, and Kroger understands that. The company’s partnership with Nuro will definitely prove to be game changer in the grocery delivery space. Customers via Kroger's ClickList ordering system and Nuro's app can place same-day delivery orders. Apart from this, the company’s deal with the Ocado, an online grocery delivery company, along with the acquisition of Home Chef, a meal kit provider, is definitely a good move to stay abreast in the race.Kroger’s partnership with Ocado is in the right direction to overcome competition. Both the companies are likely to develop three automated warehouse facilities this year and plans to take the count to 20 in the first three years. The alliance under discussion is part of the company’s “Restock Kroger” program which is gaining traction. Further, Kroger is looking to expand its “Scan, Bag, Pay & Go and Self-CheckOut” program to nearly 400 locations in 2018.Wrapping UpCertainly, Kroger is leaving no stone unturned to attract consumers and attain incremental revenues. The company remains on track to boost market share by introducing new items, digital coupons, and order online, pick up in store initiative. We believe that these strategies are likely to bolster the company’s performance and drive the stock further.In the past three months, shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) have increased 19% comfortably outperforming the industry that declined roughly 1%.

2986,TGT,"Shares of pharmacy giants CVS (CVS  -  Free Report), Rite Aid (RAD  -  Free Report), and Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA  -  Free Report) all plummeted on Thursday morning after Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) announced its purchase of online pharmacy delivery startup PillPack. The move clearly has some investors worried that Amazon’s push into the pharmaceutical industry will hurt the current powers. So let’s take a look at more of the details to find out what’s really going on.PillPackAmazon is reportedly set to acquire PillPack for $1 billion in cash, in a deal that is expected to close in the second half of 2018. PillPack launched in 2013 and ships pre-sorted medications by the dose to patients on a monthly basis. The company, which is a full-service pharmacy, works mostly with customers who take multiple daily prescriptions and coordinates refills and renewals with doctors and customers.The Manchester, New Hampshire-based pharmacy delivery startup said that it ships everywhere in the U.S. except Hawaii. PillPack has raised $118 million in venture capital funding, and its co-founder and CEO TJ Parker said last fall that the company had tens of thousands of customers and was set for more than $100 million in annual revenue.The deal should be hugely beneficial for Jeff Bezos’ behemoth, which now enters the quickly growing, $400 billion U.S. pharmaceutical industry. The news saw shares of CVS sink 9.36% through early morning trading, with Rite Aid down 11.17% and Walgreens down 8.59%.Meanwhile, shares of Amazon climbed over 1.1%. But pharmaceutical industry investors shouldn’t be too worried that Amazon will simply waltz in and take over.It’s Not Over, YetAmazon’s PillPack acquisition comes roughly a year after the company shook up the grocery industry with its Whole Foods purchase. Investors worried at the time that grocery heavyweights such as Kroger (KR  -  Free Report), Walmart (WMT  -  Free Report), Costco (COST  -  Free Report), and Target (TGT  -  Free Report) would all take a big hit, and possibly crumble underneath Amazon’s quick delivery e-commerce model. This turned out not to be the case—at least not yet (also read: Should You Buy Grocery Stocks After Kroger's Strong Quarter?).All four of these grocery industry powers simply revamped their business models and dove right into everything from same-day delivery and easy to use e-commerce portals, through partnerships with startups as well as in-house initiatives. Today, the grocery industry and customers are likely better off than they were before Amazon bought Whole Foods for roughly $14 billion because it forced them all to offer more.Sometimes lost in the narrative that Amazon will one day dominate the world, is that the e-commerce giant’s multibillion-dollar competitors, many of which have been around much longer than Amazon, can adapt—and have every reason to fight back. In fact, Walgreens executives were in the middle of a call with analysts when Amazon announced its PillPack deal. CEO Stefano Pessina said his company is “not particularly worried” about the e-commerce giant’s newest acquisition.Pessina went on to say that his drugstore chain is “not complacent.” He also said that “the pharmacy world is much more complex than just delivering certain pills or packages. I strongly believe that the role of the physical pharmacy will continue to be very, very important in the future.”Investors should note that Walgreens is ramping up its delivery options and adding to its in-store health-related services. Meanwhile, CVS announced just last week that it will offer its customers prescription delivery options through a new deal with the U.S. Postal Service.5 Medical Stocks to Buy NowZacks names 5 companies poised to ride a medical breakthrough that is targeting cures for leukemia, AIDS, muscular dystrophy, hemophilia, and other conditions.New products in this field are already generating substantial revenue and even more wondrous treatments are in the pipeline.

2987,TGT,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put Target Corporation (TGT  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Target Corporation has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 15.8, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 compares in at about 20.0. If we focus on the stock’s long-term PE trend, the current level puts Target Corporation’s current PE ratio slightly above its midpoint (which is 14.9) over the past five years.Further, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with the industry’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 27.9. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that Target Corporation has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 14.6, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for Target Corporation’s stock in the near term too.P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, Target Corporation has a P/S ratio of about 0.6. This is significantly lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.3 right now. Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is somewhat below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.If anything, this suggests some level of undervalued trading—at least compared to historical norms.   Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Target Corporation currently has a Value Style Score of B, putting it into the top 40% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes TGT a solid choice for value investors, and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too.For example, the P/CF ratio (another great indicator of value) comes in at 8.3, which is somewhat better than the industry average of 17.5. Clearly, TGT is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles.What About the Stock Overall?Though Target Corporation might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of B and a Momentum score of F. This gives TGT a VGM score—or its overarching fundamental grade—of B. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best. The current quarter has seen six estimates go higher in the past sixty days, compared to none lower, while the full year estimate has seen two upward and four downward revisions in the same time period.This has had a noticeable impact on the consensus estimate, as the current quarter consensus estimate has risen about 3.7% in the past two months, while the full year estimate has dipped 0.2%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:Target Corporation Price and Consensus  Target Corporation Price and Consensus | Target Corporation QuoteThis somewhat mixed trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and why we are looking for in-line performance from the company in the near term.Bottom LineTarget Corporation is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. However, with a sluggish industry rank (bottom 24% out of more than 250 industries) and a Zacks Rank #3, it is hard to get too excited about this company overall. In fact, over the past two years, the sector has clearly underperformed the broader market, as you can see below:So, value investors might want to wait for estimates, analyst sentiment and broader factors to turn favorable in this name first, but once that happens, this stock could be a compelling pick.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion.

2988,TGT,"Target (TGT  -  Free Report) released its latest earnings report this morning, and with rival Walmart (WMT  -  Free Report) reporting last week, investors now have a complete update on the big box retail behemoths. Both companies had mixed results, so now it is time to dig into each report to find the key takeaways and prepare for what is next.WalmartWalmart posted a double beat for Q1, with earnings of $1.14 per share and revenue of $122.7 billion. Despite outperforming expectations, the stock is down 4.8% since the report release. This is most likely a result of lowered guidance by the company due to the company investing in Flipkart, an Indian electronic commerce company.The company reported especially strong international performance. Net sales for Walmex (consolidated results of Mexico and Central America) increased 9.1%, Canada gained 2.6%, China moved 4% higher, and the United Kingdom added 3.4%.Walmart has been expanding its ecommerce business as well, competing with companies such as Kroger (KR  -  Free Report) and Whole Foods, but slightly cutting into profitability. Net income dropped $0.28 per share due to ecommerce and website investments, discounts, and transportation costs. But the investment seems to be paying off, with a 33% increase in e-commerce business growth.It is also worth noting that some of the shortcomings in Walmart’s report were caused by unseasonable weather.“We did have some headwinds we faced at the end of the quarter in April with some seasonally cool weather that impacted some of our general merchandise weather sensitive categories as well as some traffic in those categories,” said Kary Brunner, director of investor relations for Walmart, in the company’s earnings call.TargetTarget posted an earnings miss and revenue beat for Q1, reporting adjusted earnings of $1.32 per share and revenue of $16.8 billion. The earnings miss has driven share prices down 5.5% during regular trading hours today.The company reported a strong ecommerce transition as well, with online sales increasing 28% year over year. Although this is the case, it too is losing profitability at the cost of advancing its online business, with gross margins decreasing slightly year over year. Along with this, if the company hopes to produce a truly strong ecommerce platform, it will have to produce more than the current 5% of overall revenue that its digital sales are accounting for.On the upside, the company saw a strong 3% increase in comparable store sales. Running behind this, the company has stayed true to its previous full-year earnings outlook.Target’s purchase of Shipt, a same-day delivery company, shows its own delve into delivery, competing with the likes of Walmart, Whole Foods, and Kroger. Although profitability has been challenged, the company is confident that the uptick in consumer traffic in stores is a result of their efforts across the board.“We’re growing market share in a strong consumer environment across all major categories” said CEO Brian Cornell.Bottom LineWalmart and Target are two big box retailers pushing in the same direction. With both companies aggressively investing in their own brands, increase market share, and expand ecommerce, earnings and guidance likely took a dent. Walmart’s investments caused a substantial hit to its full year outlook, while Target’s investment decisions negatively impacted its Q1 EPS results.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

2989,TGT,"Target Corporation (TGT  -  Free Report) posted second straight quarter of negative earnings surprise, when it reported first-quarter fiscal 2018 results. The company posted adjusted earnings of $1.32 per share that not only missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.38 but also came below the mid-point of the earlier provided guidance range of $1.25-$1.45 per share. Clearly, this was not well perceived by investors.We note shares of this Minneapolis-based company are down roughly 6% during pre-market trading hours. Even investors ignored the fact that the bottom line improved 9.4% from the prior-year period. This year-over-year growth can be attributable to increased sales and fall in interest expense as well as share repurchase activity that to an extent offset rise in cost of sales and higher SG&A expenses.The company generated total revenue of $16,781 million that came ahead the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $16,529 million for the fifth straight quarter and increased 3.4% from the year-ago quarter. Sales rose 3.5% to $16,556 million, while other revenue declined 1.2% to $225 million.Target is trying all means to rapidly adapt to the changes in the retail ecosystem. The company is deploying resources to enhance omni-channel capacities, come up with new brands, remodel or refurbish stores, and expand same-day delivery options to expedite the shopping process.During the quarter under review, Target concluded 56 remodels, opened 7 new outlets and launched three new brands. The company also introduced Drive-Up service in more than 250 stores and expanded Target Restock nationwide. Courtesy to Shipt, the company also rolled out same-day delivery from more than 700 outlets.Notably, comparable sales for the quarter increased 3% compared with 1.3% decline witnessed in the year-ago period. The number of transactions jumped 3.7%, while the average transaction amount decreased 0.6%. Comparable digital channel sales surged 28% and added 1.1 percentage points to comparable sales.These helped this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock to gain 35% in the past six months compared with the industry’s growth of 17%.Gross margin contracted 20 basis points to 29.8%, while operating margin shriveled 90 basis points to 6.2%. Industry experts believe that incremental investments and rise in costs due to new fulfillment options might have hurt margins.Target’s debit card penetration contracted 10 basis points to 13.5%, while credit card penetration fell 50 basis points to 10.6%. Total REDcard penetration declined to 24.1% from 24.7% in the year-ago quarter.Target Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Target Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Target Corporation QuoteOther Financial DetailsDuring the quarter, Target repurchased shares worth $494 million and paid dividends of $334 million. The company still had about $2.8 billion remaining under its $5 billion share buyback program. The company ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $1,060 million, long-term debt and other borrowings of $11,107 million and shareholders’ investment of $11,158 million.A Glance at the OutlookManagement now anticipates second quarter comparable sales to be up in the low to mid single-digit range, while for fiscal 2018 the metric is expected to increase in the low-single digit. Target now envisions second quarter earnings in the band of $1.30-$1.50 and fiscal 2018 earnings between $5.15 and $5.45 per share. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the second quarter and fiscal 2018 stands at $1.34 and $5.29, respectively.Interested in Retail Space?

2990,TGT,"Target Corporation (TGT  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release first-quarter fiscal 2018 results on May 23. Well the obvious question that comes to mind is whether this operator of general merchandise stores will be able to deliver positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported.In the trailing four quarters, the company outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 10.7%. However, it reported a negative earnings surprise of 1.4% in the preceding quarter. Meanwhile, estimates have been stable ahead of the first-quarter earnings release.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the first quarter is pegged at $1.38 up from $1.21 reported in the year-ago period. Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $16,432 million, up from $16,017 million reported in the prior-year quarter.Here Are the Deciding FactorsOmni-channel & Restock Program to Lift SalesTarget has chalked out strategies to adapt to the fast-changing retail landscape. The company is deploying resources to enhance omni-channel capacities, coming up with new brands, remodeling or refurbishing stores, and expanding same-day delivery options. Target has undertaken rationalization of supply chain with same-day delivery of in-store purchases for a flat fee along with technology and process improvements.Retailers are ensuring a speedy delivery to customers. They are either acquiring or partnering with delivery service companies for same-day delivery to stay ahead in the race. In this respect, Target acquired Shipt to expand same-day delivery of more than 55,000 groceries, essentials, home, electronics, toys and other products.The company has rolled out Target Restock program that allows customers to restock their shipping box with essential items online and get them delivered at door steps by the next business day for a nominal charge. Drive Up, an app-based service, is another initiative to expedite the shopping process. The service allows customers to place orders using the Target app and have them delivered to their cars.All these strategic endeavors are likely to favorably impact the quarterly results. Management had earlier guided first-quarter fiscal 2018 comparable sales to be up low-single digit and projected earnings in the band of $1.25-$1.45.Will Margins Remain Under Pressure?Margin, an important financial metric that gives an indication about the company’s health, has been declining. We note that the operating margin shriveled 80 basis points (bps), 90 bps, 120 bps and 140 bps to 7.4%, 6.8%, 5.2% and 5.1% during the first, second, third and fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, respectively. Management expects operating margin to contract roughly 60-80 bps in the first quarter. Target informed that increase in depreciation and amortization on account of its remodel program, rise in costs due to new fulfillment options, higher wages and incremental investments are the primary headwinds.Target Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Target Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Target Corporation QuoteWhat Does the Zacks Model Suggest?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Target is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter.

2991,TGT,"“Shop anything, anytime and anywhere” is the new mantra U.S. supermarket chains are passionately following to provide consumers a seamless experience. The latest instance of the same is The Kroger Co.’s (KR  -  Free Report) deal with British online grocery delivery company Ocado that reinforces its position in the online ordering, automated fulfillment and home delivery space.Industry experts believe that the competition in the U.S. grocery market is going to intensify further in the digital space and supermarket chains will have to constantly revisit their strategy in order to endure the same. This means either you “shape up or ship out”. Kroger has taken the stock of the situation, as it agreed to increase its stake in Ocado by 5% that will help it to create a niche in the burgeoning online grocery space.SynopsisThe grocery industry has been grappling with stiff competition, volatility in food prices, aggressive promotional environment and thin margins. The industry witnessed a major shake-up when the news of Whole Foods takeover by Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) surfaced. This amalgamation of online marketplace with physical stores caused a tectonic shift in the grocery landscape.Amazon can now leverage Whole Foods’ fresh foods procurements expertise with its own data mining techniques. Experts see this acquisition as a major step by Amazon to thwart any threat coming from Walmart (WMT  -  Free Report), which holds a dominant position in the $700-$800 billion U.S. food market and has been gradually building up its e-commerce strength.Walmart has been proactive in expanding in the fast-growing online grocery space. The company extended alliance with last mile logistics entity, Deliv, to support same-day delivery for groceries. Walmart also acquired delivery start-up company, Parcel Inc. to extend same-day deliveries. The company also partnered with ride hailing services Uber and Lyft for speedy online grocery deliveries. Latest to add in the list of same is Postmates.Target (TGT  -  Free Report) has also made a concerted effort on the front of same-day delivery services by recently acquiring internet-based grocery delivery service, Shipt. Previously, the company had acquired Grand Junction in order to improve supply chain and expand delivery capabilities.Kroger Upping the AnteKroger’s partnership with Ocado is in the right direction to overcome competition, which has intensified with the foray of Amazon. Both the companies are likely to develop three automated warehouse facilities this year and plans to take the count to 20 in the first three years.The alliance under discussion is a part of the company’s “Restock Kroger” program, which is gaining traction. Kroger commenced “We Are Local” campaign; launched and opened a new restaurant concept, Kitchen 1883; and added two new product lines under “Our Brands”. As a part of the program management offloaded convenience stores to focus on its core operations and expects to generate $400 million in incremental operating margin by 2020.Kroger is looking to expand its “Scan, Bag, Pay & Go and Self-CheckOut” program to nearly 400 locations in 2018. Further, Ralphs — a unit of grocery giant — in partnership with Instacart is offering home delivery at select locations in Southern California. Kroger remains optimistic about the buyouts of Vitacost.com, an online retailer of vitamins and health-oriented products and Harris Teeter, a grocery chain. The company also expanded ClickList to more than 1,000 locations.Kroger’s Customer 1st strategy that enriches the consumers shopping experience and convinces them of returning to the store is also benefiting the company. We believe that its operational strategies present enormous opportunities to augment identical supermarket sales, alleviate gross margin pressure, improve operating margin and enhance return on invested capital.Certainly, Kroger is leaving no stone unturned to attract consumers and attain incremental revenues. Kroger remains well on track to boost market share by expanding store base, introducing new items, digital coupons, and order online, pick up in store initiative.

2992,TGT,"Shares of Kroger (KR  -  Free Report) surged over 10% on Thursday to inch near their 52-week high after the company posted better-than-expected quarterly results. Investors were also likely pleased to see that the grocery chain’s e-commerce initiatives started to pay off. The question is should investors think about buying grocery stocks as Amazon-based (AMZN  -  Free Report) fears seem to have been overblown.Kroger Kroger posted adjusted quarterly earnings of $0.73 per share, which came in well above our Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.63 per share and marked a nearly 26% climb from the year-ago quarter. The company’s Q1 revenues climbed over 3% to $37.53 billion, topping our estimate.The company also raised its earnings guidance, but what really stood out were Kroger’s online sales. Kroger saw its digital sales skyrocket 66%. Meanwhile, Kroger announced that it upped its investment in online British supermarket delivery company Ocado to help improve its online ordering, automated fulfillment, and home delivery capabilities. Furthermore, Kroger announced a merger with private meal kit powerhouse Home Chef in a move to compete against the likes of Blue Apron (APRN  -  Free Report), HelloFresh, and Plated—which supermarket chain Albertsons bought last year. Kroger also expanded its partnership with grocery delivery startup powerhouse Instacart, which works with companies from CVS (CVS  -  Free Report) to Aldi.Kroger stock is currently a Zacks Ranks #3 (Hold), and might not experience Thursday’s gains for a while now. With that said, the rest of the grocery industry has also made some significant changes in order to compete in the age of online shopping and delivery.Industry OverviewNielsen (NLSN  -  Free Report) and the Food Marketing Institute released their second-ever ""Digitally Engaged Food Shopper"" study earlier this year, which stated that within the next five to seven years 70% of consumers will do at least some grocery shopping online. FMI and Nielsen also estimated that people will spend $100 billion a year in this budding industry. Walmart (WMT  -  Free Report)Walmart in March announced its plan to expand its online grocery delivery option to more than 100 metro areas by the end of the year, up from just six. The big-box giant also offers an order online and curbside pickup up service called “Grocery Hero” at 1,200 stores, with the company expected to add the service at 1,000 more locations by end of the year.Investors should note that Walmart’s first-quarter e-commerce sales surged by 33% in the U.S. Looking ahead, the company is projected to see it quarterly earnings climb by 12%, based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimate.

The company also expanded its same-day delivery service to “most metropolitan” areas through an updated partnership with Instacart.The wholesale retailer’s quarterly revenues popped by 12% to $32.36 billion, with e-commerce comp sales up 36.8%. Looking ahead, Costco’s full-year earnings are projected to surge nearly 18%, while its full-year revenues are expected to reach $139.98 billion, representing an 8.5% jump.

2993,TGT,"Shares of internet retailers Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) and Wayfair (W  -  Free Report), and Overstock (OSTK  -  Free Report) sold off early Thursday on news that the U.S. Supreme court had decided that States could impose sales tax on interstate sales, specifically including internet transactions. Brick and Mortar retailers Wal Mart (WMT  -  Free Report) and Target (TGT  -  Free Report) rallied on the news.In the decision South Dakota vs Wayfair et al, the court voted 5 to 4 overturned a 1992 ruling that exempted sellers from collecting sales tax on transactions with customers in states where the seller did not have a physical presence. The dissenting four justices issued an opinion stating that they fundamentally agreed with the collection of interstate sales taxes, but thought that the issue should be decided by congressional legislation rather than judicial decision.The 1992 decision in Quill Corp vs. North Dakota stated that requiring vendors to navigate state sales taxes in the 45 states that impose them - as well as thousands of municipal taxes within those states-  would be an undue administrative burden on sellers and would be restrictive to commerce. Internet sales in 1992 were a tiny sliver of retail commerce, and the majority opinion in Quill primarily concerned mail-order business. The court noted that the justices in 1992 could not have envisioned a world in which 89% of Americans have internet access and e-commerce sales top $450 billion annually.In Wayfair, the court upheld a South Dakota regulation that required that sellers who deliver a total of $100,000 in goods and services or who makes more than 200 transactions annually in the state to collect a flat statewide sales tax. The court concluded that the South Dakota law did not impose an undue burden on merchants or restrict commerce because the tax was administered only at the state level, it clearly defined tax rates and which goods and services they applied to and that the state provides free software to sellers that streamlines calculating and administering the tax.For the moment, only South Dakota is affected by the decision, but presumably other states will quickly adopt tax regulations of their own that are similar to the South Dakota laws.Who are the Winners and Losers?The obvious winner as a result of Thursday’s decision is the states themselves who will now be free to collect sales tax on transactions that they previously could not. Estimates range from $8 billion to $34 billion annually in additional state revenue. Consumers, not the retailers themselves, will ultimately bear the burden of the additional sales taxes.Smaller retailers also cheered the news with industry trade organization the National Retail Federation stating that they believe the ruling will create a “level playing field” for traditional sellers to compete with online e-tailing.As far as large public retail companies though, the effect is likely to be small.First, for revenues or earnings to be significantly damaged, you’d have to suppose that customers change their buying behavior and change venues based of the imposition of sales tax - or lack thereof. While some consumers might “game” sales tax laws on large purchases like cars and jewelry by purchasing in different jurisdictions, there’s little evidence that consumers change their internet shopping behavior in an environment where sales taxes are inconsistently collected across different websites and states.Is the customer who’s buying a phone case or a pair of shoes online really going to sign off, jump in the car and drive to a retail store - where they already collect sales tax - just because the website now collects sales tax as well?Amazon already collects state sales tax on all of its sales direct to consumers, and collects tax on a small portion of third-party sales conducted on its website in the states that currently require it to do so. The administrative burden of collecting tax on all third-party sales is negligible, and because Amazon charges third parties a transaction fee for administering state taxes, the company could actually benefit slightly from the ruling. It's also possible that additional third-party sellers will choose to use Amazon in order to avoid having to collect and distribute sales tax revenue on their own.In broad economic terms, additional taxes generally slow economic activity somewhat and there’s an argument that this ruling – which really only allows the enforcement of taxes that already existed but were not being uniformly collected – might slow overall retail commerce by a small amount.As far as the e-tailors who have seen shares selloff on Thursday though, as well as the brick-and-mortar enterprises that are rallying, the actual effect on revenues and earnings going forward is likely to be a lot smaller than today’s market reaction would imply.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?

In the previous quarter, the company reported better-than-expected earnings. Also, it surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters.An Insight in to Current EstimatesIn order to get a clear picture of what analysts expect from the company’s earnings release, let’s take a look at the earnings estimate revisions.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter bottom line, which has been stable over the past 60 days, is pegged at a loss of 22 cents, comparing unfavorably with the year-ago earnings of 6 cents. Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $2.60 billion, reflecting a decline of 3.8% year over year.J. C. Penney Company, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise J. C. Penney Company, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | J. C. Penney Company, Inc. Quote Despite several measures, we expect the retail landscape to remain tough for J. C. Penney. Also, the company’s store closures are likely to weigh on its performance. Due to change in consumer spending patterns, retailers are making investments on digitalization that might keep margins under pressure in the short term.We note that for first-quarter fiscal 2018, the company had earlier highlighted that the cost of goods sold is likely to increase by 40 to 60 basis points (bps) from the year-ago quarter. Accordingly, the gross margin is likely to decline in the first quarter from the year-ago-quarter.Are Strategies Potent Enough to Fight Headwinds?J. C. Penney has taken up several strategic initiatives to drive traffic. The company, in order to enhance customer shopping experience, has been focusing on remodeling, renovating and refurbishing its stores with special focus on improving high-margin center core department that houses handbags, fashion accessories, sunglasses and fashion jewelry. The company stated that it is planning to rebrand and modernize 100 salons to Salon by InStyle.J. C. Penney continues to work on improving its omni-channel reach.

C. Penney store and faster home delivery. The company has invested substantially to boost supply chain efficiency.Meanwhile, the company’s Sephora stores, which have done exceptionally well in the past and are regarded as one of the best performing categories, are likely to maintain the uptrend in the first quarter. In fact, these shops are part of J. C. Penney’s strategy to gain a competitive edge over other beauty product retailers and drugstores that have significantly enhanced their cosmetics businesses in the recent years.Given the aforementioned strategic initiatives, management expects comp sales in the first quarter to be at the high end of the annual guidance which is in the range of flat to up 2%.What the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model does not show that J. C. Penney is likely to beat bottom-line estimates this quarter.

2998,TGT,"Walmart Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report) is set to release first-quarter fiscal 2019 results on May 17. We note that the giant omni-channel retailer’s earnings have surpassed estimates in three out of the four trailing quarters, with an average surprise of 1.5%. The company boasts of a well-spread global business network and has been steadily making headway in the online retail space, supported by robust delivery services.Courtesy of consistent strategic moves, Walmart has been gaining traction in an Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report)-dominated retail space. Notably, these endeavors have been fueling its top- and bottom-line performances. The above factors have led the company to hit headlines quite often. In fact, there is much excitement surrounding the Flipkart deal, which has been set into action.Considering these aspects, let’s look into some of the factors that might impact the upcoming quarterly release.International Business: A Growth PlatformWalmart’s international business is a well-suited archetype for modern day globalization. With presence in approximately 28 nations and a strong base in regions such as China, Mexico, Canada and UK, Walmart’s international segment forms its second-largest unit, in terms of revenues. Evidently, international sales constituted about 24% of revenues in fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 wherein currency-neutral sales improved 2.8%.  Walmart Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Walmart Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Walmart Inc. QuoteNotably, the segment performed well throughout fiscal 2018, with 10 out of 11 markets delivering positive comps — including Walmex — that led to the growth. Results in China were impressive, courtesy of efforts to enhance online grocery delivery through the company’s extended alliance with JD.com. The company is on track to fortify Sam’s Club store base in China.With such well-woven strategies, management expects Walmart’s international business to continue growing.  Moreover, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for this segment’s sales is estimated at $28.8 billion for the first quarter of fiscal 2019, reflecting a growth of almost 6.2% from the prior-year reported quarter’s figure.  Other FactorsWalmart has been gaining from its sturdy comparable store sales (comps) record. Evidently, during fourth-quarter fiscal 2018, earnings and revenues improved year over year. In fact, the company’s comps have been quite sturdy in all segments, driven by constant expansion efforts and splendid e-commerce performance.Speaking of e-commerce, the company has been undertaking several initiatives including buyouts, alliances and improved delivery as well as payment systems to bolster online performance. Recently, the company inked a deal with Rakuten, a leading Japanese e-commerce firm.Apart from this, Walmart’s buyouts of ShoeBuy, Moosejaw, Bonobos, ModCloth as well as Jet.com and the deal with Lord and Taylor underscore its quest to build an impressive digital brand portfolio. The company’s Walmart Pay mobile payment system, Mobile Express Returns program and efforts to enhance checkout process highlight its focus on accelerating online business and making shopping easier as well as faster.Additionally, Walmart’s efforts to enhance delivery services resonates well with its strategy of bolstering online sales, particularly that of groceries. To this end, the company recently inked a deal with Postmates to extend its online grocery delivery service to cover more than 40% of the families in the United States.In earlier developments, the company tested same day deliveries with Deliv and partnered with ride-hailing services like Uber and Lyft for speedy online grocery deliveries. Moreover, Walmart acquired delivery startup Parcel, Inc., which specializes in same-day delivery for perishable and non-perishable products.We expect the company’s robust e-commerce as well as delivery services to perk up comps and drive top-line performance in the upcoming quarterly release. Also, analysts polled by Zacks project sales to rise 2.2% to reach $120.1 billion in the yet-to-be-reported quarter.Additionally, consensus mark for sales pertaining to Walmart U.S., the company’s largest revenue unit, is estimated at $77.8 billion, depicting a rise of 3.2%. Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings for the impending quarter is pegged at 1.13, depicting a growth of 13% from the year-ago quarter’s figure. This estimate has increased by a penny over the last 30 days.Strained Margins Pose WorryWalmart’s gross margins have been sluggish lately, thanks to rising costs of operations, investments as well as pricing strategies. Evidently, these factors caused the company’s gross margin to contract 11 basis points (bps) and 29 bps in the second and third quarters of fiscal 2018, respectively. In fourth-quarter fiscal 2018, consolidated gross margin shrank 61 bps, due to mixed impact from rising e-commerce operations and price investments in various markets. Further, management expects margins to stay under pressure in the forthcoming periods, which raises concerns for the quarter to be reported.Nevertheless, Walmart is expected to counter such hurdles with solid sales, backed by sturdy comps. We are also encouraged regarding the company’s strength in e-commerce supported by its well-set network of delivery services that are likely to uplift performance in the quarter to be reported.All said, let’s take a look into what the Zacks Model unveils regarding the upcoming release.Zacks ModelOur proven model does not show that Walmart is likely to beat bottom-line estimates this quarter.

Growth in other international markets will be a bonus.Amazon and Alibaba are giants, so it will take a lot to wrest share from them.  Carrefour Partnership Carrefour, one of the leading food retailers in France has signed an agreement with Google to digitize its operations. So it is doing three things-Adopting G Suite (including Gmail, calendar, drive, Hangouts, Docs) to be used by its more than 160,000 employees while training a thousand employees within six months in a program that started at the beginning of the year to incorporate a culture of quick decision-making;Opening an innovation lab in Paris this summer in partnership with Google Cloud where Carrefour engineers will work alongside Google Cloud AI experts to collaborate on new consumer experiences;And most importantly, facilitating a new buying experience from Carrefour across Google platforms (Assistant, Google Home and on the Google Shopping website in France). The companies expect that by early 2019, French shoppers will be able to shop from Carrefour with Google Home devices, with Assistant on their smartphones and through Google Shopping on the web for home delivery or pickup in-store.So Carrefour is betting that its product knowledge and expertise in logistics and sales, when coupled with Google’s technology, will enable the company fend off competition from Amazon and other traditional retailers.Amazon’s product breadth and global scale have shaken things for traditional retailers and food retailers are no different. So when Amazon bought Whole Foods Market last year, food retailers across the world sat up and took notice. That’s what drove companies like Walmart (WMT  -  Free Report), Target (TGT  -  Free Report), Kroger (KR  -  Free Report) and others to build relationships with Google. Now food retailers in other markets are doing likewise. One of the leading French grocers, Casino recently started selling products from its upmarket Monoprix chain on Amazon.For Google, it’s just what the company needs to regain product search market share from Amazon (whether it will be successful in the effort is an open question).Waymo Car in CrashIt is at times scary to see headlines about self-driving cars in crashes, but it’s also worth noting that the self-driving car is not always at fault. As it turns out, according to eye witnesses, another car jumped a red light to crash into the Waymo car, which wasn’t in autonomous mode (according to the driver). The Waymo car then crashed into three other vehicles.400 Riders Using WaymoWaymo selected 400 riders of varying categories and age groups (between 9 and 49) to ride its self-driving cars for free within a 100-square-mile area. In exchange, the riders were asked to provide feedback on what could be done better. After testing for a year, the feedback indicated that it needed to make certain changes on store front pickups, narrow-street pickups, waking up sleeping commuters and how to accommodate service animals.     Helping College AdmissionsGoogle says that a Google Search to find a four-year U.S. college will now automatically pull up additional information about admissions, graduation rates, tuition costs, notable alumni, and student life. Google is also offering a feature that includes financing cost and total debt level when the student passes out.Google is getting the information from government sources like the College Scorecard and the Integrated Postsecondary Education System.As college education gets more and more expensive, students and their families increasingly want to evaluate just how good a college is in terms of results. This becomes difficult/confusing for many because of the amount of marketing materials available online that invariably get mixed up with actual information.So the effectiveness of Google’s program depends on its ability to keep college ads away from pages that display information about colleges. Otherwise, we could end up with the same problem packaged differently.RecommendationsGoogle shares carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

3000,TGT,"The grocery war is heating up with tech giants fast trying to invade the space. Reportedly, Microsoft, Inc. (MSFT  -  Free Report) is working on a technology that will eliminate the role of a cashier in a store. And if reports are to be believed, the tech giant is already in talks with retailers, including Walmart, Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report). Understandably, the technology is being developed in a move to compete with Amazon.com, Inc.’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) Amazon Go, the e-commerce giant’s cashier-less store.That said, an increasing number of retailers and grocers are focusing on customer convenience. From speeding up delivery to introducing digital shopping scanners and coming up with cashier-less stores, retailers are aggressively pumping in more money to develop new technologies and adding muscle to their delivery arm to stay ahead in the race.Microsoft Challenges AmazonMicrosoft is reportedly developing a technology wherein a cashier would no longer be required in a brick-and-mortar store. The tech giant is working on a system, which will be able to track what a customer puts in his or her cart in a brick-and mortar store. In fact, Microsoft reportedly has already demonstrated the sample to select retailers.Interestingly, the new technology could revamp the company’s previous failed attempt of check-out free shopping. Moreover, Microsoft plans not to introduce this technology in its stores first. Instead, it is reportedly in talks with Walmart. Understandably, the new technology is in a move to challenge Amazon Go, the e-commerce giant’s cashier-less store. Amazon, over the last few years, has changed the entire retail ballgame that has made brick-and-mortar stores like Walmart, Target Corporation (TGT  -  Free Report), The Kroger Co (KR  -  Free Report), Dollar Tree, Inc. (DLTR  -  Free Report) and Dollar General Corporation (DG  -  Free Report) shift focus to online.However, Microsoft’s aim is to develop a cost-effective retail tech system that will not only eliminate the role of a cashier but also will help in cutting down the cost of thousands of cameras installed on the ceilings of brick-and-mortar store.Others Join the RaceIn January 2018, Amazon opened the first Amazon Go store in Seattle. The 1,800-square-foot automated store has replaced cashiers with a smartphone app and hundreds of small cameras that tracks customers’ purchases. This certainly was a revolutionary move by Amazon and a direct challenge to brick-and-mortar giants.However, brick-and-mortar giants too have been increasingly focusing on online sales and using technology to stay abreast in the race. Walmart, Amazon’s biggest rival, already has its Scan and Go technology that allows customers to shop at its stores without interacting with a cashier.In fact, earlier this year, Walmart announced that it will be expanding its Scan and Go technology to an additional 100 stores. Amazon sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Moreover, immediately after the launch of Amazon Go, Kroger announced that it will expand its Scan, Bag, Go technology to new divisions. The technology helps customers to visit a store self-checkout area for payment. Apart from expanding its Scan, Bag, Go technology to 400 stores by the end of this year, Kroger is also working on a new technology wherein customers can skip checkout and directly pay through an app.Understandably, everyone is trying to build a loyal clientele by playing on the customer- convenience quotient. Amazon too is planning to open more Amazon Go stores by the end of this year, thus heating up the retail race.Bottom LineTechnology undoubtedly has changed the entire retail game in the last few years, with the gap between online and offline fast disappearing. Microsoft’s new technology certainly will make things easier for retailers and intensify competition.Wall Street’s Next Amazon Zacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time. It’s a once-in-a-generation opportunity to invest in pure genius.Click for details >>

3001,TGT,"Target Corporation (TGT  -  Free Report) gave investors a reason to cheer by hiking its dividend payout. The board of directors raised the quarterly dividend by 3.2% to 64 cents a share to be paid on Sep 10, 2018. The dividend yield based on the new payout and the last closing market price is approximately 3.3%. Last year in June, Target increased regular quarterly dividend by 3.3% to 62 cents.We believe that such hikes not only enhance shareholders’ value but raise the market value of the stock as well. In fact, through these dividend increases companies persuade investors to either buy or hold the scrip instead of selling it. People looking for regular income from stocks are most likely to choose companies that have a track record of consistent and incremental dividend payouts.3 Other Things That May Raise InterestStock Ascends 25% in Six MonthsTarget’s growth strategies and sound fundamentals reinforce its position. Notably, shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have advanced 24.7% in the past six months compared with the industry’s growth of 12%. The stock has also comfortably outperformed the Retail-Wholesale sector and the S&P 500 index that advanced 13.4% and 3.7%, respectively. Further, the stock is hovering close to its 52-week high of $79.59.Target Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Target Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Target Corporation Quote We see no reason why Target with a VGM Score of A and long-term earnings growth rate of 6% cannot breach that mark in the near term. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Same-Day DeliveryRetailers are ensuring a speedy delivery to customers. They are either acquiring or partnering with delivery service companies for same-day delivery to stay ahead in the race. In this respect, Target has chalked out strategies to take on Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) and Walmart (WMT  -  Free Report) in the fast-changing retail landscape. The company acquired Shipt to expand same-day delivery.The company commenced same-day delivery service in the Chicago metro area through Shipt. This is in line with the company’s efforts to expand in the Midwest states of Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Missouri, Ohio and Wisconsin for more than 55,000 groceries, essentials, home, electronics, toys and other products.Target has for long been coming up with offers to drive customer count For those signing up for the same-day service prior to the launch, the company has announced an annual membership fee offer of $49 instead of the usual $99. Further, with the annual membership, customers can avail free delivery on orders above $35. Apart from this, customers will be credited $15 on a Target order of at least $100.Restock Program & Other InitiativesThe company has rolled out Target Restock program that allows customers to restock their shipping box with essential items online and get them delivered at door steps by the next business day for a nominal charge. Drive Up, an app-based service, is another initiative to expedite the shopping process. The service allows customers to place orders using the Target app and have them delivered to their cars.Target in the recently concluded first-quarter fiscal 2018 informed that it has introduced Drive-Up service in more than 250 stores and expanded Target Restock nationwide. Courtesy to Shipt, it also rolled out same-day delivery from more than 700 outlets. The company expect to add Drive-Up service in another 300 stores during the second quarter.Wrapping UpTarget, which shares space with Costco (COST  -  Free Report), is deploying resources to enhance omni-channel capacities, coming up with new brands, remodeling or refurbishing stores, and expanding same-day delivery options. The company has undertaken rationalization of supply chain with same-day delivery of in-store purchases for a flat fee along with technology and process improvements.The company remains on track to inject $7 billion of capital to merge digital and physical shopping, open small format stores and fulfillment centers, revamp stores and bring in new merchandise. The company continues to expect capital investments of roughly $3.5 billion during fiscal 2018. Analysts pointed that incremental investments may weigh on margins. However, it is better to face short-term impediments in order to attain the long-term goals. Target is trying all means to fast adapt to the altering retail environment.5 Medical Stocks to Buy NowZacks names 5 companies poised to ride a medical breakthrough that is targeting cures for leukemia, AIDS, muscular dystrophy, hemophilia, and other conditions.New products in this field are already generating substantial revenue and even more wondrous treatments are in the pipeline.

3002,TGT,"Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) might have forever changed the grocery industry exactly one year ago when the e-commerce giant bought Whole Foods for roughly $14 billion on June 16, 2017. Today, grocery delivery is commonplace across the entire industry.OverviewNielsen (NLSN  -  Free Report) and the Food Marketing Institute released their second-ever ""Digitally Engaged Food Shopper"" study earlier this year, which stated that within the next five to seven years 70% of consumers will do at least some grocery shopping online. Furthermore, FMI and Nielsen estimated that people will spend $100 billion year in this budding industry.Amazon’s e-commerce dominance sparked this growth and forced Walmart (WMT  -  Free Report), Target (TGT  -  Free Report), and many other grocery players to dive headfirst into e-commerce, delivery, and curbside pick-up.Before we jump into what the individual companies are doing on these vital fronts, let’s take a quick look at their price performances since Amazon bought Whole Foods last year.  Investors will note that Target stock has outperformed some of its peers over the last year, by a pretty wide margin. With that said, Amazon stock has soared nearly 78%, but it operates a much bigger and more diversified business than these grocery and big-box retailers. WalmartIn March, Walmart announced its plan to expand its online grocery delivery option to more than100 metro areas by the end of the year. At the time, the service was only available in six markets.The big-box giant also offers an order online, curbside pickup up service called “Grocery Hero” at 1,000 stores, with the company expected to add that service at 1,000 more locations by end of 2017. Investors should note that Walmart’s first-quarter e-commerce sales surged by 33% in the U.S.TargetTarget also introduced its online ordering, curbside pickup service called “Drive-Up” at more than 250 stores last quarter. The company also expanded its “Restock” program nationwide, allowing customers throughout the U.S. to shop from thousands of popular items for next day delivery.  The Minneapolis-based retailer saw its digital sales surge 28% in Q1, on top of a 21% climb in the year-ago period. Target also introduced same-day delivery at over 700 locations, which was made possible by its $550 million December 2017 purchase of grocery delivery startup Shipt.CostcoBig-box powerhouse Costco (COST  -  Free Report) launched CostcoGrocery last fall. The service offers two-day delivery for non-perishable food and household supplies to Costco customers nationwide. Meanwhile, the company expanded its same-day delivery service to “most metropolitan” areas through an updated partnership with grocery delivery startup giant Instacart.The company’s most recent quarterly financial results helped demonstrate how well Costco’s online ordering and delivery business has performed. The wholesale retailer’s quarterly revenues popped by 12% to $32.36 billion, with e-commerce comp sales up 36.8%.KrogerGrocery chain Kroger (KR  -  Free Report) recently started its “Restock Kroger” initiative, aimed to accelerate its digital and e-commerce offerings. The company currently offers online ordering and curbside pickup through its ClickList service.Like Costco and many others, including CVS (CVS  -  Free Report), Aldi, and Jewel-Osco, Kroger works with Instacart for same-day delivery. It’s unclear exactly how effective Kroger’s new e-commerce and delivery initiatives have been, but its upcoming first quarter might give investors a better idea. The company is expected to report its Q1 financial results before the market opens on Thursday, June 21 (also read: Upcoming Earnings to Watch: FDX, KR, DRI).Bottom LineAmazon changed the retail grocery business forever before it even bought Whole Foods. Today, consumers have online delivery and curbside pickup options at nearly every major U.S. chain, with most of the company’s rapidly expanding their same-day delivery offerings on their own or through partnerships.Going forward, don’t be surprised if a company like Costco, which is projected to pull in nearly $140 billion this year, buys grocery delivery superstar Instacart before the company decides to go public. There is no clear winner at the moment, aside from customers around the U.S. who have exponentially more online and grocery delivery options than they did one year ago.  Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

3003,TGT,"Target Corporation (TGT  -  Free Report) is leaving no stone unturned to drive its top line and expand customer base. In line with this, the company recently announced plans to launch same-day delivery service in the Texas metro areas of El Paso, Brownsville/McAllen and Lubbock, starting Jun 28, through Shipt.Thanks to Shipt, more than 3,29,000 million consumers in the region can now get products delivered within an hour. This follows Target’s launch of same-day delivery service in the Chicago metro area, starting Jun 7.Interestingly, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company is trying to gain customers through its new service offerings. For those opting for the service prior to its launch, the company has announced an annual membership fee offer of $49 instead of the customary $99. Also, with the annual membership, customers can avail free delivery on orders above $35. Target, which shares space with the likes of Costco (COST  -  Free Report), is going the extra mile to provide the same-day delivery option to customers. The company also aims to offer same-day delivery of in-store assortments in most of its stores by the holiday season this year.The same-day delivery service is expected to be available to 65% of the households (80 million households) in the United States across 180 markets by the end of 2018. Management has also announced plans to include all major product categories at Target for same-day delivery by 2019.According to Technavio analysts, the same-day delivery market in the United States is set to see a CAGR of 23.2% during the 2018-2022 period. Given the bountiful opportunities in this niche, we expect the company to gain traction in the near term.Moreover, according to Nielsen and the Food Marketing Institute, although only 23% of consumers in the United States buy groceries online, the percentage is likely to bump up to 70% in the next five to seven years. Thus, it can be assumed that the same-day delivery space will heat up pretty soon and the company is clearly gearing up to make the most of it.The retail war is heating up with an increasing number of players shifting focus toward minimum delivery time. Almost all retail giants are pumping in more money and are either acquiring or partnering with delivery service companies for same-day delivery to stay ahead in the race. Target is fast catching up with the likes of Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) and Walmart (WMT  -  Free Report) in the same space.Over the past six months, Target has outperformed its industry.

3004,TGT,"Costco Wholesale Corporation (COST  -  Free Report) continued with stellar comparable sales (comps) performance, as evident from its April sales results. Comps for four-week ended May 6, 2018 increased 10.9%, following an advance of 8.6% in March, 10.5% in February and 6% in January. Certainly, improving labor market, rising disposable income and elevated consumer sentiment are working in tandem for the company.The company generated net sales of $10.81 billion in the month of April, up 13.1% year over year. Notably, net sales have jumped 10.9%, 12.8% and 8.4% in the months of March, February and January, respectively.Management highlighted that due to the calendar shift of Easter, April had one extra shopping day that favourably impacted sales as well as comps by an estimated one and one half to two percentage points.Comps for April reflect an increase of 10.2%, 14% and 11.2% at the United States, Canada and Other International locations, respectively. Excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and gasoline prices, Costco’s comps for the month under review rose 7.3%. The company recorded comps increase of 7.9%, 6% and 6.3% at the United States, Canada and Other International locations, respectively.For the 35-week period, Costco reported 9.6% jump in comps, displaying an increase of 8.9%, 10.1% and 13.3% at the United States, Canada and Other International locations, respectively. Net sales for the period came in at $92.24 billion, an increase of 12.2% from the year-ago period.While major chains are grappling with sluggish store and mall traffic as consumers switch to online shopping, Costco seems somewhat resilient to the challenging retail backdrop.

3005,TGT,"Walmart Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report) finally announced on Wednesday that it will be acquiring a substantial stake in India’s e-commerce giant Flipkart. This is likely the smartest move that Walmart has made in recent times. Flipkart will give Walmart the much-required strength Walmart needs to explore the highly coveted India market.Understandably, Walmart’s decision is powered by the intent to compete with e-commerce giant Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report), which has established itself already in the targeted emerging market. That said, despite this big-ticket acquisition, Walmart’s shares took a hit on Wednesday, declining as much as 3.1%. However, it is too early to rule out Walmart given that the Flipkart acquisition will only add to its strengths.Walmart’s Boldest MoveWalmart has agreed to pay $16 billion for a 77% stake in Flipkart, making it the company’s biggest deal ever. This gives Walmart a chance to capture the growing e-commerce market in India. After all, Flipkart is the one of the most successful e-commerce startups over there.Acquiring Flipkart will give Walmart a second chance in India. The retail behemoth has struggled to penetrate the India’s retail market worth $670 billion, despite making its debut 11 years ago. Walmart has a meager 21 wholesale stores in India, and no e-commerce presence. Also, Walmart’s joint venture with Bharti Enterprises of a 50:50 partnership to run the wholesale cash-and-carry business turned sour a few years ago.Understandably, the e-commerce route to tap the India market seems to be the best bet for Walmart. For more than a decade now, different governments in India have denied permission to the likes of Walmart to set up stores in that country. Walmart has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Finally, when permission was granted in 2012, it came with conditions that foreign investors could do business in India only in partnership with that country’s retailers.   At the same time, Walmart too could not have opened its own e-commerce wing as foreign investment as online retailing isn’t allowed in India. Hence, acquiring an existing business was the best option.How Filpkart Can Turn Walmart’s FortunesFlipkart is India’s own Amazon being that country’s biggest e-commerce company. Amazon, on the other hand is the second largest. Moreover, one of the biggest reasons behind Flipkart’s success has been its cash on delivery model of business, a feature that has struck a chord with shoppers. Understandably, Walmart will try to cash in on this quotient.At the same time, this will give Walmart a level playing ground with its biggest competitor Amazon. Jeff Bezos’ company has in the last few years changed the entire retail landscape and is clearly ahead of other retail giants like Walmart, Target Corporation (TGT  -  Free Report) Dollar General (DG  -  Free Report) and Dollar Tree (DLTR  -  Free Report) in the e-commerce race.Wait and Watch GameWalmart’s shares slipped 3.1% following news of the Flipkart acquisition. However, the fall isn’t because investors don’t have faith in the stock. Rather, it occurred because Walmart said that the deal could cut into its projected earnings per share of $0.25-$0.30 in the current fiscal year and around $0.60 in the next fiscal. The company also indicated that it anticipates Flipkart’s operating loss in 2017 to almost double this year.This might have dented investor’s confidence to some extent as they have long known that such a decision was in the coming. Moreover, Flipkart holds 30% of India’s e-commerce market. In fact, investors reacted in similar fashion when Walmart in 2016 acquired Jet.com for $3.3 billion. However, the acquisition turned out to be Walmart’s biggest weapon to compete with Amazon, thus proving to be one of its most successful deals.Summing UpWalmart’s decision to acquire a majority stake in Flipkart undoubtedly is a bold move and perhaps the best possible way to say in the race. The deal definitely gives the company a second chance to tap the Indian market. Moreover, given the strict operating rules for retailers in India, the Flipkart acquisition looks the best and timeliest for Walmart to stay ahead in the highly competitive retail space.Wall Street’s Next Amazon Zacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

In the trailing four quarters, this diversified media conglomerate beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 93.4%.Which Way Are Estimates Treading?In order to get a clear picture of what analysts expect from the company’s earnings release, let’s take a look at the earnings estimate revisions.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter earnings, which has gone down by a penny over the past 30 days, is in line with the prior-year quarter’s 7 cents. Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $1,978 million, flat year over year.News Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  News Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | News Corporation Quote Factors Influencing Q3News Corp remains vulnerable to foreign currency headwinds and soft print advertising demand. Advertising revenues in the News and Information Services segment fell during the second quarter of fiscal 2018 due to soft home delivered revenues at News America Marketing, mainly attributable to two fewer free-standing inserts as well as lower custom publishing revenues. Also, softness in the print advertising market along with the decision to stop The Wall Street Journal’s international print editions in the quarter impacted the results.Management had earlier highlighted that FOX SPORTS Australia is likely to struggle against higher costs during the third quarter due to the amortization of NRL rights throughout the year.Analysts polled by Zacks anticipate revenues from the News and Information Services division to decline 3.3%. However, revenues in Cable Network Programming and Digital Real Estate Services segments are expected to increase 7.4% and 10.9%, respectively. The Book Publishing division is expected to remain roughly flat with the year-ago quarter.Meanwhile, News Corp is diversifying its revenue streams through strategic acquisitions and operational enhancement.

3007,TGT,"Amazon’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) growth has helped its shares skyrocket for more than a decade, which might leave some investors upset they didn’t buy Amazon stock a long time ago. Clearly, getting in on the ground floor would have been amazing, but now still looks like a great time to buy Amazon because Jeff Bezos’ behemoth is poised for more growth and is currently a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Quick Overview Amazon forced the likes of Target (TGT  -  Free Report), Walmart (WMT  -  Free Report), and nearly every other retailer to revamp their business models, bolster their e-commerce platforms, and push much faster into delivery. Meanwhile, the company’s AWS cloud hosting business is one of the biggest in the world and competes directly against likes of Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report), Google (GOOGL  -  Free Report), and IBM (IBM  -  Free Report).The Seattle-based company has also expanded its entertainment offerings through Amazon Prime Video, spending billions on new content to compete with Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report) and Hulu. The company’s streaming music business hopes to take on Spotify (SPOT  -  Free Report) and Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) Music. Amazon is also set to stream NFL games once again this season, and recently landed highly sought after Premier League rights.Amazon has also quietly grown its advertising business, expanded its brick-and-mortar footprint with bookstores and more experimental retail locations—not to mention Whole Foods. Meanwhile, the e-commerce power looks poised to further infiltrate key growth markets, such as India (also read: The Latest on Amazon's Booming Advertising Business).And this was just a quick overview of Amazon’s staggering scale. So now let’s move onto some more of Amazon’s current fundamentals.Price Performance Shares of Amazon have skyrocketed over 300% during the last three years, which crushes the S&P 500’s 34% climb, and also thoroughly outpaces Facebook's (FB) 139% surge, as well as Wall Street darling Micron’s (MU) 149% growth.Over the last year, Amazon’s stock price has climbed roughly 75%. Year to date, AMZN is up 46%, against the S&P 500’s 4.3% climb.Valuation Coming into Wednesday, Amazon was trading at 105.3X forward 12-month Zacks Consensus EPS estimates, which does mark a massive premium compared the S&P 500’s 17.3X. It is always worth remembering that Amazon doesn’t really care about earnings as it continues to pursue expansion.Yet, Amazon stock has traded as high as 282.7X over the last year, with a year-long median of 146.4X. AMZN is currently trading almost directly in line with its 52-week low, which means it is hardly a stretch to say that Amazon stock looks rather attractive at this current valuation.Let’s also take a quick look at the company’s forward P/E divided by its P/E to growth ratio or PEG, which is a somewhat more useful valuation metric to evaluate growth companies like Amazon. AMZN is currently trading at 3.5. This comes in above the S&P 500’s average of 1.8. But Amazon stock compares more favorably against its own history.AMZN stock has traded as high as 9.5 over the last three years and rested at 7.7 as recently as February. Amazon is also trading below its three-year median of 3.9 and currently presents a discount against fellow growth focused tech firm Nvidia’s (NVDA  -  Free Report) 3.6.Looking AheadLet’s close by quickly looking at Amazon’s growth outlook. Our current Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for Amazon’s second-quarter revenues to surge by nearly 41% to $53.46 billion. The company’s full-year sales are projected to reach $237.97 billion. This would mark growth of roughly 34% from 2017, which is pretty incredible for a company of its size and age. The company well-known on Wall Street for casting earnings aside is projected to see its adjusted Q2 earnings skyrocket 525% to $2.50 per share. Amazon’s fiscal 2018 earnings are expected to expand by 180% to reach $12.74 per share.Investors should also note that during the last 60 days, Amazon has earned 14 earnings estimate revisions for the second quarter, with nearly 100% agreement to the upside. During this same time period, Amazon received 17 upward revisions for the full-year against just one downward revision. The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

Excluding Southeast Asia joint venture revenues, the top line fell nearly 16%.Moreover, the quarter witnessed weak revenues in the Men’s, Women’s and Home segments.

The stock has not only underperformed the industry that grew 1.6% but also the broader Retail-Wholesale sector that advanced 4.5%.The question lingering in investors’ minds is whether this supplier of a range of office products and services will be able to post positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. In the preceding quarter, it had outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 14.3%.Let’s look at earnings estimate revisions in order to get a clear picture of what analysts are thinking about the company prior to the release. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review has been stable in the last 30 days and is pegged at 8 cents.Nonetheless, the consensus estimate shows a sharp decline from 16 cents reported in the year-ago quarter. We note that earnings per share had decreased 13% and 27% during the third and fourth quarter of 2017, respectively.Factors Influencing the Quarterly ResultsAnalysts pointed out that demand for office products (paper-based) has been decreasing due to technological advancements. Smartphones, tablets and laptops are fast emerging as viable substitutes for paper-based office supplies. Further, stiff competition from online retailers and soft store traffic have been playing spoilsport. Nevertheless, management is not sitting idle, and instead trying all means to bring the stock back on growth trajectory.Office Depot has undertaken a strategic review of business operating model, growth prospects and cost structure. Management is making incremental investments to catapult it into a product and services-driven enterprise. As a result of these, analysts polled by Zacks now expect first-quarter revenue to increase roughly 5% to $2,812 million.The company is gaining from U.S. retail store optimization plan, reducing exposure to higher dollar-value inventory items, shuttering of non-critical distribution facilities, concentrating on e-commerce platforms as well as focusing on providing innovative products and services. The company intends to boost sales in the contract channel by increasing penetration into adjacent categories and enhancing share of wallet with existing customers.To widen domain of offerings, Office Depot acquired CompuCom Systems that help it acclimatize to the fast-changing retail landscape along with providing enterprise-level tech services and products to customers.

3010,TGT,"Iconix Brand Group, Inc. (ICON  -  Free Report) is set to report first-quarter 2018 results on May 4, before the market opens. The company has a mixed record of earnings surprises in the trailing four quarters. While the company has been benefiting from a wide array of retail partnerships and strong international operations, its men’s and home segments have been posing concerns for a while. Bearing these aspects in mind, lets delve into how things are shaping up for the upcoming quarterly release.Factors Likely to Impact Q1 PerformanceIconix has over 50 direct to retail partnerships and more than 400 licensees worldwide with several retail giants like Kohl’s (KSS  -  Free Report) and Macy’s (M  -  Free Report). Such wide-spread business network provides adequate scope for the company to expand. Moreover, launch of the Starter brand in 2017 and the multi-year agreements with Umbro and Target (TGT  -  Free Report), depict the company’s dedication toward developing long-term partnerships.With a wide array of retail partnerships, Iconix is also well placed for expanding its international footprint. In this respect, the company has been undertaking efforts to strengthen its footprint in Canada. Evidently, it purchased the remaining 50% interest in Iconix Canada from its joint-venture partner in 2017. Besides this, the company has international joint ventures in China, Latin America, Middle East, Europe and Asia. Owing to such efforts, revenues in the international segment grew 10%, 4% and 3% in the fourth, third and second quarters of 2017, respectively. Going ahead, the company is expected to continue expanding the international footprint.However, Iconix has long been battling softness in Men's and Home segments. In fourth-quarter 2017, sales at the Men’s category declined 30%, while revenues from the Home segment dipped 6%. These factors also marred net revenues by 11% in the last reported quarter. Such headwinds are likely to continue in the first quarter and dent the company’s overall performance. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimates for the impending quarter reveals a dismal picture. The consensus mark for earnings for the quarter under review is currently pegged at 9 cents, down almost 57% from the year-ago quarter. This estimate has remained stable over the past 30 days. Also, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues to decline close to 15% year over year to $50 million. Iconix Brand Group, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Iconix Brand Group, Inc.

Target is on track to meet its goal of making available these services in majority of the stores it operates by the holiday season.The retail war is heating up with an increasing number of players shifting focus toward minimum delivery time. Almost all retail giants are pumping in more money and are either acquiring or partnering with delivery service companies for same-day delivery to stay ahead in the race.Target Intensifies Delivery RaceTarget has set a goal of making available the Shift service in majority of its stores in more than 40 states before Christmas 2018. And the company is more than halfway through its rollout of same-day delivery with Shipt and the launch of curbside pickup service Drive Up. According to Target, Chicago will become the first major urban area to get access to all four of Target’s coveted fast-delivery services — Shift, Drive Up, Target Restock and from-the-store delivery. Drive Up will be available in 1,000 stores by the end of the year. Moreover, Target also decided last month to cut its next-day delivery fee by nearly half.In December 2017, Target announced plans of acquiring grocery delivery service Shipt for $550 billion and using its technology platform to expand same-day delivery at Target Stores. In March, Target and Shipt started same-day delivery of more than 55,000 groceries and home goods, toys, electronics and other products in Baltimore and Washington. It seems that the company is well on track to meet its goal and is fast expanding Shipt same-day delivery service and curbside pickup service Drive Up.Retailers Shift Focus  Amazon set the ball rolling by playing to its strength — a strong delivery wing — when it started offering free-two-hour delivery service from Whole Food stores to its Prime members in February. The move came within a year of the e-commerce giant’s $13.7-billion acquisition of supermarket chain Whole Foods that stocks a wide range of fresh produce, meat, seafood, flowers and other items (read: Will Amazon's 2-Hour Whole Foods Delivery Skew Retail Pitch?)Price Performance (Year to Date)It goes without saying that Amazon has been a pioneer in minimizing the gap between online and offline retail space. Brick-and-mortar giants like Walmart, Kroger and Target, which so long, in order to compete with Amazon, were stressing on increased investments in e-commerce, have perhaps realized that bridging the online and offline gap is the ideal way to compete. Amazon has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.In February, Walmart announced that it will be expanding its delivery service to 100 metropolitan areas by the end of 2018 with orders fulfilled at more than 800 stores across the country and delivered to shoppers contracted through Deliv, Uber and other delivery contractors.The Kroger Company (KR  -  Free Report) too is increasingly focusing on the delivery aspect. The company is into a partnership with same-day grocery delivery service Instacart and delivers groceries for Kroger stores in 45 U.S. markets.Summing UpIt goes without saying that the retail war is more focused on the delivery race now. The idea is to lure more customers on the convenience quotient and most retailers are busy reallocating their investments to add muscle to their delivery service wing. Needless to say, the gap between online and offline retail is fast disappearing and it’s only a matter of time when others jump the bandwagon.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside? Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana. Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

3018,TGT,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put Target Corporation (TGT  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Target Corporation has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 14.9, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 compares in at about 21.6. If we focus on the stock’s long-term PE trend, the current level puts Target Corporation’s current PE ratio marginally above its midpoint (which is 14.7) over the past five years.Further, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with the industry’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 21.8. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that Target Corporation has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 13.3, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for Target Corporation’s stock in the near term too.P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, Target Corporation has a P/S ratio of about 0.5. This is significantly lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.5 right now. Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is slightly below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.If anything, this suggests some level of undervalued trading—at least compared to historical norms.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Target Corporation currently has a Value Style Score of B, putting it into the top 40% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes TGT a solid choice for value investors, and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too.For example, the P/CF ratio (another great indicator of value) comes in at 7.6, which is noticeably better than the industry average of 14.9. Clearly, TGT is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles.What About the Stock Overall?Though Target Corporation might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of A and a Momentum score of A. This gives TGT a VGM score—or its overarching fundamental grade—of A. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best. The current quarter has seen two estimates go higher in the past sixty days and three lower, while the full year estimate has seen five upward and two downward revisions in the same time period.This has had a noticeable impact on the consensus estimate, as the current quarter consensus estimate has dipped 0.7% in the past two months, while the full year estimate has risen nearly 4.8%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:Target Corporation Price and Consensus  Target Corporation Price and Consensus | Target Corporation QuoteThis mixed trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and why we are looking for in-line performance from the company in the near term.Bottom LineTarget Corporation is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. Moreover, a decent industry rank (top 38% out of more than 250 industries) further supports the growth potential of the stock. However, with a Zacks Rank #3, it is hard to get too excited about this company overall. In fact, over the past one year, the sector has clearly underperformed the broader market, as you can see below:So, value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn favorable in this name first, but once that happen, this stock could be a compelling pick.Zacks Top 10 Stocks for 2018In addition to the stocks discussed above, would you like to know about our 10 finest buy-and-hold tickers for the entirety of 2018?Last year's 2017 Zacks Top 10 Stocks portfolio produced double-digit winners, including FMC Corp. and VMware which racked up stellar gains of +67.9% and +61%.

3019,TGT,"Despite reporting better-than-expected earnings for nine straight quarters, Big Lots Inc. (BIG  -  Free Report) stock was down 10.1% on Mar 9. The sharp decline in share price can be primarily attributed to lower-than-expected fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 comparable store sales (comps) and net sales. Following the results, management issued first-quarter and fiscal 2018 outlook that too disappointed investors’ sentiment.The dismal run in the bourses led the stock to decline 13.3% in the past three months against the industry’s growth of 2.5%.Let’s Delve DeepThe company posted adjusted earnings of $2.57 a share that surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.42 and also improved 14% from the year-ago period. Additionally, the bottom line surpassed the company’s guided range of $2.35 to $2.40 per share. Due to shift in retail calendar, the company had an extra week of operations in the reported quarter, which had an impact of 9 cents.Net sales came in at $1,642.1 million, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,656 million. However, the reported figure rose 4% from the year-ago figure. Increase in sales was owing to  an extra week this quarter, which overshadowed the negative impact from lower store count year over year. Decline in comps was the biggest surprise this quarter. Comps were down 0.1%, lower than the company’s guided range of flat to up 2%. Notably, comps had declined in only three out of the trailing 16 quarters.While, the company’s gross profit grew 4.4% year over year to $682 million, gross margin expanded 10 basis points to 41.5%.

3020,TGT,"Shares of Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA  -  Free Report) are down 16.5% over the last year based mostly on Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) fears. There is no doubt that online selling and delivery have altered the retail world, but does that mean Walgreens can no longer compete? Let’s dive into some of WBA’s fundamentals to see what to do with the stock.Amazon ThreatAmazon is set to acquire online and delivery pharmacy startup PillPack for $1 billion in cash, in a deal that is expected to close in the second half of 2018. PillPack’s co-founder and CEO TJ Parker said last fall that the company had tens of thousands of customers and was set for more than $100 million in annual revenue.The late June announcement sent shares of pharmacy giants CVS (CVS  -  Free Report), Rite Aid (RAD  -  Free Report), and Walgreens tumbling. But the question is, how quickly can Amazon infiltrate the industry with a pharmacy firm that boasted just tens of thousands of customers? Walgreens alone claims 13,200 stores in 11 countries, with whole distribution centers delivering to more than 230,000 pharmacies—as of August 2017.Amazon does already sell its own private-brand, over-the-counter drugs, called Basic Care, selling 65 drugs at costs that were roughly 20% less than Walgreens and CVS. Yet, Amazon is far from overtaking the approximately $400 billion U.S. pharmaceutical industry.Investors should also note that fears the e-commerce giant would destroy the grocery industry have been largely overblown to this point as Kroger (KR  -  Free Report), Walmart (WMT  -  Free Report), Costco (COST  -  Free Report) and Target (TGT  -  Free Report) have adapted to the times and pushed out their own online portals, delivery options, and meal-kits. The pharmaceutical and drug industry is much different than the grocery business, for an array of reasons, but Walgreens and others are just as capable of fighting back against Amazon’s pharmaceutical invasion.In fact, Walgreens CEO Stefano Pessina said on a conference call that his company is “not particularly worried” about Amazon’s PillPack acquisition. “The pharmacy world is much more complex than just delivering certain pills or packages,” he continued. “I strongly believe that the role of the physical pharmacy will continue to be very, very important in the future.”Recent NewsWalgreens reported strong fiscal third-quarter results on June 28, topping Wall Street estimates and posting solid year-over-year gains. The company is also upbeat about its purchase of 1,932 Rite Aid stores.Furthermore, Walgreens is ramping up its delivery, and currently offers an array of shipping and delivery options. Meanwhile, just last week, it announced that its 40% acquisition of a leading retail Chinese pharmacy chain, Sinopharm Holding GuoDa Drugstores Co, was approved—which could prove to be a great investment. And the company recently introduced a new $10 billion share repurchase program that helps indicate its focus on driving long-term stockholder value, and that its stock price looks pretty cheap at the moment.Price Movement & ValuationShares of WBA are up 88% over the last 10 years, which falls below the S&P 500’s 128% climb. And over the last three years, Walgreens has seen its stock price tumble 31%, with a 14% decline in the last three months alone. With that said, shares of WBA sit roughly $20 below their 52-week high of $83.89. This means Walgreens stock is relatively inexpensive at face value.Diving a little deeper, investors will note that Walgreens presents rather strong value at the moment. WBA is currently trading at 9.9X forward 12-month Zacks Consensus EPS estimates, which marks a substantial discount compared to its industry’s 16.2X average. Furthermore, Walgreens stock has traded as high as 23.3X over the last year, with a one-year median of 15.8X. Walgreens stock is also trading almost directly in line with its year-long low, which is its lowest earnings multiple over the last five years. Therefore investors should be able to say with some confidence that WBA appears rather cheap at its current level. Outlook Walgreens is also expected to continue to experience strong top and bottom line growth. Our current Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for its quarterly revenues to climb by over 11% to hit $33.51 billion. The company’s top line is expected to expand by 10.8% to touch $131.02 billion for its current fiscal year.Moving onto the other end of the income statement, Walgreens is projected to see its adjusted quarterly earnings pop by 10.7% to reach $1.45 per share, while its full-year EPS figure is expected to expand by 17% to reach $5.97.Bottom LineWalgreens is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) that sports an “A” grade for Value and a “B” for Growth in our Style Scores system. With all that said, WBA looks like it might be worth considering at the moment based on its outstanding valuation picture and growth outlook.Lastly, investors should expect Walgreens to adapt in order to better compete going forward. And let’s not forget the company is a dividend payer, with a yield of 2.8%.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion.

3021,TGT,"In spite of operating in a competitive retail landscape, Costco Wholesale Corporation (COST  -  Free Report) has reported solid comparable sales (comps) numbers for the month of June.

3022,TGT,"Costco Wholesale Corporation (COST  -  Free Report) seems somewhat unfazed by the tough retail scenario. While major chains are grappling with sluggish store and mall traffic as consumers switch to online shopping, this Issaquah, WA-based company seems rather resilient to the challenging retail backdrop.

In fact, the strategy to sell products at heavily discounted prices has helped it to remain on growth track. It is also steadily expanding e-commerce capabilities in the United States, Canada, the U.K., Mexico, Korea and Taiwan. As a result, comparable e-commerce sales have surged 33.2%, 38.1% and 34.8% in March, February and January, respectively.Additionally, a differentiated product range enables Costco to provide an upscale shopping experience for its members, consequently resulting in market share gains and higher sales per square foot. Notably, membership fees have increased 12.6% and 9.8% in the second and first quarter of fiscal 2018, respectively.We noted that total revenue grew 10.8% and 13.2% during the second and first quarter of fiscal 2018, respectively.

3023,TGT,"In an effort to focus on core operations, The Kroger Co. (KR  -  Free Report) recently concluded the sale of its convenience store business to EG Group for $2.15 billion. As part of the ""Restock Kroger"" program initiated last October, Kroger has been looking to weigh strategic alternatives for its convenience stores.Notably, Blackburn, England-based EG Group is an operator of convenience stores in Europe.Going into details of the deal, Kroger vended 762 stores (including 66 franchise operations in 18 states, employing 11,000 associates) under the Turkey Hill, Loaf 'N Jug, Kwik Shop, Tom Thumb and Quik Stop brands. However, management highlighted that supermarket fuel centers and Turkey Hill Dairy are not part of the deal.Planned in February, the sale is expected to yield $1.7 billion after taxes, out of which $1.2 billion will be used for an accelerated share repurchase program. The rest of the proceeds will be used to lower its net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio. The sale seems like a fitting move by Kroger, which has been grappling with stiff competition in the grocery industry, volatile food prices, an aggressive promotional environment and declining store count. Kroger, which shares space with the likes of Wal-Mart (WMT  -  Free Report), Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) and Target (TGT  -  Free Report), is leaving no stone unturned to draw consumers and gain incremental revenues. The company is expanding its store base and introducing items and digital coupons along with other attractions like online ordering and pick-up at store.Apart from such bold moves, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company has been ramping up its shareholder-friendly activities. It has entered an agreement with Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC to buy back shares, close on the heels of a $1-billion repurchase program announced on Mar 15. Per the agreement, the Cincinnati-based company will pay $1.2 billion to Goldman Sachs on Apr 24. In turn, Goldman Sachs will initially deliver around 36.1 million common shares of Kroger.

3028,TGT,"The fight over who will acquire a majority stake in India’s e-commerce retail giant Flipkart is intensifying. According to reports, Walmart Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report) is already in advanced talks to acquire a 51% stake in Flipkart. On the other hand, Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report) too is leaving no stone unturned to capture a significant stake in the company. So much so that Amazon reportedly has offered a breakup fee of nearly $1-$2 billion as part of its bid to acquire a considerable stake in Flipkart. That said, it is too early to predict who will have the last laugh, as none of the three companies have yet commented on this.However, the big question is how much does Flipkart matter to Amazon and Walmart. It surely does, given that Flipkart is the biggest e-commerce company in India and has an enviable customer base in that country, it will only strengthen the presence of both Amazon and Walmart in this vast market. Understandably, India is a lucrative market for both Amazon and Walmart, which are fighting hard to take a lead in the retail race much like every in other country.Flipkart to Help Build Stronger PresenceFlipkart is the world’s third-most funded private company and one of the most successful Indian e-commerce startups. The company has raised more than $7 billion from a number of global investors such as Softbank, Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report) and DST Global and has completed quite a significant number of acquisitions in the past few years, thus making it a name synonymous with retail e-commerce in India. For Amazon and Walmart, a stake in Flipkart definitely means a lot, as they will get to operate in a lucrative market.In fact, Flipkart to Indians is much like Amazon and is the biggest e-commerce company. Amazon, on the other hand is the second biggest. Flipkart has overtaken the likes of Snapdeal and other e-commerce companies in India within 10 years of its inception and is clearly ahead of others including Amazon. Understandably, Amazon stands to benefit if it succeeds in acquiring a considerable stake in Flipkart and it will also end the rivalry between the two companies in India. Walmart, on the other hand, too will benefit as it is striving hard to compete with its biggest rival Amazon in the e-commerce space.Moreover, one of the biggest reasons behind Flipkart’s success has been the cash-on-delivery model of business, a feature that has struck a chord with shoppers. Today, most e-commerce companies in India have adopted this model, which has helped them earn the trust of consumers, thereby increasing their revenues.Amazon and Walmart’s India Presence to Get a BoostGlobally, Amazon is clearly ahead of other retail giants like Walmart, Target Corporation (TGT  -  Free Report) Dollar General (DG  -  Free Report) and Dollar Tree (DLTR  -  Free Report) in the e-commerce race. However, Walmart continues to be its closest rivals given that the brick-and-mortar giant is making fast moves to make its online presence felt. Undoubtedly, adding Flipkart will only strengthen Amazon online dominance and at the same time take the competition to the global arena.Moreover, Amazon is the second largest e-commerce company in India and a major reason behind this is that Flipkart enjoys the trust of customers, a lot of which comes from its cash on delivery model of business. If Amazon happens to acquire a considerable stake in Flipkart, it will most likely put an end to this competition. Moreover, Flipkart already has a strong delivery arm much like Amazon has in the United States. This will help Amazon use Flipkart’s logistics wing and aid both the companies to focus more on increasing their revenues instead of competing. This will not only help Flipkart in strengthening its profits but also add muscle to its supply chain and aid in boosting its efficiency in procurement and product assortmentOn the other hand, Walmart has a negligible presence in the estimated $670 billion retail market in India with a meager 21 wholesale stores, while it has no presence in the e-commerce space. The company has been trying hard to make its presence felt in the online retail market since 2014 and adding Flipkart will definitely help it expand its footprint in India. Moreover, Walmart’s failed joint venture with Bharti Enterprises of a 50:50 partnership to run the wholesale cash-and-carry business has left the company with no choice but to acquire an existing business. If the deal fall into place, it is likely to strengthen Walmart’s position against Amazon, by helping it leverage the large market Flipkart caters to. While Amazon sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Walmart carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Summing upAlthough nothing has been finalized yet, Flipkart definitely looks to be a lucrative proposition for both the companies given the huge retail market in India. Moreover, Flipkart too stands to benefit as the company has been incurring losses despite its mass appeal. While, for Walmart, acquiring a considerable stake in Flipkart will help the company get an edge of Amazon in the e-commerce space in India, for Amazon it will become easier to spread out and the same time focus more on its profits that competing with Flipkart in India.Investor Alert: Breakthroughs Pending A medical advance is now at the flashpoint between theory and realization.

3029,TGT,"While Walmart Inc.’s (WMT  -  Free Report) progress in the e-commerce realm has been talked about for some time, the company has not neglected its brick-and-mortar business. This is evident from its latest announcement to open and remodel 43 stores in Florida. These new and upgraded stores will be equipped with advanced in-store and digital innovations.Many retailers consider the modern tech-savvy era as bad omen for brick-and-mortar stores. On the flip side, few players like Walmart, perceive this as an opportunity to drive omnichannel sales. Physical stores have become a key link to drive online shopping, courtesy of strategies like in-store pickups. Such hi-tech augmentation efforts will empower traditional stores and strengthen their position in the retail space.Well, Walmart’s latest move to expand its store base in Florida, indicates the company’s dedication toward evolving traditional stores as a vital part of omnichannel sales, helping consumers to shop with ease. That said, lets delve into the latest plans the company has spun for its Florida stores.Plans to Fortify StoresWalmart plans to spend around $200 million in Florida to augment its stores, as part of the company’s budgeted investments of $11.0 billion for business development in fiscal 2019. It plans to open six stores in Central Florida, Jacksonville and Miami-Fort Lauderdale. Also, it plans to remodel 37 stores in several regions of Florida. Apart from these, the company intends to open a new distribution center in the City of Cocoa.Further, Walmart’s store development plans in the state include rolling out its Grocery Pickup services to another 80 stores. Such services currently exist in close to 100 stores in the region. Further, the company’s Mobile Express Scan & Go facility was recently launched across 10 Walmart stores in Florida. Additionally, this service is available at 49 Sam’s Club stores in the region.Moving further on these lines, Walmart’s Pickup Towers have been gaining traction lately, as it makes online delivery system smarter by saving time and costs for the company as well as consumers. The facility is available in 15 stores across Florida. Walmart plans to continue to explore opportunities in the region to expand the same.Seamless Deliveries is the Latest MantraClearly, Walmart has been quite receptive to consumers’ preference for online shopping. In fact, the company’s Florida store augmentation efforts bear testimony to the fact that it is actively undertaking efforts to incorporate stores with digitalization trends and create diverse shopping experiences. By integrating physical stores with online shopping, Walmart has been able to improve its delivery services.Earlier this week itself, the supermarket giant inked a deal with Postmates to extend its online grocery delivery service to cover more than 40% of the families in the United States. In earlier developments, Walmart’s Sam’s Club stores partnered with Instacart for providing same-day delivery services and improve sales of food products and everyday essentials. Also, the company acquired a delivery startup — Parcel, Inc. — which is a last-mile delivery service and specializes in same-day delivery for perishable and non-perishable products. Other than this, the company tested same day deliveries with Deliv, while it also partnered with ride-hailing services like Uber and Lyft for speedy online grocery deliveries. .Notably, such well-chalked endeavors to enhance store and e-commerce traffic have been aiding comparable store sales (comps) growth. Incidentally, the company’s U.S. comps (excluding fuel) rose 2.6% during fourth-quarter fiscal 2018, which marked its 14th consecutive quarter of growth. We believe that such store augmentation efforts in Florida will contribute to the company’s robust comps trend.Wrapping it up, we believe Walmart’s efforts will fortify its presence in the rapidly evolving retail space and compete better with industry behemoth Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report). Like Walmart, companies such as Target (TGT  -  Free Report) and Kroger (KR  -  Free Report), have been undertaking several initiatives to improve delivery services. This indicates that companies are rapidly transforming their operating models to suit the needs of consumers’ tech-driven lifestyle.Coming back to Walmart, this Zacks Rank #3 (Buy) company’s strategies to continue augmenting its business and operations have been raising investor’s optimism. Shares of the company have soared almost 16.8% over the past year, compared with the industry’s rally of 12.8%.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

Net sales for the period came in at $81.43 billion, an increase of 11.8% from the year-ago period.While major chains are grappling with sluggish store and mall traffic as consumers switch to online shopping, Costco seems somewhat resilient to the challenging retail backdrop.

3034,TGT,"Shares of Kroger (KR  -  Free Report) were down nearly 10% in early morning trading Thursday after the grocery giant’s fourth-quarter earnings disappointed investors. As a result, Kroger added its name to the list of sluggish reports from the retail space this week, creating fresh volatility and caution in the evolving sector.Kroger’s Latest ResultsFor the fourth quarter, Kroger reported adjusted earnings of $0.63 per share, matching the Zacks Consensus Estimate and increasing nearly 19% on a year-over-year basis. Total quarterly revenues reached $31.03 billion, surpassing our consensus estimate of $30.83 billion and expanding more than 12% from the year-ago period.Kroger also said that same-supermarket sales, excluding fuel, increased 1.5%. The company now expects fiscal 2018 earnings per share in the range of $1.95 to $2.15 per share. Headed into the report, our Zacks Consensus Estimate was calling for 2018 earnings of $2.11 per share (also read: Kroger Reports In Line Q4 Earnings, Sales Beat Estimates).Guidance on the low end of previous expectations and slightly-sluggish comps growth was enough to send investors into a panic on Thursday morning. Any concerns about the upcoming year will be exacerbated as competition from Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) and other online sellers continues to heat up. Kroger is also facing margin pressure from rising commodity prices, increased freight costs, and higher wages.Recent Retail ReportsThis week’s reports mark the end of the traditional fourth-quarter report season, and overall, we have seen mixed results from the retail sector. Total earnings growth from the sector’s S&P 500 members broke 9% on the back of 9.6% higher revenues, which is an impressive trend.But of the 195 companies in our “Retail and Wholesale” that have reported so far, only 56% have managed to surpass earnings estimates. Meanwhile, the sector has witnessed 43 total negative estimate revisions recently, outpacing its 36 positive revisions.Interestingly, some of retail’s most-disappointing reports have come within the past few days. This week’s sluggishness started with big-box behemoth Target (TGT  -  Free Report), which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate on Tuesday. Target did manage to generate respectable comps growth of 3.6%, but investors ditched the stock. Shares of TGT are down almost 5% on the week.Wall Street also saw a concerning double miss from Costco (COST  -  Free Report) on Wednesday afternoon. The membership-based wholesale retailer reported adjusted earnings of $1.42 per share, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by three cents. Quarterly revenues came in at $32.28 billion, lagging our consensus estimate of $32.72 billion.One of the week’s most-concerning earnings announcements came from Dollar Tree (DLTR  -  Free Report). Shares of the discount retail company crashed more than 15% shortly after the release of its Q4 report. Dollar Tree reported adjusted earnings of $1.89 per share, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny. Meanwhile, same-store sales growth of 2.4% missed Street estimates.Dollar Tree was showing signs of strength over the previous six months, emerging as one of retail’s top picks over that time. Analysts pegged the company as an outperformer based on the presumed health of its core customer base: lower income families in suburban and rural areas. Investors will hope that Dollar Tree can shake of its weak quarter and rebound as its shoppers start to realize their new tax breaks.Bottom LineThe latest earnings reports from the retail sector underscore the multitude of challenges facing even its biggest names. Sure, tax reform will be a relief—but across the board, retailers are facing rising overhead costs and new competition.Want more market analysis from this author?

3035,TGT,"Guess What? Walmart Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report) might just win the next level in its game against Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report). Incidentally, both these players have long been at loggerheads, and eyeing India’s leading e-commerce player – Flipkart for quite some time now. Markedly, chances that Walmart will win this round are higher, as reported by some sources.While both companies are trying to scoop up a major stake in India’s number one online player, currently valued at roughly $20 billion, it looks like Flipkart is more inclined toward teaming up with Walmart. Incidentally, there were rounds that this supermarket giant is already in advanced talks to buy about a 51% stake in Flipkart for $10-$12 billion and has already concluded a due diligence on the latter.Walmart or Amazon: Who Will Win the Flipkart Deal?Though there hasn’t been any official confirmation from Walmart, Amazon or Flipkart, sources revealed that Flipkart is bent toward Walmart. This is because that a deal with the latter would encounter fewer regulatory hurdles, in comparison to Amazon, as Walmart doesn’t have any online retail existence in India.On the contrary, Amazon is India’s second largest online player, which also makes it Flipkart’s direct and biggest competitor. Thus, Flipkart and Amazon together would create a monopoly in the Indian online retail space, making it tough for them to clear regulatory hurdles. Apart from this, giving the stake to Walmart will also help Flipkart’s founders to continue helping in leading the business.However, it is still too early to be confident about a Walmart-Flipkart deal, as Flipkart’s biggest stakeholder — SoftBank Group — appears to be more in favor of collaborating with Amazon, given the latter’s commendable feat in the e-commerce space. Also, Amazon is likely to try all means to win the deal, as Walmart’s investment in Flipkart would intensify competition and make things tough for Amazon.Well, this e-commerce king is firing on all cylinders to get the top position in Indian online retail – after its failed efforts to dominate the e-commerce market in China. Apparently, Amazon India has been planning to slash prices and ramping up investments to grab a bigger slice of the market share in the Asian country. Also, rounds were made that this online biggie offered a breakup fee of nearly $1-$2 billion as part of its bid to buy considerable stake in Flipkart.Can Stake in Flipkart be a Game Changer?Clearly, both Amazon and Walmart are vouching to strike a deal with the Bengaluru-based online retailer. If Walmart wins it, it will help the big-box retailer expand its international reach, after bolstering position in China, Mexico Canada and the UK. While Walmart already operates in India under 21 wholesale stores, its ability to establish its own brick-and-mortar stores gets restricted by the huge costs associated with setting up stores in a nation like India, alongside certain limitations on foreign ownership for multi-brand retailers.Thus, if this deal materializes, it is likely to strengthen Walmart’s position against Amazon, by helping it leverage the large market Flipkart caters to. On the flip side, investment from the world’s largest retailer will benefit Flipkart by helping it boost its grocery business. Flipkart, which sells almost everything ranging from cosmetics to electronics, has been concentrating on the food and grocery space. At such a juncture, investment from Walmart is likely to be a perfect choice, given its vast experience in the space.Notably, Walmart has explored every nook and cranny to combat the growing dominance of Amazon, which sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). These endeavors have Walmart, a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock to rally 20.3% in a year, surpassing the industry’s 16% gain. In fact, Walmart is not the only retailer which is taking incessant strides to stay firm in the Amazon-dominated retail world. Retail behemoths like Target (TGT  -  Free Report), Kroger (KR  -  Free Report) and Kohl’s among many others are also undertaking several efforts to stay firm in the race. (Read More: Walmart Heats Up War With Amazon: How Are Others Placed?)In fact, owing to this heated competition, price wars, aggressive promotions and waning store traffic have become major hurdles for companies in the Retail-Wholesale sector, that is currently ranked among the bottom 6% of all Zacks sectors. Nevertheless, retailers’ dedicated efforts to evolve with the changing trends and drive top line has helped the sector surge 24.6% in a year’s time, easily surpassing the S&P 500’s gain of 16%.

Total revenue of this operator of membership warehouses also came ahead of analysts’ expectations for the fifth successive quarter. Notably, both the top and bottom lines continue to register double-digit improvement year over year, thanks to growth strategies and sturdy e-commerce sales.This Issaquah, WA-based company reported quarterly earnings of $1.70 per share that came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a couple of cents.

This signals that the company’s efforts to drive online sales bode well. With the wave of digital transformation hitting the sector, retailers are fast adopting the omni-channel mantra to provide a seamless shopping experience, whether online or in-stores. Costco, which shares pace with Walmart (WMT  -  Free Report), Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) and Target (TGT  -  Free Report), is no exception to this trend.Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have increased 5% compared with the industry’s growth of 0.5% in the past three months.

The company witnessed comps growth of 9.7%, 11.3% and 11.8% across the United States, Canada and Other International locations, respectively. Traffic or shopping frequency rose 5.1% both globally and in the United States, while average front-end transaction jumped 4.9%. However, cannibalization hurt comps by 60 basis points.Excluding the effect of gasoline prices and foreign exchange, the company witnessed comps growth of 7% during the quarter with the United States, Canada and Other International registering comps growth of 7.7%, 4.8% and 5.8%, respectively.Costco’s gross margin decreased 46 basis points to 11.1%. Operating income in the quarter increased 10.2% year over year to $1,067 million, however, operating margin (as a percentage of total revenues) contracted 10 basis points to 3.3%.Store UpdateCostco operates 750 warehouses, comprising 520 warehouses in the United States and Puerto Rico, 98 in Canada, 38 in Mexico, 28 in the U.K., 26 in Japan, 14 in Korea, 13 in Taiwan, nine in Australia, two in Spain, one in Iceland and one in France. The company opened two warehouses one in Mexico and another in Korea. The company plans to open 15 units — 13 net new units and two relocations — during the fourth quarter and 25 units, including four relocations during fiscal 2018.Financial AspectsCostco ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $5,877 million and long-term debt (excluding current portion) of $6,492 million. The company’s shareholders’ equity was $12,143 million, excluding non-controlling interests of $304 million.Wrapping UpWe believe that Costco continues to be one of the dominant retail wholesalers based on the breadth and quality of merchandise offered. The company’s strategy to sell products at heavily discounted prices has helped it to remain on growth track as cash-strapped customers continue to reckon Costco as a viable option for low-cost necessities. It is also gradually expanding e-commerce capabilities in the United States, Canada, the U.K., Mexico, Korea and Taiwan.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

3037,TGT,"Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) has recently announced the availability of Prime Whole Foods discount at 121 Whole Foods Market stores located across 12 U.S. states. This move is in sync with its focus to strengthen presence in the retail sector.The move enables Prime members to avail an additional 10 percent discount on their purchases along with special weekly off on selected purchases made at these stores. Notably, the initiative was first rolled out in Florida.The offer will be accessible at the stores across 12 U.S. states. At present, Prime members can benefit from the offer at Whole Foods Market 365 stores nationwide and the stores located in Florida, Idaho, Kansas, Kansas City, Missouri, Arkansas, Colorado, Texas, Utah, Northern Nevada and Northern California.We note that the expansion of the ongoing 10 percent discount across additional Whole Foods store is likely to drive the subscriber base of Prime, consequently aiding the revenue generation of the company.Coming to the price performance, shares of Amazon have returned 39% on a year-to-date basis, outperforming the industry’s rally of 21.1%.Strengthening Retail BusinessThe successful acquisition of Whole Foods Market last year helped Amazon bolster its presence in the grocery retail market. Moreover, Amazon Prime has played a significant role in shaping the company’s growth trajectory in this market with its loyalty programs and customer friendly offers.With the latest move, the company is aiming at offering Prime benefits to the customers at all Whole Foods stores across the United States which is around 463 in number. Amazon is expecting to achieve the target by this summer.Additionally, the Prime members can avail the offer while using Whole Foods app for transaction and getting it delivered via Amazon Prime.We believe Amazon’s strong endeavors toward rewarding the customers will continue to benefit its market position.Further, the company introduced two-hour delivery services from Whole Foods stores to Prime members via Prime Now this year. The services were first offered in four cities — Austin, Dallas, Cincinnati and Virginia Beach. Recently, the company has expanded the service to Denver, Sacramento, San Diego, Los Angeles, Atlanta and San Francisco.This will help the company in gaining competitive edge against the likes of — Walmart (WMT  -  Free Report), Target (TGT  -  Free Report) and Kroger (KR  -  Free Report), which are the major players in the U.S. grocery market.Walmart acquired Parcel and extended partnership with Deliv last year to support its same day delivery initiative. Further, it is leaving no stone unturned to seize portion of the online grocery space.Target also acquired Shipt to expand its same day delivery services. Further, its buyout of Grand Junction has improved its delivery capabilities. Further, Kroger’s recently acquired Ocado, which is likely to intensify the war in the U.S. grocery market.We note that Amazon with Whole Foods, Prime Benefits and impressive delivery services is likely to keep gaining momentum in the market.Amazon.com, Inc.

3038,TGT,"With the e-commerce market getting intensely competitive by the day, retailers are making constant efforts to stay ahead in the game. Apart from getting into strategic alliances, making prudent acquisitions or developing websites and mobile apps, providing seamless deliveries is the latest mantra of the e-commerce space.In this regard, Walmart Inc.’s (WMT  -  Free Report) consistent efforts to counter Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) have been one of the most talked-about developments. The supermarket giant, which scooped up Jet.com in 2016, has left no stone unturned to take on Amazon. From speedy deliveries to payment systems and from selling grocery to offering meal-kits, the players have been going head to head for quite some time now.Will Jet.com’s Latest Move Up Walmart’s Game?Walmart raised its game through the announcement of plans to open a fulfillment center for Jet.com in New York, per sources. Evidently, rumors have been doing the rounds that the world’s largest retailer is planning to foray into New York, not through its own stores but by setting up a Jet.com fulfilment center in Bronx. This will help Walmart test same-day deliveries of Jet.com’s products in the largest city of the United States.  The facility, which is likely to open this fall, will support deliveries of products ranging from fresh groceries to even Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) electronics. Jet.com plans to carry out the delivery process, using services of last-mile delivery provider Parcel Inc., which was taken over by Walmart last year. Sources further revealed that for starters, this center in New York will remain exclusive to handling deliveries of Jet.com. Also, it will only store inventories.Notably, this move is in line with Jet.com’s focus on targeting urban millennials, unlike Walmart’s conventional rural or suburban customers. Clearly, this is likely to fortify Walmart’s presence in the deliveries and online grocery space.  Well, Walmart is doing every bit to exploit the opportunities in the booming online grocery space — from inking deals with Postmates and DoorDash to the acquisition of Parcel. The company has also introduced a line of kitchen products in collaboration with Buzzfeed’s Tasty.  In earlier developments, Walmart partnered with ride hailing services like Uber and Lyft for speedy online grocery deliveries, while it also tested same-day delivery with Deliv, in a bid to enhance its services. We believe that these actions help Walmart offer multiple choices to online grocery shoppers amid pose stiff competition to Amazon. Also, it should help the company extend its online grocery delivery service to nearly 800 stores by the end of this year.WMT, TGT, KR – All in the RaceWalmart, which generates a chunk of revenues from food sales, has been taking perfervid initiatives in the delivery services realm to combat Amazon. Incidentally, Amazon has been trying to exploit every nook and cranny of the online grocery delivery space, largely owing to advantages associated with Whole Foods, which was taken over by this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company last year. Ever since, the dot.com giant has been dedicatedly integrating Whole Foods into its Prime operations and exploiting it strategically to attract customers and enhance their experience.Consequently, Walmart and retail behemoths like Target (TGT  -  Free Report) and Kroger (KR  -  Free Report) are constantly revisiting their strategy to stay firm amid the competitive frenzy. Kroger, for instance, has been steadily creating a niche in the burgeoning online grocery space. The supermarket retailer’s recent deal with Nuro (the maker of driverless road vehicles) to deliver groceries at customers’ door steps is just another way to take on rivals. Also, the Cincinnati-based retailer’s agreement with Instacart for same-day deliveries, and ClickList order online and pick up in store services tell the tale of its efforts to stay abreast in the online grocery space.Moving to Target, the company is deploying resources to enhance omni-channel capacities and expand same-day delivery options.

Notably, both the top and bottom lines continue to register double-digit growth year over year, thanks to growth strategies and sturdy e-commerce sales.This Issaquah, WA-based company reported adjusted quarterly earnings of $1.42 per share — excluding the tax benefit of 17 cents — that fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.45. However, quarterly earnings improved 21.4%, following an increase of 16.2% in the preceding quarter.Total revenues, which include net sales and membership fee, came in at $32,995 million ahead of the consensus estimate of 32,715.2 million. The top line rose 10.8% during the period under review, following growth of 13.2% witnessed in the preceding quarter.We noted that in the reported quarter, the company’s e-commerce comparable sales surged 28.5%. This signals that the company’s efforts to drive online sales bode well. With the wave of digital transformation hitting the sector, retailers are fast adopting the omni-channel mantra to provide a seamless shopping experience, whether online or in-stores. Costco, which shares pace with Walmart (WMT  -  Free Report), Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) and Target (TGT  -  Free Report), is no exception to this trend.Costco Wholesale Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Costco Wholesale Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Costco Wholesale Corporation QuoteShares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have increased 19.1% compared with the industry’s growth of 22.8% in the past six months.

3041,TGT,"The last few weeks of first-quarter earnings season has been dominated by retailers, from Target (TGT  -  Free Report) to Macy’s (M  -  Free Report). This trend is set to continue, so Zacks has investors covered with three retail stocks that look poised to top quarterly earnings estimates. The retail industry has been under pressure not only from Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) and other online sellers but also from investors. Clothing retailer Gap (GPS  -  Free Report), which had been on a strong run over the last year, saw its stock price tumble nearly 14% on Friday after it released lower-than-expected Q1 earnings results Thursday. Therefore, retail investors need to be on the hunt for stocks that look set to top quarterly earnings estimates.Luckily, Zacks Premium customers can utilize the Earnings ESP Screener in order to search for stocks that are expected to surprise, in one way or the other. This is done because, generally speaking, when an analyst posts an estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.A positive Earnings ESP paired with a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better ranking helps us feel confident about the potential for an earnings beat. In fact, our 10-year backtest has revealed that this methodology has accurately produced a positive surprise 70% of the time.Today, we are giving our readers a free look at three of these stocks ahead of their upcoming quarterly earnings reports. Check them out now:1.      DSW Inc. (DSW  -  Free Report)Shares of DSW have climbed nearly 31% over the year 12 weeks and 14% during the last four weeks, in a sign that investors might be expecting big things from this footwear retailer when it reports its first-quarter earnings results before the opening bell on Wednesday, May 30. DSW’s Q1 revenues are actually expected to slip by 1% from the year-ago period to $684.11 million, based on our Zacks Consensus Estimates.But top-line growth is not all that matters. The company’s first-quarter earnings are projected to pop by 12.5% to touch $0.36 per share. Meanwhile, DSW’s Most Accurate Estimate—the representation of the most recent analyst sentiment—calls for quarterly earnings of $0.37 per share, which is 1 cent better than our current consensus estimate. The company is also currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and sports an Earnings ESP of 3.47%. Therefore, investors should consider DSW as a stock that could beat Q1 earnings estimates.2.       Dollar General Corporation (DG  -  Free Report)Dollar General stock has surged 33.7% over the last year, yet shares have slipped over 2% in the last four weeks. However, this recent decline doesn’t seem to be based on the off-price retailer’s first-quarter outlook, with Dollar General’s quarterly revenues expected to climb by 10.3% to $6.19 billion. Moving on to the other end of the income statement, DG is projected to touch $1.40 per share, which would mark a nearly 36% surge from the prior-year period.DG is also currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and rocks an earnings ESP of 0.95%. The company’s Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $1.41 per share, coming in 1 cent above our current consensus estimate. This means that Dollar General might be able to impress investors with a bottom line beat when it reports its Q1 financial results before the market opens on Thursday, May 31.3.       Lululemon Athletica Inc. (LULU  -  Free Report)Shares of this upscale athleisure giant have skyrocketed over 118% over the last year and 31% during the last 12 weeks.

Shares have moved nearly 10% higher in the past month, and the stock is currently sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Still, Salesforce’s margins are thin, and its valuations are stretched—so the pressure will be on the company to deliver great results.According to our latest Zacks Consensus Estimates, analysts expect Salesforce to report adjusted earnings of $0.46 per share and revenue of $2.94 billion.

3043,TGT,"The Kroger Co. (KR  -  Free Report) has been trying all methods to overcome competition, which has intensified with the foray of Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report). The company’s latest initiative is the hiring drive for its family of stores in the supermarket division to better serve customers. The company will hire 11,000 employees, including 2000 for managerial roles. In the past two years, the company has created 22,000 new jobs.The hiring spree reflects on the company’s expansion strategy and its focus to adapt to the challenging retail scenario by improving customer satisfaction. Of late, the company has undertaken several initiatives to boost its top-line in the current scenario of volatility in food prices and tough promotional environment.The companyis expanding store base, introducing new items, digital coupons and ‘order online, pick up in store’ initiative. The company’s “Restock Kroger” program is gaining traction.As a part of this program, Kroger will invest an additional $500 million toward associate wages, training and development over the next three years. Moreover, Kroger is looking to expand its “Scan, Bag, Pay & Go and Self-CheckOut” program — piloted at 20 stores — to nearly 400 locations in 2018. Meanwhile, Kroger’s Customer 1st strategy, which enriches consumers’ shopping experience, is benefiting the company.

3044,TGT,"Walmart Inc.’s (WMT  -  Free Report) latest contract with Postmates is likely to intensify the online grocery delivery competition among retailers — which was largely triggered by Amazon’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) takeover of Whole Foods Market last year. Ever since the e-commerce biggie’s intrusion into the grocery space, retailers, particularly Walmart, have been making constant attempts to stay firm in the game.From speedy deliveries to payment systems, from selling grocery to offering meal-kits online, both Walmart and Amazon have been in a constant contest against each other for quite some time now. Well, Walmart improved its flair in the race yesterday, when it inked a deal with Postmates to extend its online grocery delivery service, with an intent to cover more than 40% of the families in the United States.Walmart Playing New Card Every DayWalmart initiated the aforementioned online grocery delivery service in Charlotte, NC, and now intends to expand it further in the coming months. This service will enable Walmart to provide same day delivery to customers, who can place orders on the grocery section of the company’s website or use the Walmart Grocery app. Thereafter, any Postmates member will procure the order and carry out the delivery process seamlessly. With an order fee of about $9.95 on a minimum order of $30, this service appears to be much viable than others like Shipt which mandates a membership program.Without a doubt, the service will enhance customers’ experience, as they can now order products including fresh produce, bakery items, meat, seafood and pantry staples among others more conveniently. However, the move is not completely unexpected. Last month itself, this big box retailer announced plans to expand online grocery delivery services to more than 100 metros in the United Sates, in a drive to reach nearly 40% of the nation’s household this year. While Walmart has been resorting to partnerships and buyouts to offer grocery deliveries, the company has its own Online Grocery Pickup service which is also popular as “Grocery Hero” among customers. Walmart’s Pickup service enables customers to order online and pick up orders from stores – a service that can be currently availed across 1,200 Walmart stores with plans of spreading to 1,000 more stores this year.In fact, there were rounds a day ago about Walmart’s stride to expand pickup tower facilities to additional brick-and-mortar stores. The company plans to install giant pick-up kiosks in 500 additional stores by the end of 2018, which will lead to the availability of such services in 700 stores. The new towers will be equipped with extra features such as pickup lockers. Also, to ease payment, Walmart announced plans to launch “Walmart2World” money transfer service in collaboration with MoneyGram International (MGI  -  Free Report) earlier in the month.Talking of the past alliances and buyouts mentioned above, the company tested same day deliveries with Deliv, while it also partnered with ride-hailing services like Uber and Lyft for speedy online grocery deliveries. Moreover, the company acquired delivery startup Parcel, Inc., which specializes in same-day delivery for perishable and non-perishable products.Amazon Incites Stiff CompetitionGranted, Walmart, which generates a chunk of revenues from food sales, has been taking perfervid initiatives in the delivery services realm to counter Amazon’s growing dominance. And it ought to, given the online king’s quest to dominate any sphere it touches. Though Amazon has its eyes on Walmart’s other areas of interests too (like expanding in the healthcare space) let’s maintain focus on online grocery.Incidentally, Amazon has been trying to exploit nook and cranny of the online grocery delivery space, easily evident from its recently initiated free two-hour delivery of Whole Foods products to Prime customers in Los Angeles. Apart from this, the Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company also lures customers with Amazon Lockers, which is a parcel delivery service, wherein customers can select locker locations as their delivery address and pick up orders.Well, Amazon could only do this by leveraging stores of Whole Foods, which was scooped up last year. Ever since, the dot.com giant has been dedicatedly integrating Whole Foods into its Prime operations and exploiting it strategically to attract customers and enrich their experience. Consequently, other players like Kroger (KR  -  Free Report) and Target (TGT  -  Free Report) have also been pulling up their socks to stay in the game.Target, for instance, is deploying resources to enhance omni-channel capacities and expanding same-day delivery options. To this end, the company has undertaken rationalization of supply chain with same-day delivery of in-store purchases for a flat fee along with technology and process improvements. Further, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company acquired Shipt to expand same-day delivery — an announcement that followed plans to initiate same-day delivery in New England, Philadelphia, Washington, DC and Baltimore for more than 55,000 groceries, essentials, home, electronics, toys and other products. Apart from this, the company’s Target Restock program and Drive Up service deserve mention, when talking about its efforts to join the online delivery bandwagon.Moving to Kroger, the company’s the company’s “Restock Kroger” program is gaining traction. Also, the Cincinnati-based retailer’s agreement with Instacart for same day deliveries, and ClickList order online and pick up in store services tell the tale of its efforts to stay afloat in the online grocery space. Moreover, the Zacks Rank #3  company tried Uber’s services to facilitate deliveries — a card also played by Walmart.Can Walmart Stay Firm in the Game?That said, it looks like competition among these grocery retailers is far from subsiding. Owing to the mounting competition, price wars, aggressive promotions and falling store traffic have been some major concerns plaguing companies in the Retail-Wholesale sector, that is currently ranked among the bottom 31% of all Zacks sectors. Nevertheless, retailers’ relentless efforts to evolve with the changing trends and attract customers to drive top line has helped the sector surge 23.9% in a year’s time, comfortable outdoing the S&P 500’s rise of 15.5%.Though most grocery players are strongly focused on going a step ahead of the other, we remain hopeful about Walmart’s ability to withstand this competitive frenzy. This can be solely attributable to its steadfast focus on solidifying its game against Amazon, which is most evident from its recent emergence as an omni-channel retailer officially. In fact, these endeavors have also helped this Zacks Rank #3 stock rally 20.6% in a year, surpassing the industry’s 15.7% gain.

3045,TGT,"Target Corporation (TGT  -  Free Report) has chalked out strategies to take on Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) and Walmart (WMT  -  Free Report) in the fast changing retail landscape. The company is deploying resources to enhance omni-channel capacities, coming up with new brands, remodeling or refurbishing stores, and expanding same-day delivery options. Target has undertaken rationalization of supply chain with same-day delivery of in-store purchases for a flat fee along with technology and process improvements.Here we highlight the efforts taken by the company to be in the changing retail game.Same-Day DeliveryRetailers are ensuring a speedy delivery to customers. They are either acquiring or partnering with delivery service companies for same-day delivery to stay ahead in the race. In this respect, Target acquired Shipt to expand same-day delivery.The company will commence same-day delivery service in the Northwest through Shipt. This follows the announcement to initiate same-day delivery in New England, Philadelphia, Washington, DC and Baltimore for more than 55,000 groceries, essentials, home, electronics, toys and other products. The company intends to expand the service to majority of stores by 2018 holiday season.Thanks to Shipt, consumers will get products delivered within an hour. For those signing up for the service prior to the launch, the company has announced an annual membership fee offer of $49 instead of the usual $99. Also, with the annual membership, customers can avail free delivery on orders above $35.Restock Program & Other InitiativesThe company has rolled out Target Restock program that allows customers to restock their shipping box with essential items online and get them delivered at door steps by the next business day for a nominal charge. Drive Up, an app-based service, is another initiative to expedite the shopping process. The service allows customers to place orders using the Target app and have them delivered to their cars. The company intends to expand the service to 1,000 stores by the end of this year.This merchandise retailer plans to expand delivery service for customers' in-store purchases to all New York stores and four new cities — Boston, Chicago, San Francisco and Washington, DC — this year. The orders will be delivered either to their home or office on the same day for a flat fee.Focusing on Smaller Format StoresTarget continues to lay emphasis on developing smaller format stores to tap densely populated urban regions and space-crunched cities. With the changing business scenario and rising competition, Target felt the need to have stores of various sizes and formats in order to better serve its target areas. This approach helps the company to augment sales without substantial capital investment. These types of stores generally have higher sales productivity.Target opened roughly 30 small format stores in fiscal 2017, and now plans to open another 30 new outlets in fiscal 2018. The company plans to operate more than 130 small-format outlets nationwide by the end of fiscal 2019. It remodeled 110 stores in fiscal 2017. The company plans to remodel 325 in fiscal 2018, 350 in fiscal 2019 and 325 in fiscal 2020.Wrapping UpTarget, which shares space with Costco (COST  -  Free Report), is committed to make a capital investment to the tune of more than $3 billion this year. Analysts pointed that incremental investments may weigh on margins. However, it is better to face short-term impediments in order to attain the long-term goals. Target is trying all means to fast adapt to the altering retail environment.These initiatives are likely to bolster Target’s performance and cushion the stock. In the past six months, shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company has rallied 20.9%, outperforming the industry’s growth of 16.3%.

3046,TGT,"After registering positive earnings surprises in the past three quarters, Target Corporation (TGT  -  Free Report) missed on earnings in the final quarter of fiscal 2017. The company posted fourth-quarter adjusted earnings of $1.37 per share that missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a couple of cents and declined 5.8% from the prior-year period. The quarterly earnings came above the mid-point of the recent provided guidance range of $1.30-$1.40 per share.We observe that rise in cost of sales and higher SG&A expenses hurt the bottom line. Even higher sales failed to act as a savior. Shares of this Minneapolis-based company are down roughly 4% during pre-market trading hours. This is because of the continued year-over-year decline in the bottom line.Nevertheless, the company generated total sales of $22,766 million that surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $22,463 million for the fourth straight quarter, and surged 10% from the year-ago quarter.Target’s initiatives such as the development of omni-channel capacities, diversification and localization of assortments along with emphasis on flexible format stores are encouraging. Additionally, the company intends to deploy resources to significantly develop online platform as well as store facilities to make shopping more convenient for customers. Moreover, “Target Restock” program is also gaining traction.Target Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Target Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Target Corporation QuoteNotably, comparable sales for the quarter increased 3.6% against 1.5% decline witnessed in the year-ago period.

3047,TGT,"Walmart Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report) recently announced that it will be adding 500 Pickup Towers to its U.S. stores by the end of 2018. Understandably, this is in a move to stay in the retail race and compete with Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report), which has changed the retail landscape over the last few years.Pickup Towers help customers collect their online orders from tall kiosks inside Walmart stores. Given that Walmart is primarily a brick-and-mortar giant, the company is playing to its strength, much like Amazon is making use of its strong delivery arm to win customer loyalty.Although Amazon has a similar service, Amazon Lockers, Walmart certainly has an edge over the e-commerce behemoth given that it has more physical stores. And more Pickup Towers will only help the company in luring a greater number of customers. Amazon, in the last few years, has redefined the retail space, tapering the gap between online and offline. Walmart’s decision to add more towers in its stores is another instance of other retail giants following in Amazon’s footsteps.Walmart Pickup Towers to Boost Online SalesWalmart is trying to compete with Amazon by offering discounts on its online products only if customers pick up the goods from stores instead of having them shipped to their homes. Naturally, the decision to add 500 Pickup Towers is aimed at increasing online sales. The company introduced Pickup Towers in 2017. Pickup Towers allow customers to order online and then pick up their orders from these 16-feet-tall orange vending machines inside Walmart Stores.Already, Walmart has 200 Pickup Towers and the idea of adding 500 more comes after the company witnessed more than 500,000 orders being sent to the towers. Walmart believes that the expansion will give 40% of the country’s population access to Pickup Towers by the end of 2018. Understandably, Walmart is getting mileage out of its key strength, its well-distributed brick-and-mortar stores across the country.Walmart will also be debuting Pickup Lockers inside its towers, which will store expensive and fragile purchases like televisions, for safety reasons. Moreover, Walmart has another concept similar to Pickup Towers in mind. For this, it has entered into a partnership with Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL  -  Free Report), wherein customers will be able to place orders using Google’s voice-activated digital assistant.  Amazon on the other hand only has Whole Foods stores, which it acquired for a whopping $13.7 billion in 2017, to bank on for this line of expansion. So Walmart certainly will have an advantage over Amazon in this regard.That said, the expansion is a strategic move, wherein Walmart will be able to stay in the retail race by embracing technology and e-commerce and at the same time cut down on costs. For Walmart, shipping products to its stores will cost a lot less than using its fleet of more than 6,700 delivery trucks to drop packages at individual homes.Amazon Intensifies CompetitionAmazon’s strong delivery arm has been its strength and it is giving stiff competition to brick-and-mortar giant Walmart. In February, the company started offering free-two-hour delivery service from Whole Food stores to its Prime members.Naturally, the idea is to lure more customers on the convenience quotient and the two-hour delivery service has certainly given Amazon enough power to compete with brick-and-mortar giants like Walmart, Target Corporation (TGT  -  Free Report), Dollar General Corporation (DG  -  Free Report) and Dollar Tree, Inc. (DLTR  -  Free Report).And despite not having too many physical stores like Walmart, Amazon is making strategic moves through innovations. Much like Walmart, Amazon has a similar facility, Amazon Lockers, a parcel delivery service, wherein customers can select locker locations as their delivery address and pick up orders.Moreover, Amazon recently launched its Hub delivery lockers. These lockers can be installed in apartment complexes and customers can pick up their orders from nearby lockers.While Walmart has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), Amazon sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

3050,TGT,"Amazon’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) Prime Day event is going to be an extravaganza this year. To be celebrated over 36 hours, longest in the company’s history, the event is set to kick off on Jul 16 at 3 p.m. ET.The annual Amazon Prime Day is an event similar to Cyber Monday or Black Friday. Started in 2015, it offers special deals including deep discounts on Amazon’s own products like Echo Dot, Fire tablet, the Kindle device and Happy Belly bottled water, among others.Notably, Amazon Prime Day is only open to members of the Prime subscription service, which has crossed more 100 million of paid members globally (as of April 2018).Last year, the 30-hour event turned out to be a blockbuster, marking the biggest shopping day in the company's history. As a record number of Prime members shopped across 13 countries, Prime Day sales jumped 60% year over year and reportedly generated $1 billion revenues.Moreover, tens of millions of Prime members purchased items during the shopping event, up 50% from Prime Day 2016. Amazon.com, Inc. Price and Consensus Amazon.com, Inc. Price and Consensus | Amazon.com, Inc. Quote 2018 Event Expected to Surpass All RecordsThis year’s event is expected to beat all records, primarily due to the length of the event as well as deep discounts in all products, including Whole Foods grocery items for the first time.Amazon stated that Prime Day 2018 will feature “more than one million deals exclusively for Prime members around the world, plus select deals at all U.S. Whole Foods Market stores.”Amazon has already started marketing campaigns to promote the event, apart from providing with mouth-watering deals. Reportedly, as a part of marketing campaigns, 25-foot boxes are expected to pop up in New York/Los Angeles, London, Tokyo and Milan. These boxes will open to reveal a pop-up event that will be live-streamed on Amazon’s website.Meanwhile, in a pre-cursor to the main event, Amazon is offering great deals on apparel and accessories (starting Jul 9), Home furnishings, electronics and more (though Jul 15), and Everyday essentials.Per data cited by CNBC data from One Click Retail, the 2018 Prime Day is expected to showcase 80 in-house brands from Amazon, up from almost 40 in 2017.Amazon brands such as Stone & Beam, Rivet, Presto!, Wickedly Prime, Solimo, Goodthreads, Daily Ritual, and AmazonBasics are expected to make significant impact in this year’s event. This is primarily due to accelerating number of Prime members, who have been found to be more loyal toward Amazon’s in-house brands. The company’s strategy of launching new products frequently is also a key driver.This year, Amazon is set to launch 30 new products from Rivet and Stone & Beam, as well as new apparel from brands like Isle Bay Linens.Consulting firm PwC expects home and garden, apparel and accessories, and health and beauty products to be the top product categories in 2018 Prime Day.Prime Program to Get a BoostPrime Day is exclusive for the members of the Prime subscription program. The lengthy 2018 event and portfolio strength is expected to provide a further boost to the program’s subscriber base.Notably, a large number of new members joined Amazon’s Prime on Jul 11, last year (2017 Prime Day) than on any other day in the company's history.In 2017, the company witnessed five billion of item shipments via Prime services across the world. Amazon also announced that more paid members joined Prime in 2017 than any previous year, both worldwide and in the United States.Further, per the Morgan Stanley estimates, Prime subscribers will account for 51% of the United States population in 2018, up 45% from 2017.We believe that Amazon’s continuous efforts in making Prime more customer friendly will continue to drive subscription base of the service, which will eventually drive top-line growth.Moreover, the service is expected to help Amazon improve its dominant position in the retail market space amid intensifying competition from companies like Walmart (WMT  -  Free Report), Target (TGT  -  Free Report) and Kohl’s Corp (KSS  -  Free Report).Currently, Amazon has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

3054,TGT,"When it comes to ramping up pick-up services, Walmart Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report) leaves no stone unturned to travel that extra mile. This is evident from the company’s recent stride to expand pickup tower facilities to additional brick-and-mortar stores. The company plans to install giant pick-up kiosks in 500 additional stores by the end of 2018, which will lead to the availability of such services in 700 stores. The new towers will be equipped with extra features such as pickup lockers.With Walmart’s pickup towers, consumers can collect their online orders from stores in less than a minute. This will allow them to save cost of shipping and time. Management states that consumers’ response toward pickup towers was quite overwhelming since its introduction in 2016, which led the company to expand such facilities to more stores. Moreover, adhering to popular demand, this recent expansion will include the added feature of pickup lockers, where consumers can collect bigger-sized merchandise as well.Well, such efforts offer better competing grounds for Walmart against online behemoth Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report), which has been expanding rapidly in the online delivery space. Since Walmart has a strong brick-and-mortar presence, its pickup towers are likely to strengthen its position in the Amazon-dominated retail space. Further, Walmart plans to install pickup towers equipped with refrigeration systems for delivering grocery and perishable items. Like Walmart, companies such as Target (TGT  -  Free Report) and Kroger (KR  -  Free Report), have also been undertaking several initiatives to improve delivery services. This indicates that companies are rapidly transforming their operating models to suit the needs of consumers’ tech-driven lifestyle.In addition to providing seamless deliveries to consumers, cost savings are also a vital incentive, driving Walmart to strengthen pickup in-store services. Well, the company incurs lower charges when it ships items to its stores compared with transporting them to consumers’ residences. Such savings enable the company to provide additional discounts to consumers. Walmart’s zealous initiatives in the delivery services realm has been quite a treat for consumers seeking fast and easy shopping facilities. Earlier efforts in this respect include acquisition of Parcel, Inc., which is a last-mile delivery service and specializes in same-day delivery for perishable and non-perishable products. Other than this, the company’s Walmart Pickup program enables customers to place orders online and then pick them up at a store for free. In earlier developments, Walmart partnered with ride hailing services Uber and Lyft for speedy online grocery deliveries. Moreover, Walmart’s online ordering process are backed by efficient payment systems like Walmart2World.Indeed, such laudable efforts have placed this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company in investors’ good books. Evidently, the company’s shares have gained 17.5% in the past year, while the industry rallied 13.5%.

3055,TGT,"Given the busy schedule of customers and need for hassle-free shopping, same-day delivery is much in demand now. To fulfill this, Target Corporation (TGT  -  Free Report) is leaving no stone unturned to satisfy customers’ growing needs. The company recently announced that it will commence same-day delivery service in the Northwest through Shipt.This follows the announcement to initiate same-day delivery in New England, Philadelphia, Washington, D.C. and Baltimore for more than 55,000 groceries, essentials, home, electronics, toys and other products.Thanks to Shipt, consumers across Eugene and Greater Portland in Oregon; Boise Metro Area in Idaho; Seattle and Spokane Metro Areas in Washington will get products delivered within an hour. Interestingly, Target is trying to gain customers by coming up with new offers. For those signing up for the service prior to the launch, the company has announced an annual membership fee offer of $49 instead of the usual $99. Also, with the annual membership, customers can avail free delivery on orders above $35.Target, which shares space with Costco (COST  -  Free Report), is going the extra mile to deliver seamless, same-day shopping experience to customers. The company also aims to be the first retailer to offer same-day delivery in almost every major market by the holiday season. According to BisReport analysts, the same-day delivery market is expected to reach a value of $4620 million by 2021. Given the bountiful opportunities in this niche, we expect the company to gain traction in the market in the near term.Moreover, according to Nielsen and the Food Marketing Institute, although only 23% of consumers in the United States buy groceries online, the percentage is likely to bump up to a whopping 70% in the next five to seven years. So it can be assumed that the same-day delivery space will heat up pretty soon and the company clearly is gearing up to make the most of it.

3056,TGT,"Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report) is the latest among the FANG stocks to take a beating. The company’s shares plummeted 4.4% on Wednesday and erased $30 billion of its market capitalization after the news website Axios reported that President Donald Trump wants to take on the company’s growing powers and its tax treatment.Trump has long been arguing that the e-commerce giant has been getting an unfair tax treatment compared with brick-and-mortar retailers, which have been suffering the Amazon onslaught for quite some time now. Moreover, Trump has always been critical of Amazon and its CEO Jeff Bezos, expressing time and again how much he dislikes the company. However, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders denied that the administration is planning anything against Amazon. ""We have no announcement and no specific policies we are pushing for,"" Sanders said, related to Amazon.That said, it’s still unclear what Trump will ultimately plan or do with Amazon. If he really decides to implement an Internet tax, Amazon’s revenues will be affected and its customers will have to shell out more. This is because Amazon will likely pass on its extra cost burden to its customers.Trump Versus BezosTrump’s dislike for Amazon and Bezos isn’t unknown and dates back a long time. On Wednesday, the company’s shares nosedived once again on reports of Trump planning to take on the Internet retail behemoth and its tax treatment. This saw its shares tumbling as much as 7% at one point of the day and almost $53 billion of its market capitalization being wiped out, before it closed the day at down 4.4%. The selloff was fueled by fears of a prospective Internet tax, which would cut heavily into the profits of the company. Now, this was not something out of the blue. Back in August 2017, Trump had tweeted: “Amazon is doing great damage to tax paying retailers. Towns, cities and states throughout the U.S. are being hurt - many jobs being lost!""In fact, he had also said that the United States Post Office is losing billions of dollars every year by charging the likes of Amazon and others a pittance to deliver their packages. This, Trump suggested is only making Amazon richer. Interestingly, Trump’s dislike is perhaps more for Bezos, who also owns Washington Post. Trump has often criticized Washington Post and on one occasion, misleadingly referred to it as “Amazon Washington Post.”A tweet by Trump, last year, read: ""The #AmazonWashingtonPost, sometimes referred to as the guardian of Amazon not paying Internet taxes (which they should) is FAKE NEWS!"" Understandably, Trump doesn’t like Amazon’s business style and the latest report is further proof of that.Amazon Changing the Retail LandscapeAmazon undoubtedly has changed the retail landscape in the last few years. The company has grown from strength to strength with innovations in the delivery space and by bridging the gap between online and offline retail business. Amazon’s shares have increased 63.7% in the last year and 2.4% year to date. Amazon has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.This definitely is giving other brick-and-mortar giants like Walmart Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report), Target Corporation (TGT  -  Free Report), Dollar General Corporation (DG  -  Free Report) and Dollar Tree, Inc. (DLTR  -  Free Report) a run for their money. This is especially so because the traditional incumbents are constantly striving to stay in the race.The biggest move in the brick-and-mortar space was made by Amazon when it acquired Whole Foods for $13.7 billion in 2017. Moreover, Amazon recently started free, two-hour delivery from Whole Foods’ stores to its Prime members in four cities — Austin, Dallas, Cincinnati and Virginia Beach.Of course Amazon has established its dominance in the online retail space and it’s not only the retail giants but also the smaller players that are suffering the most with many shutting shop. Michael Kors (KORS  -  Free Report) will be closing 100-125 stores over the next two years. Sears & Kmart closed 358 stores in 2017 and 63 in January 2018. Toys R Us is nearing closure too. Naturally, Trump’s concern is for brick-and-mortar stores, which are finding it difficult to survive the Amazon onslaught.But What About Amazon’s Profits?Although it really isn’t known what Trump plans to do, an Internet tax will dent Amazon’s booming online business without an inkling of doubt. In 2017, Amazon accounted for 44% of all e-commerce sales and about 4% of total U.S. retail sales, according to CNBC’s One Click Retail study. The company’s e-commerce sales for 2017 are expected to grow almost $197 billion, reflecting a 32% increase from 2016. This says a lot about the company’s dominance in e-commerce retail. And a lot of this is because Amazon is spared from any Internet tax.Moreover, according to the study, Amazon’s grocery sales in 2017 totaled $1.5 billion, up 33% from 2016, thus making it an undisputed leader in the e-commerce space. Naturally, if an Internet tax ultimately comes to effect, Amazon’s profits are sure to take a hit. More taxes mean less profits or steeper prices in case the tax burden is passed on to consumers. This in its turn might cause a slump in sales.In ConclusionTrump’s dislike for Amazon has often come to the fore and the recent news has sparked fears in the minds of investors. An Internet tax certainly isn’t a good sign for the e-commerce giant. However, with nothing concrete on the table now, and the White House denying any imminent action against Amazon, investors can be a little more patient with the stock.Investor Alert: Breakthroughs Pending A medical advance is now at the flashpoint between theory and realization. Billions of dollars in research have poured into it. Companies are already generating substantial revenue, and even more wondrous products are in the pipeline. Cures for a variety of deadly diseases are in sight, and so are big potential profits for early investors. Zacks names 5 stocks to buy now.Click here to see them >>

3057,TGT,"Nordstrom, Inc. (JWN  -  Free Report), which consistently adapts to the evolving retail industry, is not far behind in the retailers’ race to aggressively expand presence in the online and digital arena to offer a seamless shopping experience. The company’s efforts to expand digitally are essential to thwart the increasing dominance of the online giant Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report).In addition to making investments in the digital technology, the company is embracing omni-channel functionalities to retain the importance of physical stores in an era where brick-and-mortar retailing is losing ground. For this, the company stays focused on expanding and renovating outlets to provide better customer engagement. Steps Taken to Boost Digital GrowthNordstrom has long been making investments to boost the shopping experience of customers. Of late, it purchased two major retail technology entities — BevyUp and MessageYes — to cater to customers preferring online shopping. While BevyUp is a leading digital selling device, MessageYes is an iconic platform for conversational trading.  These investments will be integrated into Nordstrom’s portfolio to expedite consumer’s personalized needs and accelerate business growth.The BevyUp digital tool will be consolidated into Nordstrom’s latest and integrated mobile employee app, in the coming year. In addition, the company will supply its salespersons a mobile suite of facilities that will allow them to stay informative and easily available to customers.Notably, Nordstrom has been persistently focusing on personalized shopping. The devices will help augment this further and enable the company to efficiently cater to customers in a digitally-connected world.Additionally, Nordstrom is on track to integrate its digital and physical assets to create innovative and multiple ways for customers to shop. The company is focused on advancing in the technology space by boosting e-commerce and digital networks as well as improving its supply-chain channels and marketing efforts.The company’s fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results reflected significant progress on its digital strategy, which drove the company’s top line.Store Expansion PlansApart from enhancing its presence in the digital world, Nordstrom stays committed to opening new stores and driving the top line growth. Notably, the company has successfully completed its planned full-line store expansion in Canada by opening six outlets in the country. In 2018, the company is keen on introducing Nordstrom Racks in Canada with plans to open six Rack stores. Overall, the company envisions a $1-billion sales opportunity from its expansion in Canada by 2020. It is also on track with domestic store expansion, as it is scheduled to open six Rack stores in the United States.In fact, the company launched Nordstrom Local in 2017, which is a modern retailing concept store that does not stock merchandise. This latest concept is quite different from the traditional retail approach and is a neighborhood store, where the company’s services are easily available in a centralized location.All said, we believe Nordstrom is aggressively making headway to safeguard its position in the evolving retail space, particularly in digital growth.Other retailers that are fortifying their presence are Target Corp. (TGT  -  Free Report) and Walmart Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report).Price PerformanceShares of Nordstrom reflect 8.7% upside in the past year, against the industry’s gain of 3.4%.

3058,TGT,"While many grocery firms are reeling under stiff competition posed by industry biggies as well as shifting consumer preferences, companies like United Natural Foods, Inc. (UNFI  -  Free Report) have been putting up a strong fight and thriving well. The company’s well-planned initiatives and rising demand for natural and organic products have been fueling growth in its sales channels.Well-Planned Strategies & Surging Demand Aid Performance  United Natural boasts an impressive earnings surprise history, which was retained in the second quarter of fiscal 2018. Both the top and bottom lines improved year over year and surpassed estimates. While earnings marked its fourth straight beat, revenues topped estimates for the second period in a row. Well, the impressive results can be attributed to the company’s consistent focus on growth initiatives and surging demand across all segments.United Natural is committed toward achieving core strategic targets for 2018, some of which also drove second-quarter fiscal 2018 results. These include plans to enhance customer base, expand the company’s broadline distribution channel, improve gross margin and retain focus on mergers and buyouts. The company expects consistent demand growth for its better-for-you products. Further, the company strives to develop effective sourcing processes and supply chain networks so as to better align supplies with demand and thereby meet consumers needs much more efficiently.Growth in E-commerceUnited Natural focuses on enhancing presence in the e-commerce space, mainly through investments in technology and infrastructure. To this end, the company extended its online operations to its fourth fulfillment center. This enables United Natural to offer a wide array of online services and cater to the requirements of the company’s brick-and-mortar stores. Driven by these efforts, the company’s e-commerce sales jumped almost 28.9% in the second quarter, positively impacting the top-line results of the food services segment, which improved 6%.The growing dependency on technology and advancements in the digital space caused many grocery biggies such as Walmart (WMT  -  Free Report) and Target (TGT  -  Free Report) to expand omni-channel offerings. With sophisticated distribution networks and fulfillment centers, United Natural’s growth in the omni-channel arena is quite remarkable and places it well when it comes to competing with big box retailers and more particularly with Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report).Efforts to Widen PortfolioBuyouts have played an important role to widen United Natural’s distribution network as well as customer base and boost long-term growth. In this regard, the acquisitions of Haddon House and Gourmet Guru during 2016 have proved lucrative, as they have strengthened the company’s resource base and helped achieve greater operating scale. Other notable buyouts include Nor-Cal Produce, Inc, Tony’s Fine Foods and Trudeau Distributing Company. Further, we expect United Natural to continue gaining from such strategic takeovers.  Bright Outlook Instills OptimismWith broad-based improvements and rising demand for organic and specialty food products, management is confident about sustaining the stellar performance in the forthcoming periods. That said, management raised its previously issued sales and earnings view for fiscal 2018. United Natural projects net sales in the range of $10.01-$10.16 billion, depicting growth of 8-9.5% from fiscal 2017 sales figure. Management also envisions earnings for fiscal 2018 in the range of $3.06-$3.14 per share, depicting an increase of 19.5-22.7% from the prior-year quarter’s figure. Management anticipates significant gains from reduced tax rates during fiscal 2018.Marching with such positives rolled up in its sleeve, United Natural is expected to continue as a prominent player in the organic and specialty food space. While the company gained just 1.3% in the past six months, it performed better than the industry that declined 5.8%. Further, considering United Natural Foods’ well-woven strategic goals for 2018, we are hopeful that this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company will move higher in the charts.

3061,TGT,"The fight for e-commerce retail supremacy is heating up with The Kroger Co (KR  -  Free Report) acquiring meal-kit company Home Chef. The latest development comes within a week of the company striking a deal with British online grocer Ocado to use its robotic technology to fill up orders at its warehouses. The retail landscape is fast changing with almost all major brick-and-mortar stores increasingly focusing on their e-commerce segment.It goes without saying that Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report) has changed the entire retail ballgame in the last few years, which is compelling its peers re-strategize their business model. Moreover, the grocery industry, which till some time ago remained insulated from the e-commerce war, isn’t safe anymore, with retailers acquiring grocery companies and taking the fight to the delivery race. Given this scenario, the Ocado deal coupled with the acquisition of Home Chef definitely is a move by Kroger to stay abreast in the retail race.Kroger Heats Up the E-Commerce WarOn Wednesday, Kroger announced that it will be buying Chicago-based meal-kit company, Home Chef, in a deal that could amount to $700 million. The initial price is $200 million and could go up to $700 million over the next five years in earnout payments to Home Chef if it meets certain sales and performance targets.Kroger, the largest U.S. supermarket chain by stores and sales, has been testing the market of its own meal kits at its own stores for quite some time now. Understandably, the Home Chef buyout is in a move to stay in the e-commerce race that follows Amazon’s takeover of the Whole Foods Market.Much like a number of other brick-and-mortar stores, Kroger too has been making efforts to survive the e-commerce onslaught. The Home Chef acquisition is definitely give Kroger a shot in the arm, as Home Chef saw its sales jump 150% to $250 million in 2017.Moreover, the tie-up with Ocado last week will help Kroger will help the company run automated warehouses and deliver food with the help of Ocado’s robots. Kroger certainly is taking the challenge to face both Amazon and Walmart, Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report) with its increased push in grocery and delivery race.Brick-and-Mortar Stores Take Up the ChallengeThe e-commerce retail war heated up after Amazon’s $13.7-billion acquisition of supermarket chain Whole Foods in 2017. Moreover, the e-commerce giant announced two-hour same-day grocery delivery service in February, which set the alarm bells ringing for brick-and-mortar stores like Walmart, Target (TGT  -  Free Report), Dollar Tree (DLTR  -  Free Report) and Dollar General (DG  -  Free Report) that so long rested assured of business safety. Target has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Walmart, undoubtedly, is Amazon’s biggest rival and has been making inroads into the e-commerce space. The brick-and-mortar giant’s recent $16 billion acquisition of India’s e-commerce company Flipkart is been viewed as a bold step toward the online shift.Target too has been increasingly focusing on the e-commerce and delivery front. The company has made e-commerce an important part of its $7 billion turnaround plan. Keeping this mind, Target will be introducing voice-activated shopping with the help of Alphabet, Inc’s (GOOGL) Google assistant. Also, earlier this month the company slashed the next-day delivery feel to almost half to attract more customers.Meanwhile, Dollar Tree has been taking up the challenge by opening more stores. The company will be introducing 650 more stores in 2018 in order to lure more customers. Given that all products at Dollar Tree stores are priced at $1 or below (pricing is its biggest strength) the company is being able to keep itself afloat amid the e-commerce onslaught. Similarly, Dollar General too plans to open 900 stores in 2018.Summing UpThe retail landscape has certainly changed with e-commerce running the show. This definitely has made brick-and-mortar stores sit up and think. However, the race for supremacy seems to be heating up with more players adding muscle to their e-commerce and delivery arm with more acquisitions and technological assistance.Wall Street’s Next Amazon Zacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

3062,TGT,"Ross Stores (ROST  -  Free Report) saw its stock price pop marginally on Wednesday as part of a month-long climb that has seen shares of the off-price clothing retailer surge nearly 6%. Now, let’s see if Ross’ run looks poised to continue by taking a quick look at its first-quarter earnings outlook.Over the last year, shares of Ross have surged nearly 33%, outpacing its industry’s climb of roughly 23%—which includes the likes of Burlington Stores (BURL  -  Free Report) and TJX Companies (TJX  -  Free Report). Ross also crushed the S&P 500’s 13.4% climb.With that said, Ross stock could stall if the company reports lower-than-expected first quarter financial results Thursday. Ross might be under even more pressure since fellow brick-and-mortar retailers Macy’s (M), Nordstrom (JWN  -  Free Report), J.C. Penny (JCP  -  Free Report), Kohl's (KSS  -  Free Report), and Target (TGT  -  Free Report) have all reported their Q1 earnings, with mixed results. This means investors need to pay close attention to Ross’ most up-to-date top and bottom line estimates.Q1 OutlookRoss is projected to report quarterly revenues of $3.53 billion, based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimates. This would mark a 6.9% climb from the year-ago period. Meanwhile, the company’s adjusted quarterly earnings are expected to soar by 29.27% to reach $1.06 per share.However, investors also need to understand what chance Ross has to top our earnings estimate as this could help its stock price keep on moving upward, while a miss could lead to a decline—at least in the near-term.  Luckily, Zacks Premium customers can utilize the Earnings ESP Screener in order to search for stocks that are expected to surprise, either way. This is done because, generally speaking, when an analyst posts an estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.A positive Earnings ESP paired with a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better ranking helps us feel confident about the potential for an earnings beat. In fact, our 10-year backtest has revealed that this methodology has accurately produced a positive surprise 70% of the time.In contrast, a stock with a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or worse, coupled with a negative Earnings ESP, is one that we typically want to avoid during earnings season.Heading into Thursday, Ross’ Most Accurate Estimate—the representation of the most recent analyst sentiment—called for earnings of $1.07 per share, which comes in 1 cent above our current consensus estimate.Ross is also currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and sports an Earnings ESP of 1.17%, meaning investors can consider ROST a stock that could top quarterly earnings estimates when it reports its Q1 financial results after market close on Thursday.  Investors should also note that Ross has topped quarterly earnings estimates in the trailing 15 quarters.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion.

3063,TGT,"Headline worthy initial public offerings have been few and far between recently, and a few major tech companies have grabbed much of the IPO spotlight so far this year, including Spotify SPOT and Dropbox DBX. With that said, June could end up being the busiest month for IPOs in a long time, and this week is packed once again.Recent IPOsSpotify stock closed its first day of trading in early April at a price that valued the company at $26.5 billion, which helped it land as the eighth-largest tech IPO after one day of trading, directly behind Google and (GOOGL  -  Free Report) and Snap (SNAP  -  Free Report). Aside from Spotify and Dropbox, Docusign Inc DOCU and Smartsheet SMAR were a few other notable 2018 tech IPOs.Meanwhile, many investors have been looking forward to IPOs from Uber and Airbnb. But those industry-changing tech companies look poised to wait until at least 2019 to go public—although Uber rival Lyft could reportedly go public in late 2018.Since the start of June, 22 companies have gone public, with 12 more expected to IPO this week. In fact, if all the planned initial public offerings are completed this week, it would be the busiest IPO month since June 2015, according to Renaissance Capital. So let’s take a look at a few of the bigger IPOs expected this week and quickly break down what the companies do.BJ's Wholesale Club (BJ) - Deal Size: $600 million Exchange: NYSEBJ’s Wholesale is a membership-based grocery chain that operates over 200 stores across the East Coast, competing against the likes of Costco (COST  -  Free Report). The company was taken private by Leonard Green & Partners LP and CVC Capital Partners Ltd in 2011 for roughly $2.8 billion.BJ’s Wholesale reported annual sales of $12.75 billion last year and turned in a profit of $50.3 million. The company is set to go public amid changing times for the grocery industry. Yet, the talk of doom and gloom seems to have calmed down for the time being since Target (TGT  -  Free Report), Walmart (WMT  -  Free Report), and Kroger KR have all proven their ability to fight back against likes of Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) (also read: Should You Buy Grocery Stocks, WMT, COST, TGT, After Kroger's Strong Quarter?).The company’s IPO is expected to be priced between $15 per share and $17 per share, offering 37.5 million shares.

However, its valuation has plummeted 75% from its last funding round. Domo noted that the middle of its IPO pricing is expected to be $20.50 per share.Domo is a company that investors might want to pay close attention to over the first couple of months as its real-time business data analytics software competes against the likes IBM (IBM  -  Free Report), Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report), and Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report).

3064,TGT,"Ascena Retail Group, Inc. (ASNA  -  Free Report) declined nearly 2.4% since it came out with holiday sales results on Jan 8. The company failed to put up a stellar show this holiday season, which has, however, been a marvelous one for retailers like American Eagle Outfitters Inc. (AEO  -  Free Report), Kohl's Corp. (KSS  -  Free Report) and Target Corp. (TGT  -  Free Report).Ascena’s consolidated comparable sales (comps) dipped 3% for the holiday period extending from Nov 18, 2017 through Jan 1, 2018.  A Brief IntrospectionAscena’s dismal comps performance stemmed from the negative comps witnessed at the company’s Plus Fashion, Premium Fashion, Value Fashion segments, somewhat offset by comps growth at the Kids Fashion (Justice) division.Segment-wise, comps declined 2% at Plus Fashion, 3% at Premium Fashion and 9% at Value Fashion. On the contrary, the same increased 4% at Kids Fashion. Under the Plus Fashion division, Catherines brand reported comps decline of 7% while Lane Bryant delivered flat comps. At Premium Fashion segment, comps for LOFT and Ann Taylor brands fell 1% and 6%, respectively. Likewise, comps for Value Fashion’s maurices and dressbarn brands plunged 6% and 13%, respectively.Moreover, enterprise comps dropped 3% so far in the quarter. Management stated that it is witnessing serious merchandising issues at the dressbarn brand, though it expects trend to improve with the advent of the spring season.Furthermore, management reiterated its second-quarter fiscal 2018 loss per share guidance of 7-12 cents, excluding the possible effects of recent tax reform. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same quarter is currently pegged at a loss of 9 cents per share.Stock’s Dismal Run on the BoursesA look upon this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company’s share price performance in a year shows that it has plummeted 63%, significantly wider than the industry’s fall of 1.8%. This downtrend can be mainly attributable to the company’s dismal comps performance in the past few quarters, owing to fall in average selling price and sluggish store traffic.Apparently, the company’s total comps dropped 5% in the first quarter of fiscal 2018.

3065,TGT,"It has been just seven trading sessions so far in the year, and Target Corporation (TGT  -  Free Report) is off to a solid start. Of late, this general merchandise retailer has been one of the most talked about stocks in the Wall Street thanks to Gene Munster’s prediction of it featuring in the Amazon’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) buyout list and strong holiday sales amid ultra-competitive retail environment.This Minneapolis, MN-based company has displayed a strong run in the bourses rising roughly 5% in the chart as against the S&P 500’s growth of approximately 2% so far in the year. Meanwhile, SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT  -  Free Report) has just gained a meager 0.3%.A Brief IntrospectionTarget has been hogging the limelight following Munster forecast. The famous tech analyst highlighted that given “shared demographic and manageable but comprehensive store count” Target remains a perfect choice for Amazon. Munster added that if the acquisition takes place, Amazon may have to shell out $41 billion. Well this was enough to shake the retail industry, which has certainly been facing the brunt of heightened online competition, lower footfall and changing consumer spending patterns.Nevertheless, Target emerged strong this holiday season joining the bandwagon of retailers — Kohl’s Corporation (KSS  -  Free Report), J. C. Penney (JCP  -  Free Report) and Zumiez  — who witnessed strong sales. Comparable sales rose 3.4% in the combined November/December period buoyed by healthy store comps, robust traffic and sturdy digital sales. The solid holiday numbers allowed management to lift the view. (Read: Target Joins Bandwagon, Posts Solid Holiday Sales, Ups View)But can Target offer investors better upside in the days ahead? Here is a short analysis.Sound FundamentalsTarget has taken steps that have improved prospects in a big way. The company’s initiatives such as the development of omni-channel capacities, diversification and localization of assortments along with emphasis on flexible format stores bode well. These are going to play a major role in 2018.It has also rolled out Target Restock program that allows customers to restock their shipping box with essential items online and get them delivered at door steps by the next business day for a nominal charge. Further, in order to improve supply chain and expand delivery capabilities, the company had acquired Grand Junction.To tap digital sales this holiday season, Target strengthened relationship with Google by allowing customers nationwide to shop through Google Express, including voice-activated shopping. Target has also made a concerted effort on the front of same-day delivery services by acquiring internet-based grocery delivery service Shipt for $550 million.Valuation PerspectiveA brief glance at some valuation metrics seems to indicate that Target has enough room to run in bourses. Further a Value Score of A also indicates the same.Target with a price to sales ratio of 0.6 compared with that of industry’s 0.8 indicate that the stock has enough upside potential. The stock also looks attractive with respect to a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 14.7x versus industry’s 24.7x. A more-or-less similar picture emerges when comparing EV/EBITDA ratios. Target holds the edge here with an EV/EBITDA ratio of 6.7 lower than 10.5 for the industry.We noted that this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has surged 39% in the past six months, compared with the industry’s growth of 29.1%.

3067,TGT,"With retailers reporting sturdiest holiday sales growth since the end of the Great Recession, Tiffany & Co. (TIF  -  Free Report) also came out with solid sales numbers and provided optimistic view for fiscal 2017. However, despite reporting robust holiday sales the stock gained only 1.3% as the company stated that it will take time to bring the previous negative comparable store sales trend back on track.The jewelry retailer posted better-than-expected sales results for the November-December holiday period. Net sales came in at $1.05 billion, up 8% from the prior-year period. Moreover, comparable-store sales (comps) increased 5%. In constant currencies, net sales rose 6%, while comps gained 3%.Management stated that robust holiday sales were driven by improved performances both instore and online. The company witnessed growth in sales of fashion jewelry, fine jewelry, watches as well as new home and accessories collection.Meanwhile, Tiffany’s competitor Signet Jewelers Limited (SIG  -  Free Report) witnessed dismal holiday season results. Signet’s total sales for the nine-week period ended Dec 30, 2017, decreased 3.1% to $1,881.7 million from $1,940.9 million in the prior year, while same store sales fell 5.3%. On a constant currency basis, total sales dropped 3.9%.Net Sales by RegionsSales in the Americas rose 7% to $516 million, while comps also increased by 6%. Higher spending by local customers and growth across the United States, Canada as well as Latin America drove the region sales.Sales in the Asia-Pacific region jumped 16% to $232 million, while comps were up 7% primarily driven by fresh store opening and rise in wholesale sales. Rise in retail sales were owing to surge in spending mainly in mainland China, Hong Kong and Korea.Sales in Japan inched up 1% to $145 million, while comps remained flat.Sales in Europe came in at $136 million, up 14%, while comps gained 2%.On constant currency, sales rose 5% but comps declined 7%.Other sales came in at $18 million, down 10% but comps increased 14%. The company stated that increase in comps was overshadowed by fall diamond wholesale sales.OutlookFollowing, robust holiday sales the company raised its fiscal 2017 view. The company now expects sales on a reported and constant-exchange-rate basis to increase by nearly 4%, compared with prior guidance of increase by a low-single-digit percentage.Management now anticipates fiscal 2017 earnings per share to increase by a double-digit percentage from fiscal 2016 earnings of $3.55, compared with the earlier estimate of rise by high-single-digit percentage. Moreover, it expects earnings to jump by at least a high-single digit percentage over adjusted earnings of $3.75 per share reported in fiscal 2016, up from the prior estimate of rise by mid-single digit percentage.Nonetheless, management stated that the updated guidance doesn’t include any impact from the latest tax reforms.The company also provided preliminary view for fiscal 2018. It anticipates sales to increase by mid-single digit percentage. However, expects earnings for fiscal 2018 to be in the range of flat to down marginally from the estimated fiscal 2017 earnings.Bottom LineWe still believe Tiffany’s omni-channel platform, store expansion programs, tapping of new markets and venturing into new revenue generating avenues is likely to help improve performance. The company's shares have advanced 17.1% in the past three months and have comfortably outperformed the industry, which witnessed an increase of 9.5%.

You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Strategic EndeavorsCostco continues to be one of the dominant retail wholesalers based on the breadth and quality of merchandise offered. In fact, the company’s strategy to sell products at heavily discounted prices has helped it to remain on growth track. Certainly, a favorable economic backdrop — strong labor market, rising disposable income and elevated consumer sentiment — are also working in tandem for the company.It is also gradually expanding e-commerce capabilities in the United States, Canada, the U.K., Mexico, Korea and Taiwan. To drive its online sales further, the company launched new delivery services for its customers, one CostcoGrocery option to deliver non-perishable items to buyer’s home within two days of ordering and another same day grocery delivery service in collaboration with Instacart.Additionally, a differentiated product range enables Costco to provide an upscale shopping experience for its members, consequently resulting in market share gains and higher sales per square foot.

3070,TGT,"Shares of Target (TGT  -  Free Report) tumbled over 5.5% on Wednesday after the retail giant reported lower-than-expected first quarter earnings. This seems like a bit of an overreaction, which means investors might want to take a look at Target’s current growth outlook and other fundamentals to see if they should consider buying Target stock.First QuarterTarget’s adjusted first-quarter earnings climbed roughly 9.4% to touch $1.32 per share, which fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.38. Meanwhile, Target’s Q1 revenues jumped 3.4% to $16.78 billion, topping our estimate of $16.53 billion.The big-box retailer’s digital sales surged 28%, while overall traffic popped 3.7%. This growth helped comp sales pop 3%. Target’s comp growth looks even better compared to rival Walmart (WMT  -  Free Report), which saw its U.S. comp sales grow 2.1%, with comp traffic up just 0.8%.Overall, Target investors should be pleased with this top line expansion and same-store sales growth because this is what will matter in the long run as the company invests heavily in its future.Business InitiativesTarget’s bottom line was negatively impacted by an array of new growth initiatives that it undertook to adapt to changing shopping patterns and compete against the likes of Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) and other online sellers. Target remodeled 56 stores and opened seven new locations, and that's just the start.On top of rolling out three new brands, Target introduced its online ordering, curbside pickup service called “Drive-Up” in more than 250 stores. The company also expanded its “Restock” program nationwide, allowing customers throughout the U.S. to shop from thousands of popular items for next day delivery. Lastly, Target introduced same-day delivery at over 700 locations.Some of these moves are part of Target’s $7 billion reinvestment plan, which currently runs through 2020, to update stores and open smaller locations in urban markets.OutlookMoving on, Target now projects its comparable store sales will grow in the low to mid-single-digit range. The company also expects to report adjusted Q2 earnings between $1.30 and $1.50 per share. This high-side projection comes in well above our current Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.34 per share, which marks a nearly 9% climb from the year-ago period.Looking ahead to the current full-year, our estimates are calling for Target’s revenues to hit $72.7 billion, representing a 1.2% climb. Meanwhile, Target’s earnings are projected to surge by over 12% to $5.29 per share. With all that said, let’s move on to Target’s recent price performance, before we take a look at what kind of value the stock presents at the moment.Price MovementComing into Wednesday, shares of Target had climbed roughly 31% over the last year, outpacing the S&P 500’s 13% surge. Target stock has also outperformed its industry’s 23% gain, which includes the likes of Dollar General (DG  -  Free Report), Burlington Stores (BURL  -  Free Report), TJX Companies (TJX  -  Free Report), and others. Year to date, shares of Target have also performed above its industry’s average.Investors will also see that Target stock has crushed Walmart’s performance over the last year. Furthermore, spurred by Wednesday’s decline, Target stock currently rests almost 10% below its 52-week high.ValuationLastly, Target stock is currently trading at 14.2X forward 12-month Zacks Consensus EPS estimates, which marks a significant discount compared to the broader, nonfood retail-wholesale market industry’s 27.2X. Target stock is also trading well below its industry’s 18.1X.Over the last 5 years, Target stock has traded as high 20.1X, as low as 10.9X, and at a 5-year median of 14.3X.Therefore, investors can say with some confidence that Target stock appears relatively attractive at its current level, especially considering how it stands against its peers and rival Walmart, which is currently trading at 16.9X.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

3072,TGT,"Target Corporation (TGT  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Mar 6. Well the obvious question that comes to mind is whether this operator of general merchandise stores will be able to deliver positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported.In the trailing four quarters, the company outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 10.2%. Moreover, the company has delivered positive earnings surprises in the preceding three quarters.

The company intends to deploy resources to significantly develop its online platform as well as store facilities to make shopping more convenient for customers. The company plans to expand merchandise assortments with special emphasis on Style, Baby, Kids, and Wellness categories that are performing well.Management is focusing on key departments, such as Apparel, Beauty, Electronics and Food and Beverage. In the recent past, the company has unveiled some private label brands such as Cloud Island, Cat & Jack, A New Day, Goodfellow & Co., Project 62, JoyLab and others. Target had earlier informed that it plans to infuse $7 billion of capital over a period of three years to merge digital and physical shopping, open small format stores and fulfillment centers as well as revamp stores and bring in new merchandise.Restock Program & Other Customer Friendly EndeavorsThe retailer rolled out Target Restock program that allows customers to restock their shipping box with essential items online and get them delivered at door steps by the next business day for a nominal charge. The company also launched curbside pickup program. This program gives customers an option to get ordered items without leaving the comfort of their cars.Further, in order to improve supply chain and expand delivery capabilities, the company acquired Grand Junction. To capitalize on digital sales last holiday season, Target strengthened relationship with Google by allowing customers nationwide to shop through Google Express, including voice-activated shopping. Target has also made a concerted effort on the front of same-day delivery services by acquiring internet-based grocery delivery service Shipt for $550 million.Flexible Format StoresTarget continues to lay emphasis on developing flexible format stores to penetrate deep into urban areas. This type of stores generally has higher sales productivity. Management had earlier informed that Target is opening 32 small format stores in fiscal 2017 with plans to open 35 new outlets in fiscal 2018. The company plans to operate over 130 small-format outlets nationwide by the end of fiscal 2019. It remodeled 110 stores in fiscal 2017, including 37 in the third quarter.Will Margins Remain Under Pressure?Margin, an important financial metric that gives an indication about the company’s health, has been declining.

3073,TGT,"U.S stock indexes appear to be making a surge toward the green on Friday afternoon, potentially ending what has been a volatile week on a high note. Fears about rising inflation and an impending trade war have caused many investors to panic over the last few days, but continued earnings strength could very well be enough to inspire more bullishness.Earnings reports from Q4 were impressive across the board.

Corporate spending, in particular, looks healthy—meaning that lackluster financial reports will probably not be the thing to slow this market down.The traditional earnings season is effectively over, but a few marquee reports—especially in the retail sector—remain to be released.

Investors should also keep an eye on the company’s e-commerce growth, as well as any updates on its store rehab initiatives. 2. Costco Wholesale Corporation (COST  -  Free Report)Following Target, fellow big-box retailer Costco is slated to announce its most recent quarterly results after the closing bell on March 7.

3074,TGT,"By now, nearly every investor knows that Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) has shaken up the grocery industry, along with almost every other sector of the retail business. Grocery chains and big-box giants have, however, fought back.Walmart (WMT  -  Free Report) and Target (TGT  -  Free Report) added new trendy offerings, committed more to remodels than new locations, and focused on improving their online sales and delivery capabilities. Grocery power Kroger (KR  -  Free Report), which boasts 2,793 retail food stores under a variety of banners, has also set out to revamp its business model to better compete going forward.The company recently started its “Restock Kroger” initiative. Kroger hopes to accelerate its digital and ecommerce offerings as part of this new push. Kroger has already made a few noteworthy moves, one of the biggest being the grocer’s partnership with grocery delivery startup Instacart.But investors likely want to know if these moves are set to pay off in the company’s upcoming fourth quarter earnings report.Kroger’s Q4 sales are projected to surge by 11.7% to hit $30.84 billion. Meanwhile, Kroger’s earnings are expected to reach $0.62 per share, which would mark a nearly 17% climb from the year-ago period.   Furthermore, the Cincinnati-based grocery firm topped EPS estimates by 10% last quarter.

3075,TGT,"Multibillion-dollar big-box stores might prove to be among the only retailers that can compete against Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) as it slowly undercuts smaller online sellers and brick-and-mortar businesses.With that said, Walmart (WMT  -  Free Report) and Target (TGT  -  Free Report) have had to dig deep as they fight against the e-commerce powerhouse by revamping stores, adding new trendy lines of apparel and home décor, and maybe most importantly, bolstering their online sales and delivery capabilities.Yet, Walmart saw its quarterly e-commerce sales growth slow recently, and Target investors must wait to see if the company’s upbeat guidance will be met next week. Fellow big-box giant Costco (COST  -  Free Report) faces similar challenges as more consumers buy consumer packaged goods and groceries online.Luckily for Costco investors, the retailer has indeed expanded its e-commerce sales in a big way.

On top of that, Costco’s earnings are expected to surge by nearly 24% to reach $1.45 per share. Costco has also topped earnings estimates in each of the trailing three quarters.

The holiday season turned out to be a blissful one as consumers continued to fill their shopping carts on the back of a favorable economic scenario.A buoyant stock market, rising income, low unemployment level and upbeat consumer sentiment together worked in favor of retailers.

3079,TGT,"Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report) is in the spotlight again with recent announcements of collaboration with H&R Block (HRB  -  Free Report) and launch of DisposeRx.H&R Block to Adorn Walmart’s Products LineupWal-Mart strives to ramp up its digital products portfolio, a strategy well in place with society’s growing online dependency. Well, the company’s latest venture of collaborating with H&R Block is another major stride toward augmenting offerings in this category.Per the terms of the deal, Wal-Mart will provide H&R Block‘s DIY desktop tax software products across the company’s outlets as well as online. The exclusive deal will enable H&R Block’s DIY products to have easier and greater customer access, enabling clients to prepare taxes efficiently. Apart from being priced competitively, these products also provide facilities such as in-person audit representation, unlimited and free tax advices, along with protection against tax identity theft.Looking back, Wal-Mart’s efforts to build an impressive digital brand portfolio include buyouts of ShoeBuy, Moosejaw, ModCloth, and Jet.com. The company has also been successful at developing easy and convenient delivery solutions through its new Mobile Express Returns program and the buyout of Parcel, Inc. In fact, Wal-Mart’s efforts to enhance delivery services resonate with its strategy of growing online grocery sales. Moreover, Wal-Mart also struck a deal with Lord & Taylor to launch a flagship store in spring 2018, which will help the company to offer premium fashion brands on its shopping website, directly sourced from the latter.DisposeRx : A Unique Solution for Reducing Drug AbuseWhen it comes to revolutionizing the retail spectrum and offering products for a quality lifestyle, Wal-Mart is among the trendsetters. This is evident from the company’s latest innovation, The DisposeRx solution. The DisposeRx contains ingredients that destroy unused pills by converting the same into a biodegradable gel. This unique product will aid patients to safely dispose leftover medications and effectively counter misuse of prescription opioids. Prescription narcotics are often unused and pose major health risk to those who come in its contact. Patients can request for a free DisposeRx packet across Wal-Mart’s pharmacy outlets in the U.S., including Sam’s Club pharmacies. The introduction of DisposeRx indicates the company’s willingness to develop a responsible society and fight drug abuse. Wrapping UpThat said, Wal-Mart’s business expansion efforts and strategic growth plans are quite commendable, aiding it to emerge strongly in an industry characterized with stiff competitive pressures and aggressive promotions. Most importantly, such endeavors keep this retailer alive and active to match the rapid pace with which Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) has been capturing retail market share. Like Wal-Mart, other major retailers such as Target (TGT  -  Free Report) and Kohl’s have also been augmenting their e-commerce and omni-channel offerings to stay afloat in the industry.While Wal-Mart’s stock didn’t react much to the aforementioned announcements, the company’s constant endeavors to drive performance have been positively impacting investor’s optimism. Evidently, shares of the company surged 47.8% in a year, cruising ahead of the industry’s rally of 37.8%.

3080,TGT,"U.S. retail sales rose for the fourth straight month in December, as people continued the shopping spree. The Commerce Department stated that U.S. retail and food services sales for the final month of 2017 increased 0.4% to $495.4 billion following a revised upward reading of 0.9% growth registered in November. This shows that consumer spending — one of the pivotal factors driving the economy — remains strong during the holiday season.Analysts believe that a buoyant stock market, gradual wage acceleration, improved employment picture, rising consumer confidence and modest inflation were enough to trigger consumer spending. Per National Retail Federation, retail sales during the November/December period increased 5.5% to $691.9 billion. It's quite evident that retailers are the end gainers, as they try to make the most of the season that accounts for a sizeable chunk of yearly revenues and profits.But does the sector promises a safe bet for 2018? Let’s analyze.Favorable Sector RankDefinitely, the above sales data and economic indicators signals that the ""retail apocalypse” is now a thing of past. The sector has certainly been bearing the brunt of heightened online competition, lower footfall and changing consumer spending patterns but of late the tables are turning in favor of the retailers. Stocks once bogged down by tough environment are now suddenly climbing the charts.The sector, which currently occupies the top 13% (2 out of 16) position in the list of 16 Zacks categorized sectors, has advanced roughly 35% in a year and comfortably outperformed the S&P 500’s growth of approximately 23%. Moreover, according to the latest Earnings Trends report, the sector is expected to record top and bottom-line growth of 6.3% and 12%, respectively, in 2018.Tax Reform May Leave Surplus Money in HandThe latest tax reform that has resulted in the corporate tax rate being lowered to as much as 21%, and retailers will benefit from the same. Analysts believe that a lower tax burden is likely to allow them to channelize the surplus money to best possible options.They may go for a dividend hike, or reduce debt load, or create a corpus to fund acquisitions, or invest in enhancing omni-channel capabilities, new product launches and any other innovations. Further, any individual tax cut would pave way for higher disposable income, which may trigger demand for discretionary items.Retailers Fast Adapting to Changing Spending PatternRetail is no more restricted to brick-&-mortar presence. The major reason behind today’s ultra-competitive retail environment is because of the e-commerce giant, Amazon.com (AMZN  -  Free Report). This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company is aggressively making headway into retail space be it grocery, books, clothes and accessories or electronics, you name it and you have it. To tackle the growing Amazon dominance, Wal-Mart (WMT  -  Free Report) is striving hard to give itself a complete makeover — including buyouts, alliances, and improved delivery and payment systems.Evidently, Walmart’s buyouts of Bonobos, ShoeBuy, Moosejaw, ModCloth and Jet.com underscore its quest to build an impressive digital brand portfolio. Its Walmart Pay mobile payment system and Mobile Express Returns program further highlight its focus on accelerating online business. Further, to fortify position in online grocery business, this Zacks Rank #3 company acquired a delivery start-up Parcel, Inc., which specializes in same-day delivery.Costco (COST  -  Free Report), which carries Zacks Rank #3, is also gradually expanding e-commerce capabilities in the United States, Canada, UK, Mexico, Korea and Taiwan. The company’s growth strategies, sturdy comparable-store sales performance, strong membership trends and higher penetration of Citi Visa co-brand card program are the pillars that reinforce its position.Target (TGT  -  Free Report) has taken steps that have improved prospects in a big way. These include development of omni-channel capacities, diversification and localization of assortments along with emphasis on flexible format stores. It has also rolled out Target Restock program that allows customers to restock their shipping box with essential items online and get them delivered at door steps.Further, in order to improve supply chain and expand delivery capabilities, the company had acquired Grand Junction. This Zacks Rank #3 also acquired internet-based grocery delivery service Shipt to sharpen its same-day delivery services.Macy’s (M  -  Free Report) also has announced a slew of measures revolving around stores closures, cost containment, real estate strategy and investment in omni-channel capabilities to enhance sales, profitability and cash flows. Additionally, management is developing e-commerce business, Macy’s Backstage off-price business along with expanding Bluemercury and online order fulfillment centers. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.From above it is quite apparent that the sector does hold promise in 2018 but it is also true that it will not be an easy ride for them.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

3081,TGT,"On Tuesday, Target Corporation (TGT  -  Free Report) reported fourth-quarter fiscal 2017, missing on earnings after surprises on the positive side in three straight quarters. The company’s shares too fell 5% in late trading despite a 10% jump in revenues. The dismal showing was largely attributable to an increase in cost of sales and higher SG&A expenses, for which higher compensation costs were hugely responsible.However, it might be too early to write off the Target stock just on the basis of an earnings fiasco and investor concerns. This is because Target has extensive expansion plans, ranging from increasing minimum wages to expanding its shipping services and even drive up delivery to 1,000 stores by the end of 2018. Plus, another good news is that Target’s sales are improving, thanks to stronger traffic both online and in stores.Target Misses Q4 Earnings Estimates, Sales Beat Target reported fiscal fourth-quarter adjusted earnings of $1.37 per share, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a couple of cents and declining 5.8% from the prior-year quarter. However, the company generated total sales of $22,766 million, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $22,463 million for the fourth quarter in a row, and increasing 10% from the prior-year quarter (read: Target's Q4 Earnings Miss, Sales Beat Estimates).It was a rise in cost of sales and higher SG&A expenses that weighted on the company’s bottom line. Target’s SG&A expenses rate was 18.5% in the fourth quarter compared with 17.5% in 2016. SG&A expenses were primarily pushed up by higher compensation costs, which included both an increase in incentives of team members and an impact of investments in store member hours and wage rates. However, even higher sales could not act as a savior and Target’s shares plunged 5% in late trading on Mar 6.Surviving the Amazon OnslaughtOne of the key areas where Target is spending a lot is online order delivery. This is definitely in a bid to push into e-commerce and compete with Amazon. Moreover, Target also intends to invest further in 2018 in order to stay in the race. Amazon, on the other hand, has been constantly making smart moves both in the online and offline retail space.Over the last few years, Amazon.com (AMZN  -  Free Report) has redefined the retail space and the online and offline gap is fast disappearing. In doing so, it is giving stiff competition to all retail behemoths that include the likes of Dollar Tree (DLTR  -  Free Report), Dollar General (DG  -  Free Report) and Walmart (WMT  -  Free Report). And much like other retail giants, Target’s bid to compete with Amazon is affecting its profits.The company recently announced that it would be offering free, two-hour delivery from Whole Foods stores to its Prime members in four cities. The move came within a year of the e-commerce giant’s $13.7-billion acquisition of supermarket chain Whole Foods. While Target and other retail behemoths like Walmart, Dollar Tree and Dollar General are trying to push into e-commerce, Amazon is fast capturing the offline space too (read: Will Amazon's 2-Hour Whole Foods Delivery Skew Retail Pitch?).Target’s Extensive Expansion PlansTarget’s earnings may have raised concern among investors but the retail gaint seems confident about making a turnaround. Target announced Tuesday at its annual investor conference in Minneapolis that it will raise hourly minimum wage from $11 to $12 this spring and expects it to reach $15 by 2020. The American job market has heated up in recent times and Target’s move is a response to a tighter labor market. The company has also announced plans of expanding Drive Up to almost a thousand stores in the United States by end 2018. Drive Up allows customers to place online orders using the Target app brought out to their cars by a store team member, minutes after arriving.Moreover, Target, in order to compete with Amazon, will also be starting a free, two-day shipping service for hundreds of thousands of items on Target.com, with a $35 minimum threshold unless a shopper has a Target credit card. The company’s decision last year to add muscle to its delivery wing by acquiring Shipt will help it to manage costs as it launches its free-shipping initiatives.The company will also expand Restock, its next-day essentials delivery service, to around 40 markets. Naturally, the company is leaving no stone unturned to stay in the race.Shares of Target have gained 18.2% in the last three months. Target has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.All’s Not Lost for TargetIt goes without saying that Target has been performing well amid stiff competition. Investors might feel a shade jittery after the company missed on earnings but the stock has enough potential given that both its online and in-store sales have risen. Moreover, Target looks sure of making a turnaround and has massive expansion plans that include increasing minimum wages as well as investment in shipping and drive up delivery services across the country.Breaking News: Cryptocurrencies Now Bigger than Visa The total market cap of all cryptos recently surpassed $700 billion – more than a 3,800% increase in the previous 12 months. They’re now bigger than Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and even Visa!

Shares of Caterpillar (CAT  -  Free Report) declined 2.5%, while Boeing (BA  -  Free Report) fell 1.5%.The tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 68.56 points, after closing at a record high on Wednesday, led by a rally in tech stocks. However, tech stocks weighed heavy on markets on Thursday after the Supreme Court ruled that states can collect sales tax from e-commerce companies that do not have a physical presence in their states.This saw shares of e-commerce companies tumbling, with Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) and eBay (EBAY  -  Free Report) declining, 1.3% and 3.2%, respectively.

Fears further escalated this week after President Donald Trump threatened to slap additional 10% tariffs on $200 billion worth in Chinese goods. Consequently, China too said that it will take retaliatory measures. This saw stocks tumbling, which continued on Thursday, as investors panicked leading to huge selloffs.Supreme Court Makes it Difficult for Online RetailersOn Thursday, the Supreme Court in a ruling said that states could collect sales tax from online retailers, who do not have physical presence in their states. Till the ruling, retailers were required to collect sales tax only if they had a physical presence in a state. This gave e-commerce companies the advantage of not collecting sales tax thus making the product cheaper. This resulted in states making huge losses in revenues.The new ruling now enables states to force online retailers to pay sales tax. This saw shares of online retailers like Amazon, E-Bay and Etsy, Inc. (ETSY  -  Free Report) taking a hit, while shares of brick-and-mortal stores like Walmart (WMT  -  Free Report), Target (TGT  -  Free Report) and Dollar General (DG  -  Free Report) jumping.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?

3083,TGT,"The Supreme Court on Jun 21 ruled that states have the right to collect sales tax from online purchases even if a company doesn’t have any physical presence in that state. This certainly is a game-changing decision given that businesses, primarily online retailers, so long were not bound to collect sales tax in states where they do not operate physically.The Supreme Court ruling has been cheered by brick-and-mortar stores, which have been struggling to survive the e-commerce onslaught. That said, many online retailers are already collecting sales tax on their products in different states. Given this scenario, it needs to be seen, how big a pinch e-commerce companies would feel now.Online Retail Hits RoadblockThe Supreme Court on Thursday ruled that states can collect sales tax on online purchases, overturning a 1992 decision that traditional retailers so long complained was putting them at disadvantageous position compared with online competitors. Although retailers with a physical presence were required to collect sales tax, it wasn’t binding on online retailers and upstarts, which would often skip it, thus making their products look cheaper.The latest ruling definitely will bring relief for brick-and-mortar stores, which are striving to compete with e-commerce companies. The new ruling saw shares of traditional retailers jump immediately. Shares of Walmart, Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report) and Dollar General Corporation (DG  -  Free Report) increased 0.7% each, while Target Corporation (TGT  -  Free Report) jumped 1%.On the other hand and quite predictably, shares of online retailers like Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report), eBay, Inc. (EBAY  -  Free Report) and Etsy, Inc. (ETSY  -  Free Report) slid 1.1%, 3.2% and 0.6%, respectively. Amazon has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Amazon is Still SafeAmazon took advantage of the law for years and refrained from collecting sales tax on its book sales and then other products for years. This made the company’s products look cheaper and was one of the key factors behind turning the fortunes of the company, which is now an e-commerce behemoth.However, Amazon started collecting sales tax in all states since Apr 2017. Hence, it might not pinch the company much. That said, more than 50% of Amazon’s sales are from third party marketplace sellers, who often don’t collect sales tax. This is one area which might hurt Amazon, as with sales tax, the price of the products is likely to increase.Other Online Retailers to Feel the HeatAmazon may have started collecting sales tax but it’s the other small and medium-size online retailers that have been pushed to an uncomfortable corner with the new ruling. Companies like eBay, Etsy and Wayfair Inc. (W  -  Free Report) will now need to collect sales tax on the products they sell, which they so long had been avoiding.Online furniture company, Wayfair, saw its shares fall 1.6% immediately after the ruling was passed. Online home furnishing and products retailer Overstock, Inc. (OSTK  -  Free Report) saw its shares plummeting as much as 7.2%, while Shopify Inc. (SHOP  -  Free Report) declined 4.5%. Understandably, the new ruling is likely to affect small and medium sized online retailers more, particularly those with no physical presence at all, as they had so long been giving stiff competition to brick-and-mortar stores by charging less for their products.Level-Playing Ground for Traditional Retailers  Brick-and-mortar stores have been long ruing that an absence of sales tax on online sales put them at a disadvantage. However, the new ruling will definitely give them a level playing ground. Moreover, traditional retailers like Walmart, Target and The Kroger Company (KR  -  Free Report) that are increasingly shifting focus toward online, collect sales tax for products sold online.However, much like Amazon, they too don’t collect sales tax on goods sold by third parties on their platform. That said, online sales still make for a very small portion of the revenues for most traditional retailers. Walmart gets generates only 3% of its revenues online in the United States.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?

3084,TGT,"A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Target Corporation (TGT  -  Free Report). Shares have added about 5.9% in that time frame.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is TGT due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Target Misses Q1 Earnings Estimates, Beats SalesTarget Corporation posted second straight quarter of negative earnings surprise, when it reported first-quarter fiscal 2018 results. The company posted adjusted earnings of $1.32 per share that not only missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.38 but also came below the mid-point of the earlier provided guidance range of $1.25-$1.45 per share.However, we can’t ignore the fact that the bottom line improved 9.4% from the prior-year period. This year-over-year growth can be attributable to increased sales and fall in interest expense as well as share repurchase activity that to an extent offset rise in cost of sales and higher SG&A expenses.The company generated total revenue of $16,781 million that came ahead the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $16,529 million for the fifth straight quarter and increased 3.4% from the year-ago quarter. Sales rose 3.5% to $16,556 million, while other revenue declined 1.2% to $225 million.Target is trying all means to rapidly adapt to the changes in the retail ecosystem. The company is deploying resources to enhance omni-channel capacities, come up with new brands, remodel or refurbish stores, and expand same-day delivery options to expedite the shopping process.During the quarter under review, Target concluded 56 remodels, opened 7 new outlets and launched three new brands — Universal Thread in women's denim, apparel and accessories; Umbro in Kids and sporting goods; and Opal House in home, and a successful limited-time partnership with Hunter. The company also introduced Drive-Up service in more than 250 stores and expanded Target Restock nationwide. Courtesy to Shipt, the company also rolled out same-day delivery from more than 700 outlets. The company expect to add Drive-Up service in another 300 stores during the second quarter.Notably, comparable sales for the quarter increased 3% compared with 1.3% decline witnessed in the year-ago period driven by strength seen in home, household essentials and food & beverage. The number of transactions jumped 3.7%, while the average transaction amount decreased 0.6%. Comparable digital channel sales surged 28% and added 1.1 percentage points to comparable sales.Gross margin contracted 20 basis points to 29.8%, while operating margin shriveled 90 basis points to 6.2%. Industry experts believe that incremental investments and rise in costs due to new fulfillment options might have hurt margins.Target’s debit card penetration contracted 10 basis points to 13.5%, while credit card penetration fell 50 basis points to 10.6%. Total REDcard penetration declined to 24.1% from 24.7% in the year-ago quarter.Other Financial DetailsDuring the quarter, Target repurchased shares worth $494 million and paid dividends of $334 million. The company still had about $2.8 billion remaining under its $5 billion share buyback program. The company ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $1,060 million, long-term debt and other borrowings of $11,107 million and shareholders’ investment of $11,158 million.A Glance at the Outlook Management now anticipates second quarter comparable sales to be up in the low to mid single-digit range, while for fiscal 2018 the metric is expected to increase in the low-single digit. Target now envisions second quarter earnings in the band of $1.30-$1.50 and fiscal 2018 earnings between $5.15 and $5.45 per share.Management expects operating margin to contract roughly 40 basis points in the second quarter. The company anticipates interest expense to be $15 million lower in the second quarter.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed an upward trend in fresh estimates. There have been six revisions higher for the current quarterTarget Corporation Price and Consensus  Target Corporation Price and Consensus | Target Corporation QuoteVGM ScoresAt this time, TGT has a nice Growth Score of B, though it is lagging a bit on the momentum front with a C. The stock was also allocated a grade of B on the value side, putting it in the top 40% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of A. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.Based on our scores, the stock is equally suitable for value and growth investors while momentum investors may want to look elsewhere.OutlookEstimates have been trending upward for the stock and the magnitude of these revisions looks promising. Notably, TGT has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.

3085,TGT,"Markets ended lower on Tuesday erasing early gains, after President Donald Trump said that he wasn’t satisfied with the progress of United States-China trade talks. Moreover, Trump also said that the highly awaited summit between the United States and North Korea might not happen at all.Meanwhile, the White House said that in order to get into any fresh nuclear deal with the United States, Iran needs to stop enriching uranium and withdraw support to militant groups in the Middle East.

Trade war fears have been plaguing markets for quite some time now. However, the tension somewhat eased on Monday after two countries took to negotiations to avoid a possible trade war. This saw shares rallying on Monday.The positive sentiment saw markets opening higher on Tuesday. However, the early gains were erased after Trump’s comment, which saw stocks taking a hit once again. Industrial stocks were the worst performer on Tuesday. Shares of Boeing, Caterpillar and United Technologies declined 2.5%, 1.7% and 0.4%, respectively. Boeing has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

This saw shares of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles N.V. (FCAU  -  Free Report), General Motors Company (GM  -  Free Report) and Ford Motor Company (F  -  Free Report) 1.3%, 0.5% and 0.1%, respectively.Geopolitical Tensions With North Korea, Iran Rise AgainUncertainty surrounding the summit with North Korea’s premier Kim Jong Un is also growing. This further heightened on Tuesday after Trump said that the highly anticipated summit might not take place at all. He said, “Whether or not it happens, you'll be knowing pretty soon.” Trump and Kin Jong Un are scheduled to meet in Singapore on June 12. However, his comments on Tuesday, took its toll on markets once again.Meanwhile, on Monday, the White House said that in order to start any fresh deal with the United States, Iran first needs to stop enriching its uranium. Additionally, the country would have to withdraw support from militant groups in the Middle East. Iran immediately rejected the demands, which further raised fears in the minds of investors, making stocks plummet.Stocks That Made HeadlinesTarget Q1 Earnings Miss, Revenues Beat EstimatesTarget Corporation (TGT  -  Free Report) posted second straight quarter of negative earnings surprise, when it reported first-quarter fiscal 2018 results.

3086,TGT,"It seems big retailers are increasingly showing their inclination toward robotics and technology to stay abreast in the retail war. Walmart Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report) is the latest to follow suit by rolling out a robot workforce across 50 of its stores in the United States. The retail giant is testing these robots to check if these are faster and better in handling store inventory than humans.Of course, the likes of Walmart has now introduced what online e-commerce giant Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report) had pioneered years ago but now the race to automate is clearly heating up and the huge investments in robotics companies are paying off. Retail giants like Target Corporation (TGT  -  Free Report) and Lowe’s Companies, Inc. (LOW  -  Free Report) have also been giving their robots a trial run to track inventory at its stores for a while now.Understandably, an increasing number of retailers are testing robots and the idea is to not only manage store inventory more efficiently but also to check if they come at a price cheaper than human labor.Amazon Shows the WayAmazon certainly has changed the entire ballgame in the last few years by bridging the gap between traditional and online retail. The biggest move made by the company in this regard was the $13.7-billion acquisition of Whole Foods in 2017.However, it was Amazon’s acquisition of Kiva Systems in 2012 that was perhaps a more transformative one. Amazon had well-chalked out plans and knew what it would do with this acquisition. The deal gave Amazon an army of robots that could zip through its warehouses, scan inventory, segregate stuff and fulfill shipping requests at rocket speed.By 2014, Kiva was completing the ‘click to ship’ cycle in just 15 minutes compared with the 60-75 minutes required by humans. Since this buyout, Amazon has entered into corporate and academic partnerships to support innovation throughout its robotics’ systems.Amazon now has robots at its fulfillment centers across the world, which is increasingly taking over its shipping activities. Needless to say, Amazon depends a lot on robots for ensuring on-time delivery, customer convenience and saving on costs. This initiative has led other brick-and-mortar retail giants to test robots.Walmart Follows Amazon’s FootstepsWalmart has been going all out to catch up with Amazon. The company has started testing robots in 50 of its stores across the United States. The six-feet-tall robots, built by Bossa Nova Robotics, which resemble vacuum cleaners with sleek, small towers check if the shelves are properly stocked and correctly price tagged. Given their ability to scan shelves at a faster pace than humans, Walmart might find the bots a better choice than human workers, who could be freed up for offering greater customer satisfaction – an area that is of utmost importance to retailers.According to John Crecelius, Walmart’s vice president of innovation, the partnership with Bossa Nova Robotics is not just intended at increasing efficiency inside the store. The idea is to enhance performance and service to customers also.Target and Lowe too have been testing robots in physical stores for handling jobs like scanning shelves. This Zack Rank #3 company uses the robotics service of Simbe Robotics to help scan aisles. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Lowe too has been using the NAVii autonomous robot from Fellow Robots to scans inventories and guide customers to desired products.So robots are not just making customers feel involved, these are clearly showing retailers efforts to save time and costs.Retail MakeoverThe retail space flows with the tide and must adapt to changing tastes and preferences. The flux that was so long felt prominently in products is now showing up in its services. The robots speak volumes when it comes to the revolutionary change in retail. How far these influence their financial performance and to what extent the investments bear fruit should be interesting to watch.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest Strategies It's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6%, and +67.1%. And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon.

3087,TGT,"The U.S. toy industry was taken by surprise when the country’s largest independent toy seller, Toys ""R"" Us filed for bankruptcy in September last year. The company recently confirmed that it is liquidating its entire U.S. operations (735 Toys ""R"" Us and Babies ""R"" Us stores). Liquidation sales started on Mar 23.Toys ""R"" Us failed to keep up with fast changing customer preferences and shift of demand toward alternative entertainment modes like video games, MP3 players, tablets, smartphones and other electronic devices.It simply could not compete on price and shopping convenience with giants like Amazonand Walmart. To make matters worse, the company was burdened with a $5 billion debt load, much of which originated from its 2005 deal to go private. All these developments gradually pushed it toward bankruptcy.Will the Industry Suffer? It will, certainly. With the last major chain fully dedicated to selling toys going out of business, we expect the industry to grow at a much slower pace for quite some time.Big toymakers such as Mattel (MAT  -  Free Report) and Hasbro (HAS  -  Free Report) as well as smaller players like JAKKS Pacific (JAKK  -  Free Report) will be affected as a considerable portion of their revenues were generated from sales to Toys ""R"" Us. Retailers like Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report), Walmart (WMT  -  Free Report) and Target (TGT  -  Free Report) will surely come to their rescue, but the only problem is that they currently don’t have shelf spaces as big as Toys “R” Us.Smaller players will be hit harder because, unlike Toys ""R"" Us, the existing retailers are likely to give preference to established brands in their limited shelf space. Further, Toys ""R"" Us’ exit will hurt innovation in the industry as it was the only major toy seller promoted new products.Last year, the company sold, roughly one-fifth of the toys in the United States, generating more than $11 billion in revenues. According to Jefferies analyst Stephanie Wissink, while 85% to 90% of Toys ""R"" Us' volume would be redistributed by the second half of the year, there’s no surety about the remaining 10 to 15%. This portion of the purchase was incidental and may not shift to other channels.A Death Blow to Hasbro?Well, we hope not. Hasbro has been trying to curb its dependence on Toys “R” Us since the latter’s Chapter 11 filing. It has been testing waters with new distribution methods, developing digital play components and exploring ventures with other industries.The company has diverse retail channels such as dollar stores, drug stores, and big mass market retail. It also has a robust online strategy in place that includes interactive content and virtual immersive experiences.It has a five-year agreement with Paramount to enhance storytelling and content capabilities. The company also invested in Boulder Media, its animation studio, and increased digital capacities to drive sales.Hasbro continues to release Transformers franchise products in all forms of entertainment, including movies, television and digital expressions. Given the company’s several innovative and productive plans for Transformers franchise over the next 10 years, revenues are expected to grow.Moreover, the deal with Walt Disney to manufacture dolls based on Disney Princess stories and characters is expected to boost Hasbro’s top line.We believe that with these initiatives in place, Hasbro is well positioned than others to witness incremental revenues, thus mitigating the impact of Toys ""R"" Us exit.Last year, Hasbro generated 9% of its overall sales from Toys “R” Us and the latter has unpaid bills of $59 million with Hasbro.Hasbro, Inc. Revenue (TTM) Hasbro, Inc. Revenue (TTM) | Hasbro, Inc. QuoteWhat About Mattel?Lack of innovative schemes for brand awareness and brand innovation have been hurting the company’s revenues and point of sale (POS) momentum and the Toys “R” Us bankruptcy has surely compounded its woes.The company has been slow to react to deteriorating sales of its flagship product, Barbie and has hardly taken any measure to reduce reliance on U.S. sales. Mattel saw multiple CEO changes in recent years and lost Disney Princess and Frozen lines to Hasbro.Mattel will be much worse hit than Hasbro as Toys “R” Us handled between 15% and 20% of the company's domestic sales, and 11% of sales globally. Moreover, Toys “R” Us owes more than $135 million to Mattel and chances of recovery are scant.Mattel, Inc. Revenue (TTM) Mattel, Inc. Revenue (TTM) | Mattel, Inc. QuoteMerger in the Cards?Possibilities of a merger cannot be ignored. The impact of Toys “R” Us is strong enough to sustain speculations that Mattel may have to entertain a merger offer from Hasbro.There also remains a strong probability of mergers and acquisitions of smaller toymakers as they are the ones to be more affected by the liquidation. Hasbro, being the world’s largest toymaker, is best positioned to go for an acquisition.To ConcludeHasbro has been one of the early movers to gauge the impacts of Toys “R” Us bankruptcy while Mattel was slow to react. Hasbro has been adapting rapidly to changing market conditions while Mattel has fallen behind. Though the bankruptcy has increased challenges for both companies, we expect that Hasbro’s counter strategies will help it come through unharmed.On the other hand, Mattel is already in big trouble and only a well-planned strategic move (a turnaround or getting acquired) could shore up the company's flagging fortunes.Zacks RankWhile Hasbro carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), Mattel has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

3088,TGT,"Retail is no longer restricted to brick-and-mortar. With the wave of digital transformation hitting the sector, retailers are fast adopting the omni-channel mantra to provide a seamless shopping experience, whether online or in-stores. Consumers now seek more convenience, personalization and speed, and retailers are coming up with ground-breaking ideas to build a loyal customer base. To keep up with the trend, retailers are ready to go the extra mile, undertake strategic partnerships and buyouts as well as make prudent investments. Target Corporation (TGT  -  Free Report) is no exception in this regard.Industry experts believe that though Target is in its nascent stage with respect to digital initiatives when compared to bellwethers Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) and Walmart (WMT  -  Free Report), it is firing on all cylinders to gain a better place in the competitive and dynamic retail landscape. The company is deploying resources to enhance omni-channel capacities, come up with new brands, remodel or refurbish stores, and expand same-day delivery options. To sum it up, the company has been aggressively adopting strategies to enhance the shopping experience through miscellaneous channels.Target Gets Act Together  Target announced a number of initiatives as part of its multiyear strategy. This includes a free two-day shipping on items purchased on Target.com on a minimum spending of $35, or on payment via REDcard. Drive Up, an app-based service, is another initiative to expedite the shopping process. The service is currently available at 50 stores, allowing customers to place orders using the Target app and have them delivered to their cars. The company intends to expand the service to 1,000 stores by the end of this year.This merchandise retailer plans to expand delivery service for customers' in-store purchases to all New York stores and four new cities — Boston, Chicago, San Francisco and Washington, DC — this year. The orders will be delivered either to their home or office on the same day for a flat fee.Target has also made a concerted effort on the same-day delivery front by acquiring Internet-based grocery delivery service Shipt. The company intends to expand the service to majority of stores by 2018 holiday season. At present, the service is available at more than 440 outlets across the Southeast and the Twin Cities. The company will provide same-day delivery of groceries, essentials, home, electronics as well as other products.Further, it plans to extend Target Restock program to more than 30 new cities. The program allows customers to restock their shipping box with essential items online and get them delivered at the door step by the next business day for a nominal charge. Further, in order to improve supply chain and expand delivery capabilities, the company has acquired Grand Junction.Target continues to lay emphasis on developing smaller format stores to tap densely populated urban regions and space-crunched cities. Majority of the company’s planned opening of 30 stores this year will be in small format. The company also plans to remodel more than 300 in fiscal 2018, significantly up from about 110 remodeled last year. Further, in line with its peers, the company has been introducing exclusive brands. Recently, it launched Universal Thread, a lifestyle brand for women, and intends to unveil Opalhouse, an eclectic home collection, in April.Wrapping UpTarget, which shares space with Costco (COST  -  Free Report), is committed to make a capital investment to the tune of more than $3 billion this year. Analysts pointed that incremental investments may weigh on margins to an extent and in turn the bottom line. However, it is better to face short-term impediments in order to attain the long-term goals. Target is trying all means to fast adapt to the altering retail environment.Management laid out these strategies following the company’s fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results, wherein adjusted earnings of $1.37 per share missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a couple of cents and declined 5.8% from the prior-year quarter. However, total sales of $22,766 million surpassed the consensus mark of $22,463 million for the fourth straight quarter, and rose 10% from the year-ago quarter. Notably, comparable digital channel sales increased 29% during the quarter.Following the results, shares of Target declined roughly 4.5% during the trading session on Mar 6.  Nevertheless, we believe these initiatives are likely to bolster Target’s performance and cushion the stock. In the past three months, shares of this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company have rallied 17%, outperforming the industry’s growth of 5.6%.

They’re now bigger than Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and even Visa! The new asset class may expand even more rapidly in 2018 as new investors continue pouring in and Wall Street becomes increasingly involved.Zacks has just named 4 companies that enable investors to take advantage of the explosive growth of cryptocurrencies via the stock market.Click here to access these stocks>>

3090,TGT,"The potential decline of the grocery industry, thanks in part to Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) and other e-commerce-based delivery services, has been heavily speculated about recently. Traditional grocery chains and big-box giants have, however, fought back.Industry bellwethers Walmart (WMT  -  Free Report) and Target (TGT  -  Free Report) committed to improve their online sales and delivery capabilities. Grocery power Kroger (KR) also set out to revamp its business model to better compete going forward, including partnering with delivery service Instacart.All of this is good news for wholesale sellers, with more competition being the name of the game for them. One such industry wholesaler, United Natural Foods (UNFI  -  Free Report), is just days away from reporting its second-quarter fiscal 2018 results, and investors will want to know how the company is expected to perform during these more modern grocery wars.The natural and organic food distributor, which boats 90,000 SKUs, is expected see its quarterly sales climb by nearly 7% to reach $2.45 billion, according to our consensus estimate.United Natural Foods is also projected to see its quarterly earnings hit $0.53 per share, which would mark 6% growth from the year-ago period. Still, investors need to consider a few more metrics to understand if the company is poised to top this estimate.Luckily, Zacks Premium customers can utilize the Earnings ESP Screener in order to search for stocks that are expected to beat. Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst estimates.This is done because, generally speaking, when an analyst posts an estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.A positive Earnings ESP paired with a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better ranking helps us feel confident about the potential for an earnings beat. In fact, our 10-year backtest has revealed that this methodology has accurately produced a positive surprise 70% of the time.United Natural Foodscurrently has an Earnings ESP of 5.33%, which means earnings estimates have been higher directly ahead of UNFI’s Q2 results. When paired with the company’s current Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) standing, investors should consider the stock as one that could be poised to top estimates.Investors should also note that United Natural Foodshas topped or matched earnings estimates in seven of the last eight quarters.United Natural Foods is set to report its Q2 fiscal 2018 earnings results after market close on Thursday, March 8.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

3091,TGT,"Shares of Target (TGT  -  Free Report) slipped over 5% on Tuesday morning after the company reported fourth-quarter earnings that fell short of analyst expectations, with growth initiatives placing a significant strain on its bottom line.The fourth quarter was not all bad for Target, which also posted solid revenue growth and strong e-commerce sales in the important holiday quarter. Nevertheless, these results come two weeks after one of its biggest competitors, Walmart (WMT  -  Free Report), posted Q4 figures that made many investors similarly cautious.Both retail powers continue to face pressure from e-commerce players like Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report). This encroachment from online sellers have forced both Target and Walmart to make much-needed improvements recently—changes that could prove to be more beneficial in the long run.But for now, these investments are coming at a cost. Which of these two companies fared better? Let’s take a closer look.Earnings and Revenues Target posted adjusted Q4 earnings of $1.37 per share, which fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate by two cents. This also marked a year-over-year profit decline of nearly 6%. The company noted that its bottom line was hurt by pressure from digital fulfillments costs, along with higher compensation costs.The Minneapolis-based retailer’s total sales surged 10% to $22.77 billion, topping our estimate of $22.46 billion (also read: Target's Q4 Earnings Miss, Sales Beat Estimates).Meanwhile, Walmart posted adjusted fourth-quarter earnings of $1.33 per share, which also fell short of our estimate of $1.36. The company’s revenues climbed 4.1% to hit $136.27 billion, coming in above our estimate of nearly $135 billion.Sales Growth Target noted that strong traffic growth both in stores and online led to a 3.6% jump in Q4 comparable-store sales. The retailer posted healthy comps growth across all five merchandising areas, including fashion and home furnishings.Target’s overall customer traffic climbed by 3.2% in the quarter, driven by both online and traditional retail shoppers. Investors should also note that Target’s Q4 comparable digital channel revenues—a figure that will be closely watched from now on—surged 29% from the year-ago period.Walmart’s comparable U.S. sales increased by 2.6% in the quarter, while same-store traffic rose by 1.6%. The big-box giant’s e-commerce sales grew 23%, which marked a huge drop off from the 50% year-over-year growth Walmart achieved in the trailing three periods.GuidanceLooking ahead to the first quarter of fiscal 2018, Target currently expects to post earnings between $1.25 per share and $1.45 per share. The high end of that projection comes in above our current consensus estimate of $1.40 per share.For the coming fiscal year, Target expects to post EPS in the range of $5.15 to $5.45. Our current consensus estimate calls for $5.28 per share. Target also expects to post low-single digit comps growth.Walmart expects to post comps growth of at least 2% at U.S. stores in 2018. The company projects it will report full-year earnings between $4.75 per share and $5.00 per share. Our current consensus estimate calls for earnings of $4.96 per share. Walmart also expects to post e-commerce sales growth of 40% in its current fiscal year, after posting a 44% full-year jump in 2017.Bottom LineTarget and Walmart have focused on bolstering their e-commerce platforms and delivery capabilities in a race to modernize their businesses. Both firms have also added to their fashion and home décor offerings, and chosen to improve current retail locations in favor of new wide-scale openings.Walmart is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), while Target is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). But both retailers seem poised to charge into 2018 ready to take on Amazon and expand their businesses with eyes on the future, making both look like solid picks going forward.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

3092,TGT,"Retailers capped a healthy holiday-shopping season last year as Americans continued to spend at stores at a steady clip. Spending increased at both online and bricks-and-mortar stores and restaurants, and was largely fueled by low unemployment level, rise in income and more confident consumers. Such factors will further drive retailers in the upcoming year.In fact, spending can get a kick from the $1.5-trillion package of tax cuts approved by the Republican-controlled U.S. Congress and signed into law by President Trump last month. These massive tax cuts will drive household income and in turn increase the propensity to consume. This calls for investors to cash in on the hottest retailers right away.December Retail Sales RiseHouseholds bought a range of goods in December, helping retail sales increase for four straight months. Retail sales rose 0.4% last month and figures for the prior month were revised higher as per the Commerce Department. Retail sales for last month also rose 5.4% from a year ago. In 2017, such sales advanced 4.2% compared to 3.2% in 2016.The so-called core retail sales went up 0.3% last month following an upwardly revised 1.4% gain in November. Sales were supported by a jump in receipts at gardening and building material stores, and furniture-store. There was an uptick in sales at auto dealerships, restaurants and bars as well. Notably, sales picked up at Internet retailers. Sales at online retailers gained 1.2%. In fact, online players made a significant headway throughout last year, mostly led by Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report).Bulk E-Commerce Sales From AmazonAmazon accounted for 44% of online sales in 2017. But, it only adds up to 4% of total retail sales. Such a crazy number now makes analysts believe that they are in a position to acquire Target Corporation (TGT  -  Free Report) this year.Despite many efforts by traditional brick-and-mortar retailers to get the bigger piece of the action, Amazon continues to dominate. The company’s strength in the e-commerce segment can be attributed to innovation in delivery and logistics, broadening of its product selection, device strategy, international expansion and the Prime membership program.Holiday Retail Sales Rise at Best Pace Since 2011Retailers, in the meanwhile, enjoyed some extra Christmas cheer. According to the National Retail Federation, U.S. year-end holiday retail sales during November and December increased 5.5% compared with the same period last year. NRF President and CEO Matthew Shay added that “whether shoppers shopped in-store, online or on their phones, consumers were in the mood to spend, and retailers were there to offer them good value for their money.”Some of the largest jumps were seen in electronics and appliances. The segment climbed 7.5% and registered the strongest growth in the last 10 years. Home furniture and furnishings grew 5.1% and so did home improvement. Department stores and specialty apparel saw moderate gains, which is quite encouraging given the recent store closings. The jewelry segment also gained 5.9%, primarily driven by last-minute sales.Factors Driving the SurgeStronger employment and higher confidence led consumers to spend more during the holidays. Jobless rate remaining at an ultra-low level of 4.1% lifted consumer confidence to a 17-year high set in November.Workers’ pay has also increased 2.5% from December 2016 to December 2017, up from 2.4% in the prior month. The National Employment Law Project, in fact, showed that minimum wage is poised to increase in 18 states and around 20 cities in the United States. This will reach employee wage closer to $15 an hour, which is known as “living wage.”5 Solid PicksGiven the aforesaid positives, investing in sound retail stocks seems judicious.

3093,TGT,"Retail is no more constrained to the four walls of its brick-&-mortar existence. Instead it is rapidly accepting the concepts of an increasingly digitized world as advancing technology and digital transformation are playing key roles in evolving consumer shopping patterns. Consumers now prefer to shop online from the comfort of their homes rather than hopping from one store to another.Indeed, technology is reshaping retailers’ today and tomorrow. Retailers are fast embracing the omni-channel mantra to provide a seamless shopping experience, whether in stores or online or through smartphones via apps. They are allocating capital toward developing a multi-channel growth strategy, IT infrastructure, fulfillment centers and enterprise-wide inventory management system.But will technology alone help retailers survive Amazon’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) growing dominance in the ultra-competitive environment or will they combine forces to bolster their position.Is Consolidation the Path?Be it department stores, discount retailers, supermarket chains or grocery players, all are in the race of survival of the fittest. So is consolidation the next path retailers may prefer to tread to thwart Amazon’s omnipresence? Market pundits believe that with a whopping market cap of more than $700 billion, technological prowess and outstanding consumer reach Amazon looks invincible in the near term. But left with no choice retailers may prefer to walk the tightrope hand in hand.Last Friday (Mar 23), market was abuzz with news of possible merger talks between Target (TGT  -  Free Report) and Kroger (KR  -  Free Report). Per Fast Company report, both the companies are discussing a probable partnership and are taking forward the talks initiated last summer. Shares of both these Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) companies went up during Friday’s pre-marketing trading session. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.However, there was no official comment from both the parties on the subject. Instead, later a CNBC report surfaced that denied any merger discussion but suggested Kroger may be in talks to partner with Target’s online grocery platform, Shipt. Nevertheless, analysts believe that if they choose to combine, Kroger could benefit from Target's e-commerce capabilities and merchandise assortments, while the latter could further strengthen its grocery business.Target and Kroger generated $71.9 billion and $122.7 billion in sales, respectively, during fiscal 2017.Notably, Target is leaving no stone unturned to gain a prominent position in the dynamic retail landscape. The company’s recent app-based service, Drive Up, allows customers to place orders using the Target app and have them delivered to the comfort of their cars. Further, its Target Restock program is also gaining traction.Meanwhile, Kroger is strengthening its relationship with customers via both digital and mobile channels. The company is looking to expand its “Scan, Bag, Pay & Go and Self-CheckOut” program — piloted at 20 stores — to nearly 400 locations in 2018. Further, Ralphs — a unit of grocery giant — in partnership with Instacart is offering home delivery at select locations. Kroger remains optimistic about the acquisitions of Vitacost.com, an online retailer of vitamins and health-oriented products.Wrapping UpFor sure, Amazon is aggressively making headway into retail space be it grocery, books, clothes and accessories or electronics, you name it and you have it. With its compelling pricing strategy and the buyout of Whole Foods — that shook the entire grocery industry of roughly $800 billion where Walmart (WMT  -  Free Report) holds a prominent position — the e-commerce juggernaut has caused a tectonic shift in the retail landscape.Analysts viewed this $13.7 billion mammoth acquisition as an amalgamation between online marketplace and physical stores that could bring a massive change in the retail industry. Industry experts believe that rather than perishing, retailers with more or less same business line would prefer joining hands.5 Medical Stocks to Buy NowZacks names 5 companies poised to ride a medical breakthrough that is targeting cures for leukemia, AIDS, muscular dystrophy, hemophilia, and other conditions.New products in this field are already generating substantial revenue and even more wondrous treatments are in the pipeline.

3094,TGT,"Shares of Signet Jewelers Limited (SIG  -  Free Report) lost sheen in the index and declined roughly 6.9% yesterday, following lackluster performance this holiday season and soft fiscal 2018 guidance. The company’s dismal holiday sales results were primarily due to negative effect of the credit outsourcing transition and weakness at UK Jewelry division. Further, challenging retail landscape, aggressive promotional strategies and waning mall traffic were the other reasons behind lower-than-expected results.Signet’s total sales for the nine-week period ended Dec 30, 2017, decreased 3.1% to $1,881.7 million from $1,940.9 million in the prior year, while same store sales fell 5.3%. On a constant currency basis, total sales dropped 3.9%. However, e-commerce sales in the holiday season surged 47.7% to $210.5 million from the year-ago period. Sharp increase in e-commerce sales were primarily driven by R2Net buyout. During the holiday season, the company raised digital marketing expenditure by 35%, compared with prior year spending of 29%.Same store sales across Sterling Jewelers division and UK Jewelry division fell 8.5% and 10.3%, respectively. However, same store sales at Zale division rose 4%.This holiday season performance was more or less similar to that of 2016, where total sales decreased 5.1% and same store sales declined 4.6% in the nine-week period ended Dec 31, 2016.The dismal results compelled management to adopt a more conservative view. Signet now expects fiscal 2018 earnings (excluding the impact of U.S. tax reform) in the range of $6.17-$6.22, compared with the prior guidance of $6.10-$6.50. Moreover, earnings (including the impact of U.S. tax reform) are estimated to be in range of $6.45-$6.50. Meanwhile, the company continues to expect same store sales to decline by mid-single digits.Apart from Signet, other retailers such as Urban Outfitters (URBN  -  Free Report) and Kohl’s Corp. (KSS  -  Free Report) registered sales growth of 3.6% and 6.9%, respectively, during the November-December period, while both J. C. Penney (JCP  -  Free Report) and Target (TGT  -  Free Report) recorded comparable store sales growth of 3.4%.Bottom LineSignet’s dull holiday season and subsequent tightening of guidance has hurt investor sentiment and it would not be a surprise if shares slide further in the coming days. In a year, shares of this Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) company have plunged 36.4%, against the industry’s growth of 9.3%.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

3095,TGT,"The New Year has been dominated by cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology, with unlikely companies such as Kodak  jumping on the bandwagon after announcing its new KODAKCoin and KODAKOne platform.Just ten days into 2018, retail powers have also fared well.

According to Reuters, a potential deal could be announced as early as this week.SS&C is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). The firm is also currently trading at a respectable 19.23x earnings, which marks a major discount compared to the “Computer - Software” industry average.On top of that, SS&C’s cash flow growth rate of 42.54% crushes its industry’s average and could help facilitate moves such as the company’s current DST acquisition talks. Looking ahead, the company’s full-year 2017 earnings are projected to jump 17.68% and hit $1.93 per share, based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimates.2.       Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (ISRG  -  Free Report)Intuitive Surgical stock hit a new 52-week high of $425.71 per share after the company saw its stock price pop over 6% on Wednesday. The movement comes after the robotic-assisted surgical equipment firm announced strong preliminary fourth quarter and full-year 2017 results. Intuitive now expects to post Q4 revenues of $892 million, which would mark an 18% year-over-year jump.The company is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and earned a “B” grade for Growth in our Style Scores system. Our current Zacks Consensus Estimates call for Intuitive’s 2017 earnings to hit $8.71 per share, which would mark a nearly 17% climb from the year-ago period. On top of that, the company’s current cash flow growth rate of 19.82% crushes the “Medical – Instruments” industry’s 4.32% average and could help Intuitive continue to innovate going forward.3.       Brighthouse Financial, Inc. (BHF  -  Free Report)This provider of annuities and life insurance established by MetLife (MET) saw its stock price jump over 4.50%. Brighthouse’s climb comes just days after MetLife announced the launch of two insurance-based investment companies for start-up companies: MetLife Digital Ventures and MetLife Digital Accelerator.Brighthouse is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and rocks an overall “A” VGM score, supported by an “A” grade for Value and “B” grades for Growth and Momentum in our Style Scores system. The company is currently trading at 6.41x earnings, which is almost a 50% discount compared to its industry’s average. On top of that, Brighthouse’s 0.53 P/B ratio falls well below the “Insurance – Life Insurance” industry average. Looking ahead to 2018, the company’s full-year EPS is projected to skyrocket 538% to reach $9.63 per share, based on current Zacks Consensus Estimates.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

3096,TGT,"Shares of several major U.S. retail chains surged on Wednesday, including Sears , Macy’s (M  -  Free Report), Kohl’s (KSS  -  Free Report) and Target (TGT  -  Free Report).SearsSears saw its stock price jump 5.4% before the opening bell on Wednesday after the struggling department store announced that it raised $100 million in new financing. On top of that, the company said that it is still looking for another $200 million in financing. Sears’ CFO Rob Riecker noted that the new loan ""demonstrates that we continue to have options to finance our business.""However, the company is still struggling to fight its way back after comparable-store sales fell roughly 16% during the first two months of the fourth quarter. Shares of Sears currently hover up around 4.47% on the day.Macy’s Shares of fellow once-mighty retailer Macy’s popped more than 2.70% as investors continue to be impressed by the company’s solid holiday shopping season. Last week, Macy’s announced that comparable store sales gained 1% in November and December.“Macy’s had a solid holiday shopping season, and we are pleased that our November/December performance resulted in positive comp sales for the period, setting us up for a positive fourth quarter… We intend to close the fourth quarter in a good position and head into 2018 with momentum,” Macy’s CEO Jeff Gennette said in a statement.Investors might also be pleased to note that the company remains committed to cutting costs. This includes the planned closure of 11 stores in early 2018, along with streamlining some “non-store functions.”Kohl’s Kohl’s stock climbed over 2% as investors seem pleased with the department store’s holiday sales growth. On Monday, the company reported that total and comparable November and December revenues jumped nearly 7% year-over-year.The company noted that both online and in-store sales popped.  “All lines of business and all regions reported positive comp sales.

The company now expects to post full-year EPS in the range of $4.10 to $4.20, up from its previous guidance of $3.72 to $3.92.Target Shares of Target climbed over 3.20% as they inch near their 52-week high after the company reported that its holiday sales rose 3.4% from the year-ago period. This year-over-year jump was driven in large part by an increase in digital sales.Target now expects to grow its digital sales by 25% in 2017. The retail giant also projects that Q4 comparable sales will jump around 3.4%, while full-year 2017 comps are expected to rise by over 1%.

3098,TGT,"The reflection of GameStop Corp.’s (GME  -  Free Report) robust holiday sales results was not visible in the stock performances. Shares of this Grapevine, TX-based plunged more than 11% on Jan 12. Market experts pointed that the company’s updated fiscal 2017 earnings view came below analyst expectations giving investors cold feet.The dismal run in the bourses led the stock to decline 4.8% in a month, against the industry’s growth of 7.7%.Let’s Take a Close LookThe company generated total global sales of $2.77 billion for the nine-week holiday period ended December 30, 2017, up 10.6% year over year. Comps increased 11.8%, reflecting a gain of 13.7% in the United States as well as 7.9% internationally. Management pointed that sturdy holiday performance was driven by rise in sales of Nintendo Switch and Xbox One X. Moreover, collectibles business was also strong during the period.New hardware sales jumped 38.8% due to robust demand for the Nintendo Switch as well as Xbox One X. New video game software sales rose 7.3% primarily due to Activision’s Call of Duty: WWII and Nintendo Switch titles. Pre-owned sales fell 8.1%, while video games accessories sales advanced 33.7%.Now let’s take a look at non-physical gaming business performance during the holiday period. Collectibles sales surged 19.1% to $211.3 million on account of robust performances across apparel and toys. However, Technology Brands revenues declined 18.6% due to shortage of iPhone 10 supply and AT&T changes to compensation structure in 2017. However, digital sales and non-GAAP digital receipts surged 36.7% and 6.7%, respectively.OutlookManagement stated that given the product category sales mix during the festive season, it now anticipates adjusted earnings per share for fiscal 2017 near the middle of its earlier provided guidance range of $3.10-$3.40.

3099,TGT,"Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report) hogged limelight yesterday, courtesy of its two recent announcements. The big-box retailer surprised employees with plans to increase entry level wage rate for U.S. hourly workers to $11, alongside offering additional benefits to eligible candidates. On the other hand, Wal-Mart’s Sam’s Club unit revealed that it will shut 63 of its 660 outlets in the United States over the next few weeks — a move that will result in several job losses. Though the wage hike reflects the impact of Trump’s recent tax reforms, we believe that Wal-Mart had to adopt this competitive strategy amid a tightening labor scenario. With the U.S. unemployment level at its 17-year low, retailers are bound to increase wages to attract workers. In fact, one of Wal-Mart’s biggest competitors, Target (TGT  -  Free Report) had raised its minimum hourly wage to $11 toward the end of 2017, with plans to step it up to $15 by 2020.Thus, it looks like Wal-Mart (which last hiked wages in 2015) is taking efforts to match up to its rivals, with the task having become easier courtesy of the tax overhaul.  Moving to its plans to shut Sam’s Club locations, the move followed a strategic business review by the company. While the store closings form part of the company’s efforts to better align locations and lead to an improved Sam’s Club foothold, the closures may benefit major competitors like Costco (COST  -  Free Report).Notably, both Target and Costco saw investors rejoice following this supermarket giant’s latest developments, with their shares up 4.6% and 2.1%, respectively. On the contrary, Wal-Mart’s stock didn’t react much to the news. Nevertheless, the retailer’s constant efforts to counter Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) and its splendid past record have helped it rally 50.9% over a year, crushing the industry’s 40.3% upside. That said, let’s delve deeper into the announcements and see if they can spur further growth.The Wage Hike & MoreApart from raising all hourly workers’ minimum wage rate, the world’s largest retailer unveiled plans to extend benefits from maternity and parental leaves and also offer a one-time cash bonus (up to $1,000) to employees. The increased wage, which will come into effect from Feb 17, is incremental to the previously planned wage hikes. Also, it will be applicable to Wal-Mart’s all U.S. associates working in stores, logistics, e-commerce, Sam’s Club and Home Office.The one-time bonus will be decided depending on the employee’s tenure with Wal-Mart, with those working for 20 years or more entitled to receive $1,000. However, the company will record a discrete one-time charge related to these bonuses. Additionally, the company revealed intentions to financially support workers going for child adoption, by providing them a total of $5,000 per child to be used for various purposes.The aforementioned changes, which are likely to be gainful for the company’s more than a million hourly workers, were largely encouraged by the reduced corporate tax rate. Management stated that though it is yet to assess the overall implications of the tax reforms on the company, it remains committed toward investing the tax savings for the betterment of customer and employees, alongside undertaking business growth plans.Sam’s Club Shuts 63 Stores: What’s Ahead?Per some sources, some of Sam’s Club planned store closures have already taken place, without any notice to employees. Nonetheless, management stated that it remains focused on relocating as many employees possible to other Wal-Mart or Sam’s Club locations. Also, it will support the affected employees with the aforementioned one-time bonus, salary for two months and other compensation for the eligible workers.The company further stated that the move of shutting down 63 Sam’s Club stores forms part of its planned transformation toward a healthier business. In fact, management stated that out of the stores impacted, up to 12 will be converted to e-commerce fulfillment centers, which will accelerate deliveries of online orders. Thus, this mark yet another e-commerce initiative undertaken by the company which is exploiting every nook and cranny to combat Amazon’s rising dominance. Evidently, Sam’s Club’s e-commerce sales positively impacted its comps by approximately 80 basis points in the third quarter of fiscal 2018, wherein Wal-Mart’s U.S. e-commerce sales surged 50%.All said, we expect the latest developments to add new leaves to the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s growth story. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Zacks Editor-in-Chief Goes """"All In"""" on This Stock Full disclosure, Kevin Matras now has more of his own money in one particular stock than in any other.

3100,TGT,"Shares of Target (TGT  -  Free Report) hit a new 52-week high on Thursday, the same day that rival Walmart (WMT  -  Free Report) announced it would raise its starting hourly wages to $11 an hour. Walmart’s move comes amid a tightening U.S. labor market as competition for employees heats up.Target bumped its minimum rate up to $11 in late September. The Minneapolis-based retailer, which is one of Walmart’s largest competitors, also pledged to increase its minimum hourly wage to $15 by the end of 2020. Prior to the 2017 increase, Target’s last substantial wage increase occurred in 2016, when the company boosted starting rates to $10 an hour.Walmart’s move to match Target’s minimum wage comes in the wake of the U.S. unemployment rate hitting 4.1% in December. This rate, which remained constant during the last three months of 2017 according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, marks the lowest unemployment rate within the last 10 years.Furthermore, the unemployment rate for African-Americans reached 6.8% in December, the lowest point since the Bureau of Labor Statistics began tracking the figure in January 1972. On top of that, minimum wage increases took effect in 18 states earlier this year.Walmart’s attempt to become a more attractive place for workers also coincides with its war against online retail juggernaut Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report).But Walmart also cited the Republican tax overhaul—which is expected to greatly benefit retailers—as a major reason for the company’s ability to boost workers’ wages.“As you know, the President and Congress have approved a lower business tax rate. Given these changes, we have an opportunity to accelerate a few pieces of our investment plan,” CEO Doug McMillon wrote in a statement on Thursday.“We plan to continue investing in you, in our customers through lower prices, and in our future--especially in technology to help improve your jobs and the experience for our customers.”Along with the boost to minimum wages, Walmart announced that it increased its paid leave policy in order to provide full-time hourly associates with 10 weeks of paid maternity leave and six weeks of paid parental leave. Walmart also announced that it would pay a one-time bonus up to $1,000, following in the footsteps AT&T (T  -  Free Report) and Comcast (CMCSA  -  Free Report).Walmart noted that these changes to its salary structure would add $300 million to annual expenses, while the bonuses are set to cost $400 million. Walmart’s average hourly wage for full-time U.S. store employees will increase to around $14.50 an hour from $13.85 an hour.Target and Walmart both pay far above the federal minimum wage, which has remained at $7.25 an hour since 2009. Walmart’s jump to $11 an hour is set to begin in February for all Walmart U.S., Sam’s Club, Supply Chain, eCommerce, and Home Office hourly associates.After the announcement, shares of Walmart experienced marginal gains and closed at just over $2 below their all-time high. Shares of Target surged over 4.60% to close at a new 52-week high of $74 per share.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

3101,TGT,"Retailers are getting smarter with the game-changing technologies and are ready to adopt any innovations that keep them ahead of the curve. To be more precise retailers are thinking of tomorrow. With the wave of digital transformation sweeping the sector, they are fast embracing the omni-channel mantra to provide a seamless shopping experience, whether in stores or online or through smartphones via apps.Consumer shopping patterns have certainly evolved over the past. The consumers now seek more convenience, personalization and speed, and retailers are coming up with ground-breaking ideas to build a loyal customer base. Retailers are also looking for third-party solutions to fulfill the demand of customers and using social media platforms to advertise their brands, launch products and campaigns.Retailers nowadays try to keep track of individual customers and analyze their purchasing behavior, type of products they search and other requirements. Let’s check out how retailers are metamorphosing in the evolving marketplace.Walmart’s Game PlanWalmart (WMT  -  Free Report) has been taking greater strides to counter the growing dominance of Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report), which has been aggressively making headway into retail space be it grocery, books, clothes and accessories or electronics. With its compelling pricing strategy and the buyout of Whole Foods, the e-commerce giant has caused a tectonic shift in the retail landscape. Moreover, through Prime membership program it is trying to build a loyal customer base and provide them lucrative deals, same-day delivery options and others. Further, its new cashless grocery store, Amazon Go, allows customer to scan, shop and go without stopping at the cash counter.Coming to Walmart, the company has succeeded in giving itself a complete makeover by moving beyond a mere brick-&-mortar presence. This is well-evident from its constant initiatives — including buyouts, alliances, and improved delivery and payment systems.Evidently, Walmart’s buyouts of Bonobos, ShoeBuy, Moosejaw, ModCloth and Jet.com underscore its quest to build an impressive digital brand portfolio. Its Walmart Pay mobile payment system, and Mobile Express Returns program further highlight its focus on accelerating online business along with making shopping easier and faster. Further to fortify position in online grocery business, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company acquired a delivery start-up Parcel, Inc., which specializes in same-day delivery.Target Gets Its Act Together  Target (TGT  -  Free Report) is leaving no stone unturned to gain a prominent position in the dynamic retail landscape. The company’s recent app-based service, Drive Up, allows customers to place orders using the Target app and have them delivered to their cars. This Zacks Rank #3 company has also made a concerted effort on the same-day delivery front by acquiring Internet-based grocery delivery service Shipt. The company intends to expand the service to majority of stores by 2018 holiday season.Further, it plans to extend Target Restock program to more than 30 new cities. The program allows customers to restock their shipping box with essential items online and get them delivered at the door step by the next business day for a nominal charge. Further, in order to improve supply chain and expand delivery capabilities, the company has acquired Grand Junction.Kroger’s Counter StrategyKroger (KR) is strengthening its relationship with customers via both digital and mobile channels, introducing digital coupons, and order online, pick up in store initiative. Moreover, it is gradually rolling out a new technology called Kroger Edge that gives information about price and nutritional value of products, identifies a specific brand a customer is looking for and produce relevant digital coupons. The company in collaboration with Chase Pay is offering mobile payments in select markets.The company is looking to expand its “Scan, Bag, Pay & Go and Self-CheckOut” program — piloted at 20 stores — to nearly 400 locations in 2018. Further, Ralphs — a unit of grocery giant — in partnership with Instacart is offering home delivery at select locations in Southern California. Kroger remains optimistic about the acquisitions of Vitacost.com, an online retailer of vitamins and health-oriented products. This Zacks Rank #3 company has opened 1,000th ClickList store.Macy's Sharpening EdgeMacy's (M  -  Free Report) has been taking strategic initiatives to adapt to the ongoing changes in the industry. The company has added a new feature to its mobile app called Mobile Checkout, which allows customers to scan bar codes of items and pay via smartphones. After the completion of the transaction, customers will have to head toward Mobile Checkout counters, wherein an associate will check the purchased items and remove the security tags.Additionally, Macy’s is in the process of launching an advanced reality shopping experience to sell furniture. Through this platform customers will likely be able to virtually place the furniture in their room to see how it fits before the purchase.In an attempt to increase sales, the company has been taking steps such as integration of operations as well as developing e-commerce business and online order fulfillment centers. The company had introduced various innovative services including Apple Pay, Same Day Delivery, Macy’s Image Search and Macy’s Wallet/Bloomingdale’s Wallet. This Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company’s “Buy Online Pickup in Store” initiative is also gaining traction.

3102,TGT,"It looks like Walmart Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report) is unraveling a new card every day to sharpen its competitive flair against Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report). The officially omni-channel retailer, which has become overtly popular for undertaking constant e-commerce strategies, is also trying all means to give consumers new reasons to visit its stores. Evidently, sources revealed that the company inked a deal with FedEx’s (FDX  -  Free Report) subsidiary, FedEx Office – which will add about 500 new FedEx Office locations inside certain Walmart stores over the next two years.The agreement, which was unveiled at yesterday’s ShopTalk conference, followed the successful conclusion of a pilot program undertaken by both companies. Incidentally, Walmart and FedEx Office already tested this setup across six states that covered 47 locations such as North Carolina, South Carolina, Texas and Colorado, among others.Per media reports, the pilot program was quite impressive, as many customers visiting FedEx Offices within Walmart also ended up shopping from the latter – thus boosting the big box retailer’s store sales. Hence, we believe that this deal is likely to augment Walmart’s business by easing consumers’ shopping even further. By adding services like packaging, printing and shipping to its already wide range of products and services, Walmart is likely to emerge even stronger as a one-stop-shop for customers.Notably, the inclusion of FedEx Office stores within Walmart will also allow customers to process returns in a convenient way. Customers can send their packages to be kept at any Walmart-based FedEx Office store for up to five working days – either directly or through FedEx Delivery Manager. While Walmart and FedEx were already allies for shipping, this store within store expansion is likely to mitigate certain pressures associated with last mile deliveries, which has become a raging issue among retailers. Walmart Well Placed in the Retail GameIncidentally, major bellwethers like Target (TGT  -  Free Report) and Kroger (KR  -  Free Report), among others are also making incessant efforts in the delivery space, to stay firm in an Amazon-dominated world. This is partly clear from Target’s buyout of Shipt and Kroger’s contract with Instacart, to support seamless deliveries. Moving back to Walmart, the company is leaving no stone unturned to expand in the delivery and e-commerce space.In order to facilitate delivery, Walmart acquired a delivery startup Parcel, Inc., which is a last-mile delivery service and specializes in same-day delivery for perishable and non-perishable products. Other than this, the company’s Walmart Pickup program enables customers to place orders online and then pick them up at a store for free. In other developments, Walmart also partnered with ride hailing services Uber and Lyft for speedy online grocery deliveries. Further, the company continues to test same-day and next-day delivery to enhance its services further.While these factors and Walmart’s numerous acquisitions and alliances tell the tale of its e-commerce development, the company is also committed toward its stores business. In fact, earlier this week itself, there was a lot of buzz about the expansion of Walmart’s alliance with household services provider – Handy. Well, sources revealed that Walmart is extending its agreement with Handy, which will let customers hire helpers at about 2,000 Walmart stores to install or assemble their purchases of television and furniture.   Such strategies have been driving this supermarket giant, which has surged nearly 28.2% in a year, surpassing the industry’s rise of 21.2%. We believe that with such robust endeavors rolled up in its sleeve, Walmart is likely to keep its stellar record intact. Also, with strength across both stores and e-commerce, the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company is likely to remain well-placed against Amazon.

3103,TGT,"The retail war is intensifying with the focus gradually shifting toward minimum delivery time of your groceries. In February, Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report) started offering two-hour Whole Foods delivery to its Prime members. And now Walmart Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report), Target Corporation (TGT  -  Free Report) and The Kroger Co. (KR  -  Free Report) are following suit with same-day delivery services.Almost all retail giants are pumping in more money and either acquiring or partnering with delivery service companies for same-day delivery to stay ahead in the race. With changing shopping habits, retailers are bent on minimizing the time between the actual placement of an order and its delivery. Needless to say, the gap between online and offline retail is fast disappearing and it’s only a matter of time when others jump the bandwagon.Amazon Shows the Way for Same-Day Delivery Amazon set the ball rolling by playing to its strength — a strong delivery wing — when it started offering free-two-hour delivery service from Whole Food stores to its Prime members in February. The move came within a year of the e-commerce giant’s $13.7-billion acquisition of supermarket chain Whole Foods that stocks a wide range of fresh produce, meat, seafood, flowers and other items (read: Will Amazon's 2-Hour Whole Foods Delivery Skew Retail Pitch?).It goes without saying that Amazon has been a pioneer in minimizing the gap between online and offline retail space. The company is pulling items from Whole Foods stores, packing them and getting the goods delivered by its own drivers. Moreover, it is all free and within two hours. This move is in a bid to explore and add novelty to the untapped online groceries market, and the Whole Foods acquisition was a giant leap toward this direction.Naturally, the idea is to lure more customers on the convenience quotient and the two-hour delivery service has certainly given Amazon enough power to compete with brick-and-mortar giants like Walmart, Target, Kroger, Dollar General (DG  -  Free Report) and Dollar Tree (DLTR  -  Free Report). Understandably, same-day delivery is the need of the hour and Amazon’s recent initiative has not only made its rivals sit up and think, but also gear up for an ensuing battle.Walmart Fights BackBrick-and-mortar giants like Walmart, Kroger and Target, which so long, in order to compete with Amazon, were stressing on increased investments in e-commerce, have perhaps realized that bridging the online and offline gap is the ideal way to compete. So, most of these companies are busy reallocating their investments to add muscle to their delivery service wing. Walmart recently announced that it will be expanding its delivery service to 100 metropolitan areas by the end of 2018, with orders fulfilled at more than 800 stores across the country and delivered to shoppers contracted through Deliv, Uber and other delivery contractors. Moreover, customers who order a minimum of $30 and pay a delivery fee of $9.95 will get their purchases delivered in four hours provided they order by 1 p.m. This definitely is a challenge to Amazon.Interestingly, Walmart’s e-commerce sales growth in the United States slowed to 23% in the fourth quarter, marking a sharp decline from 50% in the prior quarter. This is being viewed as a setback for investors. However, Walmart is hopeful of registering 40% growth in online sales this year, as it has plans of investing extensively in e-commerce, which is expected to drive organic sales by 40% in fiscal 2019. Walmart has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Kroger, Target Expand Same-Day DeliveryTarget too isn’t lagging. In December 2017, the company announced plans of acquiring grocery delivery service Shipt for $550 billion and using its technology platform to expand same-day delivery at Target Stores. And come Mar 29, Target and Shipt will start same-day delivery of more than 55,000 groceries and home goods, toys, electronics and other products in Baltimore and Washington. The company also expects to make same-day delivery available from most Target stores before 2018 end and for products in all of its major categories by the end of 2019.Much like Walmart and Target, Kroger too will be expanding its partnership with same-day grocery delivery service Instacart to offer home delivery from 55 central Ohio Kroger locations. The company currently offers home delivery in 45 markets, with Instacart partnering in 27 of those markets. Also, Kroger has plans of offering delivery in 100 markets by the end of 2018.In ConclusionNo doubt, Amazon has taken the retail landscape to a different level altogether with minimum delivery time and others following suit. According to NPD Group, about 7% of U.S. households bought groceries online last year. Among them, most prefer their orders delivered to their doors, while the rest pick up from the store. This certainly emerged as an area of prime importance for most retailers and major players are going all out to tap this same-day delivery service space.Moreover, according to Nielsen and the Food Marketing Institute, although only 23% of consumers in the United States buy groceries online, the next five-seven years is expected to see a whopping 70% preferring the same. So it may well be assumed that the same-day delivery space will heat up pretty soon.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

3104,TGT,"With Walmart Inc.’s (WMT  -  Free Report) latest move to expand online grocery delivery services to more than 100 metro regions in the United Sates, there seems to be no stopping for this retail giant from bolstering grocery sales. The announcement follows the recent launches of various kitchen products and meal kits. Walmart is undoubtedly cashing in on every possible opportunity to strengthen foothold in the grocery space and ramp up delivery services.Boosting Grocery Delivery ServicesThe expansion strategy will enable Walmart to reach nearly 40% of the nation’s household, by the end of this year. Currently, this service is available in six markets. The initiative is expected to provide consumers with more accessibility to Walmart’s flourishing online grocery delivery services.Speaking of delivery services, Walmart’s efforts to enrich consumers’ experiences by providing easy shopping methods and seamless deliveries are quite praiseworthy. In fact Walmart’s warehouse unit — Sam’s Club — partnered with Instacart for providing same-day delivery services and improve sales of food products and everyday essentials. In earlier developments, the company acquired a delivery startup — Parcel, Inc. — which is a last-mile delivery service and specializes in same-day delivery for perishable and non-perishable products. Also, the company has been testing same-day deliveries with Deliv for quite some time.Further, Walmart’s grocery pickup services have been highly appreciated by customers, giving them the flexibility to order products on the go. With plans of adding close to 1000 stores by this year for providing such facilities, the company’s pickup services are expected to receive quite a boost. Moreover, the recent kitchen product launches, including a wide variety of meal-kits, are expected to benefit from improved delivery services.With such strong endeavors to bolster its position in the delivery services arena, Walmart seems to be striking the right chords when it comes to competing with big box retailers and more particularly with Amazon.com (AMZN  -  Free Report). In fact, similar ventures were also undertaken by Target (TGT  -  Free Report) and Kroger (KR  -  Free Report), which indicates widespread popularity for grocery delivery services.More Growth in Store?Notably, Walmart’s consistent efforts to accelerate online business resonate well with consumers’ fast-paced lifestyle. Apart from bolstering delivery services, the company has been taking several other e-commerce initiatives, including buyouts, alliances and improved payment systems to strengthen online operations. Additionally, the company is expanding its apparel offerings and has launched an online platform for furniture and home décor products. In fact, such relentless endeavors have aided Walmart’s U.S. e-commerce sales to soar 23% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018. Encouragingly, management expects U.S. e-commerce sales to soar nearly 40% year over year in fiscal 2019.Moreover, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s strategies to continue augmenting its business size and operations have been raising investor’s optimism. Shares of the company have surged almost 25.1% over the past year compared with the industry’s rally of 19.4%.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Wrapping it up, the company’s ongoing strategies of expanding online services and achieving all-around growth strengthens its presence in the retail space.

3105,TGT,"SUPERVALU INC.’s (SVU  -  Free Report) dedicated endeavors to strengthen wholesale business and omni-channel operations along with efforts to turn around retail business have been impressing investors, lately. In the past month, shares of this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company have gained 6.5% against the industry’s decline of 0.1%. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Wholesale Business Strategies Boost PerformanceSUPERVALU’s Wholesale business has been one of its prime growth catalysts. The company derives a major portion of its revenues from this segment. Notably, sales from this segment grew 52% year over year in third-quarter fiscal 2018, contributing roughly 73% to the company’s total revenues.Given the importance of its wholesale operations, SUPERVALU consistently undertakes measures to sustain the segments’ growth momentum. Accordingly, the company has been striving to develop the segment’s operations by adding customers alongside retaining and developing business with existing ones. Acquisitions have also been favoring the Wholesale segment’s operations for a while. In this regard, the company completed the buyout of Associated Grocers of Florida in the beginning of the fourth quarter, which along with efficient integration of Unified Grocers underscore its focus on solidifying the Wholesale business. Notably, Unified Grocers contributed sales of about $860 million to SUPERVALU’s Wholesale business during the third quarter. The company is on track to generate targeted synergies from this buyout. Apart from this, SUPERVALU has supply agreements with retailers like Fresh Market Inc. and America’s Food Basket, which is expected to fuel sales growth in this segment. Efforts to Boost Omni-channel Performance SUPERVALU also strives toward improving omni-channel capabilities to resonate with the evolving consumer trends. In this respect, the company is on track to upgrade its website and mobile applications to enhance consumer shopping experiences. The company has also teamed with Instacart for providing same-day grocery delivery services. Additionally, the company signed a multi-year contract with Instacart to launch refreshed e-commerce sites and offer integrated store coupons and loyalty rewards.  Such developments strengthen SUPERVALU’s position in the grocery segment against the e-commerce king, Amazon.com (AMZN  -  Free Report) and other large retailers such as Walmart (WMT  -  Free Report) and Target (TGT  -  Free Report), which are constantly developing their omni-channel offerings.Organic Foods: A Viable Growth Platform  SUPERVALU strives to improve business effectiveness by focusing more on prospective business areas. Notably, organic food products are becoming increasingly popular owing to rising health consciousness amongst consumers. Thus, the company has been evaluating the growth prospects in the organic foods arena and has partnered with its wholesale merchants to explore opportunities in this category. Further, we expect the company to undertake vital steps to emerge strongly in this category.Efforts to Revive Retail Segment PerformanceSUPERVALU’s sluggish performance in the retail segment has been a hurdle for the company for long. Well, the segment has been grappling with issues such as price competition, competitive store openings and intense promotions. Driven by these factors, the segment has been witnessing decline in identical store sales for the past 11 quarters.However, the company has put into place several strategies to achieve a turnaround in this segment. These include innovations, greater focus on private brands and the addition of fresh departments. The company intends to boost sales through price investments and promotions along with efforts to improve merchandise displays and offerings. Incidentally, the company has been steadily progressing with its Quick'n Easy meal solutions across a number of fresh product offerings including seafood and meat. The company concentrates on augmenting stores performance by curtailing inventory shrinkages, and making capital investments toward store openings, relocations and refurbishments. We expect that such well-chalked endeavors will bear a positive impact upon the retail segment’s performance in the long run.Wrapping it UpWe applaud SUPERVALU’s progress with its Wholesale business and efforts undertaken to meet consumer’s evolving needs, especially in the e-commerce and organic foods realm. The company’s efforts to achieve a turnaround in the retail segment are also encouraging. Marching with such potential strategies rolled up in its sleeves, we expect SUPERVALU to continue sustaining in investors’ good books.Zacks Top 10 Stocks for 2018In addition to the stocks discussed above, would you like to know about our 10 finest buy-and-hold tickers for the entirety of 2018?Last year's 2017 Zacks Top 10 Stocks portfolio produced double-digit winners, including FMC Corp. and VMware which racked up stellar gains of +67.9% and +61%.

3107,TGT,"Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report) hogs the limelight again. The company seems to have set fire to the world of online retail, with its rigorous steps to counter Amazon’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) growing dominance.  Well, rounds were made yesterday that the world’s largest retailer is in advanced talks to buy a considerable minority stake in India’s leading e-commerce destination, Flipkart — Amazon’s biggest rival in India.Incidentally, sources revealed that Wal-Mart could acquire about 15-20% stake in Flipkart, targeting an investment of about $750 million-$1 billion. While both Wal-Mart and Flipkart didn’t confirm the news, we believe that the news itself is an alarm for Amazon, which has long been trying to match up to Flipkart’s market share in India.Can Stake in Flipkart be a Game Changer?While Wal-Mart already operates in India under 21 wholesale stores, its ability to establish its own brick-and-mortar stores gets restricted by the huge costs associated with setting up stores in a nation like India, alongside certain limitations on foreign ownership for multi-brand retailers. Thus, if this deal materializes, it is likely to strengthen Wal-Mart’s position against Amazon, by helping it leverage the large market Flipkart caters to.On the flip side, investment from Wal-Mart will benefit Bengaluru-based Flipkart by helping it boost its grocery business. Flipkart, which sells almost everything ranging from cosmetics to electronics, has been concentrating on the food and grocery space — another venture already exploited by Amazon. At such a juncture, investment from Wal-Mart is likely to be a perfect choice, given its growing experience in the space.That said, it looks like Wal-Mart and Flipkart are joining forces against the e-commerce king Amazon.As for Wal-Mart, this retail biggie has explored every nook and cranny to combat Amazon’s growing dominance. In fact, it hasn’t even been a week since this big-box retailer announced plans to foray the e-book market and expand its online grocery services to Japan, though a strategic partnership with Japanese e-commerce firm, Rakuten Inc.Prior to this, rounds were made in December 2017  that this supermarket giant started selling meal-kits online — a card already played by Amazon previously. Further, the big-box retailer has taken several e-commerce initiatives, including buyouts, alliances, and improved delivery and payment systems. Out of all its e-commerce initiatives to stand strong against Amazon, Wal-Mart’s speedy expansion in the booming online grocery space steals the show.These splendid endeavors have helped this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company put up a robust past record, driving its shares 62.7% in a year, faring even better than the industry’s rise of 51.7%. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. In fact, Wal-Mart is not the only retail which is taking incessant strides to stay firm in the Amazon-dominated retail world. Retail behemoths like Target (TGT  -  Free Report), Kroger (KR  -  Free Report) and Kohl’s among many others are also undertaking several efforts to make the most of the evolving shopping trends. Coming back to Wal-Mart, investment in Flipkart will likely be one of its most tactful moves to take on Amazon and aptly justify its plan of emerging from Wal-Mart Stores to Walmart.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of All                 Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce """"the world's first trillionaires,"""" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.

3108,TGT,"Several industry headwinds, many of which were sparked by Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) and the rise of e-commerce, forced brick-and-mortar retailers like Nordstrom (JWN  -  Free Report) and Target (TGT  -  Free Report) to adapt their businesses in order to survive.These moves have caused some investors to stay away from retailers in recent years. However, like any industry or stock, there are no guarantees in retail. Investors must always focus on the stock’s current fundamentals in order to gauge its possible performance.For example, Gap (GPS  -  Free Report) is expected to see its sales climb by 5.45% to $4.67 billion in the fourth quarter, which includes the crucial holiday shopping period. But top-line growth for an established company such as Gap is not enough to excite investors on its own.The retailer is also projected to see its quarterly earnings hit $0.59 per share, up more than 15% year over year. Yet, investors will need to see more in order to know if they should expect Gap to actually top this solid EPS estimate.Luckily, Zacks Premium customers can utilize the Earnings ESP Screener in order to search for stocks that are expected to beat. Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst estimates.This is done because, generally speaking, when an analyst posts an estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.A positive Earnings ESP paired with a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better ranking helps us feel confident about the potential for an earnings beat. In fact, our 10-year backtest has revealed that this methodology has accurately produced a positive surprise 70% of the time.Gap is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and sports an “A” grade for Value in our Style Scores system. Coupled with its Earnings ESP of 0.15%, which means earnings estimates have been higher directly ahead of Gap’s Q4 results, investors should consider the stock as one that could beat earnings estimates.Investors should also note that Gap has topped or matched earnings estimates in the trailing 12 quarters, including beats of 5.45%, 11.54%, and 24.14% over the last three periods, respectivelyGap is set to report its Q4 and fiscal 2017 earnings results after market close on Thursday, March 1.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

3109,TGT,"Following a number of initiatives to ramp up grocery sales, Walmart Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report) is now eyeing to strengthen its foothold in the apparel space. The world’s largest retailer’s latest move comprises the launch of four apparel brands that will hit stores from Mar 1 onward. With exclusive brand lines for men, women and kids fashion, the company is all set for the spring season in style.Expanding Apparel Category Through LaunchesWalmart is striking the right chords when it comes to competing with big box retailers and more particularly with Amazon.com (AMZN  -  Free Report). Retailers like Target (TGT  -  Free Report) and Amazon have already been investing heavily in the apparel space. With recent brand launches, Walmart is expected to solidify its position in the apparel category.The new apparel brands — Time and Tru, Terra & Sky, Wonder Nation and George — promise on delivering fresh fashion, quality and comfort at affordable rates. Apparel and other accessory products of these brands will be available at Walmart stores and on Walmart.com. Moreover, the company has partnered with Elizabeth Stewart, a renowned celebrity stylist, for launching the new line-up of brands.Apart from signature styles and trending designs, Walmart’s apparel brands will be showcased at its stores with a whole new look. Store upgrades will include improved signage featuring inspiring photographs to help customers’ better coordinate styles. Additionally, stores will be provided with increased floor space for better visibility and revamped fitting rooms. While Walmart has been taking numerous strides to progress in the e-commerce realm, the aforementioned moves indicate the company’s efforts to enhance store experience. This highlights its focus on evolving as an omnichannel retailer.Notably, the company’s efforts to consolidate and strengthen apparel and accessories category is evident from its acquisitions of Modcloth, Bonobos, Shoebuy and Moosejaw as well as partnership with Lord & Taylor. With such effective strategies, Walmart seems well prepared to attract shoppers to its fashion department at its stores and e-commerce business and build an impressive brand portfolio.  Other Strides Toward GrowthIn addition to expanding in the apparel space, Walmart has also been undertaking aggressive measures to achieve growth in the booming online grocery arena. In fact, to better meet consumers changing shopping preferences, Walmart has been improving grocery delivery services. Recently, the company’s warehouse unit — Sam’s Club — teamed up with Instacart. Apart from this, the company has launched a new online platform for furniture and home décor products to strengthen e-commerce business. Also, Walmart has been actively improving its digital offering through efficient payment systems and checkout processes.Notably, Walmart’s consistent efforts to accelerate online business resonates well with consumers’ fast-paced lifestyle and reinforces its position amid other retailers like Kohl’s (KSS  -  Free Report), which are also progressing strongly with their online business.Wrapping it up, such strategic endeavors have aided this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company to emerge as a preferred pick for investors. Shares of Walmart have soared almost 30% over the past year compared with the industry’s rally of 25.5%. Further, we expect that the company’s dedicated efforts to achieve all-round growth will raise investors’ optimism.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

3110,TGT,"Holiday season and retail are synonymous, and with festive season almost over, it’s time to analyze the retailers’ performance. Notably, retailers stay on their toes during this busiest part of the year, flooding the market with offers and promotions. They sweep buyers off their feet with early-hour store openings, huge discounts, promotional strategies, and free shipping on online purchases. Since the season accounts for a sizeable chunk of yearly revenues and profits, retailers grab every opportunity to drive footfall.Best Holiday Sales Since 2011The holiday season was the best in few years, as cash registers at stores jingled as much as online channels, letting the retailers rejoice. According to MasterCard SpendingPulse, sales (excluding automobiles) during the November/December period jumped 4.9% compared with 3.7% rise in the prior-year period. This marks the biggest year-over-year increase in holiday spending since 2011.Per report, sales of electronics and appliances, jewelry, and home furnishings rose 7.5%, 5.9% and 5.1%, respectively. Meanwhile, specialty apparel as well as department stores witnessed “moderate” sales increase. The data by MasterCard SpendingPulse fared better than the National Retail Federation (“NRF”) projection of 3.6-4% rise in November and December sales (excluding autos, gas and restaurant sales) and eMarketer forecasts 3.1% jump in holiday sales.Retailers’ ScorecardDiscount Retailers — Target & CostcoThe two major discount retailers Costco Wholesale Corporation (COST  -  Free Report) and Target Corporation (TGT  -  Free Report) impressed investors with stellar comparable sales performance. Target reported comparable sales growth of 3.4% for the November and December period driven by robust traffic growth and unrelenting strength in digital sales. Following, robust comps performance this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company raised fourth quarter and fiscal 2017 earnings guidance. The company now expects fourth-quarter earnings per share in the band of $1.30 to $1.40, up from the prior guided range of $1.05 to $1.25. For the full year, Target anticipates adjusted earnings per share in the range of $4.64 to $4.74, compared with the prior estimate of $4.40 to $4.60.Meanwhile, Costco continued with its solid comparable-store sales (comps) trend in the month of December as well. Comps for five-week ended Dec 31, 2017 increased 11.5%, following an increase of 10.8% in November. We believe that the hike in annual membership fees and higher penetration of Citi Visa co-brand card program are benefiting the company. We are also encouraged by this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s expansion strategy, as it remains committed to opening new clubs and expanding e-commerce capabilities.Departmental Store Retailers — Kohl’s, Macy’s, JC PenneyKohl's Corporation (KSS  -  Free Report) holiday sales numbers were most impressive among the departmental stores retailers. Both comps and total sales advanced 6.9% year over year, for the combined November and December period. Notably, this marks a significant improvement from a 2.1% and 2.7% respective drop in comps and total sales witnessed in the 2016 holiday season. We believe that sustained focus on technology improvements and omni-channel expansion is likely to fuel further growth at Kohl’s. In fact, this Zacks Rank #3 company’s better-than-expected holiday performance and optimistic vision for January encouraged management to raise fiscal 2017 earnings outlook from $3.72-$3.92 to $4.10 to $4.20 per share.Meanwhile, J. C. Penney Company, Inc. (JCP  -  Free Report) reported positive comps this festive season, unlike the prior year. It delivered comps growth of 3.4% for the combined nine weeks period, ending on Dec 30, 2017. Robust comps performance was driven by solid sales at home, beauty and fine jewelry. It was also fueled by this Zacks Rank #3 company’s sturdy e-commerce business that recorded double-digit sales increase year over year.Meanwhile, despite taking a slew of measures to improve performance Macy’s, Inc.’s (M  -  Free Report) holiday sales numbers improved modestly. Comparable sales on an owned plus licensed basis increased 1.1% during November and December period combined, while on an owned basis, the same inched up 1%. Following modest increase in holiday sales, this Zacks Rank # 2 (Buy) company narrowed its sales guidance. The company now expects sales for fiscal 2017 on an owned basis to decline between 2.4% and 2.7%, compared with the prior guided range of decrease by 2.2-3.3%.Apparel Retailers – Lululemon Athletica & Urban OutfittersLululemon Athletica Inc. (LULU  -  Free Report) was also among the retailers that emerged strong this holiday season driven by accelerating trends witnessed across all parts of its businesses. This prompted management to lift its fiscal 2017 guidance. This Zacks Rank #2 company now expects adjusted earnings per share in the band of $1.25-$1.27, up from the earlier guided range of $1.19-$1.22.Urban Outfitters, Inc. (URBN  -  Free Report) disclosed holiday sales numbers, wherein comparable retail segment net sales, including the comparable direct-to-consumer channel, gained 2%. For the month of November and December comparable retail segment net sales rose 1% at Urban Outfitters, 5% at Free People and 2% at the Anthropologie Group. Gain in comparable retail sales were driven by double-digit growth in the direct-to-consumer channel. Despite reporting year-over-year increase in holiday sales, the stock came under pressure primarily due to lower-than-expected comps. In early December, the company in a filing stated that “Thus far during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, comparable Retail segment net sales are mid-single-digit positive”. However, comps for the November and December increased by low-single digit, which gives an indication that the company failed to carry its initial momentum in the latter part of holiday season.However, we believe new store openings, increase in direct penetration, growing wholesale operations and merchandising improvements bode well for the long term. Management is also making all possible efforts to enhance the performance of brands through store refurbishment and by bringing in more compelling assortments. The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 (Strong Buy) Rank stocks here.Wrapping UpFrom the above discussion it is clear that quite a few retailers had a wonderful holiday season. Based on the performance we are quite optimistic about retailers’ fourth-quarter results. Per the Earnings Trends, the total earnings for Retail/Wholesale sector are likely to witness a growth of 3.9% in the fourth quarter, while revenues are estimated to rise 8.4%.Retail/Wholesale, which currently occupies top 19% (3 out of 16) position among the Zacks Classified sectors has surged 34.5% in a year, outperforming the S&P 500 growth of 23.9%. Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

3111,TGT,"Just one week after Walmart (WMT  -  Free Report) posted subdued fourth-quarter ecommerce sales, the big-box retail giant announced that it is set to launch multiple new apparel brands and an online mattress brand.Stylish Announcements  In a move that Walmart hopes will help in its fight against rivals Target (TGT  -  Free Report) and ecommerce powerhouse Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report), the company will debut four new stylish fashion brands, both in stores and online, starting March 1. Walmart’s new “Time and Tru” line is geared towards all women, while “Terra & Sky” is designed for “plus women.”The retailer is also set to sell its first kid-centric brand, “Wonder Nation,” and men’s-focused “George.” Walmart partnered with celebrity stylist Elizabeth Stewart to launch the new brands, with costs expected to range from less than $5 to $30.“We listened to our customers and are proud to deliver apparel choices that meet at the intersection of everything they desire: on-trend styles, comfort and quality, all at unbeatable prices,” SVP of apparel at Walmart U.S., Deanah Baker, said in a statement. “These new brands are a thoughtful reflection of current trends and styles, while considering our customers’ busy, on-the-go lifestyles.”Walmart is also reportedly ready to debut a new digital-only mattresses and bedding brand, Allswell. On top of that, the company announced plans to revamp its online home décor and furniture shopping portal to help customers with design tips. The experience, which is set to roll out over the next few weeks, will kick off the retailer’s larger redesign of Walmart.com.Updated in-store signage with new photography is set to hit stores by March, with plans to upgrade whole apparel departments by fall 2018. Walmart also noted that it will remodel some stores to feature open floor plans and upgraded fitting rooms. These moves come after Walmart’s online Q4 sales—which included the holiday period—grew by only 23% after racking up consecutive quarters of 50% growth. Walmart’s push into more off-priced, fashion-forward apparel and home décor seems to be aimed directly at Target, which became well-known for these offerings.Target introduced new fashion lines for women and men last year. The retailer also introduced more home décor and furniture lines, as well as a home and lifestyle partnership with HGTV stars Chip & Joanna Gaines.More Fundamentals When looking at these moves, it seems investors might want to consider Walmart, especially when factoring in some of the company’s other fundamentals. Walmart is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and sports a “B” grade for Value and an “A” for Growth in our Style Scores system, to help it earn an overall  “A” VGM score.Walmart is projected to see its current quarter earnings jump 13%, while its full year EPS figure is expected to climb nearly 12% to hit $4.94 per share. Investors might also be happy to note that Walmart has earned 12 earnings estimate revisions for its current fiscal year, with 100% agreement to the upside. On top of that, shares of Walmart currently rest nearly 20% below their 52-week high. This means that the stock has plenty of room to climb before it faces the added burden of having to move into a new range.Investors should not discount the possible long-term significance of Walmart’s new stylish push and revamped online sales portal. When paired with the recently acquired Jet.com and brands Bonobos, Modcloth, and Moosejaw—which are not sold through Walmart.com—Walmart seems to have further readied itself to grow in the crowded, shifting retail landscape.Zacks Top 10 Stocks for 2018In addition to the stocks discussed above, would you like to know about our 10 finest buy-and-hold tickers for the entirety of 2018?Last year's 2017 Zacks Top 10 Stocks portfolio produced double-digit winners, including FMC Corp. and VMware which racked up stellar gains of +67.9% and +61%.

3112,TGT,"Last week, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report) suffered its worst day on Wall Street in more than 30 years, with shares plunging 10.2% on a single day after it reported lower-than-expected fourth-quarter results, primarily because of slower e-commerce sales growth.Naturally, investors are concerned but the company is confident of bouncing back by doubling down on its investments in e-commerce and online grocery sales. Moreover, slower e-commerce sales growth was somewhat expected as this was also the first time that Jet.com sales in the year-ago period was included in e-commerce revenues. Hence, the picture isn’t as gloomy as it looks at first glance.Why Walmart Slipped UpThe most eye-catching development was Walmart’s e-commerce sales growth in the United States that slowed to 23% in the fourth quarter, marking a sharp decline from 50% in the prior quarter. This might have been viewed as a setback for investors but it’s too early to draw conclusions.Incidentally, what most people are overlooking is that last year’s results got a big boost because of its acquisition of Jet.com. Moreover, it was expected that growth would slow because Jet.com’s sales in the year-ago period was included in Walmart’s e-commerce revenues for the first time.That said, Walmart is hopeful of registering 40% growth in online sales this year, which should boost investors’ confidence. Moreover, the panic among investors is not a result of Walmart’s slower e-commerce sales growth but because of increasing competition from Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report), which has in the last few years changed the entire retail ballgame by bridging the gap between traditional and online retail. How Amazon Has Changed the Retail GameThe biggest move in the brick-and-mortar space was made by Amazon when it acquired Whole Foods for $13.7 billion in 2017. It slashed the prices of a number of products to enhance its online retail sales, which worked in its favor.The Whole Foods’ acquisition came within a year after Walmart decided to penetrate the e-commerce space with the $3.3 billion acquisition of Jet.com. The acquisition immediately gave Amazon access to Whole Foods’ 450 stores across the United States, thus providing it enough power to compete with brick-and-mortar giants like Walmart, Target (TGT  -  Free Report), Dollar Tree (DLTR  -  Free Report) and Dollar General (DG  -  Free Report). Walmart has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Moreover, Amazon recently announced that it will offer free, two-hour delivery from Whole Foods’ stores to its Prime members in four cities — Austin, Dallas, Cincinnati and Virginia Beach.Amazon certainly has established its dominance in the online retail space but the other players aren’t lagging either. Walmart continues to be the country’s largest grocer and is trying to tap this space by offering customers the option of ordering online and a free pick-up from the store. Target brought online grocery-delivery company Shift to add muscle to it online delivery arm. Interestingly, Walmart’s shares have increased 28.32% in the last year, while that of Target has risen 13.38%. Dollar Tree and Dollar General’s shares have increased 34.25% and 19.85%, respectively, in the last 12 months.Walmart Fights BackBesides registering slower-than-expected e-commerce sales, Walmart also acknowledged a few mistakes it made during the fourth quarter that negatively impacted its sales. One of these was an increase in TVs, toys and electronics in its warehouses that eliminated space for basic items during peak holiday sales.However, it’s not the end of the road for Walmart as it seems on track to boost its online sales. The company has plans of investing extensively in e-commerce this year, which is expected to drive organic sales by 40% in fiscal 2019. Since acquiring Jet.com, Walmart has spruced up its online services and increased the number of available items.Moreover, it has acquired brands such as Bonobos and ModCloth and intends to revamp its website with a focus on fashion. Also, Walmart recently launched a home shopping vertical on its website with a focus on furniture, accessories and other decorative items. The company is also making huge investments in training its employees.Beyond Brick and MortarOne of biggest strategic moves made by the company lately was to do away with “Stores” from its corporate name in order to give an impression to customers that it doesn’t want to restrict itself to a traditional brick and mortar company. Walmarts’ stores, however, give it an edge over Amazon, its biggest competitor. Keeping that in mind, the company is planning to double the locations offering grocery delivery, which is likely to boost sales.The biggest advantage for Walmart is that it is a lot larger than Amazon in terms of revenues. The company’s 2017 sales crossed $500 billion, making it three times bigger than Amazon. Moreover, while Walmart’s stock nosedived last week, it traded at an all-time high with a 12-month gain of more than 60% in late January just before the market entered correction territory.Not the End of the RoadThe sharp decline in the company’s shares might have made investors skeptical but Walmart has a lot of things going in its favor, with the Republican tax cut likely to help retailers save an astounding $175 billion, per the National Retail Federation (NRA). Moreover, the company is confident of registering 40% growth in online sales in fiscal 2019 with huge investments in e-commerce to include a re-launch of its website along with other initiatives.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge. With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research. It's not the one you think.See This Ticker Free >>

3113,TGT,"Target (TGT  -  Free Report), Walmart (WMT  -  Free Report), Nordstrom (JWN  -  Free Report), and countless others retailers have been forced to revamp their business models on the fly to help fend off a wave of online sellers over the past few years. However, at least one retail industry—discount retail—actually seems to be better off these days.There are an array of reasons that off-priced sellers are bucking sector-wide trends, most of which relate directly to the socioeconomic background of their customers and physical retail locations.The discount retail uptick occurred even before the new Republican tax law was passed, but now analysts seem more confident in the sector based on these GOP-related headwinds. J.P. Morgan (JMP  -  Free Report) analysts recently reiterated their “Overweight” rating for Dollar Tree, noting that low-to-middle income households are set to earn substantial monetary benefits this year.Along with more money in the pockets of their consumer base, the retailers themselves are set to see lower effective tax rates going forward.With all of this said, let’s take a look at three discount retail stocks that growth-minded investors might want to consider.1.       Dollar Tree, Inc (DLTR  -  Free Report) Dollar Tree is one of the last true remaining dollar stores and iscurrently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). On top of reiterating the stock’s rating, J.P. Morgan analysts also upped its price target from $120 per share to $133 per share, which represents a 26% upside from Wednesday's closing price.Dollar Tree is expected to see its earnings surge by 36% in the fourth quarter and 27.56% for the year, based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimates. The company also sports an Earnings ESP of 1.95%, which means earnings estimates have been higher directly ahead ofits Q4 report—set for early March.The company has also witnessed nine earnings estimate revisions with 100% agreement to the upside for the coming fiscal year. Looking even further ahead, Dollar Tree is projectedto grow its earnings per share figures at an annualized rate of 14.55% over the next three to five years.2.       Burlington Stores, Inc. (BURL  -  Free Report)Burlington is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and rocks an “A” grade for Growth in our Style Scores system. This off-priced clothing retailer expects to open a total of 37 new stores in fiscal 2017. Burlington is also projected to see its Q4 and full-year revenues climb 16.85% and 32.10%, respectively, when it reports its results on March 1.Furthermore, the retailerhas earned six earnings estimate revisions for fiscal 2018 with 100% agreement to the upside. Investors should also be happy to note that Burlington has met or topped earnings estimates for four straight years, with an average surprise of 15% in the trailing four quarters. Burlington is expected to see its bottom line surge at an annualized rate of 18.65% over the next three to five years.3.       Dollar General Corporation (DG  -  Free Report)The discount retailer is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and sports an overall “A” VGM score. In the third quarter, Dollar General announced its plan to open 900 new stores and remodel 1,00 locations in 2018. DG has received four upward earnings estimate revisions within the last 60 days for its upcoming Q4 results. On top of that, Dollar General’s Earnings ESP of 2.20% means that estimates are coming in higher directly ahead of its fourth-quarter report. Looking ahead to the upcoming fiscal year, the company has earned eight earnings estimate revisions with 100% agreement to the upside.

3114,TGT,"The retail sector has experienced its fair share of volatility over the last year, driven by shifting shopping habits more so than any specific trends in fashion or electronics. This has led many inventors to stay away from the retail industry, but in reality, not all stocks are as susceptible to the online shopping undercut as others.Retail will never be as steady as some sectors, and even industry bellwethers such as Walmart (WMT  -  Free Report) and Target (TGT  -  Free Report) have been forced to restructure their business models in the Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) age. This should make investors consider retail stocks that operate, in large part, outside of the scope of big box chains. But even this alone is not enough.With that said, if investors also focus on retail stocks that are poised to expand their bottom lines while navigating a clearly separate road, they should be able to perform well amid the industry’s recent volatility.Now, let’s take a look at three specialty retail stocks that are projected to see their earnings surge.1.      Canada Goose (GOOS  -  Free Report)This upscale seller of down jackets is expected to see its earnings skyrocket by over 60% this fiscal year to hit $0.53 per share, based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimates. Canada Goose has also received positive earnings estimate revisions with complete upside agreement for its current full year as well as the following fiscal year.Canada Goose is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and sports an “A” grade for Growth in our Style Scores system. Furthermore, the parka power is expected to expand its EPS figures at an annualized rate of 26.15% over the next three to five years, while its high-end coats remain relatively immune from price manipulation online.2.       Five Below, Inc. (FIVE  -  Free Report)Five Below operates in a sector of the retail world that has, for the most part, been able to buck shopping trends hurting the industry as a whole. The discount retail giant, which has opened a ton of new stores recently, is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). FIVE has also witnessed six earnings estimate revisions with 100% agreement to the upside for both its current fiscal and the following year.Our estimates call for Five Below’s current full-year earnings to pop by nearly 40%. Looking even further ahead, the retailer is projectedto grow its earnings per share figures at an annualized rate of 28.67% over the next three to five years.3.       Restoration Hardware Holdings Inc. (RH  -  Free Report)Restoration Hardware has been able to diversify amid these changing retail times and sells industry-leading prestige furniture products. The firm is currently a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and rocks an “A” grade for Growth.RH is expected to reports its Q4 and full-year 2017 results on Thursday, Feb. 22. When it does, the home décor giant is projected to see its full year earnings skyrocket over 132%. This massive bottom-line expansion is expected to carry into 2018 as well. Restoration Hardware is expected to post earnings of $5.35 per share next year, which would mark a nearly 83% year-over-year jump from our current 2017 projections. On top of that, RH is expected to see its bottom-line surge at an annualized rate of 20% over the next three to five years.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +18.8% from 2016 - Q1 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +157.0%, +128.0%, +97.8%, +94.7%, and +90.2% respectively.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - Q1 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 11X over.

3115,TGT,"Proper guidance is often the difference between success and failure in life. The same holds true for the investing world. The need for proper guidance is all the more required now as the Q4 earnings season is just round the corner. This is because investors would look to add stocks to their respective portfolios, which have the potential to surpass earnings expectations in the current reporting cycle. This is because an earnings beat generally leads to stock price appreciation.The task of designing one’s portfolio with outperformers is by no means an easy one. The uncertainties in the investment world make the task a daunting one. Moreover, a deluge of stocks flood the market at any given point in time. In the absence of proper guidance, identifying a winning stock is akin to searching for ‘a needle in a haystack’, for an investor. The proper guidance, in this respect, comes from brokers, who are deemed to be experts, equipped with vast knowledge of investing.Of the three types of brokers/analysts (sell-side, buy-side and independent) present in the investment world, sell-side analysts are most common. Various brokerage firms employ them to provide unbiased opinion to investors after thorough research. Buy-side analysts are employed by hedge funds, mutual funds etc. while the independent ones simply sell their reports to investors.Earnings Estimate Revisions – A Proper GuideBroker ratings are backed by sound logic and are by no means arbitrary. Brokers, not only scrutinize the publicly available financial documents, but also attend company conference calls and other presentations. Naturally, it is in the best interest of investors to pay heed to such well-researched information as they aim to generate maximum returns from their portfolio.Since brokers closely follow the stocks in their coverage, they revise earnings estimates only after carefully examining the pros and cons of an event for the concerned company. In fact, a rating upgrade or downgrade by brokers has the potential to influence the price of the stock.Naturally, when investors see brokers revising their estimates or recommendation on a stock, they often assume that there is something in the stock that has attracted analyst attention. In fact, a rating upgrade generally leads to stock price appreciation. Similarly, the price of a stock may plummet following a rating downgrade.Estimates can move north for a number of reasons – favorable earnings performance, a bullish guidance, product launch or any favorable macro scenario.Framing a Winning Strategy The above write-up clearly suggests that by following broker actions, one can arrive at a winning portfolio of stocks. Keeping this in mind, we have designed a screen to shortlist stocks based on improving analyst recommendation and upward revisions to earnings estimates over the last four weeks.Also, since the price/sales ratio is a strong complementary valuation metric in the presence of analyst information, it has been included. The price/sales ratio takes care of the company’s top line, making the strategy foolproof.Screening Criteria# (Up- Down Rating)/ Total (4 weeks) =Top #75: This gives the list of top 75 companies that have witnessed net upgrades over the last four weeks.% change in Q (1) est. (4 weeks) = Top #10: This gives the top 10 stocks that have witnessed earnings estimate revisions over the past for weeks for the upcoming quarter.To ensure that the strategy is a winning one, covering all bases, we have added the following screening parameters:Price-to-Sales = Bot%10: The lower the ratio the better, companies meeting this criteria are in bottom 10% of our universe of over 7,700 stocks with respect to this ratio.Price greater than 5: A stock trading below $5 will not likely create significant interest for most investors.Average Daily Volume greater than 100,000 shares over the last 20 trading days: Volume has to be significant to ensure that these are easily traded.Market value ($ mil) = Top #3000: This gives us stocks that are the top 3000 if one judges by market capitalization.Com/ADR/Canadian= Com: This takes out the ADR and Canadian stocks.Here are five of the 10 stocks that made it through the screen:Sonic Automotive (SAH  -  Free Report) is one of the leading automotive retailers in the United States.

3116,TGT,"Target Corporation (TGT  -  Free Report) may be next on Amazon’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) buyout list. This is what Loup Venture co-founder Gene Munster predicts, per media reports. The forecast made by the famous tech analyst is enough to shake the retail industry, which has certainly been facing the brunt of heightened online competition, lower footfall and changing consumer spending patterns.Munster highlighted that given “shared demographic and manageable but comprehensive store count” Target remains a perfect choice for Amazon. Munster added that if the acquisition takes place, Amazon may have to shell out $41 billion, which reflects a premium of approximately 15% to Target’s current value. Shares of Target were up 3.7% during the trading session yesterday.If the prediction comes true, this would be Amazon’s second major buyout after Whole Foods, in its quest to become a dominant player in the retail industry. With the acquisition Amazon’s store count would jump to roughly 2,300, including Whole Foods’ approximately 470 stores but will still be lower than Wal-Mart’s (WMT  -  Free Report) mammoth count of more than 11,600 stores. Industry experts believe that the amalgamation between online marketplace and physical stores could bring a massive change in the retail industry going forward.In fact, retail is no more restricted to brick-&-mortar. The scenario has drastically changed with the advancement of technology and digital transformation that are playing key roles. Consumers now prefer to shop online from the comfort of their homes rather than hopping from one store to another. Nevertheless, this transition has persuaded retailers to come up with innovative ways to market products, and Target is no exception to the trend.Well only time will tell, whether Amazon acquires Target. But for now the latter has undertaken strategic endeavors to fast adapt to the ultra-competitive retail environment.How is Target Adapting to the Changing Retail Picture?No wonder Target is trying all means to rapidly adapt to the changes in the retail ecosystem. We believe that initiatives such as the development of omni-channel capacities, diversification and localization of assortments along with emphasis on flexible format stores, bode well. The company intends to deploy resources to significantly develop online platform as well as store facilities to make shopping more convenient for customers. We observed that comparable digital channel sales surged 24% during the third quarter of fiscal 2017 and added 0.8 percentage points to comparable sales.This general merchandise retailer recently launched curbside pickup program, at 50 Twin Cities stores. This program gives customers an option to get ordered items without leaving the comfort of their cars. It has also rolled out Target Restock program that allows customers to restock shipping box with essential items online and get them delivered at door steps by the next business day for a nominal charge. Further, in order to improve supply chain and expand delivery capabilities, the company had acquired Grand Junction.To tap digital sales this holiday season, Target strengthened relationship with Google by allowing customers nationwide to shop through Google Express, including voice-activated shopping. Wal-Mart and Home Depot (HD  -  Free Report) are also using Google's voice-activated shopping platform. Target has also made a concerted effort on the front of same-day delivery services by acquiring internet-based grocery delivery service Shipt for $550 million.Certainly, Target is leaving no stone unturned to attract consumers and attain incremental revenues. We believe that these strategies are likely to bolster the company’s performance and drive the stock further. Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) have increased 15.3% in the past three months, outperforming the industry’s growth of 14%.

3117,TGT,"Looking back at 2018, it would not be incorrect to characterize this year as the one in which brick and mortar retail faced its gravest challenges. Always a formidable online presence, Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report) fired its first offline salvo when it acquired Whole Foods for $13.7 billion. This was possibly a larger symbol of the changes sweeping through the entire brick and mortar retail space.Even as stores shuttered and a swathe of mall closures ensued, industry occupants responded to new challenges through a variety of initiatives. What finally emerged was a new online-offline model, best illustrated by the efforts of Dollar Tree Inc. (DLTR  -  Free Report), Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report) and Target Corporation (TGT  -  Free Report).Wal-Mart's Resounding SuccessWal-Mart owes its huge success in 2017 to its recent and continuing efforts to strategically transform itself to face new challenges. The stock is up 43.6% year to date and shows no signs of slowing its ascent. The iconic retailer also reported stunning third-quarter fiscal 2018 results and raised its bottom-line view for fiscal 2018. Wal-Mart has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.So what exactly did the iconic discount retailer get right? After years of sluggish sales, Wal-Mart got its act together primarily through a two-pronged approach. Firstly, it has invested billions of dollars in technology in order to fortify its e-commerce presence.It has also ramped up its delivery capabilities significantly and invested $2.7 billion in higher wages and training, initiatives which are paying rich dividends. (Read: What Can Target Learn From Wal-Mart's Retail Game?)Target Gets its Act TogetherTarget also reported strong third-quarter results, but shares of the Minneapolis-based company declined 4% in pre-market trading on Nov 15.  This was because the year-over-year decline in the bottom line and management’s comments about a highly competitive environment in the fourth quarter was not well received by investors. But Target made several moves recently that have improved its prospects in a big way. Evidence of these efforts is the 25.1% price gain it has experienced over the last six months, significantly higher than the broader sector’s 15.1% increase over the same period.Firstly, it has decided to introduce flexible format stores in order to increase its presence in densely populated urban locations. Also, it has significantly developed its online platform, aggressively reduced costs and started to showcase more premium products.Recently, it strengthened its grocery delivery capabilities by acquiring grocery delivery company Shipt for $550 million. With Target already offering same-delivery in New York City, the Shipt purchase will only add to Target’s delivery muscle. (Read: Grocery Gunfight: Can Incumbents Fend Off Amazon?)Could Target Have Better Upside Potential?Wal-Mart’s superlative success is well known and it is likely that the stock will enjoy a similar run of gains going forward. But could Target offer investors better upside in the days ahead? A cursory glance at some valuation metrics seems to indicate that this might just be the case.The price to sales ratio is particularly relevant in a consumer focused industry whose fortunes are dictated by the ebb and flow of sales. This ratio indicates the market value of each of the company’s sales dollars.Coming to the two stocks under consideration, both are undervalued compared with the wider industry, which has a P/S ratio of 1.08. However, Wal-Mart is the pricier of the two, since it has a P/S ratio of 0.6, higher than Target’s reading of 0.51.   A more-or-less similar picture emerges when comparing EV/EBITDA ratios. This it is the ideal metric to compare two companies within the same industry. Further, it is not affected by the differing capital structures of the two companies.Coming to the two retailers, both Wal-Mart and Target are undervalued relative to their broader sector. However, Target holds the edge here with an EV/EBITDA value of 6.57, lower than 9.71 for Wal-Mart.In ConclusionWal-Mart’s multiple initiatives have stood the retailer in good stead through 2017 and are likely to help it move even higher next year. Target is yet to catch up, but could offer higher upside in the days ahead, a conclusion borne out by the comparison of more than one valuation metric.  Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +18.8% from 2016 - Q1 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +157.0%, +128.0%, +97.8%, +94.7%, and +90.2% respectively.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon.

3118,TGT,"The holiday season has kicked off with Thanksgiving Day and now it’s time for Black Friday — one of the busiest shopping days of the year. Retailers are splurging on promotions, early-store openings, heavy discounts, as well as free shipping on online purchases to lure customers.According to the National Retail Federation (NRF), more than 164 million Americans are expected to shop both in-store and online during the Thanksgiving weekend (spanning four days — Thanksgiving Day, Black Friday, Small Business Saturday and Sunday). Of them, 70% (115 million) are planning to shop on Black Friday. An improving economy, acceleration in the job market, increasing consumer confidence and high spending power will make Black Friday a huge success  (see: all the Consumer Discretionary ETFs here).Though e-commerce or online shopping has been a key source of sales in recent times, queuing up and camping out for Black Friday has become as much of an American tradition as the feast itself.  What’s Hot?Black Friday sales bonanza both online and in stores is already in full swing as a number of retailers have offered their deals early. We have highlighted some of the best deals from retailers.Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) is ahead of all retailers offering attractive deals across 30 product categories from Thanksgiving Day to Cyber Monday.

3119,TGT,"Black Friday deals can’t come soon enough for many U.S. consumers as the holiday shopping extravaganza continues to grow in popularity. With that said, one day before Thanksgiving, let’s take a look at some consumer spending predictions for this holiday season before the money really starts to flow.Black Friday’s prominence continues to rise. Today, the phrase is associated almost exclusively with long lines and discounts as retail giants such as Macy’s (M  -  Free Report), Target (TGT  -  Free Report), and Walmart (WMT  -  Free Report) promote day after Thanksgiving deals (also read: A Complete History of 'Black Friday').Black Friday, and the current holiday shopping stretch we are in, help boost retailers heavily. In fact, since 2007, retail is the top U.S. equities sector during the week before and after Black Friday, according to a CNBC analysis.But this year, according to the Rakuten Marketing holiday shopping survey, 24% of consumers started their holiday shopping over the summer. July’s Amazon Prime Day (AMZN  -  Free Report) spurred some of this early spending, with 47% of those surveyed by Rakuten reportedly shopping on that day. On top of that, 59% of respondents noted that they started their holiday spending in early fall.In 2017, 75% of consumers noted that they plan to spend the same amount of money or more on their holiday shopping compared to last year. In terms of spending, 43% of Rakuten respondents said they will spend between $100 - $499, while 18% noted they could buy between $1,000 and $1,999 worth of retail goods.Thanksgiving Shopping Details Before we jump into the specific shopping numbers, as a little aside to share with friends and family, the average U.S. family spends roughly $31 a year on Turkey.The average American family spends about $31 per year on turkey. Learn more about American spending habits at https://t.co/9aJ0NMlWUq. #Thanksgiving pic.twitter.com/LwbFSwtAdI— US Labor Department (@USDOL) November 21, 2017An estimated 164 million people plan to shop during Thanksgiving weekend this year, based on a survey conducted by the National Retail Federation and Prosper Insights & Analytics.Based on the NRF survey, Black Friday is expected to be the busiest day of the now-four day shopping barrage, with 70%, or 115 million, shoppers planning to shop the Friday after Thanksgiving.Coming in second is the quickly growing online shopping holiday, Cyber Monday. This year, 78 million people— or 48% of Thanksgiving weekend shoppers—plan to sit at their computers or scroll through their phones to make online purchases.Coming in third is Small Business Saturday, when an estimated 71 million Americans hope to shop—although they are not all set on helping stimulate small businesses specifically. And what might come as a surprise to some is the fact that 32 million people are prepared to shop on Thanksgiving Day.To help explain the motivation behind the 164 million people that expect to shop this holiday weekend, NRF asked respondents to clarify why they plan to shop.Taking advantage of the deals that many stores offer was the number one reason, with 66% of people citing discounts as their primary motivation. On top of that, 26% of people noted that shopping over the Thanksgiving holiday has simply become a tradition.Last year, based on NRF data, 154 million people shopped over the Thanksgiving holiday weekend, which was up from 151 million in 2015. The average shopper spent $289.19 total, which fell by about $10 from the previous year.In terms of raw money spent for the entire November through December holiday shopping season, consumers are expected to shell out between $678.75 billion and $682 billion on retail purchases—which excludes cars, gas, and restaurants purchases. This would mark a roughly 4% increase from 2016’s two-month holiday shopping season. However, it should be noted that this annual survey included Cyber Monday for the first time this year.For some recent historical perspective, consumers were estimated to have spent $416.4 billion in 2002. Holiday spending is set to surge nearly 29% from 2010, when shoppers were projected to have made $528.8 billion worth of retail purchases.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time. It’s a once-in-a-generation opportunity to invest in pure genius.Click for details >>

3120,TGT,"Target Corporation (TGT  -  Free Report) became the latest to join the bandwagon of retailers — Kohl’s Corporation (KSS  -  Free Report), J. C. Penney (JCP  -  Free Report) and Zumiez  — who witnessed strong holiday season sales. Comparable sales for this general merchandise retailer rose 3.4% in the combined November/December period buoyed by healthy store comps, robust traffic and sturdy digital sales.

3122,TGT,"The world's largest retailer Wal-Mart (WMT  -  Free Report) suffered its worst one-day stock decline in three decades following its fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 results.The stock tumbled more than 10% at the close of Tuesday’s trading session, representing its steepest one-day drop since Jan 8 1988, and wiping out more than $31 billion in the company’s market value. It trumped its average volume figures, as nearly 52.1 million shares exchanged hands compared with around 9 million on an average.The mega retailer posted sluggish results for fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 results. Although it beat revenue estimates, earnings fell shy of the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3 cents. Slowdown in e-commerce sales was the biggest reason for the earnings miss. Online sales grew just 23% year over year, a massive drop from 50% growth seen in the third quarter and 29% growth in the year-ago quarter. This is because Wal-Mart struggled to manage its online inventory, amassing holiday-related items such as electronics, toys and gifts and falling short of stocking everyday items.The turmoil spilled over to the broader U.S. stock market, shaving off roughly 73 points from the Dow Jones Industrial Average and a 2.3% pullback in S&P 500 consumer-staples stocks. Wal-Mart has been underperforming the industry, having shed 4.7% so far this year against the latter’s 5.6% increase.However, the dip could be a good entry point given its solid fundamentals. We have highlighted some solid reasons to add the stock to your portfolio at a beaten down price.Guidance SolidDespite the slowdown in e-commerce sales, the discount chain is still optimistic as it reiterated its prior guidance of 40% online sales growth for the current fiscal. Additionally, it expects U.S. same-store sales to grow at least 2% and earnings per share in the range of $4.75-$5.00. The high-end of the guidance is above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.91.High Return on EquityThe discount chain store has a solid track of returning cash to shareholders. After returning $14.4 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases last fiscal year, Wal-Mart lifted its annual dividend by 2% to $2.08 per share, which will translate to a yield of 1.95%. This marks the 45th consecutive year of dividend increases..As such, Wal-Mart has higher return on equity of 16.92% versus the industry average of 12.40%.Encouraging Estimate RevisionsWal-Mart has seen positive earnings estimate revision of 23 cents for the current fiscal over the past three months. For FY18, the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $4.91, representing double-digit growth from the prior year. Revenues are expected to grow 2.66% year over year.Additionally, the stock carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and belongs to a top-ranked Zacks industry (top 41%), suggesting that the worst might be over. It is a triple play stock with a solid Value, Growth and Momentum Score of B each.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Low BetaWal-Mart has a lower beta of 0.42, which makes the stock safe and resilient amid the current rocky market. Beta measures the price volatility of stocks relative to the overall market. It has direct relationship to market movements. A beta of 1 indicates that the price of the stock tends to move with the broader market. A beta of more than 1 indicates that the price tends to move higher than the broader market and is extremely volatile while a beta of less than 1 indicates that the price of the stock is less volatile than the market.Competitive PositionAlthough Wal-Mart is trying to catch up with Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) in the online retail space, it is way ahead in the brick-and-mortar retail business. The company also has an edge over another retailer Target (TGT  -  Free Report) in a fiercely competitive digital space.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +18.8% from 2016 - Q1 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +157.0%, +128.0%, +97.8%, +94.7%, and +90.2% respectively.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon.

3123,TGT,"Markets finished in the red on Monday following a decline in the shares of Walmart. A spike in yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note also increased fears related to a spike in inflation and weighed heavily on the broader markets. Consequently, the Dow and the S&P 500 snapped their six-day streak of gains.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) decreased 1%, to close at 24,964.75. However, the S&P 500 fell 0.6% to close at 2,716.26. The tech-laden Nasdaq Composite Index closed at 7,234.31, losing about 0.1%. The fear-gauge CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) increased 7.7% to close at 20.95.A total of around 6.79 billion shares were traded on Monday, lower than the last 20-session average of 8.48 billion shares. Decliners outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by a 1.98-to-1 ratio. On Nasdaq, a 2.05-to-1 ratio favored declining issues.Walmart Weighs on the DowShares of Walmart Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report) declined 10.2% on Monday after posting fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 results, wherein both earnings and revenues improved year over year and the latter also exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate. However, Walmart crushed its nine-quarter long trend of posting positive earnings surprise in the quarter. Also, rate of e-commerce sales growth declined sequentially in the quarter. This was Walmart’s biggest percentage decline in a single day since January 1988.Such an event weighed on the broader market and Dow in particular shed 254 points to finish in the red, ending its six-day streak of gains. Moreover, the blue-chip index also fell below its 50-day moving average.How Did other Major Benchmarks Perform?Walmart was also the biggest drag on the S&P 500.The S&P 500 declined 16 points to also snap six-day streak of gains. Of the 11 major segments of the S&P 500, only one ended in positive territory. While the laggards were led by theconsumer staples sector, tech sector managed only meager gains. The Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLP) declined 2.3%, whereas the Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLK) notched up only 0.1% on Monday.This marked the S&P 500’s first close in negative territory in the last seven sessions. Further, the broader index broke below its 50-day moving average. However, losses for Target (TGT  -  Free Report), Kroger (KR  -  Free Report) and Kraft Heinz (KHC  -  Free Report) also weighed on the S&P 500.

Further, the short-term two-year yield lingered around a nine-year high. Such a spike in interest rates stole the sheen off equity stocks and led to broad based losses for the equity markets.Moreover, a surge in interest rates also instilled fresh inflation-related worries among investors. A surge in interest rate is seen as an indication of a possible rate hike by the Fed as benchmark interest rate lead to a spike in inflation. Such an event dampened investors’ sentiments.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

3124,TGT,"Shares of Walmart (WMT  -  Free Report) sunk nearly 10% on Tuesday after the retailer reported a substantial slowdown in fourth-quarter ecommerce sales. This sluggishness from an industry bellwether will see many investors begin to look ahead and wonder what might be in store from fellow retail power Target (TGT  -  Free Report) in its upcoming Q4 report.Walmart posted adjusted fourth-quarter earnings of $1.33 per share, which fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.36. The company’s revenues climbed 4.1% year-over-year in the important holiday period to hit $136.3 billion, topping our estimate of nearly $135 billion. Walmart also saw its U.S. comparable-store sales pop 2.6% (also read: Walmart's (WMT  -  Free Report) Q4 Earnings Miss Hurts Stock, Comps Up Again).But investors clearly saw the retail giant’s ecommerce business as a reason for concern. Ecommerce sales grew 23%, which marks a huge drop from the 50% year-over-year growth rate Walmart achieved in the trailing three periods.Some of the online sales squeeze can be attributed to a big push for holiday-related items such as TVs taking up too much space at ecommerce warehouses, which led to more everyday items being out-of-stock online. Still, after posting a 44% full-year jump in ecommerce sales this year, Walmart now expects to post ecommerce sales growth of roughly 40% in its upcoming fiscal year.With all of this said, some of Walmart’s Q4 results have to worry Target investors as the two companies operate in the same retail sphere and attract similar customers. On top of that, both companies have tried to revamp their business models to focus more heavily on ecommerce, which is both costly and difficult.Target Those looking to make an earnings play on Target stock should take a look at Walmart’s recent results as well as Target estimates ahead of the company’s Q4 earnings release.Although Target is often seen as a slightly more upscale option than Walmart, it has also felt Amazon’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) presence and has opted to focus more on remodeling existing locations and expanding online capabilities than opening new locations.Like Walmart, Target saw its online sales surge last quarter. The company saw its comparable digital sales grow 24% in Q3, which marked five consecutive quarters of 20%-plus growth. If investors are worried that Walmart’s report indicates a similar ecommerce slowdown from Target, the company’s updated fourth-quarter guidance shows that if ecommerce sales do slip, it doesn’t seem like it will be by much.Target recently announce that it expects to post 3.4% growth in comp-store sales during the holiday quarter. This guidance comes based in large part on 3.4% comparable store sales growth in the vital November and December period, which topped Target’s initial range of 0% to 2% growth. Furthermore, Target now expects that 2017 will be the fourth consecutive year that it posts digital sales growth of 25% or more.Target investors should be happy to note that our consensus estimate is moving higher on the back of strong analyst revision agreement for both Q4 and fiscal 2017. Based on our current estimates, Target is expected to post fourth-quarter revenues of $22.46 billion, which would mark an 8.57% jump from the year-ago period.Looking ahead to fiscal 2018, Target will continue to pour money into ecommerce. ""We will also remain focused on rapidly scaling up new fulfillment options including Same Day Delivery, which will be enabled by our acquisition of Shipt, and our recently launched Drive Up service,"" CEO Brian Cornell said in a statement.The retailer has topped earnings estimates in the trailing three quarters, with an average surprise of 14%.Target is also currently a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and sports an overall “B” VGM score.Target is scheduled to report its Q4 and full fiscal year results on Tuesday, March 6.*A previous version of this article mentioned that Walmart's ecommerce revenues grew 24%. That figure has been corrected to represent Walmart's actual ecommerce growth of 23%*Can Hackers Put Money INTO Your Portfolio?Earlier this month, credit bureau Equifax announced a massive data breach affecting 2 out of every 3 Americans.

3125,TGT,"U.S. retail sales registered the steepest decline in almost a year during January. The Commerce Department stated that U.S. retail and food services sales were down 0.3% to $492 billion. The fall was primarily due to lower sales at motor vehicle & parts as well as building material dealers. Per media reports, analysts were expecting a 0.2% increase in sales.Auto sales declined 1.3% in January, according to the monthly report. Furthermore, home building materials sales declined 2.4%. However, the bright spots were gasoline stations, clothing & clothing accessories and department stores where sales increased 1.6%, 1.2% and 0.8%, respectively. Receipts at service stations increased on account higher gasoline prices. Meanwhile, sales at non-store retailers remained flat but increased 10.2% from the prior-year period.Why Retail Sector Still Hold Promise?Although January sales data raises concern, industry experts believe that this may be short lived. In fact, they are of the opinion that gradual wage acceleration, a 17-year low unemployment rate and rising consumer confidence are enough to trigger consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity. Also, the monthly report states that retail sales did increase 3.6% year over year.All these bode well for the Retail-Wholesale sector, which currently occupies the top 13% (2 out of 16) position in the list of 16 Zacks sectors. The sector has advanced roughly 29% in a year, comfortably outperforming the S&P 500’s growth of approximately 14%.Furthermore, improving labor market, rising disposable income and elevated consumer sentiment have instilled confidence in retailers. With digital transformation in shopping, retailers are fast adopting the omni-channel mantra to provide a seamless shopping experience, whether online or in-stores.In fact, retail is no more restricted to brick-&-mortar presence. E-commerce giant Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) is the major reason for today’s ultra-competitive retail environment. This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company is aggressively making headway into the retail space, be it grocery, books, clothes and accessories or electronics.To keep pace with the changing shopping pattern and environment, Walmart (WMT  -  Free Report) — a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock — is going the extra mile to give itself a complete makeover through buyouts, alliances, and improved delivery and payment systems. Well, Walmart has been taking numerous initiatives to mar Amazon’s rising prospects. Of late, rumors were making rounds that Walmart is planning to build an inhouse cloud computing platform — a card already played by Amazon. In addition, sources revealed that Walmart’s Sam’s Club is providing free shipping services to premium members. These moves clearly echo the company’s transformation ideals and the shift from Wal-Mart Stores to Walmart bears the biggest testimony to its efforts to keep pace with consumers’ changing preferences. The big box retailer’s various buyouts, alliances, focus on expanding online grocery, and improved delivery and payment systems reflect the same.Other retailers such as Costco (COST  -  Free Report), Target (TGT  -  Free Report) and Macy's (M  -  Free Report) are focusing on omni-channel capabilities as well.Costco — a Zacks Rank #3 stock — is expanding e-commerce capabilities in the United States, Canada, the U.K., Mexico, Korea and Taiwan.Macy’s — a Zacks Rank #2 company — has also announced a slew of measures revolving around stores closures, cost containment, real estate strategy and investment in omni-channel capabilities to enhance sales, profitability and cash flows.Meanwhile, Target is focusing on omni-channel capacities, diversification and localization of assortments along with emphasis on flexible format stores. Notably, the company has a Restock program, which allows customers to restock their shipping box with essential items online and get them delivered at the door step by the next business day for a nominal charge.

3126,TGT,"With Thanksgiving around the corner, the retail industry’s prospects are squarely in focus. Retail is possibly the most visible face of consumer spending, which has powered the recent spurt in U.S. economic growth. But over the last few years, the industry’s landscape has undergone several radical changes. The most important of these is possibly the tussle between brick and mortar formats and exclusive online stores.Around this time last year, it seemed that e-commerce was easily winning the battle. This is likely the case even now, with several retail majors expanding their online presence significantly. However, some brick and mortar chains are resisting the temptation to go online and have found new ways to fight the retail battle.Battling a Retail CollapseNearly 16 million individuals are employed by the U.S. retail sector, making it a significant cog in the country’s economic engine. However, several of them have been forced to shutter several stores after failing to fend off online competition. And troubles don’t end there for this category. Several big names have even had to file for bankruptcy this year.To provide a small illustration, in 2017 alone, Sears Holdings Corporation  has shuttered more than 350 Sears and K-mart stores. Meanwhile, The Gap, Inc. (GPS  -  Free Report) and J. C. Penney Company, Inc. (JCP  -  Free Report) have shut down 200 and 140 stores, respectively.But it isn’t that sales have completely fallen away for these traditional retail mainstays. Instead, several retailers with an online presence are witnessing a migration from brick and mortar outlets to their company websites.Online, Offline or a Mix of Both?This migration toward online portals has forced retailers to come up with methods to balance their online and offline presence. For instance, Target Corporation (TGT  -  Free Report) is following a two-pronged strategy of increasing its online presence and slashing prices. Meanwhile, nearly half of its online purchases are either being shipped from stores or being picked up from brick and mortar outlets by customers.Also, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report) has decided to adjust its pricing strategy in order to find the right online-offline balance. The iconic retailer has recently decided to raise online prices for certain products for which shipping costs are significantly high. This move makes store prices for certain items cheaper, which means that it’s a strategy that could backfire for online focused customers.How Dollar Tree is Winning the FightHowever, some discount chains have not had to depend heavily on the online route to remain afloat in this fiercely competitive environment. One of them is Dollar Tree Inc. (DLTR  -  Free Report), which posted impressive third-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Nov 21. Comparable store sales (comps) for the quarter increased 3.2% in constant-currency, driven by improved customer count and average ticket. (Read: Dollar Tree Stock Jumps on Q3 Earnings Beat, View Up)At the heart of its recent success have been store remodeling efforts and a decision to expand its food offerings. According to Dollar Tree’s CEO Gary Philbin, strong consumables sales have fueled overall sales during the last quarter. Further, the company provided 125 additional Dollar Tree stores with refrigeration facilities. Dollar Tree has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Taking a Leaf out of Aldi’s Book?Dollar Tree has also been gaining from the integration of Family Dollar, which is contributing significantly to the company’s results. Philbin said better food merchandizing led to a rise in sales at Family Dollar outlets during the third quarter. Such strategies are similar to Germany’s retail giant Aldi which announced ambitious U.S. expansion plans this year.One of the biggest reasons behind Aldi’s discount business model is that 90% of the products are Aldi-exclusive brands, letting the grocer provide high-quality product without the hidden costs of advertising and marketing usually associated with national name brands. (Read: Why Aldi is the Grocery Store of the Future)The Way AheadMost traditional retailers are choosing to take a middle path, striking a delicate balance between their online and offline efforts. But the success of discount stores like Dollar Tree and Aldi indicates that the American consumer is willing to opt for brick and mortar outlets ahead of their online counterparts if they provide strong product offerings at reasonable prices. Clearly, the days of brick and mortar stores are far from over.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time. It’s a once-in-a-generation opportunity to invest in pure genius.Click for details >>

3127,TGT,"A week out from Super Bowl LII in Minneapolis, with much of the football world beginning to descend upon Minnesota, businesses around the Twin Cities hope to experience an economic boost.Estimates regarding the economic impact of hosting a Super Bowl vary widely. But after Minneapolis was awarded the big game, which is set to be held in the new $1.13 billion U.S. Bank Stadium, Minnesota Gov. Mark Dayton proclaimed that the 10-day event would lead to a $500 million win for the state.A more updated impact forecast from the Minnesota Super Bowl Host Committee notes that the game will generate more than $400 million and attract more than one million visitors.

(PII  -  Free Report)This Medina, Minnesota-headquartered maker of off-road recreational vehicles instantly conjures up pictures of rugged northern landscapes. Polaris is also one of Minnesota’s biggest companies and has facilities located throughout the state.

3128,TGT,"Investors in Target Corporation (TGT  -  Free Report) need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the January 12, 2018 $55 Put had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Target shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Target is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Retail - Discount Stores industry that ranks in the Top 36% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, three analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while four analysts have dropped their estimates. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from $1.25 per share to $1.22 in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Target right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Often times, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay.

3129,TGT,"The Retail-Wholesale sector is hogging all the attention, and this time for good reasons. For the time being, the expression ""retail apocalypse” appears to be a thing of past. The sector has certainly been bearing the brunt of heightened online competition, lower footfall and changing consumer spending patterns but of late the tables are turning in favor of the retailers. Stocks once bogged down by tough environment are now suddenly climbing the charts.The first and foremost reason for the same is that retailers are efficiently allocating a large chunk of capital toward multi-channel growth strategy focused on improving merchandise offerings, and developing IT infrastructure to enhance the web and mobile experience of customers. Further, the retailers are renovating stores, developing fulfillment centers and implementing an enterprise-wide inventory management system.Another reason for the same is the latest tax reform that has resulted in lowering the corporate tax rate to as much as 21%, and retailers will be the beneficiary of the same. Analysts believe that a lower tax burden is likely to allow them to channelize the surplus money to best possible options. They may go for a dividend hike, or reduce debt load, or create a corpus to fund acquisitions, or invest in enhancing omni-channel capabilities, new product launches and any other innovations.The last factor that has also played a major role in grabbing investors’ attention to the sector is the blissful holiday season. Per MasterCard SpendingPulse report, retail sales during the holiday period jumped 4.9%, marking the biggest year-over-year uptick in holiday spending since 2011. Retailers such as Urban Outfitters (URBN  -  Free Report) and Kohl’s Corp. (KSS  -  Free Report) registered sales growth of 3.6% and 6.9%, respectively, during the November-December period, while both J. C. Penney (JCP  -  Free Report) and Target (TGT  -  Free Report) recorded comparable store sales growth of 3.4%.How Is the Sector Placed?The sector, which currently occupies the top 19% (3 out of 16) position in the list of 16 Zacks categorized sectors, has advanced 33% in a year and comfortably outperformed the S&P 500’s gain of 21.5%. We believe that given the favorable economic indicators the sector holds promise for 2018.The rebound in oil prices from all-time lows, fall in the unemployment rate to 17-year low, and improving housing and manufacturing sectors signal that the economy is on a recovery mode. These factors are favorable for retailers. Steady job additions and gradual wage acceleration boost consumer confidence. Although consumer confidence dipped to 122.1 in December from November’s revised reading of 128.6, analysts believe that consumers remain optimistic about the economy.Consequently, adding a few stocks from the space would be a prudent decision at the current juncture. Here we have highlighted four Retail-Wholesale stocks that have a favorable Zacks Rank – Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and have been given a Strong Buy/Buy rating by 70% or more brokers.4 Prominent PicksWe suggest investing in Conn's, Inc.

3130,TGT,"After taking somewhat of a breather in the first trading day of the week — only 2 of the 3 major indexes wound up in the green at the close (at record levels yet again), with the Dow finishing slightly lower — we see pre-market trading springing back to life this morning. Continued health in the domestic economy joins new positive data from the Eurozone overnight.European indexes finished higher for now the fifth straight session. Economic data from Germany, the Eurozone’s largest economy, were strong: Industrials for November came in +3.4%, nearly double expectations, and the country’s trade balance is a better-than-expected +$26.7 billion. Also, European telecom major Altice NV has announced a spinoff to the U.S. market with a new cable television company, Altice USA. This has helped push the French market higher, as Altice is the second-largest telecom provider in the country, behind Orange.Another big-box retailer has also reported stronger-than-expected sales in the Q4 holiday season. Target (TGT  -  Free Report) saw big improvements year over year, following similar announcements from other retailers since the beginning of the new year, and the company expects the newly passed tax law to improve margins at the company. Pre-market investors have rewarded the stock this morning, now up roughly 4%.Finally, we see some new positive news out of the long-dormant 10-year Treasury bill, which has now poked its head above 2.5% for the first time since last March. We also see some minor strides in the value of the U.S. dollar this morning, with its index up again today to 92.53.

3131,TGT,"Consumer analytics firm Nielsen (NLSN  -  Free Report) just released its second-ever online food shopping study, which found that the industry Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) and meal-kit delivery companies such as Blue Apron (APRN  -  Free Report) helped popularize is set to grow into a $100 billion market soon.On Monday, Nielsen, in partnership with the Food Marketing Institute, released its “Digitally Engaged Food Shopper” study. The joint venture found that within as few as five to seven years, 70% of all U.S. consumers are expected to buy at least a portion of their groceries online.Previously, Nielsen and FMI projected it would take the U.S. online grocery business until 2025 to reach the $100 billion milestone. “The grocery industry is currently in the age of digital experimentation, where the roadmap on how to navigate and achieve real and profitable growth continues to evolve,” Nielsen executive Chris Morley said in a statement.The Digitally Engaged Food Shopper study found that the online grocery industry is set to expand rapidly, but investors should know that it is already widely popular in the U.S. CNBC noted that 49% of all U.S. shoppers bought a packaged good online within the last three months.Looking at the generational breakdown, 61% of Millennials purchased at least some type of grocery item online, while 44% of Baby Boomers also joined the new online shopping trend.This growth hardly comes as a shock to many investors and certainly won’t surprise many retailers. In fact, over the last year, big-box giants Walmart (WMT  -  Free Report) and Target (TGT  -  Free Report) have attempted to bolster their online grocery businesses in order to better compete with Amazon.Looking ahead, grocery companies such as Kroger (KR  -  Free Report) and Costco (COST  -  Free Report) will likely invest more money in online ordering technologies and infrastructure.On top of investments from industry giants, grocery delivery startups such as Instacart have become popular in cities around the country. Now, as Instacart partners with everyone from Petco to CVS (CVS  -  Free Report), investors might see more shake-ups and mergers akin to Amazon’s Whole Foods purchase sooner than later.Zacks Top 10 Stocks for 2018In addition to the stocks discussed above, would you like to know about our 10 finest buy-and-hold tickers for the entirety of 2018?Last year's 2017 Zacks Top 10 Stocks portfolio produced double-digit winners, including FMC Corp. and VMware which racked up stellar gains of +67.9% and +61%.

3132,TGT,"2017 has undoubtedly been a tough year for the retailers, who struggled to maintain good business due to changing preferences and habits of consumers. The year saw an outbreak of online shopping fervor, which almost put the existence of traditional and department store retailers in question. Increased promotions, price wars, lower store and mall traffic, brick-and-mortar store closures, strengthening of online and omni-channel portals were some of the common trends witnessed through the year.Additionally, the retail sector saw some renowned retailers file bankruptcy, including small mom-and-pop stores as well as major retailers. Some names on the list were Toys R Us, Payless Shoes, Gymboree and Rue21. A major reason behind the demise of these stores was the absence of online presence as consumers today prefer to use smartphones and tablets to shop, instead of spending time in a brick-and-mortar outlet.Hence, the winners in today’s market are those taking strides to boost online presence through investments in enhancement of digital and mobile offerings, alongside improving product acceptance. Further, retailers are adopting various initiatives to improve omni-channel capabilities. Through these initiatives retailers are not only enhancing online business but also reviving the importance of physical stores. Some omni-channel capabilities that were successful in 2017 include “Buy Online, Pick-Up In Store”, “Ship from Store”, “Find-in-Store”, “Reserve-in-Store”, “Order in Store”, “Reserve Online and Try In-Store”, “Buy Online, Return In Store”, “Click and Collect” and same-day delivery services.Further, retailers have been taking steps to enhance the capacities of distribution centers to improve deliveries of goods purchased online. Retailers gaining from the roll out if these capabilities and improved distribution centers include The Gap Inc. (GPS  -  Free Report), Nordstrom Inc. (JWN  -  Free Report), Macy’s Inc. (M  -  Free Report), Decker’s Outdoor Corporation (DECK  -  Free Report), among others.Retailers’ omni-channel strategies were more prominent this holiday season, when retailers came up with interesting offers to lure customers. Apart from early-hour store openings, huge discounts, promotional strategies, free shipping on online purchases, price match guarantee and enticing gift ideas were some offers shoppers could not resist this holiday season. This, along with a strengthening economy and a stable labor market, led to a successful holiday season for retailers in long time.Looking ahead, we anticipate the optimism from the holiday fest to continue in 2018, as retailers’ omni-channel efforts will continue to lure shoppers. That said, we are here to analyze some of the retailers and their enticing strategies, which have the ability to hook up customers through the New Year.Retailers Poised to Steer the Sector’s Growth in 2018On top of the list is e-retailing giant, Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report). The popularity that the company has garnered in recent years is unprecedented. The company’s technological expertise is the mantra for its ability to provide a seamless shopping experience. Its user-friendly app and website, impressive product assortment, constant innovations, along with seamless payment and checkout system have helped it to become consumers’ favorite shopping destination.Amazon’s retail business is nearly unbeatable on grounds of price, choice, and convenience with the help of a solid loyalty system in Prime and its FBA strategy. The company continues to push advantages exclusively to Prime members, consequently encouraging them to spend more on Amazon. Further, the company’s strategy of gradually merging online and offline retail looks promising. The company’s online and offline feature, added to its bookstores has gained significant popularity in recent times. Moreover, the company is taking this forward with innovations such as drive-in-grocery delivery service (AmazonFresh Pickup - order groceries online and collect them from a store nearby) and “cashier-less” stores (Amazon Go – the company’s first brick-and mortar grocery store).These strategies are likely to fend off competition arising from traditional retailers building their e-commerce businesses as well as other e-retailing counterparts. Further, the company is continually expanding offerings through acquisitions and pacts with leading brands. The company’s recent takeover of grocery retailer, Whole Foods Market Inc.; and agreement with Nike Inc. (NKE  -  Free Report) to directly sell products on Amazon.com, are examples of its expansion strategy.Driven by these efforts, the company recorded 25% growth in net sales, which came in at roughly $38 billion in the second quarter of 2017. When most retailers are struggling to boost their top lines, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s growth is a clear indication of how well it poised to capture the lion’s share.(Looking for the Best Stocks for 2018? Be among the first to see our Top Ten Stocks for 2018 portfolio here.)Next comes the supermarket chain, Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report), which is putting in due efforts to neutralize the dominance of Amazon in the retail space. The company’s latest strategy of keeping online prices almost at par with Amazon during the holiday season has left an indelible impression on the minds of industry gurus. Sources revealed that Walmart’s prices were just 0.3% higher than Amazon’s, clearly reflecting the company’s efforts to gain a good share this holiday season.While this was a strategy to counter competition, particularly this holiday season, Wal-Mart has been continually taking steps to boost e-commerce sales through acquisitions, alliances and enhanced delivery and payment systems. Walmart’s buyouts of Bonobos, ShoeBuy, Moosejaw, ModCloth and Jet.com, along with its Walmart Pay mobile payment system and Mobile Express Returns program underscore its quest to accelerate online business.Further, Walmart’s efforts to enhance delivery services resonate well with its strategy of growing online grocery sales. For this, the company’s recent acquisition of a delivery startup Parcel, Inc., and previous agreements with ride hailing services Uber and Lyft for speedy online grocery deliveries, have been notable. Additionally, the Walmart Pickup program enables customers to place orders online and then pick them up at a store for free. Further, the company continues to test same-day and next-day delivery to enhance services further.Consequently, Walmart’s U.S. e-commerce sales soared 50% in the third quarter of fiscal 2018, primarily owing to Walmart.com’s performance, including significant contributions from Walmart’s online grocery service. The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Last, but not the least, we have Target Corporation (TGT  -  Free Report), a department store chain that is leaving no stone unturned to stay in business in the current competitive retail landscape. The company has been deploying resources to significantly develop online platform as well as store facilities to make shopping more convenient for customers. In a recent move, the company announced price-cuts for various products, following Amazon’s decision to slash prices at the recent acquired Whole Foods business.Further, the company has been emphasizing on growth of e-commerce business, through the launch of an international version of its website, expanding merchandise assortments through introduction of new brands, aggressive cost reduction strategy, rationalization of supply chain with same-day delivery of in-store purchases, as well as technology and process improvements. Further, it waged war against other retail big-wigs by aggressively cutting prices on a range of items and launched curbside pickup program, at 50 Twin Cities stores.Additionally, to leave a mark in the booming online grocery delivery market, the company has teamed with online grocery delivery service Instacart and made significant headway in the same-day delivery race by acquiring grocery delivery company Shipt. Further, the company’s Target Restock program that allows customers to restock their shipping box with essential items online and get them delivered at door steps by the next business day for a nominal charge. Moreover, in order to improve supply chain and expand delivery capabilities, Target acquired Grand Junction. We believe these efforts will help the company provide some solid competition to big-wigs in the retail space. The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +18.8% from 2016 - Q1 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +157.0%, +128.0%, +97.8%, +94.7%, and +90.2% respectively.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon.

3133,TGT,"Target Corporation (TGT  -  Free Report) looks quite disciplined in approach when it comes to tackling prevailing headwinds in the retail landscape — sluggish store traffic, stiff competition from online retailers and aggressive pricing strategy. The company’s initiatives such as the development of omni-channel capacities, diversification and localization of assortments along with emphasis on flexible format stores bode well. These are going to play a major role in 2018.Despite the tough retail landscape, shares of Target have surged 27.3% in the past six months, compared with the industry’s growth of 24.3%. Further, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock’s VGM Score of B portray its inherent strength.Endeavors UndertakenNo wonder Target is trying all means to rapidly adapt to the changes in the retail ecosystem. The company intends to deploy resources to significantly develop online platform as well as store facilities to make shopping more convenient for customers. Further, it intends to launch 12 new brands across signature categories. The company plans to expand merchandise assortments with special emphasis on Style, Baby, Kids, and Wellness categories that are performing well.This general merchandise retailer recently launched curbside pickup program, at 50 Twin Cities stores. This program gives customers an option to get ordered items without leaving the comfort of their cars. It has also rolled out Target Restock program that allows customers to restock their shipping box with essential items online and get them delivered at door steps by the next business day for a nominal charge. Further, in order to improve supply chain and expand delivery capabilities, the company had acquired Grand Junction.To tap digital sales this holiday season, Target strengthened relationship with Google by allowing customers nationwide to shop through Google Express, including voice-activated shopping. Target has also made a concerted effort on the front of same-day delivery services by acquiring internet-based grocery delivery service Shipt for $550 million.Short-Term ImpedimentsShares of Target did come under pressure following third-quarter fiscal 2017 results.  Despite a positive earnings surprise, investors remained concerned about the year-over-year decline registered in the bottom line and management’s commentary about highly competitive environment in the fourth quarter.The competition has intensified following Whole Foods Market’s buyout by Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report). Further, the fourth quarter coincides with the holiday season, which is often a make-or-break time for retailers, as it accounts for a sizeable chunk of yearly revenues and profits. Target also did not provide an encouraging earnings outlook for the final quarter due to increased spending related to stores, lower pricing and higher wages that are likely to weigh upon margins.The company has been jostling with waning margins for quite some time now. In both the first and second quarters of fiscal 2017, gross margin contracted 40 basis points to 30.5%. In the third quarter, gross margin contracted 10 basis points to 29.7% on account of pricing and promotions, as well as cost of digital fulfillment. Maintaining the same chronological order, operating margin shriveled 80 basis points, 90 basis points and 120 basis points to 7.4%, 6.8% and 5.2%, respectively.Wrapping UpCertainly, Target is leaving no stone unturned to attract consumers and attain incremental revenues. We believe that these strategies are likely to bolster the company’s performance and help overcome impediments, thus positioning it for 2018.Interested in the Retail Space, Check TheseRoss Stores, Inc.

3134,TGT,"Industry experts believe that the competition in the U.S. grocery market is going to intensify further in 2018, and supermarket chains will have to constantly revisit their strategy in order to withstand it. This means either you “shape up or ship out.” It seems that The Kroger Co. (KR  -  Free Report) has taken the stock of the situation and is on its way to give itself a complete makeover.The BackgroundThe grocery industry has been grappling with stiff competition, volatility in food prices, aggressive promotional environment and declining store count. The industry witnessed a major shake-up when the news of Whole Foods takeover by Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) surfaced. This amalgamation of online marketplace with physical stores caused a tectonic shift in the grocery landscape.Amazon can now leverage Whole Foods’ fresh foods procurements expertise with its own data mining techniques. Experts see this acquisition as a major step by Amazon to thwart any threat coming from Wal-Mart (WMT  -  Free Report), which holds a dominant position in the $700-$800 billion U.S. food market and has been gradually building up its e-commerce strength.Wal-Mart has been proactive in expanding in the fast-growing online grocery space. The company, which competes with Amazon Fresh, extended alliance with last mile logistics entity, Deliv, to support same-day delivery for groceries. Walmart also acquired delivery start-up company, Parcel Inc. to extend same-day deliveries.Target (TGT  -  Free Report) has also made a concerted effort on the front of same-day delivery services by recently acquiring internet-based grocery delivery service, Shipt. Previously, the company had acquired Grand Junction in order to improve supply chain and expand delivery capabilities.What’s Kroger’s Strategy?Kroger has been trying all means to overcome competition, which has intensified with the entrance of Amazon. The company remains well on track to boost market share by expanding store base, introducing new items, digital coupons, and order online, pick up in store initiative. The company introduced an entirely new brand, HemisFares that give customers access to best foods from all around the globe and is expanding Prep+Pared Meal Kits.The company’s “Restock Kroger” program is gaining traction. Kroger commenced “We Are Local” campaign; launched and opened a new restaurant concept, Kitchen 1883; and added two new product lines under “Our Brands” — an apparel brand to be launched in 2018 and a floral line, BLOOM HAUS, which is available in stores.As part of the program management is considering the sale of convenience store business, and expects to generate $400 million in incremental operating margin by 2020 and over $4 billion of free cash flow in the next three years. The company in collaboration with Chase Pay will offer mobile payments in select markets beginning next year.Kroger is looking to expand its “Scan, Bag, Pay & Go and Self-CheckOut” program — piloted at 20 stores — to nearly 400 locations in 2018. Further, Ralphs — a unit of grocery giant — in partnership with Instacart is offering home delivery at select locations in Southern California. Kroger remains optimistic about the acquisitions of Vitacost.com, an online retailer of vitamins and health-oriented products; Harris Teeter, a grocery chain, and the merger of Modern HC Holdings with Axium Pharmacy Holdings Inc., a specialty pharmacy. Kroger also acquired Roundy's, the grocery store operator.Kroger’s Customer 1st strategy that enriches the consumers shopping experience and convinces them of returning to the store is also benefiting the company. We believe that the company's operational strategies present enormous opportunities to augment identical supermarket sales, alleviate gross margin pressure, improve operating margin and enhance return on invested capital.Certainly, Kroger is leaving no stone unturned to attract consumers and attain incremental revenues. We believe that these strategies are likely to bolster the company’s performance and drive the stock further. In the past three months, shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) have surged 33.3%, outperforming the industry’s growth of 23.4%.

3135,TGT,"Groceries, until recently an insular market in the fiercely competitive retail zone, may see a radical shift in the days to come. The landscape is seeing a rapid change, with more players jumping on the offline bandwagon. The latest move in this space comes from Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report), which is offering free, two-hour delivery from Whole Foods stores to its Prime members in four cities — Austin, Dallas, Cincinnati and Virginia Beach.  This is perhaps the beginning of a battle that will only intensify in the days and months to come.  The move comes within a year of the e-commerce giant’s $13.7-billion acquisition of supermarket chain Whole Foods. Customers in Austin, Dallas, Cincinnati and Virginia Beach can now order fresh produce, meat, seafood, flowers and other items that their local Whole Foods stores stock.Such a move was expected by Amazon given that it has specific plans of exploring and adding novelty to the untapped online groceries market, and the Whole Foods acquisition was a giant leap toward this direction. Needless to say, this will most likely set alarm bells ringing for brick-and-mortar grocers that so long rested assured of business safety.Consumer Focus Route to Success That said, besides sparking fear among the traditional brick-and-mortar stores, the two-hour free delivery service has been introduced keeping in mind customer demands. Consumers look for convenience and good bargains and Amazon is focusing on both. Per a Walker Sands survey, 40% would buy groceries online if they were less expensive and 23% would for it if it were more convenient. The Whole Foods acquisition was certainly a strategic move by Amazon and perhaps the best option, as most of its other technology-driven food delivery initiatives such as Amazon Go have faltered. The acquisition immediately gave Amazon access to Whole Foods’ 450 stores across the United States, thus giving it enough power to compete with brick-and-mortar giants like Walmart (WMT  -  Free Report), Target (TGT  -  Free Report), Dollar Tree (DLTR  -  Free Report) and Dollar General (DG  -  Free Report). Target has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.In doing so, the first step taken by the e-commerce behemoth was to slash prices of avocados, eggs, fruits, fish and prepared food by as much as 50%. Now, its two-hour, free-delivery service is only going to heat up competition for brick-and-mortar grocers. The idea is to lure more customers on the convenience quotient.According to David J. Livingston, a supermarket analyst for DJL Research, people generally buy the same groceries every week. And the biggest question in their mind is if they really need to go and spend an hour at Walmart or Giant for that.Grocery War at Its HeightWhile Amazon is clearing thinking big and taking bold steps, the likes of Walmart, Dollar Tree and Dollar General too are going the online way, thus creating a perfect setup for an intense war in the groceries space. According to NPD Group, about 7% of U.S. households bought groceries online last year. Among them, most prefer their orders delivered to their doors, while the rest pick up from the store. While Walmart, the country’s largest grocer is leaving no stone unturned to tap this area by offering customers the option to order online and a free pick-up from the store, Target brought online grocery-delivery company Shift to add muscle to it online delivery arm.However, Amazon seems to be playing to its strength — a strong delivery wing. The company will pull items from Whole Foods stores, bag them but get the goods delivered by its own drivers. Moreover, it is all free and within two-hours. That certainly is a big challenge for those that are trying to go the online way. More in StoreUnderstandably, there is a lot more that can be expected from retail giants in the near future. Walmart has already entered into a partnership with Japan’s Rakuten to sell e-books in the United States and strengthen its online grocery business in the Asian nation. Amazon’s move may have just ignited a fierce competition that’s only going to flare up. However, the others too seem very much in the race.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

3136,TGT,"Amid a tough retail landscape Costco Wholesale Corporation (COST  -  Free Report) continued with its solid comparable sales (comps) trend in the month of January as well. While major chains are grappling with sluggish store and mall traffic as consumers switch to online shopping, Costco seems somewhat resilient to the challenging retail backdrop.Improving labor market, rising disposable income and elevated consumer sentiment have ushered confidence in the operator of membership warehouses. However, shares of Costco did come under pressure after the news of Whole Foods buyout by Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) surfaced. Moreover, analysts fear that aggressive investments by Walmart (WMT  -  Free Report) and Target (TGT  -  Free Report) to boost their digital operations may hurt Costco’s market share.We noted that shares of Costco have underperformed the Zacks Retail-Discount Industry in a year. This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has advanced 5.1%, while the industry, which occupies a space in the top 13% (33 out of 256) among the Zacks classified industries, has grown 10.9%. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.How Have Comps Fared?Comps for five-weeks ended Feb 4, 2018 increased 6%, following an increase of 11.5% in December, 10.8% in November, 7.5% in October, 8.9% in September, 7.3% in August, 6.2% in July, 6% in June, 4.1% in May, 3% in April, 6% in March, 4% in February and 7% in January.The company generated net sales of $12.24 billion in January, up 8.4% year over year. Notably, net sales increased 14.3%, 13.2%, 10.1%, 12.1%, 10%, 8.8%, 7%, 7%, 5%, 9%, 8% and 9% in December, November, October, September, August, July, June, May, April, March, February and January, respectively. Comparable e-commerce sales for the month under review surged 34.8%.Why Sales Growth Rate Decelerate in January?We note that although comps and sales have increased in the month of January, growth rates have decelerated from preceding months.Management pointed that one less shopping day in January versus last year on account of the calendar shift of New Year’s Day hurt both total sales and comps by approximately 3%. Moreover, with Chinese New Year falling in February this year, total sales and Other International sales were adversely impacted by 0.5% and 3.5%, respectively.Comps for January reflect an increase of 4.9%, 8.3% and 9.8% at the United States, Canada and Other International locations, respectively. Excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and gasoline prices, Costco’s comps for the month under review rose 2.9%. The company recorded comps increase of 3.6%, 1.3% and 0.6% at the United States, Canada and Other International locations, respectively.For the 22-week period, Costco reported 8.8% jump in comps, displaying an increase of 8.2%, 10% and 11.2% at the United States, Canada and Other International locations. Net sales for the period came in at $58.30 billion, an increase of 11.6% from the year-ago period.Wrapping UpWe believe that Costco continues to be one of the dominant retail wholesalers based on the breadth and quality of merchandise offered. The company’s strategy to sell products at heavily discounted prices has helped it to remain on growth track as cash-strapped customers continue to reckon Costco as a viable option for low-cost necessities. We are also encouraged by the company’s expansion strategy, as it remains committed to opening new clubs and expanding e-commerce capabilities.It operates 746 warehouses, comprising 518 warehouses in the United States and Puerto Rico, 98 in Canada, 37 in Mexico, 28 in UK, 26 in Japan, 13 in Korea, 13 in Taiwan, nine in Australia, two in Spain, one in Iceland and one in France. It is also gradually expanding e-commerce capabilities in the United States, Canada, UK, Mexico, Korea and Taiwan.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time. It’s a once-in-a-generation opportunity to invest in pure genius.Click for details >>

3137,TGT,"Tuesday, January 9, 2018After taking somewhat of a breather in the first trading day of the week — only 2 of the 3 major indexes wound up in the green at the close (at record levels yet again), with the Dow finishing slightly lower — we see pre-market trading springing back to life this morning. Continued health in the domestic economy joins new positive data from the Eurozone overnight.European indexes finished higher for now the fifth straight session. Economic data from Germany, the Eurozone’s largest economy, were strong: Industrials for November came in +3.4%, nearly double expectations, and the country’s trade balance is a better-than-expected +$26.7 billion. Also, European telecom major Altice NV has announced a spinoff to the U.S. market with a new cable television company, Altice USA. This has helped push the French market higher, as Altice is the second-largest telecom provider in the country, behind Orange.Another big-box retailer has also reported stronger-than-expected sales in the Q4 holiday season. Target (TGT  -  Free Report) saw big improvements year over year, following similar announcements from other retailers since the beginning of the new year, and the company expects the newly passed tax law to improve margins at the company. Pre-market investors have rewarded the stock this morning, now up roughly 4%.Finally, we see some new positive news out of the long-dormant 10-year Treasury bill, which has now poked its head above 2.5% for the first time since last March. We also see some minor strides in the value of the U.S. dollar this morning, with its index up again today to 92.53.Mark VickerySenior EditorQuestions or comments about this article and/or its author?

What impact will it have on the other players?What if it, gulps, fails in some areas?Acquisition of Whole Foods Was a Game ChangerAmazon closed on its largest ever acquisition, the $13.7 billion deal to acquire Whole Foods Market, over the summer of 2017.Immediately, many predicted the doom of other supermarket chains as Amazon would be able to leverage its huge online presence with over 460 US physical stores.Tracey and Maddy were both Whole Foods shoppers before the acquisition.What do they think of it now that Amazon has been in charge for several months?Could there be trouble ahead for Amazon?What If You Launch 2 Furniture Brands, But No One Knows?In early November 2017, Amazon quietly launched two private label furniture brands: Rivet, which is a mid-century modern line, and Stone & Beam, a family focused Pottery Barn-like brand with sectional couches and farmhouse type accessories.It will offer free shipping with Prime Membership.But can Amazon compete in the competitive furniture market?Williams-Sonoma’s (WSM  -  Free Report) West Elm is the leader in mid-century modern furniture.

3139,TGT,"With Q3 earnings season nearly over, the focus is likely to shift to the retail sector, which hogs all attention with the advent of the holiday season. Retail stocks get a thrust during this busiest part of the year, which is often a make-or-break time for retailers. As the countdown to Black Friday begins, investors also scurry for bright spots in the space.Eye-popping Black Friday deals usher in the Christmas shopping bonanza. Apart from price-matching policies, retailers try to sweep buyers off their feet with early-hour store openings, huge discounts, promotional strategies and free shipping on online purchases. Competition will certainly be tough, be it at the brick-and-mortar stores or online portals.Per the survey conducted by RetailMeNot, consumers are likely to spend an average of $743 this year during the Black Friday weekend through Cyber Monday up from the prior-year figure of $505.Retailers such as Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report), Best Buy (BBY  -  Free Report), Target (TGT  -  Free Report) and others are efficiently allocating a large chunk of their capital toward a multi-channel growth strategy focused on improving merchandise offerings, developing IT infrastructure to enhance the web and mobile experience of customers, renovating stores with a modern look, and developing fulfillment centers to enable speedy delivery.Retail Space Rides on Favorable IndicatorsThe rebound in oil prices from all-time lows, an improving labor market, along with a rising housing market and manufacturing sector signal that the economy is in recovery mode that rose 3% in the third quarter of 2017. Further, the Fed’s indication of a likely rate hike in December reflects the underlying fundamental strength of the economy.Analysts believe that buoyant stock market, gradual wage acceleration, fall in the unemployment rate to 17-year low, and a lift in the economic activity post hurricanes were enough to boost consumer confidence. We anticipate this positive sentiment to translate into higher consumer spending that may help increase sales in the current retail landscape, which is witnessing a sea change with the focus gradually shifting to online shopping.The nation's largest retail trade group, National Retail Federation projects a 3.6-4% rise in November and December sales (excluding autos, gas and restaurant sales) to $678.75-$682 billion, up from $655.8 billion last year and better than the five-year average sales growth of 3.5%. Data compiled by eMarketer forecasts 3.1% jump in holiday sales (November and December) to $923.15 billion, while retail e-commerce holiday season sales are anticipated to rise 16.6%.Indeed, shopping season is likely to be more blissful for retailers. So, how about betting your bucks on lucrative options?4 Prominent PicksHere we have highlighted four Retail/Wholesale stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and a VGM Score of A or B. These stocks are backed by sound fundamentals, surging share price and a track record of better-than-expected results. Not only this, these stocks have outperformed their respective industries.RH (RH  -  Free Report), a home furnishing retailer, is a lucrative option. The stock has a long-term earnings growth rate of 29.3% and a VGM Score of A. We note that in a year, the stock has soared over 100%, while the industry has gained 1.7%.

3140,TGT,"After the news of an unexpected uptick in the U.S. retail sales — +0.2% — in October, retailers got another reason to smile as they head into the holiday season. Consumer Confidence — a key determinant of the economy’s health — reached its highest level in almost 17 years. Per the Conference Board data, the Consumer Confidence Index surged to 129.5 in November from October’s revised reading of 126.2.Analysts believe that buoyant stock market, gradual wage acceleration, fall in the unemployment rate to a 17-year low, and a lift in the economic activity post hurricanes were enough to boost consumer sentiment. The positive sentiment is likely to trigger consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of the U.S. economic activity. Any increase in this metric at this juncture signals consumers’ willingness to spend more this season.This Means a Lot for RetailersImproving labor market, rising disposable income and elevated consumer sentiment have ushered confidence in retailers about a robust holiday season. The festive season is often a make-or-break time for retailers, as it accounts for a sizeable chunk of yearly revenues and profits. Be it early-hour store openings, huge discounts, promotional strategies, price matching and free shipping on online purchases, retailers will go the extra mile.The five-day holiday period starting from Thanksgiving, followed by Black Friday, Small Business Saturday to Cyber Monday, marked an auspicious start to the holiday-shopping season. Per National Retail Federation (“NRF”) approximately 174 million customers shopped in stores and online during this weekend. The trade group estimates that an American spent about an average of $335.47 during the five-day period.Indeed, shopping season is likely to be more blissful for retailers. With Christmas falling on Monday and 32 days after Thanksgiving, shoppers are getting one extra day compared with last year and an extended weekend to do last minute purchasing.Overall, NRF projects a 3.6-4% rise in November and December sales (excluding autos, gas and restaurant sales) to $678.75-$682 billion, up from $655.8 billion last year and better than the five-year average sales growth of 3.5%. Data compiled by eMarketer forecasts 3.1% jump in holiday sales (November and December) to $923.15 billion, while retail e-commerce holiday season sales are anticipated to rise 16.6%.Wrapping UpFrom Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) to Wal-Mart (WMT  -  Free Report), Target (TGT  -  Free Report) to Macy’s (M  -  Free Report) and Gap (GPS  -  Free Report) to Best Buy (BBY  -  Free Report), retailers are gearing up for the busiest part of the year. With digital transformation in shopping and consumers splurging, online retailers are fast adopting the omni-channel mantra.Wal-Mart is making huge investments in e-commerce initiatives. The company’s acquisitions of ShoeBuy, Moosejaw, ModCloth and Jet.com are in sync with its quest to build an impressive digital brand portfolio. Further, the company partnered with Alphabet’s Google to enable shopping through Google Express using voice-activated service. The company is also trying to keep the prices of items more competitive.Target has been also focusing on developing online business. In a bid to stimulate digital sales this holiday season, the company is strengthening relationship with Google by allowing customers nationwide to shop through Google Express, including voice-activated shopping. Recently, it waged war against other retail big-wigs by aggressively cutting prices on a range of items and launched curbside pickup program at 50 Twin Cities stores.As you can see, there are plenty of reasons to be optimistic about the retail sector but what about investing in the space right now?

3141,TGT,"Target Corporation (TGT  -  Free Report), which has introduced several innovative endeavors to counter competition, has announced it will begin same-day delivery across Florida in partnership with an online deliver platform, Shipt, Inc. Notably, the company has acquired Shipt, Inc. recently with the objective of capitalizing on the booming online shoppingShipt will begin the same-day delivery from Target stores in Tampa and South Florida, beginning Feb 1, 2018.  The facility will also be available in Daytona Beach, Fort Myers, Gainesville, Gulf Shores, Jacksonville, Naples, Sarasota, Orlando, Space Coast, St. Augustine, Tallahassee and Treasure Coast form Feb 8, 2018. More than 6.3 million customers across the state can avail this service.The company will provide same-day delivery services of groceries, essentials, home, electronics as well as other products. However, the company will expand it to all major products by the end of 2019. Moreover, with the help of Shipt, Target will start providing same-day delivery services from nearly half of its stores by early 2018. The services will also be available from most of the stores in major markets by the beginning of 2018 holiday season.Founder and CEO of Shipt, Bill Smith said “Florida’s growing community of Shipt members continues to be loyal and enthusiastic about the service, and we look forward to expanding throughout the state with our newest retail partner, Target.”The retail landscape has been undergoing a fundamental change. With digital transformation in shopping and consumers splurging online, store and mall traffic has been hit hard. As a result, most retailers, including big-box, are struggling to compete with e-commerce channels and are being forced to trim store count to focus more on an online model. We believe, the company’s decision to bring same-day delivery services is likely to lure more customers and in turn will drive the top line higher. The acquisition will also aid the company to compete with e-commerce biggie Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report), Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report) and Best Buy Co., Inc. (BBY  -  Free Report)Other InitiativesCurrently, the Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company has Restock program, which allows customers to restock their shipping box with essential items online and get them delivered at door steps by the next business day for a nominal charge. Further, the company had acquired Grand Junction in order to improve supply chain and expand delivery capabilities. This transportation technology company provides a platform that allows retailers, distributors and third-party logistics providers to manage local deliveries through a network of over 700 carriers.In October, the company had launched curbside pickup program, at 50 Twin Cities stores. This program gives customers an option to get ordered items without leaving the comfort of their cars. To avail the service the customers need to place orders via the latest version of Target’s app and then select “Drive Up”. Target will inform the customers when the order is ready for delivery. Once the shopper arrives to the chosen parking spot outside the Target store, an employee will bring the order to the vehicle.The company’s initiatives such as the development of omni-channel capacities, diversification and localization of assortments along with emphasis on flexible format stores bode well for the stock. The shares of Target have outpaced the industry in a month.

3142,TGT,"Retail is no more restricted to brick-&-mortar presence. The scenario has drastically changed with the advancement of technology and digital transformation that are playing key roles in changing consumer shopping pattern. Nevertheless, this transition has persuaded retailers to come up with innovative ways to market products, and Target Corp. (TGT  -  Free Report) is no exception to the trend.Consumers now prefer to shop online from the comfort of their homes rather than hopping from one store to another. Retail bellwethers such as Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) and Wal-Mart (WMT  -  Free Report) are aggressively making headway by tapping customers’ evolving shopping patterns. No wonder Target is trying all means to rapidly adapt to the changes in the retail ecosystem.Target Sharpening the EdgeFocus on Private-Label BrandsTarget has undertaken several strategic initiatives to boost performance. The company intends to deploy resources to significantly develop its online platform as well as store facilities to make shopping more convenient for customers. The company plans to expand merchandise assortments with special emphasis on Style, Baby, Kids, and Wellness categories that are performing well.Management is focusing on key departments, such as Apparel, Beauty, Electronics and Food and Beverage. In the recent past, the company has unveiled some private label brands such as Cloud Island, Cat & Jack, A New Day, Goodfellow & Co., Project 62, JoyLab and others. Target had earlier informed that it plans to infuse $7 billion of capital over a period of three years to merge digital and physical shopping, open small format stores and fulfillment centers, revamp stores and bring in new merchandise.Restock Program & Other Customer Friendly EndeavorsThis general merchandise retailer rolled out Target Restock program that allows customers to restock their shipping box with essential items online and get them delivered at door steps by the next business day for a nominal charge. The company also launched curbside pickup program at 50 Twin Cities stores. This program gives customers an option to get ordered items without leaving the comfort of their cars.Further, in order to improve supply chain and expand delivery capabilities, the company had acquired Grand Junction. To capitalize on digital sales this holiday season, Target strengthened relationship with Google by allowing customers nationwide to shop through Google Express, including voice-activated shopping. Wal-Mart and Home Depot (HD  -  Free Report) are also using Google's voice-activated shopping platform. Target has also made a concerted effort on the front of same-day delivery services by acquiring internet-based grocery delivery service Shipt for $550 million.Flexible Format StoresTarget continues to lay emphasis on developing flexible format stores to penetrate deep into urban areas. This type of stores generally has higher sales productivity. Management had earlier informed that Target is opening 32 small format stores in fiscal 2017 with plans to open 35 new outlets in fiscal 2018. The company plans to operate over 130 small-format outlets nationwide by the end of fiscal 2019. It remodeled 110 stores in fiscal 2017, including 37 in the third quarter. The company plans to remodel 325 in fiscal 2018, 350 in fiscal 2019 and 325 in fiscal 2020.Wrapping UpA reflection of the company’s endeavors was quite visible in the strong holiday season sales. Comparable sales rose 3.4% in the combined November/December period buoyed by healthy store comps, robust traffic and sturdy digital sales. The solid holiday numbers allowed management to lift the view.This Minneapolis, MN-based company now projects fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 adjusted earnings in the band of $1.30-$1.40 compared with the prior range of $1.05-$1.25. For the fiscal year, management now forecasts adjusted earnings between $4.64 and $4.74 per share, up from the previous guidance of $4.40-$4.60.Further, Target now envisions comparable sales to increase approximately 3.4% during the fourth quarter with full year expected to be just over 1%. Taking into account the 53rd week, Target anticipates total sales to increase more than 9% in the final quarter.Certainly, Target is leaving no stone unturned to attract consumers and attain incremental revenues. We believe that these strategies are likely to bolster the company’s performance and help overcome impediments, thus positioning it well for 2018.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

3143,TGT,"Industry experts are of the opinion that competition in the U.S. grocery industry is going to intensify and supermarket chains will have to constantly revisit their strategy in order to withstand the same. This means, either you “shape up or ship out."" It seems that The Kroger Co. (KR  -  Free Report) has taken stock of the situation and is on its way to give itself a complete makeover. This Cincinnati-based company recently entered into an agreement to sell its convenience stores to focus on its core operations.Per the deal valued $2.15 billion, Kroger will sell more than 700 stores —  operating under the banners of Turkey Hill, Loaf 'N Jug, Kwik Shop, Tom Thumb and Quik Stop — to EG Group, a Blackburn, England-based operator of convenience stores in Europe. Since last October, Kroger has been looking for strategic alternatives for its convenience store operations, including a potential sale.No wonder, Kroger plans to utilize net sale proceeds to buy back shares and lower the debt load. However, management highlighted that supermarket fuel centers and Turkey Hill Dairy are not part of the deal. The transaction is expected to be concluded during the first quarter of Kroger's fiscal year.The decision looks inevitable in a scenario, where the grocery industry has been grappling with stiff competition, volatility in food prices, aggressive promotional environment and declining store count. The industry witnessed a major shake-up when the news of Whole Foods' takeover by Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) surfaced.Kroger, which shares space with Wal-Mart (WMT  -  Free Report) and Target (TGT  -  Free Report), is leaving no stone unturned to attract consumers and attain incremental revenues. The company is expanding store base, and introducing new items, digital coupons and the order online, pick up in store initiative.The company’s “Restock Kroger” program is also gaining traction. Kroger commenced the “We Are Local” campaign; launched and opened a new restaurant concept, Kitchen 1883; and added two new product-lines under “Our Brands” — an apparel brand and a floral line, BLOOM HAUS. The sale of the convenience store business is part of this program only. Kroger is also looking to expand its “Scan, Bag, Pay & Go and Self-CheckOut” program — piloted at 20 stores — to nearly 400 locations this year.We believe that these strategies are likely to bolster Kroger’s performance and drive the stock. In the past three months, shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) have surged 33.6%, outperforming the industry’s growth of 18.3%.

3144,TGT,"In this Global Week Ahead, another 90 fourth quarter (Q4) S&P 500 earnings results hit the tape. The names include GM, Walt Disney and Kellogg.Earnings growth — the stock market’s main locomotive — has been pulling its share price load, easier than ever.The first half of S&P 500 companies has reported excellent results. 75% of firms that have released results reported positive earnings surprises. 80% have reported positive sales surprises.Big U.S. firms have been racking up earnings beats ever since a major cut of their corporate tax rate — down to 21% — at a time when the global economy had begun to heat up.The blended EPS growth rate for Q4 stands at +13.4%. All 11 S&P 500 sectors have reported earnings growth, led by Energy. The blended sales growth rate rests at +7.5%.Due to strengthening “synchronized global growth,” Q4-2017 reports have been impressive across the revenue expansion ledger. Info Tech is the most global of all sectors. Rising oil and commodity prices played out as a key driver for the Energy and & Materials sectors. Higher global interest rates helped Financials.“Bulls” can also take pride in Q1-2018 earnings revisions to outlooks. Overall S&P 500 earnings show the largest increase in bottom-up EPS estimates — over the first month of a quarter — since tracking quarterly bottom-up EPS estimates began in Q2-2002.What of valuation benchmarks? The forward 12-month P/E — after last week’s sell-off — sits at 18.0. The 5-year average is 16.0.Still, “Bears” can start winning, as bond rates rise higher, under market pressure from steeply mounting Federal debt sales. Over the weekend, the Washington Post reported that the U.S. government is “set to borrow nearly $1 trillion this year, an 84% jump from last year.”Yikes! That’s another steam locomotive on the risk market tracks. But it is headed in the wrong direction for stocks.There is plenty of technical share price downside here. For technical support levels to watch, the 50-day S&P 500 moving average is around 2,700; and the 200-day is 2,500.Yes. There is a strong earnings season train on the U.S. economy tracks. But it is not steaming alone anymore. Higher bond rates are able to derail stocks.We have got to watch this… to see if it becomes a train wreck.Zacks #1 Rank (STRONG BUY) Stocks--Below I list three bellwether S&P 500 stocks. Note the difference in long-term Zacks VGM (Value-Growth-Momentum) scores. I emphasized Value scores.JP Morgan Chase (JPM  -  Free Report): With a share price of $114 and a market cap of $396 billion, this is a big component in U.S. financials. The Zacks long-term VGM score is F, with an F in Value.Boeing (BA  -  Free Report): Yes, you read that right. The share price is now $350 on this $207 market cap stock. The Zacks long-term VGM score is D, with an F for Value.Target (TGT  -  Free Report): Lo and behold, a lowly U.S. major retailer to watch. This is a $73 a share stock and the market cap is $39 billion. The long-term Zacks VGM score? That’s scoring an A, with an A for Value.Key global macro—By Thursday, the U.S. needs to find a way to avoiding a government shutdown. This is increasingly complicated. With each turn at bat, the debt ceiling is becoming increasingly binding, as the nation’s debt piles on the roof from the tax cut.After last week’s FOMC meeting, the Fed governor speaker blackout is lifted. This week, two voting FOMC members speak (Dudley, Williams). Three alternate members also speak (Evans, Bullard, George). And so do three non-voting officials (Kaplan, Harker, Kashkari).There are follow-on monetary policy decisions out of Australia, Brazil, Mexico, Russia, and the U.K. to watch out for.

3145,TGT,"The year 2017 can be characterized as the one in which brick-and-mortar retail faced its gravest challenges. Even as stores shuttered and a swathe of mall closures ensued, industry occupants responded to new challenges through a variety of initiatives. What finally emerged was a new online-offline model. No wonder Target Corporation (TGT  -  Free Report) is trying all means to rapidly adapt to the changes in the retail ecosystem.A BackgroundShares of Target did come under pressure following third-quarter fiscal 2017 results.  Despite a positive earnings surprise, investors remained concerned about the year-over-year decline registered in the bottom line and management’s commentary about highly competitive environment in the fourth quarter.The company also did not provide an encouraging earnings outlook for the final quarter due to increased spending related to stores, lower pricing and higher wages that are likely to weigh upon margins.But Target has taken steps that have improved prospects in a big way. The company’s initiatives such as the development of omni-channel capacities, diversification and localization of assortments along with emphasis on flexible format stores bode well. These are going to play a major role in 2018.Efforts to Overcome ImpedimentsTarget intends to deploy resources to significantly develop online platform as well as store facilities to make shopping more convenient for customers. Further, it intends to launch 12 new brands across signature categories. The company plans to expand merchandise assortments with special emphasis on Style, Baby, Kids, and Wellness categories that are performing well.This general merchandise retailer recently launched curbside pickup program, at 50 Twin Cities stores. This program gives customers an option to get ordered items without leaving the comfort of their cars. It has also rolled out Target Restock program that allows customers to restock their shipping box with essential items online and get them delivered at door steps by the next business day for a nominal charge. Further, in order to improve supply chain and expand delivery capabilities, the company had acquired Grand Junction.To tap digital sales this holiday season, Target strengthened relationship with Google by allowing customers nationwide to shop through Google Express, including voice-activated shopping. Target has also made a concerted effort on the front of same-day delivery services by acquiring internet-based grocery delivery service Shipt for $550 million.As a result of these, comparable sales in the combined November/December period rose 3.4%. Healthy store comps, robust traffic and sturdy digital sales can be cited as the reason behind the company’s spectacular performance. Comparable sales across core merchandise categories — Home, Apparel, Food & Beverage, Hardlines and Essentials — were positive.Management now projects fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 adjusted earnings in the band of $1.30-$1.40 compared with the prior range of $1.05 to $1.25 and envisions comparable sales growth of approximately 3.4%.Stock Vs IndustryShares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) have surged 33.9% in the past six months, compared with the industry’s growth of 30.2%. Further, the stock’s VGM Score of A portray its inherent strength.But can Target offer investors better upside in the days ahead? A brief glance at some valuation metrics seems to indicate that this might just be the case. Target with a price to sales ratio of 0.5 compared with that of industry’s 0.8 indicate that the stock has enough upside potential. The stock also looks attractive with respect to a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 14.8x versus industry’s 21.1x. A more-or-less similar picture emerges when comparing EV/EBITDA ratios. Target holds the edge here with an EV/EBITDA ratio of 6.7 lower than 10.5 for the industry.Key PicksG-III Apparel Group, Ltd. (GIII  -  Free Report) delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 6.1% in the trailing four quarters. It has a long-term earnings growth rate of 15% and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

A patch for the bug, which leaves private info and cached files susceptible to attacks, could affect performance by as much as 5% to 30%.

3147,TGT,"After a banner year, Wall Street’s tech big cheese continues to scale new highs in 2018. Computer and software makers, Internet players and chipmakers are having a ball after the repatriation tax holiday in the GOP’s plan is expected to boost stock prices of these companies, while also stimulating the U.S. economy.And if a few worrywarts feel that the stock of the tech biggies have become pricey relative to earnings, then the continued strength in profits and sales might drive share prices higher. This calls for investing in this space for handsome returns.Tech Stocks Soar in New YearTech stocks have easily outperformed the broader equity market’s rally last year. While the Nasdaq soared 29.6%, the broader S&P 500 gained 21.8%. Tech stocks marched higher this year as well, with the Nasdaq closing above the coveted 7,000 mark. The tech-rich index raced to a fresh 1000-point milestone in around eight months, a pace not seen since the tech boom period.Tech heavyweights Netflix, Inc. (NFLX  -  Free Report), Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report), Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report), Google parent Alphabet Inc (GOOGL  -  Free Report), Microsoft Corp (MSFT  -  Free Report) and Facebook Inc (FB  -  Free Report) collectively contributed almost two-third of the points that helped the Nasdaq climb from one 1000-point to another, as per stock-market research firm Birinyi Associates.But, will the lofty valuation lead to a fall in 2018? Wall Street analysts mostly disagree, and rightly so. Netflix is poised for a bigger rise this year as it is far ahead of peers in building subscription video services. The company is also rumored to be acquired by Apple, which may drive its stock further north. Apple, by the way, is benefitting from steady iPhone sales, spurt in services segment and resurgence in Mac and iPad sales.Amazon’s juggernaut, in the meanwhile, seems unstoppable. The company has already shipped more than 5 billion items from its Prime membership service to subscribers and is on the verge of buying Target Corporation (TGT  -  Free Report) following its purchase of Whole Foods.While Alphabet’s strong advertising revenues and improving paid click growth remain growth drivers, Microsoft’s rapid adoption of Azure and Office 365 will remain a key catalyst in the near future. And when it comes to Facebook, the company’s efforts in mobile and live videos continue to pay off.Semiconductor Stocks RallyA steady rally among semiconductors supported the broader tech sector at the beginning of this year, while the PHLX Semiconductor index gained nearly 40% last year. These makers of computer chips utilized in everything from smartphones to self-driving cars, in fact, recently got a boost from a survey by the Semiconductor Industry Association. The report showed that worldwide chip sales climbed 21.5% in November from a year earlier.While all the major semiconductors made headway in recent times, NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report) has progressed by leaps and bounds. The world’s leading graphics chipmaker’s commendable position in areas such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), deep learning and driverless cars industry are making investors optimistic about its prospects.Catalysts Behind the SurgeThe House of Representatives approved the biggest overhaul of the U.S. tax code in 30 years, which mostly supported the gains among the manufacturers of internal technologies —the semiconductor makers and the software industry.As per Statista, corporate taxation rate in the United States was among the world’s highest. This explains why most of the tech majors stash cash overseas. In fact, a Nikkei Asian Review showed that combined overseas cash reserves of major tech companies exceeded the Japanese government’s overall tax revenues in fiscal 2016.But, the headline-grabbing move of the bill was slashing the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. This in turn will make tech players repatriate trillions of dollars held abroad and eventually drive their after-tax earnings. Tech companies can also use this extra cash for research and development and M&A activities.Top 5 Tech Behemoths to Buy NowInvestors, thus, should double down on the hottest tech behemoths after they cross one record after another, primarily, backed by favorable government policy.

3148,TGT,"There is no doubt that 2017 will go down as one of the most remarkable years in the history of U.S. stock trading. The market touched more than 60 daily all-time highs, and the S&P 500 closed higher in every single month for the first time in history. That hot streaked has continued into the first days of the New Year, with our major indexes once again surging to new peaks in 2018.Another trend we have also seen move into 2018 is speculation over major mergers and acquisitions. Total M&A activity was actually relatively quiet in 2017—deals were down about 35% through mid-November—but several Wall Street titans either announced major deals or found themselves at the center of deal-related rumors throughout the year.From industry-shifting moves like Amazon’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) buyout of Whole Foods and CVS Health’s (CVS  -  Free Report) tie-up with Aetna (AET  -  Free Report), to future-focused acquisitions like Gilead’s (GILD  -  Free Report) purchase of CAR-T researcher Kite Pharma and Intel’s INTC deal to buy computer vision firm Mobileye, 2017 had plenty of huge M&A headlines to soak in (also read: 15 of the Best Mergers & Acquisitions of 2017).And so far in 2018, the headlines have continued. The entertainment industry is still reacting to Disney’s (DIS  -  Free Report) acquisition of several major 21st Century Fox (FOXA  -  Free Report) assets, and giants like Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) and Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report) have already caused the rumor mill to swirl.With this in mind, let’s take a look a three huge M&A deals that might happen this year:1.       Apple (Finally) Buying NetflixPeople have been arguing that Apple should use its massive cash pile to make a major media acquisition for years now, and video streaming giant Netflix is typically the first choice among speculators.But Apple has defied these speculators time and time again, opting instead to invest in itself. Indeed, the company recently promised $1 billion to its Apple Music division for the purposes of building out original video content, and its first in-house produced shows are starting to debut now.However, the GOP’s tax reform bill, which includes a one-time allowance for companies to repatriate overseas cash, could be the catalyst needed to inspire a major Apple deal.Earlier this week, shares of Netflix surged after a note on this very topic from Citigroup analysts emerged. The firm’s Jim Suva and Asiya Merchant wrote that Apple is gearing up to make a major acquisition of a car company, video game company, or entertainment company. The analysts suggested that there is as high as a 40% likelihood of Apple acquiring Netflix soon.But is Apple even interested in the company, or will its attention turn elsewhere? 2.       Amazon Targets… Target?As if Amazon’s acquisition of Whole Foods was not enough to satisfy the retail deal rumors, the latest batch of industry whispers point to the e-commerce king going after big-box retailer Target (TGT  -  Free Report).The rumors were sparked by Loup Venture co-founder Gene Munster, who recently published a report highlighting eight predictions for the technology industry this year.“Target is the ideal offline partner for Amazon for two reasons, shared demographic and manageable but comprehensive store count,” Munster argued. “Getting the timing on this is difficult, but seeing the value of the combination is easy.”Amazon burned a lot of its cash with its $13.7 billion purchase of Whole Foods in 2017, but if the financials work out, Target certainly makes sense within the context of the online retailer’s ongoing war with Walmart (WMT  -  Free Report).Nevertheless, another brick-and-mortar acquisition could be a lofty move for the e-commerce company, especially considering how fresh the Whole Foods deal is. Can the internet giant really adapt to traditional retail that quickly? 3.       Time Warner and Comcast Snatch HuluAs mentioned, the entertainment industry is still figuring out what to do next after Disney decided to shell out more than $50 billion in stock for many of Fox’s most important assets. Disney has certainly beefed up the library for its upcoming streaming services, and ESPN’s grasp on the sports world is even tighter with the acquisition of Fox Sports Regional Networks.But one thing that remains unclear is the fate of Hulu, a budding video streaming platform co-owned by Fox, Disney, Comcast (CMCSA  -  Free Report), and Time Warner . Disney bought Fox’s 30% stake in the brand, giving it a controlling 60% stake, but it is unlikely that Comcast and Time Warner will give up on the promising streaming platform just yet.Comcast still owns 30% of Hulu, and through its NBCUniversal subsidiary, it could certainly whip up a Hulu-NBC-Universal streaming service that could compete with Disney and Netflix. Teaming up with Time Warner and its HBO division could add even more firing power.Of course, we have yet to see any indication that Disney is looking to shed its new controlling stake in Hulu, but one would imagine that it could become a bargaining tool in what is sure to be a complicated regulatory approval process.With Netflix, Disney, and Amazon poised to be video streaming leaders in five years’ time, might Comcast and Time Warner look to toss a fourth hat into the ring? Want more stock market analysis from this author?

3149,TGT,"The onset of the holiday season this year seems to have ushered confidence in retailers, who had been reeling under a tough environment characterized by increased competition from online retailers like Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report) and lower footfall.  The five-day holiday period starting from Thanksgiving, followed by Black Friday, Small Business Saturday, Monikerless Sunday and Cyber Monday, marked a good start to a promising holiday season.The spending data from Thanksgiving through Cyber Monday indicates that the U.S. retail industry is ready to shed all worries and embrace a profitable holiday season this year. Data from the nation’s largest retail trade group, National Retail Federation (“NRF”) revealed that more than 174 million Americans shopped in-stores and online during the Thanksgiving holiday weekend, leaving behind its estimate to engage 164 million shoppers.Further, the trade group estimates that Americans spent an average of about $335.47 during the five-day period, with about $250.78 or 75% spent for buying gifts. Among the shoppers, older Millennials aged between 25 and 34 years turned out to be the biggest spenders this year, spending nearly $419.52 on an average.Omni-Channel Retail Is InApart from improving optimism for the holiday season, the five-day shopping fest clearly reflected that omni-channel has become the order of the day and retailers’ investments toward providing a seamless shopping experience, whether online or in-stores, has paid off big time. The long weekend attracted more than 64 million shoppers to make purchases both online and in-stores. Additionally, there were shoppers who chose to buy only at stores or only online. Notably, the weekend saw more than 58 million people shop only online, while over 51 million people chose to shop only in stores.NRF revealed that the omni-channel shoppers spent $82 more on average compared with the people shopping only online. Furthermore, average spending of these shoppers was $49 more than people shopping only in stores.Top Shopping Days – In Store & OnlineThe two top days for in-store shopping this year were Black Friday and Small Business Saturday, when 77 million and 55 million shoppers, respectively, stepped out of their homes to take advantage of the big deals.Meanwhile, online shopping was most popular on Cyber Monday with more than 81 million shoppers using their computers, smart phones and tablets to shop. This popular online shopping day raked in online sales of a record $6.59 million, as per Adobe Analytics. Reflecting a $1 billion (or 16.8%) growth from last year, this day marked the largest online shopping day in U.S. history.Another popular online shopping day, as surveyed by NRF, was Black Friday with more than 66 million shoppers turning to online deals on this day.Further, shopping through mobile devices was the most prominent trend during this year’s Black Friday and Cyber Monday shopping period, as nearly 63% of customers used their smart phones to make buying decisions while 29% used it to actually buy goods.The BeneficiariesNotably, the long weekend had all favorable factors from a pleasant weather to low unemployment rate and improved consumer confidence that encouraged shoppers get going with their shopping lists, in preparation for Christmas. The most popular items on sale during the weekend were televisions, laptops, toys and gaming consoles. Driven by the huge discounts and promotions, retailers witnessed a splurge in traffic and online conversion trends, which is likely to make up for an otherwise tough year.Further, this five-day shopping fest saw trends reverse for some retailers, particularly department stores, which bore the brunt of a tough retailing environment. Notably, department stores were at the top of this season’s top shopping destinations attracting 43% shoppers. This was followed by online retailers (42%), electronic stores (32%), clothing and accessories stores (31%) and discount stores (31%).The Black Friday event witnessed some big sales coming from Best Buy (BBY  -  Free Report), which aired many lucrative offers shoppers couldn’t resist. Much of this is also attributed to the fact that shoppers have lately realized the importance of in-store purchases for large items for their homes. We believe this trend is surely going to benefit Best Buy this holiday season and into 2018.Another stock that is ready to make it big this holiday season, knocking down competition from online giant — Amazon, is Wal-Mart (WMT  -  Free Report). Apart from offering car loading services for groceries, Wal-Mart is pushing hard to compete with Amazon on price and service grounds.The success of Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales not only set the cash registers ringing, it also led the retail stocks trade higher. This was particularly true for Macy’s (M  -  Free Report), Target (TGT  -  Free Report), Best Buy and Home Depot (HD  -  Free Report), that witnessed 4.5%, 1.4%, 1.8% and 1.4%, respectively, after a blockbuster Cyber Monday on Nov 27.This gives all the reasons to be optimistic about the performance of retailers this holiday season. At this juncture, it would be wise to invest in stocks that promise returns this season. Out of the stocks mentioned above, Wal-Mart and Home Depot carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), while Amazon, Target, Macy’s and Best Buy carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Holiday Sales ProjectionOverall, NRF projects retail sales for November and December (excluding autos, gas and restaurant sales) to improve 3.6-4% to $678.75-$682 billion, up from $655.8 billion (or 3.6% growth) last year and better than the five-year average sales growth of 3.5%.Moreover, Deloitte projects holiday season sales to go up as much as 4.5%, while e-commerce sales are envisioned to improve 18-21%.Bottom LineThe start to the 2017 holiday season certainly looks promising. However, it remains to be seen if this momentum is sustained until the Christmas bells ring and how many retail bellwethers can really take the competition to Amazon.Investor Alert: Breakthroughs PendingA medical advance is now at the flashpoint between theory and realization. Billions of dollars in research have poured into it. Companies are already generating substantial revenue, and even more wondrous products are in the pipeline.Cures for a variety of deadly diseases are in sight, and so are big potential profits for early investors.

3150,TGT,"(0:15) - Historic Cyber Monday(3:45) - UPS, USPS, & FedEx: Deliveries Expected(5:30) - Episode Roundup: Podcast@Zacks.comHistory was made during this year’s Cyber Monday, and on this week’s episode of Shopping for Stocks, host and Zacks Editor Maddy Johnson dives into America’s largest-ever online shopping day.Cyber Monday ended up generating some $6.6 billion in sales, according to Adobe Analytics, and that by 10 a.m., $840 million had already been spent online, a 17% year-over-year jump.Overall, this holiday season has been off to a strong start. Online sales saw another record on Black Friday, while foot traffic on that day in stores didn’t fall as much as analysts had feared. If you went out shopping last Friday, you likely noticed that a ton of other people decided to join you. Or at least I did. My local Target (TGT  -  Free Report), Macy’s (M  -  Free Report), Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY  -  Free Report), and Ulta (ULTA  -  Free Report) were packed, with winding lines during those peak doorbuster hours.This rise in retail activity has helped bolster retail stocks, even after not too shabby Q3 earnings results, and shares of Macy’s, JCPenney (JCP  -  Free Report), Target, and Walmart (WMT  -  Free Report) all rallied yesterday after preliminary Black Friday sales results started to creep in.While solid promotions were likely a big driver for a lot of shoppers, the strong economy should also be looked at.

3151,TGT,"Thanks to the burst of heavy discounts and e-commerce boom, retailers are enjoying one of the best holiday seasons ever. This is especially true as Black Friday and Thanksgiving online sales surged to new record of $7.9 billion, up 17.9% year over year, according to Adobe Analytics (read: Retail ETFs Sizzling on Black Friday Deals).Black Friday sales soared 16.9% year over year to $5.03 billion while Thanksgiving Day saw a jump of 18.3% to $2.87 billion in online spending. Most of the online sales came from mobiles and smartphones. Given a solid online shopping frenzy, Cyber Monday could become the largest U.S. online shopping day in history.Adobe Analytics expects Cyber Monday online sales to hit $6.6 billion, surpassing Black Friday sales and increasing 16.5% from last year. The web analytics firm ComScore projects Cyber Monday to fetch $4.5 billion in e-commerce sales, up 22% from $3.68 billion last year. With the same fervor, retailers kicked in Cyber Monday deals early morning and many are stretching those through the Cyber Week.Retailers on a RollOnline behemoth Amazon.com (AMZN  -  Free Report) remained the hottest retailer. The company is rolling out more than 30 ‘Deals of the Day’ and thousands of ‘Lightning Deals’ on Cyber Monday.

Notably, the retailers have started unveiling their plans for the busiest part of the year. Macy's, Inc. (M  -  Free Report) will hire nearly 80,000 seasonal workers to handle the rush, per media report. Notably, during prior-year holiday season the company hired 83,000 workers.The overall decline in seasonal hiring is due the shutting down of stores. However with increase in online shopping, the company will hire 18,000 holiday workers to support online orders, up nearly 20% from the last year holiday season. Improved staffing will aid the company cater to customers in a better way during the hectic holidays.Notably, during the holiday season retailers stay on their toes, flooding the market with offers and promotions. They sweep buyers off their feet with early-hour store openings, huge discounts, promotional strategies, and free shipping on online purchases.

(GPS  -  Free Report) has begun inviting applications for seasonal associate positions at all stores including Gap, Gap Outlet, Banana Republic, Banana Republic Factory and Old Navy across the United States and Canada.

(GME  -  Free Report) are yet to announce seasonal hiring plan.Macy’s Stock PerformanceMacy's shares are riding high of late, driven by previously announced measures revolving around stores closures, cost containment, real estate strategy and investment in omni-channel capabilities to improve performance. In a month, the stock has gained 9.3% but still below the industry’s gain of 12.8% primarily due to investors ongoing concerns about dwindling top and bottom-line results.Now it is to be seen whether the company’s initiatives like integration of operations as well as developing e-commerce business and online order fulfillment centers can drive the top line during all important holiday season.Macy’s currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

3153,TGT,"The past three months have turned out to be an eventful one for Retail-Discount & Variety industry. The industry has advanced 9.3%, outperforming the S&P 500’s gain of 3.5%. Moreover, it also occupies top 9% (24 out of 265) position among the Zacks classified industries. Stocks such as Target Corporation (TGT  -  Free Report), Dollar General Corporation (DG  -  Free Report), PriceSmart, Inc. (PSMT  -  Free Report) and Ross Stores, Inc. (ROST  -  Free Report) have witnessed a gain of 13.3%, 15%, 9% and 15%, respectively. Today we will focus on Target and try to analyze the catalysts that may help the stock to sustain momentum going forward.Strategic Endeavors Well on TrackTarget’s initiatives such as the development of omni-channel capacities, diversification and localization of assortments along with emphasis on flexible format stores bode well. Management plans to expand merchandise assortments with special emphasis on Style, Baby, Kids, and Wellness categories that are performing well. Moreover, the company is also concentrating on rationalization of supply chain, technology and process improvements.These initiatives helped it to continue with upbeat performance in fiscal 2017 as reflected from impressive second-quarter results and an encouraging earnings outlook. Management now envisions third-quarter earnings in the band of 75-95 cents and fiscal 2017 earnings between $4.34 and $4.54 up from $3.80 to $4.20 per share projected earlier.Focus on Digital TransformationWith digital transformation in shopping and consumers splurging online, store and mall traffic has been hit hard. As a result, most retailers including big-box ones are struggling to compete with e-commerce channels. Nevertheless, this transition in buying pattern has persuaded retailers to come up with innovative ways to market products, and Target is no exception to the trend.In a bid to stimulate digital sales this holiday season, Target is strengthening relationship with Google by allowing customers nationwide to shop through Google Express, including voice-activated shopping. Target informed that customers will get their orders delivered within a couple of days, as the items will be shipped from a nearby outlet.Further, Target, which has taken several strategic initiatives to drive performance, recently launched curbside pickup program, at 50 Twin Cities stores. This program gives customers an option to get their ordered items without leaving the comfort of their cars.To avail the service the customers need to place orders via the latest version of Target’s app and then select “Drive Up”. Target will inform the customers when the order is ready for delivery. Once the shopper arrives to the chosen parking spot outside the Target store, an employee will bring the order to the vehicle.Wrapping UpWe believe company is leaving no stone unturned to attract consumers and attain incremental revenues.

3154,TGT,"After the news of an uptick in the U.S. consumer sentiment to 13-year high, retailers got another reason to smile just ahead of the festive season. U.S. retail sales rebounded sharply in September, after a pullback in the month of August, on sturdy auto sales, rising gasoline prices and increased demand for building materials. This clearly indicates that the economy is gathering pace and setting the stage right for an upbeat holiday season.Analysts believe that a buoyant stock market, gradual wage acceleration, fall in the unemployment rate to a 16-year low, and a lift in economic activity post hurricanes were enough to boost consumer sentiment. According to the data released by University of Michigan, consumer sentiment index surged to 101.1 in October from 95.1 in September. All this is music to retailers' ears as they try to make the most of the season, which accounts for a sizeable chunk of yearly revenues and profits.Sturdy Retail SalesThe Commerce Department stated that U.S. retail and food services sales in September increased 1.6% to $483.9 billion, following a revised reading of a 0.1% decline registered in August. However, retail sales increased 4.4% from September 2016. The report suggests that sales at motor vehicles and parts dealers rose 3.6%, while receipts at gasoline stations and sales at building material dealers jumped 5.8% and 2.1%, respectively.Sales at electronics & appliance stores dipped 1.1%, while at clothing shops the same rose 0.4%. Meanwhile, food & beverage stores and general merchandise shops witnessed sales growth of 0.8% and 0.3%, respectively. Sales at non-store retailers climbed 0.5% and increased 9.2% from the prior-year period.Holiday Season: A Likely Bonanza for RetailersWith September retail sales reaching a pinnacle after March 2015,  hopes have been raised for a blissful holiday season. With the ability and willingness seen in consumers to spend more, retailers could hear cash registers jingle this time. Retailers such as Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report), Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report), Macy’s, Inc. (M  -  Free Report), J. C. Penney Company, Inc. (JCP  -  Free Report), Target Corporation (TGT  -  Free Report) and The Gap, Inc. (GPS  -  Free Report) are bracing up for the upcoming holiday season.Be it early-hour store openings, huge discounts, promotional strategies, price matching and free shipping on online purchases, retailers will go the extra mile. Since Christmas is falling on Monday and 32 days after Thanksgiving, shoppers are getting one extra day than last year and an extended weekend for last-minute purchasing.Data compiled by the nation's largest retail trade group, National Retail Federation projects a 3.6-4% rise in November and December sales (excluding autos, gas and restaurant sales) to $678.75-$682 billion, up from $655.8 billion last year and better than the five-year average sales growth of 3.5%. According to Deloitte, sales during the holiday season are likely to increase in the band of 4-4.5%, while e-commerce sales are envisioned to improve 18-21%.Wrapping UpThe holiday season is nothing less than a battlefield for the retailers fighting hard to win over consumers and with technology playing a major role they are fast adopting the omni-channel mantra.With the advent of the holiday season, the retail sector hogs all the attention. So, how about betting your bucks on these lucrative options? Out of the stocks mentioned above, Wal-Mart, Target and Gap carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), while Macy’s has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

3155,TGT,"Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report) is gearing up to manage the rush during the upcoming holiday season. It has announced that it will hire more than 120,000 seasonal workers, who will join more than 125,000 regular, full-time employees.The e-commerce giant will be recruiting across the United States for its fulfillment and sortation facilities and customer service sites.We observe that Amazon’s shares have gained 33.5% year to date, underperforming the 54.0% rally of the industry it belongs to.Hiring Spree Continues at All Major RetailersAmazon appears to be hiring more seasonal employees compared to a few of its competitors. This massive employment plan underscores its confidence regarding its seasonal sales.Moreover, the addition definitely makes sense as the company continues to open new fulfillment centers across the country and invests in logistics, cloud computing and machine learning.Other rival retailers such as Macy's, Inc. (M  -  Free Report), Target Corporation (TGT  -  Free Report), The Gap, Inc. (GPS  -  Free Report) have also announced hiring plans for the upcoming holiday season as they expect higher store traffic based on renewed consumer confidence.According to reports, Target intends to employ 100,000 associates, while Macy's will hire nearly 80,000 seasonal workers to handle the rush. Gap too has begun inviting applications for seasonal associate positions at all stores.Hiring more employees during this period clearly shows the importance of the holiday season for all retailers. It is no less than a battlefield for the retailers fighting hard to win over consumers.Amazon.com, Inc. Price and Consensus  Amazon.com, Inc. Price and Consensus | Amazon.com, Inc. QuoteBottom LineGrowth of the e-commerce industry, with an increasing number of consumers buying things online, is always a favorable factor for companies like Amazon. Product offerings, a superior user experience, bargains and customer feedback have further helped Amazon build a strong position for itself in the fast-growing e-commerce market.Moreover, the recent acquisition of Whole Foods Market by the e-commerce behemoth has given it an easy access to roughly more than 400 stores and a foothold in the grocery business. This is a big positive for the company.Now with the holiday season nearing, we believe Amazon is set to take advantage of the situation.Currently, Amazon has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).

3156,TGT,"While the dotcom era was all about small exciting tech startups, 2017 was possibly the year when getting bigger became truly better. It was also a year when competitors decided that imitation was the best form of offence. So Facebook (FB  -  Free Report) adopted some of Snap Inc.’s (SNAP  -  Free Report) Snapchat’s best features. Also, Microsoft Corporation (MSFT  -  Free Report) entered Apple Inc.’s (AAPL  -  Free Report) arena and Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL  -  Free Report) ventured into creating its own line of products.But a single deal stands out amongst all of this year’s apparently unrelated diversification moves. Amazon.com, Inc.’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) $13.7 billion buyout of Whole Foods is a development that has changed the retail landscape for good. And looking at its fallout, it’s safe to say that it is likely to transform vast swathes of the entire economy.  Transformational Move or Hidden Acknowledgement?Immediately after taking over Whole Foods, Amazon triggered a price war by cutting prices. Smaller competitors like The Kroger Co. (KR  -  Free Report) had to follow suit in the wake of falling share prices. Amazon has also indicated that its Prime Members may receive further discounts, a move which is likely to set off an intense price war. And it didn’t stop there. The likes of Target Corporation (TGT  -  Free Report) are hurrying to enter into agreements which will allow their customers to shop using Google’s Express platform, a move aimed at countering Amazon’s Echo line of products. Moreover, grocery delivery startups are now suddenly in vogue with Target snagging Shipt for $550 million. (Read: Grocery Gunfight: Can Incumbents Fend Off Amazon?)But was the Whole Foods deal simply Amazon’s way of conceding that it needs to become more and more of a large format retailer like Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report)? Surely Amazon’s efforts to develop an online-offline model mimic the Wal-Mart success story in more way than one. Incidentally, both Amazon and Wal-Mart have had a banner year at the bourses, surging by 58.3% and 42.9% year to date.Online-Offline Approach Holds the EdgeThe Whole Foods buy has given Amazon access to 450 stores across the United States, effectively giving it enough offline muscle. However, there’s still a long way to go for Amazon in this area. For example, it offers grocery pickups from only two locations in Seattle. Also, it is yet to perfect the grocery logistics process, which is exactly why the Whole Foods purchase happened in the first place.In fact, Amazon had little choice but to add a chain like Whole Foods to its arsenal. Most of its technology driven food sales initiatives have been ridden with flaws. Even its much vaunted Amazon Go launch has met with little success.Meanwhile, Wal-Mart has intensely focused on its online initiatives this year. Starting 2017, it is offering free two day shipping for all purchases above $35. This is clearly a move designed to counter Amazon Prime’s two-day free shipping feature. Also, it has almost tripled its range of products available offline, which have jumped from eight million to 23 million as of now.All of these initiatives have helped Wal-Mart expand its e-commerce sales by more than 60%. And its offline presence remains as formidable as ever. For instance, it offers grocery pickups from more than 1,100 locations as against only two for Amazon.Could Wal-Mart be a Better Bet Than Amazon?In fact Wal-Mart has been sharpening its grocery delivery chops through a service it launched in China. Its acquisition of Jet.com seems have to made all the difference in this area with Marc Lore, Jet’s erstwhile boss heading its e-commerce initiatives. Further, the big-box retailer will be known as “Walmart Inc."" effective Feb 1, 2018.Management stated that the company’s current name is used only in few legal places as it is more popular as just “Walmart”, given its seamless operations across stores, online as well as its app. Thus, this name change will bring uniformity and reveal Walmart’s unified and omni-channel existence universally. (Read: Wal-Mart Stores to Walmart: What's Behind the Name Change?) The only snag for Wal-Mart could its surging valuations, which at a PEG value of 3.46 is significantly greater than the S&P 500’s figure of 2.01. But with a PEG ratio of 7.11, Amazon is clearly even pricier. The ongoing bull market has dispelled such concerns over valuation time and time again.Tech majors have delivered ever stronger earnings performances, as was in evidence during Wal-Mart’s third quarter results, to justify such exorbitant valuations. Wal-Mart has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The Last WordAmazon’s buyout has signaled a tectonic shift in the retail sector and has set many traditional retailers scurrying for cover. But this is not a universal truth, since the likes of Wal-Mart could put up more than a stiff fight. In fact, with its strong offline-online model, Wal-Mart might just give Amazon a run for its money.5 Medical Stocks to Buy NowZacks names 5 companies poised to ride a medical breakthrough that is targeting cures for leukemia, AIDS, muscular dystrophy, hemophilia, and other conditions.New products in this field are already generating substantial revenue and even more wondrous treatments are in the pipeline.

3157,TGT,"After the news of an uptick in the U.S. consumer confidence to a 17-year high and the latest tax reform that is likely to lower the burden, retailers got another reason to smile as retail sales increased for the third straight month. The better-than-expected November retail sales added extra jingle to the holiday season that is approaching its crescendo with Christmas just a week away.A solid start to the shopping season highlights the underlying economic strength that paved the way for a rate hike for the third time this year. Analysts believe that a buoyant stock market, gradual wage acceleration, improved employment picture and modest inflation are enough to trigger consumer spending. All these sound favorable for retailers, who try to make the most of the season that accounts for a sizeable chunk of yearly revenues and profits.Sturdy Retail SalesThe Commerce Department stated that U.S. retail and food services sales in November advanced 0.8% to $492.7 billion — following a revised reading of 0.5% increase registered in October. Retail sales improved 5.8% from November 2016. The report suggests that sales at electronics & appliance stores rose 2.1%, while receipts at gasoline stations and sales at building material dealers jumped 2.8% and 1.2%, respectively.Sales at motor vehicles and parts dealers dipped 0.2%, while at clothing shops the same rose 0.7%. Meanwhile, sales at food & beverage stores and receipts at restaurants witnessed growth of 0.2% and 0.7%, respectively. Sales at non-store retailers climbed 2.5% and increased 10.4% from the prior-year period.Holiday Season: Likely Bonanza for RetailersHealthy November retail sales only raises hope for a blissful holiday season. A blockbuster Thanksgiving weekend and buoyant Cyber Monday also echo the festive spirit. Be it early-hour store openings, huge discounts, promotional strategies, price matching and free shipping on online purchases, retailers are going that extra mile.Online sales on Thanksgiving Day surged 18.3% to $2.87 billion, per Adobe Analytics. Bargain hunters bought $5.03 billion worth of products online on Black Friday, an increase of 16.9% from last year. The euphoria did not end here, as the shopping frenzy was palpable on Cyber Monday when online sales soared 16.8% to $6.59 billion.Per National Retail Federation (“NRF”) an American spent about an average of $335.47 during the five-day period. Further, shopping through mobile devices was the most prominent trend which developed during this year’s Black Friday and Cyber Monday shopping period, as nearly 63% of customers used their smart phones to make buying decisions, while 29% used it to actually buy goods.Overall, NRF projects a 3.6-4% rise in November and December sales (excluding autos, gas and restaurant sales) to $678.75-$682 billion, up from $655.8 billion last year and better than the five-year average sales growth of 3.5%. Data compiled by eMarketer forecasts 3.1% jump in holiday sales (November and December) to $923.15 billion, while retail e-commerce holiday season sales are anticipated to rise 16.6%.Wrapping UpRetail sector is hogging all the attention, and this time for good reasons. For the time being, the expression ""retail apocalypse” appears to be a thing of past. The sector has certainly been facing the brunt of heightened online competition, lower footfall and changing consumer spending patterns but of late the tables are turning in favor of the retailers.From Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) to Wal-Mart (WMT  -  Free Report), Target (TGT  -  Free Report) to Macy’s (M  -  Free Report) and Gap (GPS  -  Free Report) to Best Buy (BBY  -  Free Report) retailers are gearing up for the busiest part of the year. With digital transformation in shopping retailers are fast adopting the omni-channel mantra. The Retail-Wholesale sector has gained roughly 30% so far in the year, outperforming the S&P 500 index, which advanced 20.7%.As you can see, there are plenty of reasons to be optimistic about the retail sector but what about investing in the space right now?

3158,TGT,"The time has arrived to thankall good things in life. Like every year, most Americans warm up for their celebratory meals and vacations with family and friends on the fourth Thursday of November. Thanksgiving also marks the start of the one month-long holiday season.This year too, savings on gas stations, an improving job market and still-contained inflation should lay a grand spread on the Thanksgiving table.How Pricey Will Thanksgiving Meal be This Year?The average cost of this year’s Thanksgiving feast for 10 is $49.12, down 75 cents from last year’s average of $49.87, according to the American Farm Bureau Federation. The cost is the cheapest in five years. Even the main item of the event, the turkey, is coming at 2 cents less per pound. So, one can expect copious consumption of Turkey this year.However, the U.S. Department of Labor’s Consumer Price Index for food-at-home indicates a 0.5% rise in costs compared with the Farm Bureau’s 1.5% decline. As per an article published on usatoday.com, “the discrepancy is likely a result of the Farm Bureau’s emphasis on a select group of holiday fare.”Forget dine-at-home, dining outside should also be in the cards. Restaurants like Denny’s (DENN  -  Free Report), Bob Evans BOBE, Cracker Barrel (CBRL  -  Free Report), DineEquity DIN, Maggiano's Little Italy of Brinker International Restaurants EAT, Rudy Tuesday  and Ruth's Hospitality Group, Inc. RUTH will be open on Turkey Day. Several of these restaurants offer fat deals on this occasion.Apart from restaurants, stores like Walmart (WMT  -  Free Report) and Target (TGT  -  Free Report) will likely see increased footfall thanks to deals and offerings. How About Thanking Travel & Hotel Demand?According to travel service provider AAA, thanksgiving holiday travel is expected to hit levels not seen in 12 years. Auto travel is expected to increase 3.2% from last year while air travel will likely jump 5%. The auto club projects that about 89% will take long car trips while almost 8% will take to the skies (read: Will Airline ETF Crash on Subdued Q3 or Take Off on Value?).The average price of hotels rated by AAA as three-diamond jumped 14% a night, as indicated by auto club.

3159,TGT,"Thanksgiving is just round the corner, marking the start of a busy period for retail stocks. While Thanksgiving is the unofficial start of the holiday shopping season, Black Friday, the day after Thanksgiving, is one of the busiest shopping days of the year.According to a survey released by the National Retail Federation and Prosper Insights & Analytics last week, about 164 million people or 69% of Americans plan to shop over the weekend which includes Thanksgiving Day, Black Friday, Small Business Saturday and Sunday as well as Cyber Monday. Both online and brick-and-mortar stores provide competitive offers and discounts during this period to attract customers.Black Friday is expected to be the busiest day this weekend with about 115 million people planning to shop this day. While 71 million people plan to shop on Saturday, Cyber Monday is expected to see about 78 million shoppers. With just 2% of consumers having completed their holiday shopping, Black Friday will be a very important day for e-commerce stocks and retailers with many companies reporting their highest profits on this day. The holiday season gives retailers the opportunity to improve traffic and bring in the numbers through promotions, early-store openings, heavy discounts, as well as free shipping on online purchases. People queuing up outside stores from the wee hours to take advantage of attractive deals and offers including early bird discounts is not an uncommon sight during this period.Retailers are gearing up for the holiday season with companies like Target Corporation (TGT  -  Free Report) announcing the hiring of additional team members for the peak holiday season. Target has introduced Weekend Deals this year featuring marquee prices on new items every weekend based on what customers are looking for at different times throughout the season. The company also said it would be offering some of its lowest prices of the year during big events like Black Friday and Cyber Monday.

3160,TGT,"Today, the phrase “Black Friday” is synonymous with the hoards of U.S. shoppers who descend upon retail businesses, shopping centers, and downtown shopping hubs in the hopes of finding the best deals on all of their holiday gifts during the one-day shopping festival.However, Black Friday has not always meant marked-down TV and toys.The history of the phrase Black Friday and where it originated is not set in stone, but research puts the basic—and relatively contemporary—timeline of the massive shopping phenomenon in simple enough order.An 1860s Gold Crisis Black Friday, as its name might suggest, originally marked an awful day for the U.S. economy. The phrase initially referred to the day the American gold market crashed on Friday, Sept. 24, 1869.As the story goes, two Wall Street financial speculators, Jim Fisk and Jay Gould, bought up as much gold as they could in hopes of driving up U.S. gold prices and selling their positions at a massive profit. The idea was simple enough, but Fisk and Gould’s run on the gold market ended up causing a substantial crash.When things got out of hand, President Grant decided to have the U.S. Treasury sell $4 million worth of gold on the next trading day. News circulated quickly, which caused Wall Street and the stock market to tumble. “Possibly no avalanche ever swept with more terrible violence,” the New York Herald later wrote of the day that would become known as Black Friday.In The BlackEarly 20th-century holiday shopping trends helped shape the modern use of the term Black Friday. The idea and phrase stems from the basic terms that businesses use to mark profitability. “Black” meant retail stores and companies were able to finally get “into the black,” or turn a profit, when shoppers began their holiday spending.Nevertheless, this is still not the real genesis of all of the Black Friday ads and deals most U.S. retail businesses run today.Upset Police The modern phrase related to this day of frenzied shopping seems to trace back to upset police officers. Starting in the 1950s, Philadelphia police began to refer to the day after Thanksgiving as “Black Friday,” and their reasoning was clear.The department came to dread the influx of suburban shoppers that flooded the city, as well as the tourists who began arriving for the Army-Navy football game, which was often played in the city. Philadelphia police officers resented the long hours and increased congestion the day after Thanksgiving brought.The phrase caught fire in the area quickly, with retail stores trying unsuccessfully to flip the phrase into a happy term meant to encourage more shoppers to come in on the days following Thanksgiving.Black Friday ShoppingStill, the official Black Friday deals that the likes of Best Buy (BBY  -  Free Report), Target (TGT  -  Free Report), Walmart (WMT  -  Free Report), Macy’s (M  -  Free Report), and almost every U.S. retailer promote did not catch on until the 1980s.There was no official start to the current trend of discounts and hype, but most place it sometime near the tail end of the 80s, when retailers found a way to rebrand the phrase into a sales-producing positive.Since the 80s, Black Friday has morphed into something insane. Deals now start on Thanksgiving Day and run all the way through Small Business Saturday/Sunday into Cyber Monday. The shopping holiday has even spread to the U.K. and places that do not celebrate Thanksgiving.However, it wasn’t until the early 2000s, after years of marketing, that Black Friday overtook the Friday before Christmas as the most popular shopping day of the year.Now, Black Friday has evolved into its own Thanksgiving shopping season that tends to help retail stocks surge during the last two weeks of November. In fact, since 2007, retail is the top U.S. equities sector during the week before and after Black Friday, according to a CNBC analysis.This year—despite a wave of pushback and an overall retail shift—the National Retail Federation estimates 164 million people will shop on Black Friday, which is up from 87 million in 2014.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

3162,TGT,"Walmart (WMT  -  Free Report) shares surged over 9% to reach a new all-time high on Thursday after the company reported solid third-quarter results, which were driven in large part by the strength of its core in-store business.The Arkansas-based retailer posted $123.18 billion in quarterly revenues and adjusted EPS of $1.00 per share, which both beat Wall Street expectations. Walmart also raised its full-year earnings guidance to help its stock price hit a new intraday trading high of $98.01 per share (also read: Walmart (WMT  -  Free Report) Stock Gains on Solid Q3 Earnings & Raised View).Investors were clearly pleased with Walmart’s Q3 gains, and many were likely excited by the fact that the company’s online sales jumped 50%—driven by acquisitions and a greater amount of offerings. This e-commerce growth is needed to help Walmart try to compete against Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report), but online sales only accounted for $14 billion in revenues.With that said, many investors must have loved what they saw from the rest of Walmart’s third-quarter, as few would place their hopes in a business segment that currently amounts to roughly 3% of total sales.Core Business Walmart’s domestic sales popped 4.3% to $77.72 billion. The company’s international revenues jumped 4.1% to $29.55 billion, while Walmart’s bulk-buying outlet Sam’s Club saw its sales climb 4.4% to $14.86 billion.U.S. same-store sales rose for the 13th-consecutive quarter, and Walmart also delivered its biggest year-over-year sales growth at established domestic stores in over eight years. Walmart brand comparable store sales also rose, fueled in large part by increased food sales. Walmart noted that food sales had their best quarter in almost six years.The retail giant’s grocery business continues to help bring customers to its stores at a time when the likes of Target (TGT  -  Free Report) and Amazon are adding to their food offerings.Some of these grocery gains were attributed to hurricane-related sales. But food sales were also spurred by Walmart’s improved online grocery business—with the company set to double the number of curbside grocery pick-up locations to 2,000 by next year.""Market share in the critical food category continues to grow as the expansion of its buy-online/pick-up in store capability is driving increased sales, and the focus on improving working capital continues,"" Moody analyst Charlie O'Shea wrote in a note to clients.""As usual, we expect Walmart to largely set the tone on multiple fronts and in multiple categories for the Holiday season.""Bottom Line Once written off by some as archaic, Walmart proved it is more than capable of competing in this shifting retail environment where Amazon and e-commerce powers generate most of the headlines.Walmart investors should also be pleased to see that one of the world’s biggest retailers is committed to improving its core in-store business while it quickly bolsters its e-commerce portfolio, with eyes on the future.Zacks’ Best Private Investment IdeasWhile we are happy to share many articles like this on the website, our best recommendations and most in-depth research are not available to the public.Starting today, for the next month, you can follow all Zacks' private buys and sells in real time.

3164,TGT,"Costco Wholesale Corporation’s (COST  -  Free Report) growth strategies, sturdy comparable-store sales (comps) performance, strong membership trends and higher penetration of Citi Visa co-brand card program are the pillars that reinforce its position. The company has one of the highest square footage growth in the industry and remains committed toward opening new clubs in domestic and international markets. These endeavors are likely to fuel top-line growth.Analysts polled by Zacks expect second-quarter and fiscal 2018 revenues to come in at $32.64 billion and $138.28 billion, reflecting an increase of roughly 9.7% and 7.2%, respectively. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is currently pegged at $1.43 for the quarter under review and $6.69 for the fiscal, reflecting an improvement of approximately 22.2% and 15%, respectively.Sturdy Comps Induce ConfidenceCostco seems somewhat unfazed by tough retail scenario, comprising soft traffic and inclination toward online shopping. This Issaquah, WA-based company continued with positive comps performance driven by improved store traffic and average transaction size. Comps for December increased 11.5%, following an increase of 10.8% in November, 7.5% in October and 8.9% in September. Notably, net sales increased 14.3%, 13.2%, 10.1% and 12.1% in the respective months.The operator of membership warehouses commenced fiscal 2018 on an upbeat note with both the top and bottom lines beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third straight quarter, consequently sidelining the woes which have gripped the brick-and-mortar retailers for some time now. Moreover, both sales and earnings have also increased year over year.We noted that total revenue grew 13.2% during the first quarter of fiscal 2018, following an increase of 15.7% and 7.8% in the fourth and third quarter of fiscal 2017. Earnings per share improved 16.2% in the first quarter, after registering growth of 17.5% and 12.9% in the preceding two quarters.Costco Wholesale Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Costco Wholesale Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Costco Wholesale Corporation QuoteStrategic EndeavorsCostco continues to be one of the dominant retail wholesalers based on the breadth and quality of merchandise offered. In fact, the company’s strategy to sell products at heavily discounted prices has helped it to remain on growth track. Moreover, analysts believe that the company is likely to gain from Wal-Mart’s (WMT  -  Free Report) latest decision to shut 63 of 660 Sam’s Club outlets in the United States over the next few weeks.It is also gradually expanding e-commerce capabilities in the United States, Canada, UK, Mexico, Korea and Taiwan. Consequently, comparable e-commerce sales have surged 33.3%, 39%, 31% and 30% in December, November, October and September, respectively.Additionally, a differentiated product range enables Costco to provide an upscale shopping experience for its members, consequently resulting in market share gains and higher sales per square foot. Notably, membership fees have increased 9.8% in the first quarter of fiscal 2018, and 13.3% and 4.2% in the fourth and third quarter of fiscal 2017.Wrapping UpCertainly, Costco’s sound fundamentals placed the stock favorably in 2018. Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) are hovering close to its 52-week high of $195.35, and there is no reason why the stock cannot breach that mark in the near term.

3166,TGT,"A glimpse of The Kroger Company’s (KR  -  Free Report) share price movement reveals that it has plunged over 38% so far in the year compared with the industry’s gain of 7.9%. So what is behind the debacle? We have tried to ascertain major reasons that can be held responsible for the stock’s dismal show in the bourses. Definitely, management is not sitting idle and trying all means to pull the company out of the doldrums. Let’s analyze the stock.What’s Bothering the Stock?Margins at StakeStiff competition, volatility in food prices, aggressive promotional environment and waning store traffic are making things tough for Kroger. The company’s shares came under immense pressure, after the news of Whole Foods Market buyout by Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report) spread through the market. The deal has helped positioned Whole Foods’ better against the likes of Kroger, Target Corporation (TGT  -  Free Report) and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report).Analysts are looking at this mammoth acquisition as an amalgamation between online marketplace and physical stores that could bring a massive change in the retail industry going forward. In order to stay in the race, Kroger has to revisit strategies and prepare itself for more aggressive price war ahead at the cost of margins. Not surprisingly, Amazon has already initiated price cuts across various Whole Foods products.Waning Bottom LineThis is evident from second-quarter fiscal 2017 results, wherein the bottom line continued to decline year over year for the fourth straight quarter. After falling 4.7% and 7% in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2016, respectively, bottom line plunged 18.3% and 17% in the first and second quarters of fiscal 2017, respectively.Nevertheless, the company continues to project fiscal 2017 adjusted earnings in the band of $2.00-$2.05 per share down from $2.12 reported in the prior year. As a result, not much movement was noticed in the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the past seven days. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.98 and $1.99 for fiscal 2017 and 2018 has declined by 1 and 3 cents, respectively.Debt BurdenApart from the aforementioned reasons, Kroger’s debt level may also elevate investors’ concern. The company ended second-quarter fiscal 2017 with a total debt of $14,048 million compared with $12,420 million in the year-ago period. As a result, interest expense rose 19% year over year in the quarter under review, following an increase of 14.2% in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 and 11.5% and 16% in the fourth and third quarters of fiscal 2016, respectively.We also noted that the company’s debt-to-equity ratio, which represents the proportion of debt and equity it is deploying to finance its assets, is displaying an increasing trend — 1.88, 2.09, 2.10, 2.19, 2.29 in the second, third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2016, and first and second quarters of fiscal 2017, respectively. Higher debt level may adversely impact the company’s credit worthiness and make it more susceptible to the macro-economic factors and competitive pressures.Strategic Endeavors Nevertheless, Kroger remains well on track to boost market share by expanding store base, introducing new items, digital coupons, and order online, pick up in store initiative. We note that total sales grew 3.9% during the second quarter of fiscal 2017, following an increase of 4.9% in the preceding quarter and 5.5% in the final quarter of fiscal 2016.The second quarter also marked the fourth straight quarter of revenue beat. Top line continues to improve fueled by Customer 1st strategy, digital endeavors and recent buyouts. Excluding fuel center sales, total sales rose 3.8%. Digital revenue surged 126% on the back of ClickList. The company has over 813 ClickList and ExpressLane locations.Management continues to deploy capital to concentrate more on remodels, merchandising, and other viable projects. Kroger remains optimistic about the acquisitions of Vitacost.com, an online retailer of vitamins and health-oriented products; Harris Teeter, a grocery chain, and the merger of Modern HC Holdings with Axium Pharmacy Holdings Inc., a specialty pharmacy. Kroger also acquired Roundy's, the grocery store operator.Given the pros and cons embedded stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Also, the international body commented in its monthly report that increasing global demand for crude and OPEC decision to curb the output would eventually balance the inventories.Fears over Irma, North Korea EaseMoreover, investors have regained their appetite for risk following weaker than expected impact of Hurricane Irma and a nuclear missile from North Korea anticipated to be launched over the weekend failed to materialize. Apple’s Shares Decline Meanwhile, shares of Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) lost 1.3% after investors raised concerns regarding high launch price of iPhone X.

3168,TGT,"Retail is no more restricted to brick-&-mortar. The scenario has drastically changed with the advancement of technology and digital transformation that are playing key roles in changing consumer shopping pattern. Consumers now prefer to shop online from the comfort of their homes rather than hopping from one store to another. Nevertheless, this transition has persuaded retailers to come up with innovative ways to market products, and Target Corp. (TGT  -  Free Report) is no exception to the trend.But before jumping on how Target is bracing itself for 2018 retail war, let’s analyze the changing retail scenario.Changing Retail EcosystemThe major disruption in the brick-&-mortar format or to say in a more sophisticated manner, the reason behind the today’s ultra-competitive retail environment is because of Amazon.com (AMZN  -  Free Report). The e-commerce giant is aggressively making headway into retail space be it grocery, books, clothes and accessories or electronics, you name it and you have it. With its compelling pricing strategy and the buyout of Whole Foods, the online retail bellwether has caused a tectonic shift in the retail landscape. Moreover, through Prime membership program it is trying to build a loyal customer base and provide them lucrative deals, same-day delivery options and others.To tackle the growing Amazon dominance, Wal-Mart (WMT  -  Free Report) is striving hard to give itself a complete makeover by moving beyond brick-&-mortar and to resonate with customers’ evolving shopping patterns. This supermarket giant has long been undertaking aggressive efforts to facilitate shopping through miscellaneous channels.This is well-evident from its constant e-commerce initiatives — including buyouts, alliances, and improved delivery and payment systems. Evidently, Walmart’s buyouts of Bonobos, ShoeBuy, Moosejaw, ModCloth and Jet.com underscore its quest to build an impressive digital brand portfolio. Its Walmart Pay mobile payment system, and Mobile Express Returns program further highlight its focus on accelerating online business along with making shopping easier and faster. Further to fortify position in online grocery business, Wal-Mart acquired a delivery start-up Parcel, Inc., which specializes in same-day delivery.Target Sharpening the EdgeNo wonder Target is trying all means to rapidly adapt to the changes in the retail ecosystem. We believe that initiatives such as the development of omni-channel capacities, diversification and localization of assortments along with emphasis on flexible format stores, bode well. The company intends to deploy resources to significantly develop online platform as well as store facilities to make shopping more convenient for customers. We observed that comparable digital channel sales surged 24% during the third quarter of fiscal 2017 and added 0.8 percentage points to comparable sales.This general merchandise retailer recently launched curbside pickup program, at 50 Twin Cities stores. This program gives customers an option to get ordered items without leaving the comfort of their cars. It has also rolled out Target Restock program that allows customers to restock their shipping box with essential items online and get them delivered at door steps by the next business day for a nominal charge. Further, in order to improve supply chain and expand delivery capabilities, the company had acquired Grand Junction.To tap digital sales this holiday season, Target strengthened relationship with Google by allowing customers nationwide to shop through Google Express, including voice-activated shopping. Wal-Mart and Home Depot (HD  -  Free Report) are also using Google's voice-activated shopping platform. Target has also made a concerted effort on the front of same-day delivery services by acquiring internet-based grocery delivery service Shipt for $550 million.Certainly, Target is leaving no stone unturned to attract consumers and attain incremental revenues. We believe that these strategies are likely to bolster the company’s performance and drive the stock further.

3170,TGT,"More than a month has gone by since the last earnings report for Target Corporation (TGT  -  Free Report). Shares have added about 15.6% in that time frame, outperforming the market.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to the stock's next earnings release, or is it due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Target Q3 Earnings & Sales Beat EstimatesTarget Corporation continued with its upbeat performance in fiscal 2017, as reflected from its better-than-expected third-quarter results. The company’s strategic endeavors, turnaround plan as well as improved traffic trends remain the driving factors.Despite a positive earnings surprise, investors remained concerned about the year-over-year decline in the bottom line and management’s commentary about highly competitive environment in the fourth quarter. Further, the company did not provide an encouraging earnings outlook for the final quarter due to increased spending related to stores, lower pricing and higher wages that are likely to weigh upon margins. However, the company raised its full year projection providing some cushion.Let’s Unveil the PictureThe company posted third-quarter adjusted earnings of 91 cents a share that came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 86 cents but declined 13.1% from the prior-year period. We observed that rise in cost of sales, increased SG&A expenses and higher interest expense hurt the bottom line.The company generated total sales of $16,667 million that also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $16,613 million and rose 1.4% from the year-ago quarter.Target’s initiatives such as the development of omni-channel capacities, diversification and localization of assortments along with emphasis on flexible format stores and cost reduction are encouraging. During the quarter, the company remodeled 37 stores and opened 12 new stores. In a bid to stimulate its digital sales this holiday season, Target is also strengthening its relationship with Google by allowing customers nationwide to shop through Google Express including voice-activated shopping.The company also rolled out Target Restock program that allows customers to restock their shipping box with essential items online and get them delivered at door steps by the next business day for a nominal charge. These endeavors are important due to changing retail landscape that encompasses increasing online penetration and aggressive pricing that may hurt sales and margins.Notably, comparable sales for the quarter increased 0.9% compared with 0.2% decline witnessed in the year-ago period. The number of transactions rose 1.4%, while the average transaction amount declined 0.5%. Comparable digital channel sales surged 24% and added 0.8 percentage points to comparable sales.Gross profit inched up 1% to $4,955 million, while gross margin contracted 10 basis points to 29.7% on account of pricing and promotion pressure coupled with cost of digital fulfillment, partly mitigated by cost containment efforts. The company hinted that gross margin is likely to remain under pressure during the fourth quarter as well.Operating income plummeted 17.8% to $869 million, while operating margin shriveled 120 basis points to 5.2%.Target’s debit and credit card penetration remained flat at 12.9% and 11.4%, respectively. Total REDcard penetration climbed to 24.2% from 24.3% in the year-ago quarter.Other Financial DetailsDuring the quarter, Target repurchased shares worth $171 million and paid dividends of $339 million. The company still had about $4 billion remaining under its $5 billion share buyback program. The company ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $2,725 million, long-term debt and other borrowings of $11,277 million and shareholders’ investment of $11,137 million. The company made a capital investment of $800 million during the quarter.A Glance at the Outlook Management now anticipates fourth quarter comparable sales to be flat to up 2%. The company expects fiscal 2017 comparable sales to be flat to up 1%.Target now envisions fourth quarter earnings in the band of $1.05-$1.25 and fiscal 2017 earnings between $4.40 and $4.60 up from $4.34-$4.54 per share projected earlier.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?It turns out, fresh estimates have trended downward during the past month. There has been one revision lower for the current quarter.Target Corporation Price and Consensus  Target Corporation Price and Consensus | Target Corporation QuoteVGM ScoresAt this time, Target's stock has a nice Growth Score of B, though it is lagging a lot on the momentum front with a F.  The stock was also allocated a grade of A on the value side, putting it in the top 20% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of B. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.Our style scores indicate that the stock is more suitable for value investors than growth investors.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock. The magnitude of these revisions also indicates a downward shift. Notably, the stock has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We are expecting an inline return from the stock in the next few months.

3171,TGT,"Target Corp. (TGT  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release third-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Nov 15. Well, the obvious question that comes to mind is will this operator of general merchandise stores be able to deliver positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported.In the trailing four quarters, the company outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 15.1%.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third quarter is pegged at 85 cents down from $1.04 reported in the year-ago period. Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $16,521 million compared with $16,441 million in the prior-year quarter. Target envisions third-quarter earnings in the band of 75-95 cents a share.Factors at PlayTarget’s initiatives such as the development of omni-channel capacities, diversification and localization of assortments along with emphasis on flexible format stores are encouraging. Additionally, the company intends to deploy resources to significantly develop online platform as well as store facilities to make shopping more convenient for customers.In a bid to stimulate its digital sales this holiday season, Target is also strengthening its relationship with Google by allowing customers nationwide to shop through Google Express including voice-activated shopping. We observed that comparable digital channel sales surged 32% during the second quarter of fiscal 2017 and added 1.1 percentage points to comparable sales.Meanwhile, Target plans to expand merchandise assortments with special emphasis on Style, Baby, Kids and Wellness categories that are performing well. Also, the company has adopted a cost reduction strategy including rationalization of supply chain, technology and process improvements.The company also rolled out Target Restock program that allows customers to restock their shipping box with essential items online and get them delivered at door steps by the next business day for a nominal charge. These endeavors are of vital importance with regard to sales and margins, which might be affected by adverse retail conditions like increasing online penetration and aggressive pricing.Target Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Target Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Target Corporation QuoteWhat Does the Zacks Model Suggest?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Target is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Target carries a Zacks Rank #2 but an Earnings ESP of -1.60%, thus making surprise prediction difficult.Stocks With Favorable CombinationHere are three companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Burlington Stores, Inc. (BURL  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +1.27% and a Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The Home Depot, Inc. (HD  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.57% and a Zacks Rank #2.Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.96% and a Zacks Rank #3.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars? Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers.

3172,TGT,"The Q3 earnings season has reached the tail end for all sectors save retail, which has seen about half of its total releases. Total earnings for the sector reported so far are up 2.3% from the same period last year on 10.1% revenue growth with 81.8% beating EPS estimates and 63.6% beating revenue estimates.While earnings growth is well below the last reporting cycle and the four-quarter average, revenue growth has been accelerating compared with the other recent periods. Additionally, the quarter so far has witnessed an above-average proportion of positive surprises, implying that the momentum has been carried forward. Further, the estimates revision trend for the fourth quarter has been favorable, with earnings estimates holding up a lot better relative to other comparable periods (read: Amazon ETFs to Buy on Q3 Blowout Results).This is especially true given the impressive stock market performance of department store operators like Macy’s (M  -  Free Report), Nordstrom (JWN  -  Free Report), Kohl’s (KSS  -  Free Report), J.C. Penney (JCP  -  Free Report) and others following their quarterly releases. Nordstrom and J.C. Penney posted better-than-expected results. Meanwhile, Kohl's beat on revenues but missed on earnings, while Macy's beat on earnings and missed on revenues.The strength in these stocks led to smooth trading in the broad retail sector. In fact, retail ETFs — SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT  -  Free Report), VanEck Vectors Retail ETF (RTH  -  Free Report) and PowerShares Retail Fund (PMR  -  Free Report) — added 0.7%, 1.5% and 0.6%, respectively, over the past five trading days.Given that earnings are the most important drivers of stock performance, it is necessary to look at the expected surprise of big-box retailers that are likely to report this week. These also have the potential to push related ETFs upward or downward (see: all the Consumer Discretionary ETFs here).A Peek into Earnings SurprisesReports from Home Depot (HD  -  Free Report), Target (TGT  -  Free Report), Wal-Mart (WMT  -  Free Report), and Foot Locker (FL  -  Free Report) will be crucial for the sector this week.According to our surprise prediction methodology, a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) when combined with a positive Earnings ESP increases chances of an earnings beat. A Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) is best avoided going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Home Depot is slated to report earnings before the bell on Nov 14. The stock has a Zacks Rank #2 and an Earnings ESP of +0.57%, indicating higher chances of beating estimates. The company saw positive earnings estimate revision of a penny over the past three months for the to-be-reported quarter and delivered a positive earnings surprise in each of the last four quarters, with an average beat of 3.77%. The stock has a VGM Style Score of A.Target has a Zacks Rank #2 and an Earnings ESP of -1.60%, indicating less chances of beating estimates. The stock has seen solid earnings estimate revision of seven cents for the to-be-reported quarter over the past three months and delivered a positive earnings surprise of 15.11% in the last four quarters. It has a top VGM Style Score of A. The company is expected to report before the opening bell on Nov 15 (read: Profit from Retailers' Defaults With These ETFs).Wal-Mart is scheduled to report on Nov 16 before market open. It has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of +0.96%, indicating a reasonable chance of beat. The company delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 1.99% in the last four quarters but witnessed negative earnings estimate revision of a penny over the past three months for the to-be-reported quarter. It has a VGM Style Score of B.Foot Locker, which will likely report earnings on Nov 17 before the opening bell, has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of -0.48%, indicating lower chances of beating estimates. The stock has seen negative earnings estimate revision of 41 cents over the past 90 days for the yet-to-be-reported quarter and delivered an average negative earnings surprise of 6.55% in the last four quarters. Additionally, the stock has a VGM Style Score of B.  ConclusionWith notable earnings surprises in the cards and a favorable stock rank for big-box retailers, the ETF space will continue to see good trading in the days ahead even though the sector has an ugly Zacks Rank in the bottom 0%. Further, the ETFs mentioned above have favorable ranks. Notably, RTH and ZRT have a Zacks ETF Rank of 2 while PMR has a Zacks ETF Rank of 3.Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week.

3173,TGT,"Sluggish store traffic, stiff competition from online retailers, aggressive pricing strategy and changing consumer spending patterns are the headwinds plaguing the retail sector. Nevertheless, Tapestry, Inc. (TPR  -  Free Report) looks quite disciplined in its approach when it comes to tackling prevailing hurdles.The company has undertaken transformational initiatives revolving around products, stores and marketing. These are likely to fuel top-line growth in fiscal 2018. Analysts polled by Zacks expect second-quarter and fiscal 2018 revenues to come in at $1.77 billion and $5.82 billion, reflecting an increase of roughly 33.7% and 29.7%, respectively.CatalystsAs one of the leading American marketers of fine accessories and gifts, Tapestry boasts a proven strategy of investing in stores to enhance sales output through product innovation, a compelling pricing strategy, new merchandise assortments and a cost-effective global sourcing model. We believe that these strategies will help drive comparable-store sales and operating margins in the long term. The company’s growth drivers include expansion of global distribution model and venturing into under-penetrated markets.Tapestry is undergoing a brand transformation and is introducing modern luxury concept stores in key markets. The acquisition of Stuart Weitzman and Kate Spade has been accretive to performance and is being viewed as a significant step toward becoming a multi-brand company. Management now expects to attain run-rate synergies of approximately $100-$115 million from Kate Spade buyout in fiscal 2019 compared with the prior view of $50 million. Management expects fiscal 2018 revenue to increase approximately 30% year over year to $5.8-$5.9 billion.Additionally, the company is aggressively expanding e-commerce platform. It also plans to undertake strategic measures involving, upgrading of core technology platforms and enhancement of international supply chain.ObstaclesAlthough, Tapestry reported 15th straight quarter of positive earnings surprise when it reported first-quarter fiscal 2018 results, the bottom line declined 6.7% year over year due to higher SG&A expenses. Even an increase in the top line failed to act as a savior. We also noted that total sales fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fifth successive quarter.Analysts pointed that drop in comparable-store sales at Coach brand was the culprit behind lower-than-expected sales. Net sales for Coach declined 3% year over year.Bottom LineDespite the tough retail scenario, shares of Tapestry have surged 29.3% in a year compared with the industry’s growth of 4.6%. Further, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock’s long-term earnings per share growth rate of 11.3% portray its inherent strength.Interested in the Retail Space, Check TheseTarget Corporation (TGT  -  Free Report) delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 10.2% in the trailing four quarters.

3174,TGT,"Shares of Kroger (KR  -  Free Report) were up more than 3.5% in morning trading Wednesday after the grocery chain reaffirmed its 2017 forecast and said that it was considering the sale of its convenience store business.For fiscal 2017, Kroger projects adjusted earnings to fall in the range of $2 per share to $2.05 per share. The company expects identical supermarket sales, excluding fuel, to improve by 0.5% to 1%.In a prepared statement, Kroger management also confirmed that the company is working with Goldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report) to explore strategic alternatives, one of which would be to offload its 780-store, 18-state convenience store portfolio.“Considering the current premium multiples for convenience stores, we feel it is our obligation as a management team to undertake a review,” CFO Mike Schlotman said.On top of its core supermarkets and convenience stores, Kroger operates several retail health clinics, jewelry stores, and pharmacies.Kroger is also detailing its three-year goals at this week’s annual investor meeting. Dubbed the “Restock” plan, Kroger is looking to couple cost savings in certain business segments with roughly $9 billion in capital investments. The company hopes that the plan will generate over $4 billion in free cash flow over the next three years.“We have the scale, the data, the physical assets and human connection to win,” said CEO Rodney McMullen. “Restock Kroger builds on our strengths and strategically repositions Kroger to accelerate our customer-centered efforts in order to create shareholder value.”One of Kroger’s primary goals for Restock is to improve its in-store experience. As brick-and-mortar retailers continue to adapt to e-commerce, especially recently in the grocery space, a key strategy has been to focus on bettering the traditional shopping environment.So far, it looks like Kroger has some interesting ideas on this front. The company intends on expanding its “Scan, Bag, Go” program, which is being piloted at 20 stores, to nearly 400 locations next year. “Scan, Bag, Go” allows shoppers to check out items with a handheld scanner as they walk around the store, a concept that is eerily reminiscent of Amazon’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) Amazon Go experiment. Kroger also plans to invest nearly $500 million in better pay and training for its store employees.Today’s gain comes on the back of the news that fellow supermarket chain Walmart (WMT  -  Free Report) was reaffirming its own guidance for fiscal 2018 and updating its sales goals for fiscal 2019. Despite a brutal pricing war involving Amazon’s Whole Foods, big box retailers like Walmart and Target (TGT  -  Free Report), and discount chains like Aldi, some grocery giants are clearly finding success.Currently, Kroger is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and sports an “A” grade for Value in our Style Scores system. The company’s P/E ratio of 10.30 and P/S ratio of 0.15 present a discount to the industry and market averages.Want more stock market analysis from this author?

3177,TGT,"Brick and mortar retailers have been hit hard by the Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) effect and many stores have as a result bitten the dust. Target (TGT  -  Free Report) may have shut a few itself, but that isn’t a good enough reason to think that the retailer has bowed out. The following analysis shows that not only will the company continue fighting, but like Walmart (WMT  -  Free Report), it will also become a force to reckon with in the increasingly omnichannel retail market.The Turnaround PlanWeak sales, weak gross margins (an indication that the company is heavily discounting goods to move stock, or high procurement cost related to new brands, or both) and relatively steady EPS despite a steadily declining share count aren’t things that inspire confidence. But CEO Brian Cornell has outlined a turnaround plan, and execution appears to be on track.“We’re investing in our business with a long-term view of years and decades, not months and quarters,” Cornell said in a nutshell. “We’re putting digital first and evolving our stores, digital channels and supply chain to work together as a smart network that delivers on everything guests love about Target, including more than a dozen new brands we’ll introduce over the next two years.”For the purpose, he’s earmarked $7 billion for capital expenses over the next three years and a billion more in operating profits, beginning in 2017. So let’s see how he’s doing-Putting Digital FirstThere are two aspects to this, the first being increased digitization of the stores to improve the in-store shopping experience and the second being the building of the online shopping channel to improve that shopping experience.  Target has been working on both.On the store front, it has added RFID (radio frequency identification) tags to apparel to quickly locate in-store inventory and beacons through which location-based information can be transmitted to shoppers while in the store. Now, it’s doing more to remodel the stores so they are to support delivery of orders taken online (more on that later).This year, it’s rolling out new technology in stores that will allow store employees to check inventory, take orders, process payments through a mobile point-of-sale system and arrange delivery. The capability will be expanded to all stores by year-end.On the online shopping front, it has invested in its digital infrastructure to increase its speed, stability, performance and capacity. So today it has a much more functional website and app. This year, it is also integrating its savings app Cartwheel with the main Target shopping app to streamline the shopping experience. It also has a deal with Pinterest that could attract more users.As a result, Target’s digital sales have grown strongly every quarter, doubling between 2013 and 2016.Google AllianceAlthough part of its digital focus, the alliance with Alphabet’s (GOOGL  -  Free Report) Google is big enough to warrant separate discussion.Target has expanded and deepened the relationship this year. After testing Google Express (an ecommerce shipping service with no subscription charges and free shipping depending on order size) in select markets across New York and California, it has now announced that Target products can be purchased via Google Express across the country.Come 2018, devices like Google Home, Android and iOS smartphones and smart TVs that come with Google Assistant, can also be used to shop Target using voice commands. Also in 2018, Google Express will integrate Target REDcard, so holders can grab their related special discounts and offers.The Google agreement is particularly significant because the tech giant already has a ton of data on individuals that it will use to personalize offers and discounts. It’s also building augmented reality apps that can greatly improve the shopping experience. Target, with its focus on stylish home, apparel and beauty products at reasonable prices, can benefit hugely.Additionally, with Google Express and Assistant, customers have more choice than Amazon Prime and Alexa, because they can choose products from a number of retailers like Walmart, Target, Costco (COST  -  Free Report), Walgreens (WBA  -  Free Report) and PetSmart depending on price, availability, convenience (whether they want to pick up at the nearest store or get it delivered) and other criteria. So the deal allows Target to become part of a larger basket.Evolving StoresOf the 1,800 stores Target is operating today, it plans to remodel more than a 1,000 by 2020 (600 by 2019). It also plans to operate 130 additional small-format stores by 2019. The target for this year is to remodel 110 stores and open 30 small-format stores.The remodeling entails reorganization of the backroom so it can double as a hyper-local delivery hub. Now, this space is being optimized to build a ship-from-store capability (shipping from the nearest store when a customer orders online to minimize delivery time and cost). Target has said that 1,400 stores already offer this capability and by 2019, all stores will have it.All stores already support the order pickup facility (where a customer chooses to pick up the item at the store after ordering it online). Ship-from-store and order pickup are already taking care of more than half the digital sales volume today although it’s expected to peak during the holidays.The smaller format stores are being opened in densely populated urban areas and college campuses and they are open for long hours (7AM to midnight). The goal is to allow customers to make quick purchases of every day essentials-type of things. On college campuses, the goal is to lure young consumers to the Target brand. They also operate as pickup centers for online orders.Creating a Smart NetworkThe revamped stores and online channels are increasingly woven into a smart network that allows Target to offer many fulfillment options. So customers can now opt for in-store pickup; drive-up (where a store employee takes the order out to the customer’s car); same-day delivery in select locations and for select items including fresh groceries; next-day delivery; Target Restock, where the company takes orders for essentials up to 7PM every day for delivery on the following day; and Google Express. As the supply chain gets smarter, the in-stock position improves so it is also able to expand the number of products eligible for next-day delivery.Focus on EmployeesRetail has forever been about having the right products in the right place and at the right time. But now, it isn’t just about products anymore because people are increasingly also looking for a good experience. Therefore, it is important to retain good employees with the requisite knowledge and experience. It therefore started investing in its people. The company recently raised the minimum wage to $11 an hour as part of an initiative to raise it to $15 an hour by the end of 2020. It is also investing in training employees for better guest satisfaction.More Than a Dozen New BrandsThe private label market is exploding with supermarkets, drug chains and mass-merchandise stores like Amazon all jumping in. The concept is also a very big deal in Europe where it was used effectively by German chains Aldi and Lidl.To tap this opportunity, Target has said that it plans to launch 12 new store brands. The advantage of these brands is that customers can’t get them anywhere except from Target, so once brand loyalty is built, it results in repeat customers. Other advantages include a greater control over product creation, time to market and pricing, translating into stronger profitability.  The fact that millennial shoppers are less attached to the brands their parents swore by makes this that much easier to do.Target’s private labels focus on its most profitable apparel and home categories and include the kids clothing line Cat & Jack, the kids bedding and home collection line of more than 1,200 pieces of furniture (including 12 themes) Pillowfort, the baby brand Cloud Island, women's apparel brand A New Day, menswear line Goodfellow & Co., homewares brand Project 62, athleisure brand Joy Lab and home and lifestyle brand Hearthand Hand with Magnolia. Cat & Jack, which has been around the longest, racked up $2 billion in sales in its very first year since launch. With eight of the twelve already launched, Target will see the effect in the holidays and through 2018, when we’ll know more about how they did.There are also four more to go, and according to recent trademarks, they could reportedly be ""Universal Thread"" or ""Universal Thread Goods Co.,"" United Thread and an Obvious Foods rebranding. The company generally focuses on style, wellness, baby and kids products, so its private labels are unlikely to venture too far from these.ConclusionAll of the above point to the fact that Target is poised for some big changes in 2018. It has most of the pieces in its turnaround plan on the board, now it just needs to tie it all together. Two metrics are particularly interesting in this respect: digital sales, which continue to grow at strong double digits despite tougher comps and two straight quarters of traffic growth, indicating that customers are returning to Target.As far as the Amazon effect is concerned, it’s worth knowing that ecommerce is still just 8.1% of total retail sales, according to the commerce department. Yes, it’s causing disruption, but Target has finally jumped on the bandwagon and the changes it has embraced (along with suitable advertising) should help the company get back on track. Add to that the fact that not all retailers will be able to weather the storm so Target has scope to grab share.Note that the company also returns cash to investors both as share repurchases and dividends. So the fact that it is catching up with leading trends increases confidence that there is no risk to the income.The way things stand now, it does appear that Target is entering buy territory. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks hereWall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

3179,TGT,"The latest Consumer Price Index (CPI) report hit the tape early this morning, coming in-line with expectations of +0.1% for the month of October. Minus volatile food & energy costs, we see this number go +0.2%. Year over year, CPI hit 2%, a scad beneath the 2.2% analysts were looking for; the core read of 1.8% is also in-line with estimates.Following yesterday’s hotter-than-expected Producer Price Index (PPI), these numbers are a bit of a disappointment, as can be seen by sinking futures in today’s pre-market after the results were released. A tepid attitude among consumers does not trend the desired narrative of a new leg up on consumer spending appetites ahead of the all-important holiday shopping season.Retail Sales for October also came out this morning, with a read of +0.2% from the 0.1% expected. Subtracting costs of auto sales, the number comes in a little light at 0.1%.Empire State Manufacturing missed expectations this morning, posting a read of 19.4 from the 25.1 expected. In September, Empire Manufacturing hit a much-higher 30.2.All of these new econ results are working against a robust bull-market narrative, which is what market participants were hoping to see in order to wipe out the recent slump over the last few trading days, led by softer economic news out of Asia. All three major U.S. indexes are currently in the red again, with the Dow leading the bear charge, down more than 100 points.The takeaway from this, at a quick early-morning glance, is that these data points — especially CPI — did not disappoint enough to gouge market activity, nor did they surprise to the upside enough to staunch the mild sell-off from yesterday. Traders and investors now begin to ask questions whether or not the “slam dunk” interest rate hike next month is even a genuinely good idea anymore. That this generates a question is itself a mild negative for today’s pre-market.We are still very likely to see a quarter-point rate hike at the Fed’s December meeting, but odds are about 10% slimmer than they were. Also, looking into 2018, the market has only priced in one additional rate hike, whereas the Fed itself has indicated three. So there will be plenty to sort out in the waning months of calendar 2017, and combined with some quite understandable profit taking following a stronger (and less volatile) trading year than expected, it will be hard for the markets to regain their recent traction of continually hitting new all-time highs.A tax reform/cut passage through Congress would do the trick.

There is a House vote scheduled for tomorrow, so stay tuned...Target Beats Q3 EstimatesTarget Corp. (TGT  -  Free Report) reported fiscal Q3 earnings numbers ahead of the opening bell today, beating estimates on both top and bottom lines.

3181,TGT,"Target Corporation (TGT  -  Free Report) continued with its upbeat performance in fiscal 2017 as reflected from its better-than-expected third-quarter results. The company’s strategic endeavors, turnaround plan as well as improved traffic trends remain the driving factors. These helped this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock to gain 10.1% in the past six months compared with the industry’s growth of 3.1%.Despite reporting positive earnings surprise during the quarter, shares of this Minneapolis-based company are down roughly 4% in the pre-market trading hours. This is because the year-over-year decline in the bottom line and management’s commentary about highly competitive environment in the fourth quarter was not well perceived by investors. Further, the company’s not so encouraging outlook for the final quarter also hurt investors' sentiments.  Let’s Unveil the PictureThe company posted third-quarter adjusted earnings of 91 cents a share that outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 86 cents but declined 13.1% from the prior-year period. We observed that rise in cost of sales, increased SG&A expenses and higher interest expense hurt the bottom line.The company generated total sales of $16,667 million that also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $16,613 million and rose 1.4% from the year-ago quarter.Target’s initiatives such as the development of omni-channel capacities, diversification and localization of assortments along with emphasis on flexible format stores and cost reduction are encouraging. In a bid to stimulate its digital sales this holiday season, Target is also strengthening its relationship with Google by allowing customers nationwide to shop through Google Express including voice-activated shopping.The company also rolled out Target Restock program that allows customers to restock their shipping box with essential items online and get them delivered at door steps by the next business day for a nominal charge. These endeavors are important due to changing retail landscape that encompasses increasing online penetration and aggressive pricing that may hurt sales and margins.Notably, comparable sales for the quarter increased 0.9% compared to a 0.2% decline witnessed in the year-ago period. While the number of transactions rose 1.4%, the average transaction amount declined 0.5%. Comparable digital channel sales surged 24% and added 0.8 percentage points to comparable sales.Gross profit grew 1% to $4,955 million while gross margin contracted 10 basis points to 29.7%. Operating income plummeted 17.8% to $869 million, while operating margin shriveled 120 basis points to 5.2%.Target’s debit and credit card penetration remained flat at 12.9% and 11.4%, respectively. Total REDcard penetration climbed to 24.2% from 24.3% in the year-ago quarter.Target Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Target Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Target Corporation QuoteOther Financial DetailsDuring the quarter, Target repurchased shares worth $171 million and paid dividends of $339 million. The company still had about $4 billion remaining under its $5 billion share buyback program.The company ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $2,725 million, long-term debt and other borrowings of $11,277 million and shareholders’ investment of $11,137 million.A Glance at the Outlook Management now anticipates fourth-quarter comparable sales to be flat to up 2%. The company expects fiscal 2017 comparable sales to be flat to up 1%.Target now envisions fourth-quarter earnings in the band of $1.05-$1.25 and fiscal 2017 earnings between $4.40 and $4.60 up from $4.34 and $4.54 per share, projected earlier.

3183,TGT,"On Tuesday, the market woke up to the news of Wal-Mart Stores' (WMT  -  Free Report) stock repurchase program of a staggering $20 billion, to be carried out in the next two years. Wal-Mart regularly returns value through higher dividends and share buybacks.In fiscal 2017, the company returned a total of $14.5 billion to its shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. It bought back shares worth $8.3 billion. Wal-Mart has increased dividend for 44 consecutive years including the hike of 2% for fiscal 2018.Further, the company reaffirmed its fiscal 2018 earnings guidance and continues to expect the same in the range of $4.30–$4.40. The company enticed investors by providing a positive outlook for fiscal 2019, wherein it expects earnings to grow 5%, thereby translating to adjusted earnings in the range of $4.52–$4.62. Driven by the sustained growth in comps and e-commerce, the company envisions sales to rise approximately 3% during fiscal 2019.Consequently, shares of Wal-Mart rallied more than 4% on Oct 10, 2017, while finally closing at $84.13. Undoubtedly, this retail behemoth is leaving no stone unturned to continue boosting shareholder returns, along with the ramping up of e-commerce and delivery services.Continuous Endeavors to Expand Online PresenceWal-Mart has been relentlessly focusing on expanding its online business. Most recently, the company introduced easy and hassle free returns process for items purchased online. It has also announced free two-day shipping and in-store pick ups in close to 4,700 stores for online shoppers. The company plans to further add 1000 online grocery locations. It remains on track to improve delivery services for its e-commerce business and has recently acquired Parcel, Inc. In addition to expanding online grocery locations domestically, Wal-Mart is also focusing on expanding such services in key emerging markets and plans to add 255 units in China and Mexico.Through its online arm Jet.com, Wal-Mart has announced plans to launch its own private-label brand, Uniquely J, targeting young urban adults. Since Jet.com’s acquisition in September 2016, the company has acquired four e-commerce businesses — Bonobos, ShoeBuy, Moosejaw, ModCloth.  The company also plans to invest in online cosmetics startup Birchbox. Wal-Mart has also teamed up with Google’s Alphabet Inc to enter the budding voice-shopping market, following the footsteps of Amazon.Backed by the solid progress of Wal-Mart’s e-commerce business the company expects Wal-Mart US online sales revenue to account for 40% of net sales in fiscal 2019. It also anticipates capital expenditures of $11 billion each during fiscal 2018 and 2019 in connection with its online business expansion.These efforts indicate Wal-Mart’s enthusiasm toward exploring and augmenting itself in the digital space and thereby offer a formidable fight to Amazon.com (AMZN  -  Free Report) for capturing retail market share. Similarly retailers like Target Corporation (TGT  -  Free Report) and Kohl’s Corporation (KSS  -  Free Report) are also focused on boosting omni-channel retailing and e-commerce. Expansion of Wal-Mart’s online business also compensates for the receding performance of brick-and-mortar stores. As a result, Wal-Mart plans to restrict store openings in the United States to lower than 15 Supercenters and 10 neighborhood markets, during fiscal 2019.  This Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company has constantly been an important pick for investors because of constant endeavors to expand its offering, while catering to the evolving needs of consumers. This is well reflected in the company’s share price performance that surged 24.7% in the past 12 months, compared with the industry’s increase of 12.5%. Further, the stock has a VGM Score of A, and a long-term growth rate of 5.9% indicating its inherent strength.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

3184,TGT,"After the news of an uptick in the U.S. economy with GDP expanding at a 3% annual rate in the third quarter, retailers got another reason to smile just ahead of the festive season. Consumer Confidence — a key determinant of the economy’s health — reached its highest level in almost 17 years. Per the Conference Board data, the Consumer Confidence Index surged to 125.9 last month from September’s revised reading of 120.6.Analysts believe that buoyant stock market, gradual wage acceleration, fall in the unemployment rate to 16-year low, and a lift in the economic activity post-hurricanes were enough to boost consumer sentiment. We expect this positive sentiment to translate into higher consumer spending that may help increase sales.Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of the US economic activity, surged 1% in September, recording its biggest monthly increase in almost eight years. The rise in spending was led by robust sales of autos and other durable items. All these sound favorable for retailers, who try to make the most of the season that accounts for a sizeable chunk of yearly revenues and profits.Holiday Season: Likely Bonanza for RetailersWe are entering the festive season with Thanksgiving, Black Friday, Cyber Monday and of course Christmas lined up to take you on a holiday shopping spree. Competition will certainly be tough, be it at the brick-and-mortar stores or online portals, the retailers need to be hawk-eyed. Retailers will go the extra mile be it early-hour store openings, huge discounts, promotional strategies, price matching and free shipping on online purchases.Indeed, shopping season is likely to be more blissful for retailers. Data compiled by the nation's largest retail trade group, National Retail Federation projects a 3.6-4% rise in November and December sales (excluding autos, gas and restaurant sales) to $678.75-$682 billion, up from $655.8 billion last year and better than the five-year average sales growth of 3.5%.The data unveiled by Kantar suggests that sales during the fourth-quarter holiday period is expected to jump 3.7%. Data compiled by eMarketer forecasts 3.1% jump in holiday sales (November and December) to $923.15 billion, while retail e-commerce holiday season sales are anticipated to rise 16.6%.Retailers such as Macy’s, Inc.

3185,TGT,"Holiday season and retail are synonymous, and with the festive season approaching, the sector is back in spotlight. Just like every year, retailers are busy with preparations to make the most of this solid selling period. In keeping with this trend, Nordstrom, Inc. (JWN  -  Free Report) will hire nearly 13,650 workers to handle the rush, higher than the previous year’s hiring of approximately 11,400 seasonal employees.Notably, Nordstrom’s seasonal employees will cater to customers across all its stores including the Rack stores along with its distribution and fulfillment centers. Further, some of the employees will look after its online operations, Hautelook and Trunk Club customers.Incidentally, roughly 8,200 seasonal employees will be recruited for 122 Nordstrom stores across the United States and Canada, and 3,200 for 1127 Nordstrom Rack stores. Additionally, the company plans to hire about 2,200 workers for its stores and e-commerce operations at its fulfillment and distribution centers across various states.These seasonal roles will include both part-time and full-time positions, with the opportunity for some workers to become regular employees. This fashion specialty retailer believes that the improved staffing will help it to better serve customers during the busiest time of the year.Notably, during the holiday season retailers stay on their toes, flooding the market with offers and promotions. They sweep buyers off their feet with early-hour store openings, huge discounts, promotional strategies, and free shipping on online purchases. Since the season accounts for a sizeable chunk of yearly revenues and profits, retailers grab every opportunity to drive footfall.Apart from Nordstrom, other retail bellwethers like Macy’s Inc. (M  -  Free Report), Target Corp. (TGT  -  Free Report) and The Gap, Inc. (GPS  -  Free Report), among others have adopted the same strategy to tap maximum holiday sales.Stocks PerformanceIn the past one month, the company’s shares have declined 12.4%, wider than the industry’s fall of 5.1%.

3186,TGT,"Shares of upscale departmental store retailer, Nordstrom, Inc. (JWN  -  Free Report) lost 5.3% on Oct 16 on the news that Nordstrom family’s plans to take the company private are on hold for the time being. The Nordstrom family, which has been exploring options to fund the privatization for a while now, informed the “Special Committee” that it has deferred the search process for the rest of the year.While the Nordstrom family alias the Group notified that it plans to resume exploration initiatives after the holiday season, it remains to be seen if any deal can actually surface amid the tough retail landscape. Though the possibility of finding a lender may depend on Nordstrom’s performance in this crucial selling season, some reports suggest that it depends on the overall holiday season scenario.Nevertheless, let’s delve deeper and analyze what just happened.Privatization on Hold – Why?It was in June when Nordstrom first announced that the family (which currently owns about 31% stake in the company) was seeking viable options of taking the company private, by buying all the outstanding shares of Nordstrom. Then, Nordstrom formed a “Special Committee” including its board of directors. This “Special Committee” that consists of Nordstrom’s independent directors, will act on the company’s behalf on anything related to the aforementioned privatization.Since then, the Group has been looking for potential sponsors. In fact, there were rounds that the Nordstrom family was nearing a deal with Leonard Green & Partners, apart from being in talks with Apollo Global Management LLC and KKR & Co LLP to help the deal pass through. However, it looks like the family and the private equity firms are facing a hard time securing funds for the transaction. This can be largely blamed upon the troubles looming over the retail sector, which has weighed upon lenders’ confidence.Little About the Retail Hurdles: Where’s Nordstrom Headed?Retailers, including big-wigs like Target Corporation (TGT  -  Free Report) and Macy’s Inc. (M  -  Free Report) have long been battling evolving consumer trends and the mounting competition from e-commerce giant, Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report). With consumers’ accelerated transition to the dot.com world, retailers are suffering soft sales as store traffic has been hit hard. Moreover, costs associated with efforts to boost omni-channel initiatives are straining the companies’ margins. Owing to these challenges, the retail space has also witnessed various bankruptcies, mergers and acquisitions.Given such circumstances, going private was considered a prudent move for Nordstrom, as it will help the Nordstrom family reshape the organization and overcome the hurdles faster, which is not that easy as a public entity. As a private firm, it will be easier for Nordstrom to make the required investments per the changing consumer trends, without caring much about stockholders’ short-term responses.  However, it looks like the lenders are waiting to see retailers’ holiday season performance amid these challenges, as this season generates a considerable chunk of revenues for most retailers. Undoubtedly, this is likely to create a pressure on Nordstrom, which has tumbled 13.6% this year, though it performed better than the industry that plunged 25.8% in the said time frame.   Notably, Nordstrom has been gaining from its off-price Rack store business. Also, the company’s e-commerce initiatives are bearing significant results, as evident from its online sales growth of 20% in the second quarter of fiscal 2017. So for now, we remain hopeful about the company’s holiday season performance, which might just switch on the Nordstrom family’s search mode on again.The Nordstrom family comprises the company’s three Co-Presidents — Blake W. Nordstrom, Peter E. Nordstrom and Erik B. Nordstrom; President of Stores — James F. Nordstrom; Chairman — Emeritus Bruce A. Nordstrom, and Anne E. Gittinger, together. The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

3187,TGT,"On Dec 13, Target Corporation (TGT  -  Free Report) made significant headway in the same-day delivery race by acquiring grocery delivery company Shipt for $550 million. The landmark deal was a must do for Target given the rapidly changing retailer landscape. In the current scenario, failure to offer same-day store to home delivery could mean curtains for nearly every retailer.Already, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report) is beginning to offer grocery pickups at more of its outlets and is looking to launch same-day delivery services. Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report) is also making concerted efforts on this front, with more such initiatives likely following its much vaunted Whole Foods acquisition.This is why Target had no choice but to snag a delivery specialist like Shipt. Moreover, Target is looking to protect its online sales kitty, which swelled to 24% during last quarter.Why Did Amazon’s Whole Foods Buy Change the Game?But it was Amazon that fired first in what is developing into a grocery gunfight of sorts. In June, the online retail behemoth announced it was buying premium supermarket chain Whole Foods for $13.7 billion. This was Amazon’s largest ever acquisition, easily exceeding the $1.2 billion for which it picked up Zappos eight years ago.Amazon had little choice but to add a chain like Whole Foods to its arsenal. Most of its technology driven food sales initiatives have been ridden with flaws. Even its much vaunted Amazon Go launch has met with little success. This is why it has failed to challenge the dominance of Wal-Mart in the grocery space despite its tremendous success with books, electronics and streaming services. Wal-Mart has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.In this situation, picking up Whole Foods was a smart move. Amazon can now combine Whole Foods’ fresh foods procurements expertise with its own data mining techniques. Now, Whole Foods can utilize the online behemoth’s experience to develop a better profile of its customers’ behavior. This will ensure that it offers the correct product at the right price with near immaculate timing.How Can Traditional Retailers Respond?For several years now, groceries were an insular market, safe from the e-commerce assault laying waste to other retail segments. In fact, only around 2% of the $800 billion U.S. groceries market has gone online till now, per data from RBC Capital Markets.But the Whole Foods takeover has caused a tectonic shift in the grocery landscape. Analysts are now betting that Amazon will soon make major forays into the grocery space because of its logistics and data mining expertise. This could cause nearly 10% of grocery purchases to move online.This means that the legacy supermarket business needs to learn how to deal with such a large volume of online purchases. One option to satisfy these orders would be to develop an in-house delivery structure. But this would likely be an exhaustive and costly process. This is why most of them are depending on e-delivery experts.Both Shipt and Instacart follow a similar business model. These companies have entered into partnerships with retailers whose products at a specific store are offered online. When a customer places an order with say Shipt, a shopper visits the store in question, picks up the groceries and completes the delivery. Grocery delivery companies like Shipt usually charge customers a yearly fee for their services.How Target Plans to Leverage the Shipt BuyoutEarlier this year, Target acquired software company Grand Junction which is also part of the same-day delivery space. With Target already offering same-delivery in New York City, the Shipt purchase will only add to Target’s delivery muscle. Target is now looking to offer same-day delivery services from half of its stores in six months and from all stores by the end of 2018.Target will also add selections from electronics and other retail categories to the delivery baskets of Shipt. The ultimate target is to offer same-day delivery from Target’s website and mobile app. Meanwhile, Shipt will continue to work with Target’s competitors since a critical volume of business is required to make operations viable.  No Brainer Gainers: Delivery StartupsEven before its Shipt acquisition, Target was working with its competitor Instacart across several markets. The United States’ largest grocery chain The Kroger Co. (KR  -  Free Report) works with both these grocery delivery companies. Meanwhile, privately held Albertsons will utilize Instacart’s services to provide home delivery.As for Shipt itself, since it will continue to operate as an independent entity, it will serve Target competitors like Kroger and Costco Wholesale Corporation (COST  -  Free Report). Such a scheme of things implies that Amazon’s purchase of Whole Foods has come as boon for grocery delivery startups instead of the body blow it was initially perceived to be.In fact, the Whole Foods acquisition has improved the profile of the grocery delivery segment. They are now the natural allies of traditional retailers in their war against Amazon. Since June, Shipt’s orders have jumped 60% and it has forayed into 22 new geographical areas. By next year, Shipt predicts that its revenues will hit $1 billion.The Last WordThe Whole Foods takeover came as a rude awakening for traditional retailers. But they have learnt to survive and even thrive in a new environment, leveraging the strengths of relatively unknown grocery startups. This emerging segment has gained in the process, which means that Amazon may find that mastering the grocery business may be a much tougher challenge than it appeared at first glance.  Investor Alert: Breakthroughs PendingA medical advance is now at the flashpoint between theory and realization. Billions of dollars in research have poured into it. Companies are already generating substantial revenue, and even more wondrous products are in the pipeline.Cures for a variety of deadly diseases are in sight, and so are big potential profits for early investors.

3188,TGT,"Amid a tough retail landscape Costco Wholesale Corporation (COST  -  Free Report) commenced fiscal 2018 on an upbeat note backed by growth strategies, sturdy e-commerce sales and increased penetration of Citi Visa co-brand card program. This is the third consecutive quarter of better-than-expected results for this operator of membership warehouses.This Issaquah, WA-based company posted adjusted quarterly earnings of $1.36 per share that beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny and increased 16.2% from the prior-year period. Total revenues, which include net sales and membership fee, came in at $31,809 million surpassing the consensus estimate of 31,520.7 million and jumped 13.2% year over year.Major chains are grappling with sluggish store and mall traffic as consumers choose to shop online from the comfort of their homes. But Costco seems somewhat resilient to the challenging retail backdrop. We noted that in the reported quarter, the company’s e-commerce comparable sales increased 43.5%. This signals that the company’s efforts to drive online sales bode well.To drive online sales further, Costco recently launched new delivery services for customers — one CostcoGrocery option to deliver non-perishable items to buyer’s home within two days of ordering and another same day grocery delivery service in collaboration with Instacart. These initiatives provide the company a competitive platform against Wal-Mart (WMT  -  Free Report), Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) and Target (TGT  -  Free Report). Target recently acquired Shipt, Inc., a same-day delivery service platform.Costco Wholesale Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Costco Wholesale Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Costco Wholesale Corporation QuoteDelving DeeperNet sales rose 13.3% to $31,117 million, while membership fee increased 9.8% to $692 million. Global e-commerce sales surged 40% to $1.3 billion.Costco’s comparable-store sales (comps) for the quarter improved 10.5%. The company witnessed comps growth of 10.3%, 11.3% and 10.1% across the United States, Canada and Other International locations, respectively. Traffic increased 5.9% globally and 6.6% in the United States.Excluding the effect of gasoline prices and foreign exchange, the company witnessed comps growth of 7.9% during the quarter with the United States, Canada and Other International registering comps growth of 8.7%, 4.3% and 8.2%, respectively.Shares of Costco have outpaced the Zacks Retail-Discount Industry in a year gaining from sturdy comps performance. In a year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has rallied 16.3%, while the industry, which occupies a space in the bottom 28% (185 out of 256) among the Zacks classified industries, has advanced 6.4%. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Costco’s operating income in the quarter increased 12% year over year to $951 million, while operating margin (as a percentage of total revenues) remained flat 3%. However, gross margin contracted 33 basis points, after shrinking 15 basis points in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. Management expects incremental costs related to new centralized return facilities may hurt margins in the next two quarters.Store UpdateCostco operates 746 warehouses, comprising 518 warehouses in the United States and Puerto Rico, 98 in Canada, 37 in Mexico, 28 in UK, 26 in Japan, 13 in Korea, 13 in Taiwan, nine in Australia, two in Spain, one in Iceland and one in France.During the quarter, the company opened seven locations (five net openings and two relocations). During fiscal 2018, the company plans to open 20 and 25 warehouses with over half in the United States, three in Canada, two in Korea and one each in Australia and Mexico. It also plans to relocate six warehouses — four in the United States and two in Canada.Financial AspectsCostco ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $5,689 million and long-term debt (excluding current portion) of $6,478 million. The company’s shareholders’ equity was $11,078 million, excluding non-controlling interests of $278 million. During the quarter, the company incurred capital expenditures of $820 million and bought back 734,000 shares for $119 million.Wrapping UpWe believe that Costco continues to be one of the dominant retail wholesalers based on the breadth and quality of merchandise offered. The company’s strategy to sell products at heavily discounted prices has helped it to remain on growth track as cash-strapped customers continue to reckon Costco as a viable option for low-cost necessities. It is also gradually expanding e-commerce capabilities in the United States, Canada, UK, Mexico, Korea and Taiwan.Investor Alert: Breakthroughs PendingA medical advance is now at the flashpoint between theory and realization.

Meanwhile, Democrat Doug Jones won elections in Alabama, disturbing the Republican majority in the Senate.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) increased 0.3%, to close at 24,585.43.

The new rate of interest will hover between 1.25% and 1.5%. This marks the fourth rate hike by Fed in a year’s time. Further, central bank officials reiterated their earlier projection of three possible rate hikes in 2018. Central bankers reasoned that a hike in interest rate would actually prevent the economy from overheating and negate the effects of a sudden increase in inflation.Also, the central bank did not alter its initial forecast for inflation. The Fed projects a gradual increase in inflation with officials forecasting that the year will end with inflation levels still below 2%. This also marked Janet Yellen’s last news conference as the Fed Chief before her term ends in February next year.Doug Jones’ Win Upsets Republican Advantage on Tax BillDemocrat candidate Doug Jones won the Senate elections in Alabama late on Tuesday. defeating Republican Roy Moore.

3190,TGT,"Kohl’s Corporation (KSS  -  Free Report) has been gaining from efforts to drive sales along with omnichannel initiatives, which boosted comps in the last reported quarter.  Further, the company’s inventory and expense management efforts have also been yielding positive results. Owing to such upsides, shares of the company have gained 36.1% in the past six months, compared with the industry’s rally of 14.2%.Comps Growth Initiatives Bode WellThe company’s comps witnessed year-over-year growth for the first time during the third quarter of fiscal 2017. Comps growth was primarily driven by the company’s partnership with Amazon.com (AMZN  -  Free Report). Incidentally, Kohl’s has started accepting returns for Amazon’s customers on select products. This move followed Kohl's decision to sell Amazon devices, accessories and smart home devices in 10 selected stores in Los Angeles and Chicago. Per the company, the store-within-store concept will boost stores traffic, owing to the availability of Amazon’s diverse electronics options. Kohl’s will also provide free packing and shipping services for the merchandise sent to Amazon’s fulfillment centers.Like Kohl’s, other major retailers such as Wal-Mart (WMT  -  Free Report) and Target Corporation (TGT  -  Free Report) are striving to boost their omnichannel capabilities and maintain their competitive position amid consumers’ shift toward digital and convenient shopping options.  Further, growth in comps further signifies that the company’s strategic initiative — Greatness Agenda — has started yielding positive results. The initiative, which commenced in first quarter of 2014, was designed to drive transactions per store and sales.The company’s store sales are benefitting from enhanced focus on prominent brands such as Nike and Adidas. These efforts helped Kohl’s gain significant market share in active apparel and footwear up until the third quarter. The company expects this trend to continue, on the back of assortment improvements.  Other Factors Aiding PerformanceKohl’s regularly introduces brands to keep the inventory assortment fresh and drive customer traffic to its stores and website. Popular launches include Fit Bed under active and wellness business and the Jumping Beans collection featuring Disney characters, amongst others. Further, Kohl’s has been undertaking several initiatives to reduce inventory levels. During the third quarter of fiscal 2017 inventory per store declined 2%, while units per store fell 4%, in line with the expectations for a low to mid-single-digit decrease for the year. Management continues to expect inventory to be down low to mid-single digits for fiscal 2017.Factors Limiting the Company’s Performance  However, increased shipping expenses stemming from the growth in online business and increased reserves, having been posing concerns for the company. Incidentally, the company’s gross margin declined 30 basis points year over year in the third quarter, thanks to higher shipping costs.Further, Kohl’s has been struggling with accessories and women’s business, due to a cautious consumer spending environment. Kohl’s competitive position has been low due to lack of exposure to markets outside the United States.Bottom-LineNevertheless, we commend Kohl’s efforts to improve comp, which is expected to positively impact sales in the forthcoming quarters. Moreover, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock carries a VGM Score of A and has a long-term growth rate of 6.7%, indicating its inherent strength.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Zacks Editor-in-Chief Goes ""All In"" on This StockFull disclosure, Kevin Matras now has more of his own money in one particular stock than in any other.

3191,TGT,"With the objective of capitalizing on the booming online shopping, Target Corporation (TGT  -  Free Report) has announced its intention to buy Shipt, Inc., a same-day delivery platform. The value of the deal, which is pegged at $550 million, is likely to be concluded by the end of this calendar year. Following, the news the company’s shares gained nearly 3% yesterday.With the help of this acquisition, Target will start providing same-day delivery services from nearly half of its stores by early 2018 and the services will be available from most of the stores in major markets by the beginning of 2018 holiday season. Initially, the company will provide same-day delivery services of groceries, essentials, home, electronics as well as other products before expanding it to all major products by the end of 2019.The retail landscape has been undergoing a fundamental change. With digital transformation in shopping and consumers splurging online, store and mall traffic has been hit hard. As a result, most retailers, including big-box, are struggling to compete with e-commerce channels and are being forced to trim store count to focus more on an online model. We believe, the company’s decision to bring same-day delivery services is likely to lure more customers and in turn will drive the top line higher. The acquisition will also aid the company to compete with e-commerce biggie Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report), Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report) and Best Buy Co., Inc. (BBY  -  Free Report).Other InitiativesCurrently, the company has Restock program, which allows customers to restock their shipping box with essential items online and get them delivered at door steps by the next business day for a nominal charge. Further, in order to improve supply chain and expand delivery capabilities, the company had acquired Grand Junction. This transportation technology company provides a platform that allows retailers, distributors and third-party logistics providers to manage local deliveries through a network of over 700 carriers.In October, the company had launched curbside pickup program, at 50 Twin Cities stores. This program gives customers an option to get ordered items without leaving the comfort of their cars. To avail the service the customers need to place orders via the latest version of Target’s app and then select “Drive Up”. Target will inform the customers when the order is ready for delivery. Once the shopper arrives to the chosen parking spot outside the Target store, an employee will bring the order to the vehicle.The company’s initiatives such as the development of omni-channel capacities, diversification and localization of assortments along with emphasis on flexible format stores bode well for the stock. The shares of Target have outpaced the industry in a month. The stock has advanced 15.7%, outperforming the industry’s growth of 12%.Target currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Owing to technological advancements, customers’ shopping habits have evolved rapidly, leading to a large number of customers opting for digital shopping.In keeping with such consumer needs, SUPERVALU is striving to upgrade website and mobile applications to make shopping easier. Recently, the company launched refreshed e-commerce sites under a multi-year contract with Instacart. Apart from this, the company has also been undertaking initiatives to expand wholesale business and augment organic food products portfolio.On the back of such efforts, the company’s shares have depicted a turnaround from a declining trend. Its shares have surged 32.2% in the past month compared with the industry’s rally of 3.1%.Let’s take a look into SUPERVALU’s omnichannel development initiatives and other factors that have been driving the company’s performance.E-commerce Expansion With Instacart & Other Growth EffortsSUPERVALU and Instacart had first teamed up in September 2015, for providing same-day grocery delivery services. Given consumers’ favorable response and rising demand for e-commerce, SUPERVALU decided to opt for Instacart’s services to enhance its omnichannel operations. Thus, the company launched e-commerce websites, powered by Instacart to augment services in four of its retail units. These units include Cub, Shop 'n Save, Farm Fresh Food and Pharmacy as well as Shoppers Food and Pharmacy.Notably, the new websites offer solutions that allow shoppers to place orders online and collect the same from stores without having to leave their vehicles. Further, the websites will allow customers to club store coupons and loyalty rewards with online orders. The company also stated that customers in St. Louis, Minnesota, Virginia Beach and Washington, D.C. can now place orders at brand specific websites of Instacart and get the items delivered to their doorstep within an hour.Clearly, SUPERVALU strives to adapt itself to reap from growing e-commerce opportunities and provide unique options to shoppers. Management believes that the newly-launched website offering fits well with consumer’s busy lifestyle.Further, consumers are benefitting from purchasing fresh products from the company’s retail stores with the option of same-day delivery. Such developments also strengthen SUPERVALU’s position in the grocery segment against the e-commerce king Amazon.com (AMZN  -  Free Report) and other large retailers such as Wal-Mart (WMT  -  Free Report) and Target (TGT  -  Free Report). We also expect that company’s e-commerce growth efforts to help revive the performance of retail-banners that have been sluggish in the past.In addition to expanding omnichannel capabilities, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company has been dedicatedly widening wholesale business scope through acquisitions. Recently, the company concluded the buyout of Florida-based Associated Grocers, prior to which it acquired Unified Grocers in June. Additionally, the company has been evaluating prospects in the organic food products arena and has partnered with wholesale merchants to explore opportunities in this category.We expect such efforts to drive SUPERVALU’s performance in the forthcoming periods and help it maintain its position in the green territory.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.See This Ticker Free >>

3193,TGT,"As retail companies attempt to navigate the constantly changing e-commerce and brick-and-mortar landscapes, two powerhouse companies—Wal-Mart (WMT  -  Free Report) and Target (TGT  -  Free Report)—have started to regain solid footing.Retailers are in the midst of their most important quarter—and one that could set traditional retail back, if the likes of Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) dominate the holiday season. And although the e-commerce giant has devastated some retailers, it might have also forced some to make big changes that will help prove vital today and down the road.Recently, Walmart began—if not by choice, by necessity—to fight back against online retail’s proliferation with a massive expansion into e-commerce and speedy delivery.With on the fly tweaks to its business model, Walmart has regained investor confidence. Now, let’s take a look at Walmart’s current fundamentals and see how it stacks up against another, somewhat different retail star: Target.WalmartThe company recently announced that it renewed its fiscal 2018 guidance and projected strong new sales and revenue goals for fiscal 2019. Walmart’s new longer-term confidence stems in part from a push into e-commerce that includes plans to add 1,000 more online grocery locations domestically (also read: Wal-Mart (WMT  -  Free Report) Hits 52-Week High, Grocery Stocks Follow).Walmart is committed to enhancing its online sales and delivery services instead of adding more locations domestically. The company expects to open less than 25 U.S. stores in fiscal 2019, while opening roughly 225 locations in faster-growing regions, such as China and Mexico.Walmart is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and sports an “A” for both Growth and Value in our Style Scores system, helping it earn an overall “A” VGM grade.The company is trading at 18x earnings, which is above the “Retail – Supermarkets” industry average but is still solid overall. Walmart’s 3.01 P/B ratio and P/S ratio of 0.48 also don’t mark discounts to the industry, but they help prove that it is still a reasonable value play.Walmart has experienced a 14.29% year-to-date price change that crushes the industry’s 1.17% decline and tops the S&P 500 average. Its stock price now rests atop a new 52-week high at $84.88 per share.Investors who worry that the company might have a hard time breaking through a new threshold might consider some of our current Walmart projections. Within the last 60-days, the company has experienced three positive earnings estimate revisions for next quarter, along with one downward change. Walmart has earned seven positive revisions for its full-year, along with no negative revisions, during this same time frame.Based on our current consensus estimates, Walmart’s revenues are projected to jump 2.42% in the current quarter, 2.92% next quarter, and 2.11% for the year, ultimately reaching an upward estimate of $499.24 billion. The company’s earnings are expected to dip over 1% in the current quarter but jump 1.36% for the year, and 5.25% for its next fiscal year.TargetFor one, this Minneapolis-based retail power is set to up its holiday hiring push by 40% this year. Target hopes to add 4,500 more employees to its distribution and fulfillment centers—on top of adding 100,000 overall—in order to more quickly refill products in stores, and maybe more importantly, help carry out its new online sales push. Target’s online sales climbed 32% in the second quarter.Aside from expanding its e-commerce business, the company has updated its efforts to do what it does best: sell an upscale feel at affordable prices. Target recently launched a new multi-year partnership with HGTV's widely popular home remodeling show Fixer Upper, debuted a new modernist design-focused furniture and home décor line dubbed Project 62, and added three new clothing lines.Target has also started to invest $7 billion to help remodel stores and open small-scale locations in major metropolitan areas. On top of that, Target cut prices on basic items, from cereal and baby formula to razors and paper towels, to help better compete with Amazon.Target is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock and scored “A” grades for both Growth and Value in our Style Scores system.Target is trading at only 12.75x earnings, which marks a substantial discount compared to the “Retail – Discount Stores” industry average. Its 2.81 P/B ratio comes in well below the industry’s 3.91 average, while its 0.42 price to sales figure also marks a discount. These three figures help illuminate the fact that in spite of—or perhaps because of—its struggles, Target presents a strong option for value-minded investors.The company has received six upward earnings estimate revisions and no downward changes for its current quarter, all within the last 60 days. In this same timeframe, Target earned nine full-year upward earnings estimate revisions and no negative revisions.Target’s sales are projected to gain 4.69% next quarter and 1.44% for the year to reach $70.91 billion, based on our current consensus estimates. However, in terms of earnings, Target is set to see double-digit year-over-year declines for its current quarter and for the year.Bottom Line Both Target and Walmart are currently Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stocks with great VGM scores. They are also both heading into their most vital quarter with improved e-commerce businesses to boot.Yet, because of Target’s projected earnings decline, on top of the fact that its shares have tanked 21% this year, investors who consider growth and momentum trends might chose Walmart stock.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +18.8% from 2016 - Q1 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +157.0%, +128.0%, +97.8%, +94.7%, and +90.2% respectively.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - Q1 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 11X over. Maybe even more remarkable is the fact that we're willing to share their latest stocks with you without cost or obligation. See Them Free>>

3194,TGT,"Shares of Walmart (WMT  -  Free Report) soared to a new 52-week high on Tuesday morning after the big-box retailer provided strong new sales and revenue goals for fiscal 2019. This positive outlook helped send the rest of the industry, including Target (TGT  -  Free Report) and Costco (COST  -  Free Report), higher as well.On the same day the retail giant hosts its annual meeting for the investment community, Walmart reaffirmed its guidance for fiscal 2018 and announced a new share buyback program. What has investors more excited, however, is the fact that Walmart expects its net sales will grow around or above 3% in fiscal 2019, spurred by a 40% jump in U.S. e-commerce sales.This push includes plans to add 1,000 more online grocery locations domestically. The retail giant, known for its sprawling and somewhat drab stores, wants to spend money to remodel stores and bolster its online presence over building new locations.Instead of adding more locations at home, Walmart is set to open stores in new and growing markets abroad. The company expects to open less than 25 U.S. stores total in fiscal 2019, while opening roughly 225 locations in faster-growing regions, such as China and Mexico. The company is already offering one-hour delivery from select Chinese locations.“We’re combining the accessibility of our stores with e-commerce to provide new and exciting ways for customers to shop,” Walmart President and CEO Doug McMillon said in a statement.“We’re proud of the progress we’re making. We’re equipping our associates with training and technology so they will continue to innovate in our stores, clubs and through e-commerce to find ways to deliver an enjoyable shopping experience for our customers that is easy, fast, friendly and fun.”The new, longer-term confidence from one of the biggest retail companies in the world—based on a commitment to emerging markets and a heavy focus on online selling—has helped renew many investors’ confidence in the $250 billion company.Walmart saw its stock price gain almost 2% premarket, and its shares have surged over 4.50% since then to touch a new 52-week intraday trading high of $84.46 per share.Walmart’s ability to pivot its business slightly to help fend off Amazon’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) push into every inch of retail, including the grocery business, has also helped pull the rest of the industry up on Tuesday.Shares of fellow big-box retailer Costco popped over 1.50%, while Target stock climbed almost 2%.Smaller grocery chains also benefited from Walmart’s announcement. Shares of Casey's General Stores (CASY  -  Free Report) and Sprouts Farmers Market (SFM  -  Free Report) both gained over 1%, while Ingles Markets (IMKTA  -  Free Report) jumped over 2.10%. Weis Markets  and Smart & Final Stores (SFS  -  Free Report) both saw their stock prices surge over 2%.  Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

3195,TGT,"From Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) to Wal-Mart Stores (WMT  -  Free Report), retailers are gearing up for the busiest part of the year. Improving labor market, rising disposable income and elevated consumer confidence points to an uptick in sales during this festive season, and retail bellwethers will leave no opportunity to make the most of the season that accounts for a sizeable chunk of yearly revenues and profits. Be it early-hour store openings, huge discounts, promotional strategies, price matching and free shipping on online purchases, retailers will go the extra mile.Indeed, shopping season is likely to be more blissful for retailers. Market experts asserted that while recent hurricanes resulted in short-term derailment in the economic activity, a lift in the later part of the year remains on the cards. Since Christmas is falling on Monday and 32 days after Thanksgiving, shoppers are getting one extra day than last year and an extended weekend to do last minute purchasing.What Do Holiday Numbers Unveil?With the ability and willingness seen in consumers to spend more, retailers could hear their cash registers jingle this time. Data compiled by the nation's largest retail trade group, National Retail Federation projects a 3.6-4% rise in November and December sales (excluding autos, gas and restaurant sales) to $678.75-$682 billion, up from $655.8 billion last year and better than the five-year average sales growth of 3.5%.According to Deloitte, sales during the holiday season are likely to increase in the band of 4-4.5%, while e-commerce sales are envisioned to improve 18-21%. The data unveiled by Kantar suggests that sales during the fourth-quarter holiday period is expected to jump 3.7%. Data compiled by eMarketer forecasts 3.1% jump in holiday sales (November and December) to $923.15 billion, while retail e-commerce holiday season sales are anticipated to rise 16.6%.Retailers such as Macy’s, Inc. (M  -  Free Report), J. C. Penney Company, Inc. (JCP  -  Free Report), Target Corporation (TGT  -  Free Report), The Gap, Inc. (GPS  -  Free Report) are bracing up for this year’s race and have announced hiring plans for the upcoming holiday season to meet the holiday rush. Per media reports, Target intends to employ 100,000 associates, while Macy's will hire nearly 80,000 seasonal workers to handle the rush. Meanwhile, Gap is deploying seasonal associates at all stores including Gap, Gap Outlet, Banana Republic, Banana Republic Factory and Old Navy across the United States and Canada. J. C. Penney will hire nearly 40,000 seasonal workers.Be Hawk-Eyed The holiday season is nothing less than a battlefield for the retailers fighting hard to win over consumers and with technology playing a major role they are fast adopting the omni-channel mantra. Companies will go the extra mile — offering discounts or indulging in promotional activities — to trap the bargain hunters. But we wonder whether these will come at the price of margins, not to say the impact on the bottom line.Wal-Mart is making huge investments in e-commerce initiatives. The company’s acquisitions of ShoeBuy, Moosejaw, ModCloth and Jet.com are in sync with its quest to build an impressive digital brand portfolio. Also, the company partnered with Alphabet’s Google to enable shopping through Google Express using voice-activated service. Target has been also focusing on developing its online business. Recently, it waged war against other retail big-wigs by aggressively cutting prices on a range of items and launched curbside pickup program, at 50 Twin Cities stores.Bottom LineWe believe that with the advent of the holiday season, the retail sector will hog all the attention. So, how about betting your bucks on these lucrative options? Out of the stocks mentioned above, Wal-Mart, Target and Gap carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), while Macy’s and J. C. Penney has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

3196,TGT,"(0:45) - Jet.com To Launch In House Brand: Uniquely J(2:00) - Private Label Boom Within Online Retailers(4:45) - Episode Roundup: Podcast@Zacks.comOn this week’s episode of Shopping for Stocks, host and Zacks Editor Maddy Johnson discussed the retail strategy of private-label brands, and the companies who utilize them.Walmart-owned (WMT  -  Free Report) Jet.com just unveiled a new grocery line called Uniquely J that will carry things like coffee, olive oil, laundry detergent, and paper towels. For years now, Walmart has sold through its own private labels Equate, Great Value, and Sam’s Choice, but Uniquely J could help America’s largest retailer reach a different, younger audience.Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report), of course, has many private-label brands, like its AmazonBasics and Amazon Elements lines that are popular for their wide array of everyday essentials. And now that the e-commerce giant has bought Whole Foods, Amazon sells the organic grocer’s popular 365 brand on its website.Costco (COST  -  Free Report), Target (TGT  -  Free Report), and German discount grocery chain Aldi have been making headway with customers thanks to their private labels, and some of them are even award-winning.But private-labels and in-house brands are nothing new, and are a much-used strategy throughout the retail industry. However, it’s when companies reformat it, reenergize it, that we start paying attention. If these retailers can create and market private-label brands that connect with shoppers in new and exciting ways, the oft-used tactic could be the direction retail needs to go.As a reminder, if you feel that something was missed, or if you want a different topic covered, send an email to podcast@zacks.com.

3197,TGT,"Target Corporation (TGT  -  Free Report), which has taken several strategic initiatives to drive performance, recently launched curbside pickup program, at 50 Twin Cities stores. This program gives customers an option to get their ordered items without leaving the comfort of their cars.To avail the service the customers need to place orders via the latest version of Target’s app and then select “Drive Up”. Target will inform the customers when the order is ready for delivery. Once the shopper arrives to the chosen parking spot outside the Target store, an employee will bring the order to the vehicle.Over the summer, the company has been testing the curbside pickup program with its employees at some of the Twin Cities stores. This is not for the first time that the company has come up with   curbside pickup program. In 2014, Target tested the program but had to scrap it later on.  Other Strategic InitiativesWith the objective of capitalizing on the booming online grocery delivery market, Target is expanding Target Restock to eight new markets. Notably, Target Restock is a next-day delivery service, which the company had launched in June. Customers opting for next-day delivery services will have to shell out nearly $5 to avail the service. The company began this service in Minneapolis but latter on expanded it to Denver as well as Dallas markets in the month of August. Following the recent expansion, the service will now be available in Atlanta, New York, Chicago, Philadelphia, St. Louis, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Washington D.C./Baltimore.The Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s initiatives such as the development of omni-channel capacities, diversification and localization of assortments along with emphasis on flexible format stores bode well for the stock. The shares of Target have outpaced the industry in the past three months. The stock has advanced 11.9%, outperforming the industry’s gain of 8%.Management plans to expand merchandise assortments with special emphasis on Style, Baby, Kids, and Wellness categories that are performing well. Moreover, Target is also concentrating on rationalization of supply chain, technology and process improvements. These initiatives aided it to continue with upbeat performance in fiscal 2017 as reflected from impressive second-quarter results and an encouraging earnings outlook.3 Stocks Occupying Retail’s CenterstageBetter-ranked stocks, which warrant a look in the retail sector includes, Costco Wholesale Corporation (COST  -  Free Report), Tilly's, Inc.

3198,TGT,"Shares of Equifax Inc. (EFX  -  Free Report) continue to hit new lows amid mounting scrutiny pressure from lawmakers, investigating agencies and regulators over the credit reporting company’s response to the data breach. The stock tumbled again yesterday due to a series of events which occurred during the entire day.Recent Additions in TroubleIntensifying troubles for Equifax, a group of 37 U.S. Senators, yesterday, vowed for investigation by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Department of Justice. They argued that there is possibly a higher chance of a potential insider trading, as three Equifax’s executives had sold shares in three days after the company discovered the data breach.Meanwhile, the state of Massachusetts announced yesterday that it is planning to file a lawsuit against the company on behalf of its residents. If the state goes ahead with its plan, then it will be no surprise if other states follow suit.Furthermore, a U.S. house panel is probing the data breach and announced that it would testify Equifax’s chief executive — Richard Smith — on Oct 3.Shares of Equifax plunged nearly 15% yesterday after the aforementioned news surfaced. It should be noted that the stock has lost over 30% of its value from last Thursday’s closing price. In the year-to-date period, Equifax has lost 16.3%, significantly underperforming the industry to which it belongs to, which has recorded growth of 27.3%.What’s Bothering Investors?On Sep 7, Equifax announced that highly sensitive personal data of approximately 143 million consumers has been stolen from its database. Reportedly, nearly two-third of the adult U.S. population has been impacted due to this cyber attack.Per the company, the data breach occurred between mid-May and July this year, which was discovered on Jul 29. Apart from some sensitive personal information, hackers have stolen credit card numbers of about 209,000 U.S. consumers and “certain dispute documents with personal identifying information” of nearly 182,000 U.S. consumers.The recent cyber attack has heavily tarnished the brand image, reputation and credibility of Equifax. The company is facing huge customer criticism, while cybersecurity companies are questioning its preparedness and response to this massive data breach. Moreover, with lawmakers and investigating agencies probing the mishap, troubles for Equifax are unlikely to end any time soon.Investors seem concerned that the entire issue may result in loss of customers and the company may also have to make huge compensation to its clients. This is feared to have an adverse impact on the company’s financial performance in the near term.Bottom LineThis is not the first instance when consumer data has been stolen from a company’s data base. Last December, Yahoo! Inc. reported a massive data breach, where private information of over one billion users was compromised. Other big companies like Target Corporation (TGT  -  Free Report), Anthem Inc. (ANTM  -  Free Report) and Sony Corporation (SNE  -  Free Report) have also been victims of cyber attack, when fraudsters stole large number of consumer data.However, sensitivity of the information exposed in Equifax’s data breach case makes it one of the worst in recent times. The latest data breach at the company will likely have a lasting impact as criminals can use the stolen resources for opening new accounts, applying for credit cards or loans, buying insurance, renting an apartment or even for tax frauds.It should be noted that banks and financial institutions rely on the United States’ three main consumer credit reporting agencies — Equifax, TransUnion (TRU  -  Free Report) and Experian. Therefore, with access to social security, driver’s license and credit card numbers, criminals can make such frauds due to which consumers will have to suffer for longer periods of time.Hence, we believe that investors’ concerns are justified as the mishap will have a lasting impact on Equifax’s results, in the form of financial costs relating to settlement of lawsuits and litigation expenses. Moreover, it will be very tough for the company to repair its brand image, as well as retaining its current customer base.Currently, Equifax carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

3199,TGT,"Kohl’s Corporation (KSS  -  Free Report) has been gaining from its strong portfolio of brands, growth in e-commerce business and continued innovation. Strong inventory and expense management have also been positively impacting the company’s bottom line.In addition, we also believe that the extended tie-up between Kohl’s and Amazon.com (AMZN  -  Free Report) have enhanced investor’s confidence in the stock. Shares of Kohl’s have surged 8.3% in the past six months, outperforming the industry’s decline of 15.8%.Let’s delve into the factors that have been impacting Kohl’s performance lately.Surging e-commerce Kohl’s e-commerce sales have almost doubled since 2011 at a compound annual growth rate of almost 40% over the last five years. In the recently reported second quarter of 2017, digital conversion improved at a double-digit rate on the back of better customer experience on smartphone and smartphone app. In fact, technology improvements in both application and the device along with omni-channel efforts are expected to bear positive impact on customer experience.Similarly, retailers like Target Corporation (TGT  -  Free Report) are also focused on boosting omni-channel retailing and e-commerce.Initiatives to Enhance Margins Kohl’s has undertaken several initiatives to reduce inventory, in order to boost profits. During the second quarter of fiscal 2017, the company made additional progress on its initiatives. As a result, inventory per store decreased 2%, while units per store were 3% lower, which was consistent with expectations for a low to mid-single-digit decrease for the year. The company continues to expect inventory to be down low to mid-single digits for fiscal 2017.Strong Portfolio of Brands Kohl’s prides on having a diverse product portfolio which includes apparel, shoes, accessories, beauty and home products. The company has established a strong brand portfolio with national brands such as Dockers, Levi’s, Columbia Sportswear, Reebok, Champion, Oshkosh, Pfatzgraff and KitchenAid. The company has also been keen on innovation and regularly introduces new brands in order to keep the inventory assortment fresh and drive customer traffic to its stores and website. Popular launches include Fit Bed under its active and wellness business and Jumping Beans collection, amongst many more. Efforts to Improve Store Traffic Kohl’s has been struggling with lower comps for quite some time now. The company’s comps started declining from the first quarter of fiscal 2016 and plummeted consecutively for the next six quarters. This signifies that the company’s strategic initiative, Greatness Agenda, is failing to deliver results. The initiative, which commenced in first-quarter 2014, was designed to increase transactions per store and sales.In an effort to drive store sales, Kohl’s has started offering more outside famous brands and cutting down on the number of in-house clothing brands it sells. The addition of Under Armour workout tights, sneakers and other accessories in March was a great success and was well received among customers. The company’s focus on large private-label brands such as, SONOMA, Croft & Barrow and Apartment 9 has also been aiding store traffic expansion.Tie-Up with AmazonKohl’s recent initiatives to strengthen its tie-up with Amazon are also expected to enhance store traffic. The company recently announced its initiative to accept returns for Amazon customers on selected products in 82 of its U.S. store locations from October 2017. Additionally, the retailer will provide free service of packing and shipping the merchandises to Amazon’s fulfillment centers. Through such a partnership, Kohl’s is expected to expand its omni-channel capabilities and make use of Amazons’ wide consumer base.In recent times, Kohl’s had also announced to sell Amazon’s devices, accessories and smart home products in 10 selected stores in Los Angeles and Chicago. Kohl’s believes that this store-within-store concept will boost traffic. Like Kohl’s, retailers such as Best Buy Co. Inc (BBY  -  Free Report) have also teamed up with the online giant ahead of the holiday season.Bottom Line Kohl’s dedicated efforts to improve comps are quite noteworthy and is expected to positively impact sales in the forthcoming quarters. Moreover, this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock carries a VGM Score of A and has a long-term growth rate of 5.7%, indicating its inherent strength. Further estimates for the forthcoming third-quarter results and for fiscal 2017 have also remained stable at 71 cents and $3.72 respectively, over the past 30 days.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here.5 Trades Could Profit ""Big-League"" from Trump PoliciesIf the stocks above spark your interest, wait until you look into companies primed to make substantial gains from Washington's changing course.Today Zacks reveals 5 tickers that could benefit from new trends like streamlined drug approvals, tariffs, lower taxes, higher interest rates, and spending surges in defense and infrastructure.See these buy recommendations now >>

3200,TGT,"It has been more than a month since the last earnings report for Target Corporation (TGT  -  Free Report). Shares have added about 6.5% in that time frame, outperforming the market.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to the stock's next earnings release, or is it due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Target Q2 Earnings & Sales Top Estimates, Lifts ViewTarget continued with its upbeat performance in fiscal 2017, as reflected from its impressive second-quarter results and an encouraging earnings outlook. The company’s strategic endeavors as well as improved traffic trends helped boost performance.Let’s Unveil the PictureThe company posted second-quarter adjusted earnings of $1.23 per share that came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.20 but remained flat year over year. We observed that higher sales and lower interest expense provide cushion to the bottom line. The company generated total sales of $16,429 million that also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $16,282 million and jumped 1.6% from the year-ago quarter.We believe that the initiatives such as the development of omni-channel capacities, diversification and localization of assortments along with emphasis on flexible format stores, bode well for this Minneapolis-based company. Target is investing in merchandise categories such as Style, Baby, Kids and Wellness and rolled out Target Restock program. It intends to launch new brands and be more competitive in terms of price. Further, in order to expand delivery capabilities the company has entered into a deal to acquire Grand Junction, the transportation tech company.Comparable sales for the quarter increased 1.3%.

3201,TGT,"Retail sector is hogging all the attention, and this time for good reasons. For the time being, the expression ""retail apocalypse” appears to be a thing of past. The sector has certainly been facing the brunt of heightened online competition, lower footfall and changing consumer spending patterns but of late the tables are turning in favor of the retailers. Stocks once bogged down by tough environment are now suddenly climbing the charts.The first and foremost reason for the same is the latest tax reform that is likely to come into shape, following the approval of the Senate. The tax code once implemented is likely to lower the burden of retailers, who now topped the list with a corporate tax rate of as much as 35%. President Trump has been recommending a tax rate of as much as 20% and pushing hard to pass on the benefits to companies who generate all or most part of revenues in the United States.The news was enough to drive the retail stocks. As a result, shares of Macy’s (M  -  Free Report), Gap (GPS  -  Free Report), Target (TGT  -  Free Report), Kohl's (KSS  -  Free Report) and Best Buy (BBY  -  Free Report) gained 6.7%, 6.6%, 5.1%, 4.4% and 3.7%, respectively, yesterday.Certainly, the “Trump Factor” is ruling the U.S. stock market but it is also the attractive holiday season deals that are exciting consumers. The five-day holiday period starting from Thanksgiving, followed by Black Friday, Small Business Saturday to Cyber Monday, marked an auspicious start to the holiday-shopping season. Retailers are cashing in on customers preferring to shop from the comfort of their homes, mostly online or through their mobile phones.A Stellar Start to the SeasonOnline sales on Thanksgiving Day surged 18.3% to $2.87 billion, per Adobe Analytics. Bargain hunters bought $5.03 billion worth of products online on Black Friday, an increase of 16.9% from last year. The euphoria did not end here, as the shopping frenzy was palpable on Cyber Monday when online sales soared 16.8% to $6.59 billion.A blockbuster Thanksgiving weekend and buoyant Cyber Monday indicate that the season is turning out to be a bonanza for retailers. Per National Retail Federation (“NRF”), approximately 174 million customers shopped in stores and online during this weekend. The trade group estimates that an American spent about an average of $335.47 during the five-day period.Further, shopping through mobile devices was the most prominent trend that developed during this year’s Black Friday and Cyber Monday shopping period, as nearly 63% of customers used their smart phones to make buying decisions, while 29% used it to actually buy goods.This indeed points to a blissful shopping season for retailers. With Christmas falling on Monday and 32 days after Thanksgiving, shoppers are getting one extra day compared with last year and an extended weekend to do last minute purchasing.Wrapping UpImproving labor market, rising disposable income and elevated consumer sentiment have ushered confidence in retailers about a robust holiday season. From Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) to Wal-Mart (WMT  -  Free Report) retailers are gearing up for the busiest part of the year. With digital transformation in shopping they are fast adopting the omni-channel mantra to provide a seamless shopping experience, whether online or in-stores.Overall, NRF projects a 3.6-4% rise in November and December sales (excluding autos, gas and restaurant sales) to $678.75-$682 billion, up from $655.8 billion last year and better than the five-year average sales growth of 3.5%. Data compiled by eMarketer forecasts 3.1% jump in holiday sales (November and December) to $923.15 billion, while retail e-commerce holiday season sales are anticipated to rise 16.6%.As you can see, there are plenty of reasons to be optimistic about the retail sector but what about investing in the space right now? Out of the stocks mentioned above, Wal-Mart carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), while Amazon, Target, Macy’s, Best Buy, Kohl's and Gap carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

3202,TGT,"The grocery industry has been undergoing a fundamental change, with technology playing a major role and the focus shifting to online shopping. This transition in shopping pattern is compelling supermarket chains to rapidly adapt to changes in the ecosystem. These companies are left with no option but to keep pace with the changing retail scenario and focus more on enhancing omni-channel capabilities. It seems that The Kroger Co. (KR  -  Free Report) has taken the stock of the situation and is on its way to give itself a complete makeover.Kroger has been trying all means to overcome competition, which has intensified with the foray of Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report). The company is expanding store base, introducing new items, digital coupons, and order online, pick up in store initiative. The company’s “Restock Kroger” program is also gaining traction. These endeavors are likely to fuel top-line growth. Analysts polled by Zacks expect fourth-quarter and fiscal 2017 revenues to come in at $30.84 billion and $122.13 billion, reflecting an increase of roughly 11.7% and 6%, respectively.Kroger’s Strategy to Counter CompetitionThe company’s “Restock Kroger” program is gaining traction. Kroger commenced “We Are Local” campaign; launched and opened a new restaurant concept, Kitchen 1883; and added two new product lines under “Our Brands” — an apparel brand and a floral line, BLOOM HAUS. As part of the program, management is considering the sale of convenience store business, and expects to generate $400 million in incremental operating margin by 2020 and over $4 billion of free cash flow in the next three years. The company in collaboration with Chase Pay is offering mobile payments in select markets.Kroger is looking to expand its “Scan, Bag, Pay & Go and Self-CheckOut” program — piloted at 20 stores — to nearly 400 locations in 2018. Further, Ralphs — a unit of grocery giant — in partnership with Instacart is offering home delivery at select locations in Southern California. Kroger remains optimistic about the acquisitions of Vitacost.com, an online retailer of vitamins and health-oriented products; Harris Teeter, a grocery chain, and the merger of Modern HC Holdings with Axium Pharmacy Holdings Inc., a specialty pharmacy. Kroger also acquired Roundy's, the grocery store operator.Kroger’s Customer 1st strategy that enriches the consumers shopping experience and convinces them of returning to the store is also benefiting the company. We believe that the company's operational strategies present enormous opportunities to augment identical supermarket sales, alleviate gross margin pressure, improve operating margin and enhance return on invested capital.Per sources, Kroger is possibly mulling over purchasing America’s major online wholesaler — Boxed. The speculation is also rife about this Cincinnati-based company to acquire Overstock, an online retailer that offers home decor products and others.Wrapping UpKroger, which shares space with Wal-Mart (WMT  -  Free Report) and Target (TGT  -  Free Report), is leaving no stone unturned to attract consumers and attain incremental revenues. We believe that these strategies are likely to bolster performance and drive the stock further. In the past three months, shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) have surged 38%, outperforming the industry’s growth of 20.7%.

3203,TGT,"There is a long list of popular averages and ranges that investors like to use while looking at stocks, and that includes the 52-week low and 52-week high metrics. It’s great to find stocks right before they surge towards new highs, but it can be difficult for some to establish a new and consistent range.With that said, investors typically become interested in stocks as they breach 52-week highs because that momentum can oftentimes continue until a new range is established. If a stock is strong in a variety of key categories, it certainly can keep climbing well above that old 52-week high, and we can find those strong stocks using our Zacks methods.Here at Zacks, we place an emphasis on earnings-related data, especially earnings estimate revision activity, and this can definitely be applied to stocks approaching their 52-week highs. One way to ensure continued upward momentum is solid earnings momentum, so we can use the proven Zacks Rank system to identify companies that are impressing in this regard.Using this strategy, we have found five stocks that are seeing positive estimate revision activity and are hovering near their 52-week highs. Check them out now:1.       Target Corporation (TGT  -  Free Report)Prior Close: $77.90 / 52-Week High: $77.91After surpassing earnings estimates by five cents in its most recent quarter, Target witnessed several positive estimate revisions for its upcoming quarters. In fact, our consensus estimate for its upcoming fiscal year has gained more than $1.00 over the past 60 days. Meanwhile, shares have climbed roughly 25% in just 12 weeks. The stock is taking off like a rocket on the back of an improved outlook, and investors will not want to miss the gains that could come if Target can post another strong quarter. 2.       Sysco Corporation (SYY  -  Free Report)Prior Close: $62.22 / 52-Week High: $62.79Food distribution giant Sysco is experiencing strong momentum in the wake of its tenth-consecutive quarter or matching or surpassing earnings estimates. Shares of the company have soared about 14% over the past 12 weeks, lifting the stock toward the 52-week high it is hovering at today. But earnings estimates are improving for the current quarter and next quarter, so shares should keep climbing as Sysco’s outlook improves. Our consensus estimates are calling for the company’s bottom line to improve by 12% and 22%, respectively, over the next two quarters. 3.       CBOE Holdings, Inc. (CBOE  -  Free Report)Prior Close: $132.91 / 52-Week High: $133.31Earnings estimates are moving higher for both the current and next fiscal year for CBOE, an options exchange based in Chicago. This revision activity has been a driving force for the stock, which has now gained more than 20% over the last 12 weeks. Still, impressive top and bottom line growth in the current quarter should inspire even stronger momentum, and a rising rate environment over the next few years should help that momentum continue into the long term. 4.       Dollar Tree, Inc. (DLTR  -  Free Report)Prior Close: $112.90 / 52-Week High: $115.89Much has been made about the death of brick-and-mortar retail, but times have perhaps never been better for discount retailers like Dollar Tree. The company is riding high after two solid earnings beats, and the stock has moved more than 23% over the past 12 weeks. Meanwhile, our consensus estimate for Dollar Tree’s upcoming fiscal year earnings has gained a whopping 60 cents within the past 60 days. The company’s bottom line outlook is improving significantly, and investors will hope that this improvement inspires continued momentum. 5.       FedEx Corporation (FDX  -  Free Report)Prior Close: $272.25 / 52-Week High: $273.16Shipping behemoth FedEx is bouncing back strongly after a concerning down period. The company beat our consensus earnings estimate by more than 10% in the most recent quarter, and shares have soared more than 20% within the past 12 weeks. That surge has lifted FedEx to these 52-week high levels, but the stock should break higher soon on the back of its improved earnings outlook. Our consensus estimates are soaring thanks to a tidal wave of positive revisions, so investors should be able to capitalize soon. Bottom LineAll of these stocks are quickly approaching their 52-week highs, and that means they should be on your radar. Each stock is also sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) based on its strong earnings-related data, including recent positive estimate revisions. While there are no guarantees on the stock market, these five companies definitely appear to be well-equipped to establish new ranges soon.Want more analysis from this author?

3204,TGT,"A splendid holiday season has given retailers a reason to smile. Certainly, Americans were in the mood to spend, as retail sales during the November/December period increased 5.5% to $691.9 billion, per National Retail Federation. Bullish stock market, improved job prospects, upbeat consumer sentiment and modest inflation were enough to trigger consumer spending.Our today’s article revolves around three discount store retailers — Target (TGT  -  Free Report), Costco (COST  -  Free Report) and PriceSmart (PSMT  -  Free Report). Promising holiday sales numbers have not only helped the retail-discount industry to rally approximately 20% in three months but also outpace the S&P 500’s growth of roughly 10%. We noted that the industry occupies a space in the top 20% of the Zacks classified industries (52 out of the 256). Further, the broader Retail-Wholesale sector of which they are part of is also placed at top 13% of the Zacks classified sectors (2 out of 16).From the above, it is quite apparent that the near-term outlook for the industry looks favorable. Let’s take a closer look at the performances of the three discount retailers.Target Posts Solid Holiday CompsTarget joined the bandwagon of retailers that have witnessed strong holiday season sales. Comparable sales for this general merchandise retailer rose 3.4% in the combined November/December period buoyed by healthy store comps, robust traffic and sturdy digital sales. The solid holiday numbers allowed management to lift the view.Target now anticipates digital sales to increase more than 25% for the fourth straight year in fiscal 2017. The company now projects fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 adjusted earnings in the band of $1.30-$1.40 compared with the prior range of $1.05-$1.25. For the fiscal year, management now forecasts adjusted earnings between $4.64 and $4.74 per share, up from the previous guidance of $4.40-$4.60.Further, Target now envisions comparable sales to increase approximately 3.4% during the fourth quarter with the full year expected to be just over 1%. Taking into account the 53rd week, Target anticipates total sales to increase more than 9% in the final quarter.Target is trying all means to rapidly adapt to the changes in the retail ecosystem, which is more inclined toward digitalization. Initiatives such as the development of omni-channel capacities, diversification and localization of assortments along with emphasis on flexible format stores bode well for this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Costco Unveils Healthy CompsCostco seems somewhat unfazed by tough retail scenario, comprising soft traffic and inclination toward online shopping. It continued with its solid comparable-store sales trend in the month of November as well December, which is the most crucial part of the year for retailers. Comparable-store sales rose 10.8% and 11.5% during November and December period, respectively. Meanwhile, comparable e-commerce sales for the respective months surged 39% and 33.3%.We believe that this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s growth strategies, sturdy comparable-store sales (comps) performance, strong membership trends and higher penetration of Citi Visa co-brand card program are the pillars that reinforce its position. Moreover, analysts believe that Costco is likely to gain from Wal-Mart’s (WMT  -  Free Report) latest decision to shut 63 of 660 Sam’s Club outlets in the United States over the next few weeks.PriceSmart Witnesses Comps GrowthPriceSmart, which owns and operates membership shopping warehouse clubs, registered net sales increase of 6.4% and 4.9% in the months of November and December, respectively. This San Diego, CA-based company’s comparable warehouse sales jumped 2.7% and 6.4% during the said periods, respectively.The company also recently came out with first-quarter fiscal 2018 results, wherein earnings of 74 cents missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 82 cents and declined roughly 10% from the year-ago period. However, the top line of this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company came in line with the consensus mark. The company reported total revenue of $767.1 million, reflecting an increase of 3.7% year over year.Zacks Top 10 Stocks for 2018In addition to the stocks discussed above, would you like to know about our 10 finest buy-and-hold tickers for the entirety of 2018?Last year's 2017 Zacks Top 10 Stocks portfolio produced double-digit winners, including FMC Corp. and VMware which racked up stellar gains of +67.9% and +61%.

3205,TGT,"Welcome to the ninth episode of Full-Court Finance, the podcast from Zacks Investment Research focused on the intersection of sports, business, and the stock market. On this week’s episode, we dive into the business of Major League Soccer ahead of Saturday’s championship matchup between the Seattle Sounders and Toronto FC.The MLS has grown in both size and stature in recent years. Just last week, the MLS announced four cities—Cincinnati, Detroit, Nashville, and Sacramento—as finalists for two new expansion franchises, with a whopping $150 million price tag attached.On top of that, the league’s TV ratings and attendance numbers have climbed in 2017. Team valuations also continue to rise, as notable owners from the NFL and NBA, such as Robert Kraft and Paul Allen, help inspire other billionaires to get in on the growth of MLS.The league’s TV partners—Fox (FOXA  -  Free Report), ESPN (DIS  -  Free Report), Univision, and others—broadcasted more games than ever before, many in new primetime spots on flagship channels.Adidas (ADDYY  -  Free Report) is firmly committed to MLS and growing the sport of soccer in the U.S. The German sportswear giant keeps on pouring money into the league through jersey deals and youth development.MLS is also a corporate sponsors dream, given the ability to advertise directly on team jerseys. This is something Herbalife Ltd. (HLF  -  Free Report), Alaska Air Group, Inc. (ALK  -  Free Report), Target (TGT  -  Free Report), Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report), and many others have embraced. Home Depot (HD  -  Free Report), AT&T (T  -  Free Report), and Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report) are also all current MLS partners and sponsors.Still, despite all of these positive signs and real growth, many people around the U.S. question the current and long-term viability of the relatively young MLS.If you have any questions about this episode of Full-Court Finance please feel free to shoot us an email over at podcast@zacks.com.

3206,TGT,"Standing on the first day of the last month of 2017, we can say that this year has been a blissful one for investors with markets attaining new highs. Evidently, the market has been on a roll, buoyed by an improving U.S. economy, favorable earnings reports and a supportive monetary policy.Encouragingly, the latest GDP data suggests that the U.S. economy improved at a better-than-expected rate in the third quarter, also marking its fastest pace over the past three years. Per the Bureau of Economic Analysis, the second estimate for the third-quarter GDP jumped at an annual rate of 3.3%, courtesy of higher business investments and favorable government spending. An improved labor market and increased consumer spending has also been driving the economy, which saw growth of at least 3% for the second straight quarter.Moreover, Fed Chair’s comment, ""the economy will continue to expand” ushers in positive sentiment among investors, who now have plenty of investment opportunities this month before they bid adieu to 2017. To top it, Trump’s proposed tax cut is expected to provide further impetus to the already buoyant market.Retail Seems to be the Season’s DemandYellen’s comment: “the economic expansion is increasingly broad-based across sectors,"" deems fit at the current juncture. That said, let’s move our focus to the Zacks Retail – Wholesale sector which looks quite well-placed for December, thanks to the bolstered consumer confidence and solid prospects from the holiday season. Incidentally, the sector has rallied 28.8% this year, surpassing the S&P 500’s upside of 20.1%.  Bullish markets, gradual wage improvement, rising economic activities after hurricanes and falling unemployment rate has boosted consumer sentiment. This is clearly visible from the recent Consumer Confidence data, which reached its highest level in almost 17 years. Per the Conference Board data, the Consumer Confidence Index surged to 129.5 in November from October’s revised reading of 126.2.This clearly signals consumers’ willingness to spend more this holiday season, which is the most crucial period for retailers, as it accounts for a sizeable chunk of yearly revenues and profits. Fortunately, it commenced on a good note this year, as reflected by National Retail Federation’s (NRF) data for the five-day period stretching over Thanksgiving to Cyber Monday. Also, NRF’s sales projection (including e-commerce) for November and December bodes well for the retail space.From Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) to Target (TGT  -  Free Report), retailers are gearing up for the busiest part of the year, and with digital transformation in shopping, they are fast adopting the omni-channel mantra. Having said that, we believe the sector offers lucrative opportunities for investors to make their Christmas holidays special.Your Holiday Shopping Stock Buys for DecemberWe have identified four rock-solid stocks from the Retail – Wholesale space, with a favorable Zacks Rank. Boasting impressive fundamentals and a splendid earnings surprise history, these stocks have surged more than 20% so far this year.Starting with Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report), the company has seen its shares rally 43.6% so far this year, crushing the industry’s growth of 33.4%. We note that this supermarket giant has delivered nine straight quarters of positive earnings surprises, driven by its aggressive expansion in the e-commerce space. These factors, along with management’s recently raised guidance for fiscal 2018 make this big-box retailer a solid bet. Walmart, which carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) has long-term earnings per share growth rate of 6.1%. You can seethe complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Investors can also count on Burlington Stores, Inc. (BURL  -  Free Report), which has surpassed earnings estimates for 12 consecutive quarters now. Further, Burlington has been doing well on the revenue front, backed by its solid strategic initiatives. These factors have helped this Zacks Rank #2 stock soar 25.5%, faring better than the industry that advanced 10.3%. Additionally, this retailer of branded apparel products has a long-term growth rate of 17.5%. Five Below, Inc. (FIVE  -  Free Report) is another solid pick with long-term growth rate of 28.5%. This Zacks Rank #2 company’s impressive merchandise assortment, focus on pre-teen customers and favorable pricing strategy help it stand strong amid a tough retail landscape. This is evident from the Five Below’s stellar past record. Notably, the company has delivered positive earnings surprises for nine quarters in a row now, helping its stock soar 54.7% year to date, as against the industry’s ’s decline of 13.4%.Finally, investors can invest in Dollar Tree, Inc. (DLTR  -  Free Report), which carries the same Zacks Rank as the aforementioned stocks. This operator of discount variety stores has topped earnings estimates in three out of the past four quarters, while posting 39 straight quarters of positive same-store sales growth. Thanks to these solid metrics and the recently raised outlook for fiscal 2017, shares of the company have gained 33.1% this year, outperforming the industry’s growth of 10.4%. Dollar Tree’s long-term growth rate of 13.1% also bodes well.5 Medical Stocks to Buy NowZacks names 5 companies poised to ride a medical breakthrough that is targeting cures for leukemia, AIDS, muscular dystrophy, hemophilia and other conditions.New products in this field are already generating substantial revenue and even more wondrous treatments are in the pipeline.

3207,TGT,"In early November, reports emerged that Target Corporation (TGT  -  Free Report) was looking to shutter a dozen stores by February next year. A spokesperson for the company commented that this was part of an annual process aimed at closing underperforming locations. But Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) Target’s decision serves to illustrate the dilemma facing the retailer and its competitors and the need to react effectively to new challenges.Brick & Mortar’s ChallengesIt’s not that it’s been a bad year for retail overall. According to data from the Department of Commerce, retail sales registered a year-over-year increase of 3.9% up to October. Of course, not all sectors have managed to latch onto gains. The challenges faced by brick and mortal retail have received wide coverage. But the condition of department stores is particularly acute. Over the same period, department stores witnessed a 2.8% decline in sales. The challenges faced by the department store segment are reflected in the fortunes of brands such as Macy's, Inc. (M  -  Free Report) and Sears Holdings Corporation , which have had to close a number of stores in response to the decline in shopping traffic.Wal-Mart Aces Results, Target Lowers OutlookStanding head and shoulders above the rest of the competition is Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report), which reported solid third quarter earnings and raised its view on Nov 16. The stock has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The company raised its bottom-line view for fiscal 2018 and now envisions adjusted earnings in the range of $4.38-$4.46 per share, as compared with the prior expectation of $4.30-$4.40. (Read: Walmart Stock Gains on Solid Q3 Earnings & Raised View)Target also reported strong third quarter results, but shares of the Minneapolis-based company declined 4% in pre-market trading on Nov 15.  This is because the year-over-year decline in the bottom line and management’s commentary about highly competitive environment in the fourth quarter was not well perceived by investors. Target now envisions fourth-quarter earnings in the band of $1.05-$1.25 and fiscal 2017 earnings between $4.40 and $4.60 up from $4.34 and $4.54 per share, projected earlier. (Read: Target Falls Despite Q3 Earnings Beat: Here's Why)What did Wal-Mart Get Right?So what exactly did the iconic discount retailer get right? After years of sluggish sales, Wal-Mart got its act together primarily through a two-pronged approach. Firstly, it has invested billions of dollars in technology in order to fortify its e-commerce presence. And its success on this front can be gleaned from e-commerce sales recorded between Black Friday and Cyber Monday this year.Wal-Mart’s share of online expenditure during this period has jumped to 10%, more than twice as much as the proportion recorded a year ago. Much of this success can be attributed to its acquisition of erstwhile Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) competitor Jet.com last year for $3 billion.Human Factor Holds the KeyFurther, in order to facilitate delivery, Walmart recently acquired a delivery startup Parcel, Inc., which is a last-mile delivery service and specializes in same-day delivery for perishable and non-perishable products. Other than this, the company’s Walmart Pickup program enables customers to place orders online and then pick them up at a store for free.Even though the spotlight is squarely on Wal-Mart’s online efforts, the largest portion of the retailer’s new found vitality has come from its strong investments in people. Around two years ago, Wal-Mart decided to invest $2.7 billion in higher wages and training, a move which did little to cheer market watchers. But it’s one that has paid off, helping the shares close in on the $96 mark post third quarter earnings.Did Target Miss a Trick?Firstly, Target has put in a considerably better performance over the last six months. The company’s strategic endeavors and turnaround plan has helped it gain 7.9% over the last six months, though it has still underperformed its larger rival and the broader market over this period. Target needed to take a fresh look at its strategy after a misadventure in the food segment, a hacker attack and the now all too familiar threat of Amazon led its shares to decline by more than 16% over the last two years even as the S&P 500 gained more than 13%.And its investments in technology and people as well as its decision to experiment with a larger variety of store formats seem to be paying off.  During the third quarter, Target experienced a 1.4% increase in store traffic while the same metric is now up 0.9% year to date. This reverses the decline in traffic, which the franchise was facing at the beginning of the year.It’s Aggression That’s MissingEven though Target may be doing similar things, it is missing out on the speed and scale of Wal-Mart. Its investments in people and technology are far lower than that of its larger competitor. For instance, Target received significant media attention after raising its minimum wage for associates from $10 per hour to $11. But this is still miniscule compared to the mammoth investments Wal-Mart had invested in its area. With shelf stacking time significantly reduced, the iconic retailer’s associates are now free to assist its customers. But what Target seems to be really missing out on is a bit of aggression.Though Target has recently adopted a cost reduction strategy, Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail recently commented that were execution related issues with its new Project 62 home label. “It is almost as if Target lacks the confidence to push this range heavily,"" Saunders said. In contrast, Wal-Mart has upped the ante against Amazon, proactively cutting prices and offering discounts to counter the online behemoth.How Target Plans to Right its ShipAll’s not lost for Target and it has made strong strides in several areas. Firstly, it has decided to introduce flexible format stores in order to increase its presence in densely populated urban locations. Also, it has significantly developed its online platform and aggressively reduced costs.For instance, the retailer is trying to find new ways to leverage its extensive network of 1,800 stores. According to Target, nearly 50% of its digital volume is being fulfilled by its store network, a proportion which is expected to rise to 80% by Christmas.But Target’s strategy for the near future centers on providing brick and mortar store outlets for discretionary spending which seek to complement online purchases. With this goal in mind, Target has launched several private labels. The number of these instore brands should rise to 12 by the end of next year.Further, it has decided to provide more premium offerings, such as Goodfellow & Co, which is targeted toward men, a segment which has ignored Target for quite some time.  According to some analysts, its move to differentiate many of its offerings has made price comparisons increasingly difficult. ConclusionSome industry watchers still feel that Target lacks the aggression needed to take on the competition. But Wal-Mart’s smaller rival has taken several steps to overcome the sluggishness of the past. This is why it could come up with a significantly better performance in the year to come.5 Medical Stocks to Buy NowZacks names 5 companies poised to ride a medical breakthrough that is targeting cures for leukemia, AIDS, muscular dystrophy, hemophilia, and other conditions.New products in this field are already generating substantial revenue and even more wondrous treatments are in the pipeline.

3209,TGT,"Retailers are already gearing up for the vitally important holiday season, perhaps none more so than Target (TGT  -  Free Report). The company has already been busy, but here is everything investors and shoppers need to know about Target’s recent moves, as the company prepares to do retail battle over the next four months.Target has seen its stock price plunge since the start of the year, and the shifting retail environment has placed a renewed burden on the more upscale big-box retailer to adapt and innovate.However, the retail chain has already made changes, and it seems to have wasted no time in making its holiday intentions known: it is ready to fight Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) and Wal-Mart (WMT  -  Free Report) for customers on all fronts.Holiday Employees The Minneapolis-based retail power announced on Wednesday that it plans to hire around 100,000 seasonal employees at its 1,816 stores. Target’s holiday hiring push is up 40% from last year.As online shopping proliferates, shoppers have grown accustomed to ease, which means Target needs short lines and full shelves. Target hopes the big boost in holiday workers will help the company make consumers’ shopping experiences more smooth and speedy.The company also hopes to add 4,500 more employees to its distribution and fulfillment centers in order to more quickly refill products in stores, and maybe more importantly, help carry out Target’s new online sales push. Target’s online orders have skyrocketed since it began to bolster its online shopping business and experience, which includes faster deliveries. Last month, the company reported that its online sales climbed 32% in the second quarter.Target is one of the only big-time retailers to have officially announced its seasonal worker push already. But it will likely be matched by its competition, as Amazon hired about 120,000 extra holiday workers last year—which marked a 20% increase.Target is set to hold nationwide hiring events Oct. 13-15.HGTV StarsTarget has partnered with celebrities and designers before, but they were often for limited-time engagements. The company’s newest deal with cable television stars Chip and Joanna Gaines—from HGTV's widely popular home remodeling show “Fixer Upper”—is a multi-year partnership.The corporation’s official deal is with the TV couple’s successful home and lifestyle brand, “Magnolia.” The Gaines’ Target collaboration, “Hearth & Hand with Magnolia,” will debut on Nov. 5.The new Target collection will feature more than 300 different pieces, including holiday gifts and home décor. The Hearth & Hand with Magnolia line will range in price from $0.99 to $129.99, but most items will cost less than $29.99. Updates to the product offerings will be made throughout the year.“In a retail environment where differentiation has never been more important, we’re doubling down and introducing more than a dozen new brands to provide guests with even more reasons to choose Target,” Target executive VP Mark Tritton said in a statement.“Partnering with Chip and Joanna to create a modern farmhouse collection available only at Target allows us to offer an aesthetic we know our guests will love, and the quality and affordable prices can’t be beat.”Target is also set to introduce another new furniture and home décor line next week, dubbed “Project 62.” The modernist design-focused line will pay homage to styles that took off in the early 1960s, as well as the specific year Target started:1962.New Clothing Lines The retail giant managed to become a popular place to buy low-cost clothing with an upscale feel, which was mostly geared towards women—although men’s brands were very present.Target announced this summer that it would stop selling widely sold clothing brands Mossimo, Merona, Cherokee, and Circo. But fashion is always moving, and the company decided it was ready to debut new brands and lines.The company recently launched “A New Day,” a new women’s line, which Target hopes women will wear ""from weekend to work to dinner date, effortlessly."" The retailer is set to debut “JoyLab,” a different women’s line with a “street-fashion vibe,” in October.The company ditched its old menswear lines because they found that “men come to Target to buy… underwear,” according to a company statement.However, “Goodfellow & Co.” made its debut at the beginning of September. Target’s new menswear line is more modern and higher-end, with a J.Crew-esque vibe that features clothing, shoes, and accessories.Bottom Line Target has started to invest billions of dollars—$7 billion to be exact—into remodeling stores and opening small-scale locations in major metropolitan areas, including Chicago. And just last week, Target began cutting prices on items from cereal and baby formula to razors and paper towels.Target’s holiday and long-term push forward seems to be paying off already, as its shares surged over 2.75% on Wednesday to hit $60.11—the corporation’s highest intraday mark since February.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

3210,TGT,"Remember Nordstrom Inc.’s (JWN  -  Free Report) family was planning to take the company private? Well, it might just happen soon. Evidently, on Sep 12 there were news that Nordstrom’s family is in talks with Leonard Green & Partners to help fund the transaction. Though the deal wasn’t confirmed but the news sent shares of this fashion specialty retailer up by nearly 10% in the after-market trading session.This was clearly a respite for investors who have long been worried about Nordstrom’s ability to cope up with the evolving consumer trends and the mounting competition from e-commerce giant, Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report). Owing to these concerns, the stock has lost 3.7% so far this year, though it performed better than the industry’s slump of 27.2%. If yesterday’s news could drive such positive sentiments among investors, it is to be seen how the stock will actually react if the plans are put to action.The Plan in DetailsSources revealed that Leonard Green, which is a private equity firm, is likely to provide equity worth nearly $1 billion to Nordstrom’s family, to fund the buyout. Apart from this, the family is also trying to raise debt of roughly $7-$8 billion from banks. In fact, per the sources, the family, which currently owns about 31% stake in the company, might come up with a formal proposal in the next two weeks.  The Nordstrom family comprises the company’s three Co-Presidents — Blake W. Nordstrom, Peter E. Nordstrom and Erik B. Nordstrom; President of Stores — James F. Nordstrom; Chairman — Emeritus Bruce A. Nordstrom, and Anne E. Gittinger, together. It was in June when the Seattle-based company first announced that the family (“Group”) is seeking viable options of taking the company private, by buying all the outstanding shares of Nordstrom.Ever since then, the Group has been looking for potential sponsors. Apparently, the family also had talks with Apollo Global Management LLC and KKR & Co LLP to help the deal pass through. However, the final terms with Leonard Green are not confirmed yet, and it is quite likely for Nordstrom’s family to face interruptions from other parties in the process.Can Going Private Help Nordstrom Battle the Hurdles?Nordstrom is no different from other retailers who are trying all means to stay afloat in the challenging retail landscape. With consumers’ accelerated transition to the dot.com world, store traffic has been hit hard. Consequently, retailers are quickly resorting to e-commerce development, alongside closing underperforming stores. Apart from Nordstrom, big-wigs like Macy’s Inc. (M  -  Free Report), Target Corporation (TGT  -  Free Report) and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report) are few among the many retailers who are firing on all cylinders to catch up with the online rage, thanks to Amazon’s rising dominance.That said, going private could be a prudent move for Nordstrom’s family, as it will help them reshape the organization and overcome the retail hurdles faster, which is not that easy as a public entity. As a private firm, it will be easier for Nordstrom to make the required investments as per the changing consumer trends, without caring much about stockholders’ short-term responses.  Concurrent to its first announcement of plans to go private, Nordstrom stated that its board of directors have organized a special committee. This “Special Committee” that consists of Nordstrom’s independent directors, will act on the company’s behalf on anything related to the aforementioned privatization. While any formal proposal is still pending, sources revealed that this Special Committee will evaluate the deal terms in case of any offer.Nordstrom currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

3211,TGT,"Nordstrom, Inc. (JWN  -  Free Report) recently announced the launch of Nordstrom Local, its first modern retailing concept store that does not stock merchandise. Notably, it is quite different from the traditional retail concept, a neighborhood store, where the company’s services are easily available in a centralized location.Slated to open doors on Oct 3 at Melrose Place in West Hollywood, CA, this 3,000 square-foot store is likely to focus on personal styling, consultations, appointments along with buy online, pick-up in-store and same-day delivery services. Notably, the merchandise will enter this store after having consultations with personal stylists. This leading fashion retailer will also relocate one of its stores from Westside Pavilion to Century City on the same day.Furthermore, this inventory-free store will house a styling suite with eight dressing rooms around a central hall where customers can relax and have discussions with the personal stylists. This Los Angeles-based store will also cater to on-site tailoring as well as alterations, coupled with Trunk Club stylists, curbside pickup, digital boards with tailored fashion recommendations. Additionally, various modes of refreshment with gift cards and easy return processes from stores as well as online will be present there.We note that Nordstrom has brought this modern retailing concept to suit the needs of the challenging retail landscape. In fact, the retail sector is on a transformation mode, where various companies are shifting their focus to newer store concepts with maximum online services. To this end, the new store is expected to cater to its customers the best shopping experience with valuable and faster services.Apart from Nordstrom, Target Corporation (TGT  -  Free Report) also continues to lay emphasis on developing flexible format stores to penetrate deeper into urban areas.Markedly, Nordstrom runs in coherence with the evolving retail industry that is focused on offering maximum choices to customers for enhancing their shopping experience. Also, the company continues to efficiently allocate a major portion of its capital toward its multichannel growth strategy focused on improving its merchandise offerings, developing IT infrastructure to enhance web and mobile experience of customers, renovating stores with a modern look, and developing fulfillment centers to enable speedy delivery to online customers. Consequently, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock was up 2.5% in the last six months, as against the industry’s decline of 20.5%.

3212,TGT,"On Monday, The Wall Street Journal reported that upscale department store chain Nordstrom (JWN  -  Free Report) is readying a new concept that is much different than its other retail ventures: a store that doesn’t even sell clothes.Called Nordstrom Local, which opens October 3 in West Hollywood, California, this new store concept will focus on personal styling and consultations, and prospective customers will be able to make appointments ""online, over the phone or in-person,"" said Nordstrom in a statement.When customers enter Nordstrom Local, they’ll likely notice it’s much smaller than a typical Nordstrom location. The concept is only 3,000 square feet, measuring just a fraction of the size of the company’s mall-anchored flagships. But that’s the point: Local was designed in mind to be convenient, a time-saving option for shoppers on the go.“As the retail landscape continues to transform at an unprecedented pace, the one thing we know that remains constant is that customers continue to value great service, speed and convenience,” said Shea Jensen, Nordstrom senior vice president of customer experience.“We know there are more and more demands on a customer's time and we wanted to offer our best services in a convenient location to meet their shopping needs. Finding new ways to engage with customers on their terms is more important to us now than ever,” Jensen continued.Another deviation from a typical Nordstrom department store, and your regular retailer, is that Nordstrom Local won’t have any clothes in stock. Instead, there will be eight dressing rooms where customers can try on certain items of clothing, and if you find something that works, the personal stylists will then “retrieve goods from nine Nordstrom locations in Los Angeles, or through its website,” writes the WSJ.Additionally, any orders placed on Nordstrom.com by 2 p.m. can be picked up at Nordstrom Local, and the store will also be able to accept returns of items bought online of from other Nordstrom locations.More than anything, Nordstrom Local is service-oriented, and in addition to styling services, customers have access to the retailer’s other amenities like Trunk Club styling, Buy Online, Pick-Up In-Store, onsite alterations and tailoring, same-day delivery, and curbside delivery. Local will also offer manicures and a bar that offers coffee, pressed juices, and wine or beer.Nordstrom isn’t the only retailer experimenting with smaller format stores. Target (TGT  -  Free Report), in particular, has been notably expanding this kind of concept in urban areas, while fellow department stores Kohl’s (KSS  -  Free Report) and Sears  have been shrinking a good number of its existing locations.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

3213,TGT,"When Walmart (WMT  -  Free Report) bought e-commerce up-and-comer Jet.com last year for $3.3 billion, it was the beginning of its seemingly relentless digital and online initiative, as the retailer gained Jet founder Marc Lore as its new CEO of Walmart eCommerce U.S.Following this acquisition, Walmart has scooped up upscale menswear company Bonobos, Modcloth.com, Moosejaw, Shoebuy.com, and Hayneedle.com, all companies who largely operated online. There’s even talks that Walmart could buy online cosmetics retailer Birchbox.All of these companies together create quite a retail arsenal, and combined with its grocery division, makes Walmart one of the few companies able to successfully compete with Amazon.com (AMZN  -  Free Report).Walmart and Amazon have steadily become arch-rivals since the Jet acquisition, and even more so once Amazon completed its purchase of upscale organic grocer Whole Foods Market. But according to a New York Post report, Jet is preparing to launch its very first private-label grocery brand, most certainly a response from Walmart now that Whole Foods’ popular 365 brand is available through AmazonFresh.The brand, called “Uniquely J,” will have more than 60 food and household items like coffee, olive oil, laundry detergent, and paper towels, and the label is set to debut in the coming months. Jet said that the brand will be tailored towards “young urban adults,” which is not a demographic Walmart is known for interacting with.Uniquely J will be exclusive to Jet.com for the first year, but will then be available on Walmart.com and could even be sold in Walmart stores, said the Post’s sources familiar with the plan. Right now, Jet.com is selling Walmart’s own private-label brands like Equate, Great Value, and Sam’s Choice, though those labels aren’t hitting the mark with the site’s younger customers, added the Post.This move comes soon after Walmart announced an interesting addition to its grocery game. America’s largest brick-and-mortar will soon be testing a service in Silicon Valley that delivers groceries to your home and unloads them for you straight to your refrigerator—even when you’re not home.Private labels can be huge revenue boosters for retailers. Costco (COST  -  Free Report) is known for its hugely popular Kirkland brand, while Target (TGT  -  Free Report) has seen financial performance improve recently thanks to its in-house brands. Then there’s Aldi, whose entire inventory is almost private-label brands, and some of them are even award-winning. The Exquisite Collection Côtes de Provence Rosé finally came to the U.S., and at $8 a bottle, likely sold out fast at some locations.  Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers.

3214,TGT,"The retail industry has been witnessing rapid changes of late due to intense competition and increasing online activity. We note that traditional retailers have been experiencing increasing sales pressure and are finding it hard to keep up its market share amid highly promotional environment. With a digital transformation in shopping and consumers preferring to buy online, store and mall traffic has been impacted adversely. As a result, many retailers are shutting stores and focusing on their online models to compete with e-commerce channels. These firms are also trying to find innovative ways to attract traffic to stores. One such stock is Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report). The Bentonville, AR-based company enjoys strong growth potential along with compelling fundamentals and has been making efforts to understand the evolving needs of customers and drive traffic in both at stores and online.Let’s now look into some of the factors that have been aiding the company’s performance and few of the challenges it has been dealing with.Initiatives to Understand Customer Needs and Boost Sales: The company is striving to understand the evolving needs of customers to regain their confidence, and boost sales. The company’s recent move to consolidate its U.S. operations will simplify its business structure and facilitate communication as well as improve execution. The move will also help the company to reduce its sky-high expenses, which have resulted from higher e-commerce activities and wage hikes. This will further help in increasing  efficiency at stores.Walmart’s international business has also shown improvement in the recently concluded second-quarter fiscal 2018, which has been declining since first-quarter fiscal 2016. Results were driven by improved performance at Walmex and in U.K. In fact, nine out of 11 international markets posted positive comp sales, including in the U.K., and five of these markets grew comps by more than 5%. Walmart continues to believe that its future revenue growth is expected to come from international markets.Improving Comps Sales Growth at Walmart U.S.: Walmart is seeing positive comps at Walmart U.S. for the last 12 quarters. Traffic has also improved for eleven consecutive quarters, thanks to the company’s efforts to modernize its stores to boost traffic. Traffic also increased due to moderate improvement in consumer spending. Walmart’s efforts to change its stores as per consumers’ demand helped the retailer attract shoppers. In fact, the company continues to expect positive comps year over year at Walmart U.S. in fiscal 2018.Higher Investment in E-Commerce Category: Walmart is putting a lot of effort and focusing on expanding its online business in order to gain larger market share than Seattle-based Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report), the leader in the online business. Just like Walmart, retailers like Kohl’s Corporation (KSS  -  Free Report) and Target Corporation (TGT  -  Free Report) are also focusing on its omni-channel retailing and e-commerce activity.In this regard, the company continues to make huge investments in e-commerce initiatives, including acquisitions. The company’s acquisition of four e-commerce businesses (Bonobos, ShoeBuy, Moosejaw, ModCloth) since the Jet.com acquisition (in September 2016) is in line with the Walmart’s quest to build an impressive digital brand portfolio to take on Amazon. Recently, the company announced palns to invest in online cosmetics startup Birchbox. If the deal materializes, it will become the fifth e-commerce acquisition, since the buyout of Jet.com. Meanwhile, the company is increasing investment in Mexico and China, where Amazon has a substantial share. Wal-Mart has also launched its own mobile payment system called Walmart Pay that will allow shoppers to pay through its smartphone app.Walmart is also aggressively trying to get a share of the pie in the online grocery shopping and delivery, which is a booming industry worth $12 billion in the United States. Walmart now operates online grocery delivery service in six markets. The giant retailer also enables customers to order groceries online and collect them from 900 locations. The retail giant has partnered with the ride hailing service provider Uber and Lyft for speedy online grocery deliveries. Walmart has recently unveiled a program wherein it will allow food stamp receivers to order food and groceries online and pick up from any of the five specific stores in the United States. Also, with Easy Reorder on walmart.com, customers can repurchase items by looking into their previous in-store and online purchases records. The company also has a dedicated back-to-school destination on walmart.com which enables customers to shop school supply lists for more than 1 million classrooms across the country.The company’s free two-day shipping to U.S. shoppers on a minimum order of $35 and that too without a membership fee has also proved to be a success. In April, Walmart introduced a program wherein it offered discounts on online items, only if shoppers pick up their orders from a nearby store. The discount given had an added feature to Walmart’s already existing delivery service called Walmart Pickup, which enables customers to place orders online and then pick them up at a store for free. Pickup is currently available at more than 4,600 stores.In fact, the company expects to continue to invest aggressively in e-commerce initiatives in fiscal 2018.4 Promising Stock Picks to Keep an Eye On With news stories about computer hacking and identity theft becoming increasingly commonplace, the cybersecurity industry looks like a promising investment opportunity.

3215,TGT,"Target Corporation (TGT  -  Free Report) recently announced plans to increase the minimum wages of its team members to $11 an hour, effective from October. The company also stated that the minimum hourly wages for all team members will be raised to $15 by the end of 2020. The move will benefit employees with higher wages, right before the holiday season. Encouragingly, the raised wages will also benefit around 100,000 temporary employees hired during the holiday season.Continued Investment in Workforce The labor market conditions in the United States have been steadily improving with declining unemployment rates and frequent wage hikes by firms across different industries.Target previously raised its minimum hourly wages in 2016 to $10 from $9 in 2015, following suit of other giant retailers who raised their pay to attract workers amid a highly competitive market scenario. The current wage hike by Target is expected to force other retailers such as Wal-Mart Stores, Inc (WMT  -  Free Report), one of the largest domestic employers, Costco Wholesale Corporation (COST  -  Free Report) and Gap Inc. (GPS  -  Free Report) to raise their minimum pay in order to remain competitive, especially during the ongoing holiday season hiring.  Target’s wage hike also exceeds the minimum federal wage rate of $7.25.The increase in minimum wages is in line with Target’s strategic store-growth policies, that focuses on retaining efficient employees and attract more workers as the company progresses with its store remodeling and expansion initiatives. Moreover, Target has always remained committed toward investing in its workforce. In addition to a healthy pay, the company also provides a number of other benefits such as discounts on select merchandise at Target stores, health and wellness services as well as financial resources for eligible members.Reiterates Guidance Despite a wage hike, which will lead to higher expenses, Target has reiterated its upcoming third quarter and full-year guidance. This indicates that the current hike will not affect the company’s operating results.Target continues to remain consistent with its sales growth expectation, to be in the range of flat to plus or minus 1%. Adjusted earnings for the third quarter are also continued to be expected in the range of 75 cents to 95 cents per share, while full year earnings are anticipated in the range of $4.34 to $4.54.Though the wage hike will raise the expense burden on the retailer, we believe the move will keep workers content and also help improve customer service. This will ultimately encourage shoppers to spend more.Share Price Performance The company’s continued investment toward improving store formats, customer-friendly initiatives and enhancing online shopping facilities are seen to bode well with investors.

During the past few quarters, Target has implemented a ton of strategic business initiatives, and the impact of this new direction brought surprise positive same-store sales last quarter. Will this new direction help Target manage strong results in Q3?Also reporting this week is Walmart (WMT  -  Free Report), who has significantly stepped up its e-commerce game in an effort to compete with Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report). From high-profile acquisitions to rollout of online grocery, Walmart has been posting double-digit growth in its U.S. digital divisions. Will this trend continue when the retailer releases results on Thursday?Another big name to keep an eye on is Best Buy (BBY  -  Free Report). Just a few months ago, the company held its first investor meeting in five years, outlining new goals for its next phase of growth. While Best Buy is determined to grow its smart home business and mobile market share, it must also take care to increase its same-store sales, especially during the holiday quarter.These reports are as important as ever, as they help shine a light on the current retail landscape, and what the holiday shopping season could look like.As a reminder, if you feel that something was missed, or if you want a different topic covered, send an email to podcast@zacks.com.

3217,TGT,"If you haven’t completed your holiday shopping yet, Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report) surely has some good news for you. This supermarket giant, which is leaving no stone unturned to evolve with the changing consumer trends and combat competition from Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report), came up with plans to ease eleventh-hour shopping.Wal-Mart’s Plans for This Holiday SeasonWell, there were rounds last week that this holiday season, Wal-Mart plans to significantly increase its Walmart.com offerings available for same-day pickup in stores. Notably, this big-box retailer has grown its offerings on Walmart.com by roughly three times over a year. As the company expects demand for same-day deliveries to double in the last two weeks of the holiday season, it plans to strengthen its online assortment more than it had ever done before.Further, per a CNBC report, customers can shop on Walmart.com for items noted ""Free Pickup Today"" until 4 p.m. on Dec 23, and can pick up those products from the company’s stores until 6 pm on Christmas Eve. Also, the big-box retailer came up with another enticing plan, of filling some online order cases with unloaded gift cards. These cards will allow customers to make another gift purchase by adding funds to it.We believe that this last-minute online shopping and pick up in store option is likely to be a bliss for customers. In fact, this step also strengthens Wal-Mart’s competitive position against e-commerce king Amazon. Clearly, these moves reflect Wal-Mart’s aggressive efforts to resonate with the changing trends and make the most of the holiday season.Well, this is not Wal-Mart’s first attempt to make most of the opportunity. This is evident from the company’s recent strategy of keeping its online prices almost on par to that of Amazon this Cyber Monday. Sources revealed that Walmart’s prices were just 0.3% higher than Amazon’s, reflecting the company’s efforts to gain a good share this holiday season.What Other Retailers Are Doing?Notably, the U.S. holiday season is the most important time for retailers who garner a significant chunk of revenues during this period. Consequently, retailers go all out during the season, with early-hour store openings, huge discounts, promotional strategies and free shipping on online purchases. This is visible from the holiday season strategies undertaken by many industry players, other than Wal-Mart.Evidently, Target Corp. (TGT  -  Free Report) announced weekend deals and discounts on select categories (which don’t usually appear for sale in the company’s stores and online) in the beginning of this holiday season. The departmental biggie further stated that it will have weekend offers throughout the season. We also commend Target’s efforts to enhance online shopping during the busy selling period, with its free holiday shipping, Ship from Store, myCheckout, Order Pickup and Target Restock programs, among others.Best Buy (BBY  -  Free Report) is also taking initiatives to boost up sales this holiday season as evident from its “20 Days of Doorbusters” event. With lucrative offers, free shipping, price match guarantee and enticing gift ideas, this consumer electronics retailer is set to make most of this holiday season. Apart from this, Kohl’s (KSS  -  Free Report) and GameStop (GME  -  Free Report) are also luring shoppers with impressive deals and the online shopping and pickup at store facility.Incidentally, the National Retail Federation projects November and December sales (excluding autos, gas and restaurant sales) to rise 3.6-4% year over year to $678.75-$682 billion, which also fares better than the five-year average sales growth of 3.5%.All said, we believe that in an Amazon-dominated world, these retailers’ superb game plans should help them win over customers this holiday season. While Target, Best Buy, Kohl’s and GameStop carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) each, Wal-Mart boasts a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) thanks to its fantastic past performance and successful endeavors to resort to the dot.com bandwagon. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

3218,TGT,"With digital transformation in shopping and consumers splurging online, store and mall traffic has been hit hard. As a result, most retailers including big-box ones are struggling to compete with e-Commerce channels. Nevertheless, this transition in buying pattern has persuaded retailers to come up with innovative ways to market products, and Target Corp. (TGT  -  Free Report) is no exception to the trend.This general merchandise retailer is trying all means to rapidly adapt to the changes in the retail ecosystem that just witnessed Whole Foods Market’s buyout by Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report). This clearly indicates that technology is going to play a pivotal role going forward.Let’s Take a Look at the StockWe believe that Target’s initiatives such as the development of omni-channel capacities, diversification and localization of assortments along with emphasis on flexible format stores, bode well. The company intends to deploy resources to significantly develop online platform as well as store facilities to make shopping more convenient for customers. These endeavors have helped the stock to outperform the industry in the past six months. The stock increased 4.4% against the industry’s decline of 3.1%.We observed that comparable digital channel sales surged 32% during the second quarter of fiscal 2017 and added 1.1 percentage points to comparable sales. The company intends to launch 12 new brands across its signature categories. It has also rolled out Target Restock program that allows customers to restock their shipping box with essential items online and get them delivered at door steps by the next business day for a nominal charge.The company plans to expand merchandise assortments with special emphasis on Style, Baby, Kids, and Wellness categories that are performing well. Target has also adopted a cost reduction strategy, including rationalization of supply chain, technology and process improvements. Recently, it waged war against other retail big-wigs such as Amazon, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report) and Costco Wholesale Corp. (COST  -  Free Report) by aggressively cutting prices on a range of items.Analysts believe that the move might help improve the top-line performance but will definitely hurt margins. We noted that in both the first and second quarters of fiscal 2017 gross margin contracted 40 basis points to 30.5%. Operating margin also shriveled 80 basis points and 90 basis points to 7.4% and 6.8%, respectively. The retail sector is already reeling under pricing pressure and Target’s recent strategy may not be well perceived by investors.Currently, Target carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

3219,TGT,"With technology having advanced in leaps and bounds, online shopping has become the order of the day. Thanks to the various mobile apps and dot.com businesses, shopping for anything is literally on consumers’ finger-tips. Talking of e-Commerce, Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report) is undoubtedly the first name to pop-up on anyone’s mind.Obviously, consumers’ rapid shift to e-marketplace and Amazon’s growing dominance has hit store traffic hard. This has shaken most retailers and compelled them to adopt omni-channel strategies, which has become the need of the hour. Before getting into how retailers are coping up with the evolving consumer preferences and mounting competition from the e-Commerce king, let’s take a glance at the U.S. Retail e-Commerce Sales data.e-Commerce Sales Data — a Major Indicator of Consumers’ Changing PreferencesPer the U.S. Census Bureau of the Department of Commerce, the estimate for second-quarter 2017 U.S. retail e-Commerce sales rose 4.8% sequentially, to $111.5 billion. On a year-over-year basis, this estimate surged 16.2%. Further, the Bureau stated that e-Commerce sales constituted about 8.9% of the total retail sales in the second quarter, marking a 40 basis points and 90 bps improvement on a sequential and year-over-year basis, respectively. Notably, these estimates included adjustments related to seasonal variations.Amazon Trying to Gain Lion’s ShareAmazon’s popularity is attributable to its solid technological expertise, which enables it to offer consumers an unmatched level of convenience. Its user-friendly app and website, impressive product assortment, constant innovations, and seamless payment and checkout system have helped it to become consumers’ favorite shopping destination.Further, this e-Commerce giant’s success story is highlighted by its AmazonFresh Pickup service, and its cloud computing arm, Amazon Web Services (AWS). While the former allows users to order groceries online, the latter is a provider of technological infrastructure. This biggie is also known for the online and offline features added to its bookstores.Driven by these efforts, the company recorded 25% growth in net sales, which came in at roughly $38 billion in the second quarter of 2017. When most retailers are struggling to boost their top lines, Amazon’s growth is a clear indication of how the company trying to capture the lion’s share.Moreover, the company’s takeover of Whole Foods Market Inc. sent shivers down major grocery retailers. Also, NIKE Inc.’s (NKE  -  Free Report) plans to sell directly through Amazon raised concerns for other sporting goods retailers like Foot Locker, Dicks Sporting Goods, Inc. and Hibbett Sports, among others. Clearly, these hurdles have had a dismal impact on the Zacks Retail – Wholesale sector that currently occupies the bottom-most place among all 16 sectors.Can Walmart & Others Catch Up to Amazon?However, retailers are leaving no stone unturned and are following Amazon’s footsteps. The companies are also firing on all cylinders to change their operating methods.  To counter the intense competition and keep pace with the altering trends, various bellwethers are adopting omni-channel strategies to draw online traffic.To start with major supermarket chain Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report), we note that this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company is making huge investments in e-Commerce initiatives. The company’s acquisitions of ShoeBuy, Moosejaw, ModCloth and Jet.com fall in line with its quest to build an impressive digital brand portfolio. Also, Wal-Mart partnered with Alphabet’s Google last month to enable shopping through Google Express using voice-activated service. Notably, Walmart’s e-Commerce sales soared roughly 60% in the last quarter, mainly backed by its solid online grocery business.Target Corporation (TGT  -  Free Report) is another department store retailer that is doing everything possible to stay afloat in the current scenario. Evidently, last week this Minneapolis-based company announced plans to slash prices of a number of products. Incidentally, this news came soon after Amazon decided to cut prices at its recently acquired Whole Foods business.Apart from this, Target has been focused on developing its online business, which helped it to witness comparable digital channel sales growth of 32% in second-quarter fiscal 2017, compared with 16% in the same period last year. Likewise, Macy’s Inc.’s (M  -  Free Report) digital sales witnessed double digit growth in the last quarter, thanks to its omni-channel measures. Both Target and Macy’s hold the same Zacks Rank as Walmart.While this was for department store behemoths, we also have major apparel/shoe and sportswear companies that are responding well to the online rage. As mentioned above, NIKE recently revealed plans to sell directly through Amazon, which is most likely to enhance its market. It looks like the swoosh brand followed athletic wear Under Armour that sells directly through its own, customized page on Amazon.Moving to popular apparel/shoe retailers, American Eagle Outfitters (AEO  -  Free Report), Abercrombie & Fitch and The Gap Inc. (GPS  -  Free Report) are few among the many retailers resonating with the dot.com bandwagon. These retailers’ online sales contributed significantly to their top lines in the last quarter, underscoring their efforts to develop their omni-channel platform to reach customers in every possible way.While American Eagle and Abercrombie carry a Zacks Rank #3 each, Gap carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Will the Efforts Bear Fruit?The aforementioned retailers are just a few examples from the list of those names battling Amazon’s rising dominance. These retailers and their growth strides have helped the sector surge 17.3% so far this year, surpassing the S&P 500 market’s 11.8% growth. Though the present scenario is far from being rosy for retailers, continued focus on boosting e-Commerce investments will definitely help them withstand industry challenges.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

3220,TGT,"The brand image and creditability of Equifax Inc. (EFX  -  Free Report) is in question as very sensitive personal data of approximately 143 million consumers has been stolen from the credit information provider’s database. Reportedly, nearly two-third of the adult U.S. population has been affected due to this cyber attack.The company late last Thursday announced that a data breach occurred between mid-May and July this year, which was discovered on Jul 29. Per Equifax, criminals stole consumer data like “names, Social Security numbers, birth dates, addresses and, in some instances, driver’s license numbers.”In addition to this, as per Equifax’s investigation, hackers accessed the credit card numbers of about 209,000 U.S. consumers and “certain dispute documents with personal identifying information” of nearly 182,000 U.S. consumers.Shares of Equifax plunged nearly 14% last Friday after news of the cyber attack surfaced. Notably, the stock has significantly underperformed the industry to which it belongs to in the year-to-date period. Equifax has lost 4.2% of its value during this period, while the industry recorded growth of 26.2%.Nonetheless, the financial information services provider further noted that its core consumer or commercial credit reporting databases seemed to be safe as it did not find any unauthorized activity. This implies that the consumers’ credit scores are safe.Among the Worst Data BreachesThis is not the first instance when consumer data has been stolen from a company’s data base. Last December, Yahoo! Inc. reported a massive data breach, where private information of over one billion users was compromised. Other big companies like Target Corporation (TGT  -  Free Report), Anthem Inc. (ANTM  -  Free Report) and Sony Corporation (SNE  -  Free Report) have also been victims of cyber attack, when fraudsters stole large number of consumer data.However, sensitivity of the information exposed in Equifax’s data breach case makes it one of the worst in recent times as well as bigger than those at the aforementioned companies. The latest data breach at Equifax is expected to have a lasting impact as criminals can use the stolen resources for opening new accounts, applying for credit cards or loans, buying insurance, renting an apartment or even make tax frauds.It should be noted that banks and financial institutions rely on the United States’ three main consumer credit reporting agencies — Equifax, TransUnion (TRU  -  Free Report) and Experian. Therefore, with access to social security, driver’s license and credit card numbers, criminals can make such frauds due to which consumers will have to suffer for a long time.Criticism MountingThe recent cyber attack has heavily tarnished the brand image, reputation and credibility of Equifax. The company is facing huge customer criticism, while cybersecurity companies are questioning its preparedness and response to this massive data breach.Various investigation agencies, including attorney generals of New York and Illinois, and the U.S. House Financial Services Committee, have already started probing whether the company met its risk management responsibilities or not. Equifax’s directors may be charged for negligence if the investigating agencies discover any loopholes in risk management.Also, per Reuters, two lawsuits have been filed against the company’s negligence over consumer data protection, one at Portland, OR, and one in Atlanta.Bottom LineWith the company facing huge criticism from customers, and lawmakers and investigating agencies probing the mishap, troubles for Equifax are unlikely to end any time soon. We opine that the entire issue may result in loss of customers and the company may also have to make huge compensation to its clients. This is feared to have an adverse impact on the company’s financial performance in the near term.The recent cyber attack proved that most organizations across the globe still lack proper cybersecurity measures. With cyber security becoming a matter of utmost importance, companies should regard it as part of safeguarding strategies and look for more stringent cybersecurity measures to plug the loopholes in the system.Currently, Equifax carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

3221,TGT,"The competition between retail giant Wal-Mart Stores Inc.(WMT  -  Free Report) and online king Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report) seems to be intensifying with the former trying every means to take on the latter in the e-commerce segment. The competition is not only limited to online grocery delivery and pick up services; it has extended to gaining share of lower-priced private label brands. Amazon’s acquisition of the natural and organic foods supermarket chain Whole Foods in August 2017 positioned the company well in the grocery industry and provided access to Whole Foods’ 365 brands. Walmart has also been aggressively expanding in online grocery segment and recently, through its online arm Jet.com, it plans to launch its own private-label brand targeting young urban adults.Focus on Private Labels — Need of the Hour?Notably, customers are becoming more inclined toward private label products as they are low-cost alternatives to national brands. Walmart sells its own private-label brands like Equate, Great Value, and Sam’s Choice on Jet.com. Companies like Costco Corporation (COST  -  Free Report), Target Corporation (TGT  -  Free Report) are also focusing on private labels for boosting revenues. German discount chains Aldi and Lidl are also growing on the back of their private-label products.Jet.com’s Private-Label Brand Uniquely JAccording to New York Post, Jet.com will roll out private-label brand, Uniquely J, in few months with food categories like coffee, olive oil, laundry detergent and paper towels. For the first year, Uniquely J will initially be exclusive to Jet.com, but will later be available on Walmart.com and in Walmart stores.We believe Jet.com’s Uniquely J brand will attract young consumers thanks to its bold packaging and quality ingredients at low price. With the rising demand for private label products, Jet.com’s initiative to offer private merchandises will surely fuel sales. Also, the move is expected to slow down Amazon’s push into the grocery market with lower pricing.Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. QuoteWalmart’s Foray in E-Commerce Walmart has acquired four e-commerce businesses (Bonobos, ShoeBuy, Moosejaw, ModCloth) since the Jet.com acquisition (in September 2016), which is in line with the Walmart’s expansion efforts in the e-commerce space. Recently, the company plans to invest in online cosmetics startup Birchbox. If the deal materializes, it will become the fifth e-commerce acquisition, since the Jet.com buyout.The Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company is trying every means to compete with brick-and-mortar rivals and e-commerce king Amazon.

Recently, the retailer is testing a delivery service in partnership with San Francisco-based smart-lock maker August Home and Menlo Park-based same-day delivery startup Deliv, wherein customers can get groceries delivered to their fridge directly. Walmart has also announced a program wherein it will allow food stamp receivers to order food and groceries online. However, they will have to pick up the items from any of the five specific stores in the United States.In August, the giant retailer teamed up with Alphabet Inc's Google to enter the budding voice-shopping market, following the footsteps of Amazon.If we look into the share price performance on a year-to-date basis, we note that Walmart’s shares have rallied 13.1%, higher than the industry, which grew 5.6%. Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

3222,TGT,"Looking for economic data? You’ve come to the right week. Only trouble is, most of it is coming out after the opening bell today and beyond — which means, by definition, after the Ahead of Wall Street column is published. August New Home Sales and September Consumer Confidence reports come out at 10am ET. Also, Fed Chair Janet Yellen speaks this afternoon, as do other Fed players — specifically Lael Brainard, Loretta Mester and Raphael Bostic. After today’s closing bell, we will see fiscal Q1 2018 earnings results from Nike (NKE  -  Free Report).Ahead of today’s start to normal-day trading, the Case-Shiller Home Price Index report came in slightly better than expected: 5.9% versus 5.7% for the month of July. Yes, this data is from the middle of summer, but is considered to be the most accurate of all metrics regarding U.S. home pricing. This is something the Fed should be happy to see — that real estate price growth is higher than analysts were anticipating — because this lends itself to increased inflation, which will help the Fed (finally) see its 2% goal. Even if this takes longer than expected, increased home pricing is better than a decrease.The other side of the Fed’s dual mandate, apart from 2% inflation, is job growth. This has been solid for the past year and even previously. What has puzzled economists is the lack of wage growth, and on this issue, a new report released by The Hamilton Project, headed by a Brookings Institute fellow, indicates we have seen 0.2% wage growth over the past year. This report, which looks at more than four decades’ worth of data, tracks how productivity and wage growth has decoupled.From 1947 through roughly 1977, wage growth and productivity were in-line with one another. By the late 1990s, productivity had zoomed past wage growth. It flattened during the Great Recession in the last decade, and has been up only gradually ever since. But productivity is still far above wage growth in 2017.Companies like Target (TGT  -  Free Report) independently raising its minimum wage — reported on here by Zacks’ Maddy Johnson — should help a bit, but only if all other retailers, restaurants, etc. follow suit. One company is not enough to create wage growth pressure, which is exactly what is needed for that inflation metric to hit the Fed’s goals.As mentioned above, we expect some interesting statements from Fed Chair Yellen and other members of the Federal Reserve today. Perhaps markets will take direction from these statements later today and for the rest of the week.Equifax (EFX  -  Free Report) CEO Richard Smith is stepping down from his post effective today, a couple weeks after news that 143 million Americans’ data has been compromised by a breach at the company. The stock has fallen precipitously since this news report, and looks to open lower again today.Finally, Carnival Cruise Lines (CCL  -  Free Report) has beaten earnings estimates for at least the fifth consecutive quarter, topping fiscal Q3 2017 estimates by 9 cents per share and coming out ahead of revenue estimates as well. The company did report it expects hurricane and damages in the Caribbean to have a negative effect on Q4 results, but shares are trading up in today’s pre-market.

3223,TGT,"On Friday, shares of big box giant Target Corp. (TGT  -  Free Report) are slipping, down over 2% in afternoon trading on the heels of the company’s new initiative to get more customers shopping at its stores and on its website.Following in the footsteps of rivals Walmart (WMT  -  Free Report) and Amazon.com (AMZN  -  Free Report), Target has cut prices on thousands of items in its inventory, from bath tissue and cereal to baby formula, paper towels, razors, and many more items.The announcement comes just days after Amazon began slashing prices at Whole Foods, marking the completion of its $13.7 billion acquisition of the organic grocery chain. “We want our guests to feel a sense of satisfaction every time they shop at Target,” says Mark Tritton, Target executive vice president and chief merchandising officer. “Part of that is removing the guesswork to ensure they feel confident they’re getting a great, low price every day.”Walmart, of course, has long been known for this kind of pricing strategy, but it will be new to Target shoppers.“We’ve spent months looking at our entire assortment, with a focus on offering the right price every day and simplifying our marketing to make great, low prices easy to spot, all while maintaining sales we know are meaningful to guests. And guests are taking note, appreciating much easier, more clear—and more consistent savings—at Target,” Tritton continued.Target also said that it is getting rid of more than two-thirds of its “price and offer call-outs,” which were signs with phrases like “Weekly Wow” or “Bonus Offer” on them, in favor of clearer messaging in-stores. Big savings, then, should be easier for customers to spot.Other items that are being reduced in price include milk, eggs, crayons, and markers.Target is currently a #3 (Hold) on the Zacks Rank, and the stock is down about 19.7% year-to-date.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

3224,TGT,"Shares of Kroger (KR  -  Free Report) plummeted after the company reported its second-quarter earnings on Friday morning. The grocery store giant’s big profit decline helped send much of the rest of the grocery industry down as well.Kroger’s second-quarter revenues jumped 3.8% to $27.6 billion, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $27.4 billion. The company’s same-store sales, excluding Kroger's fuel centers, gained 0.7%. However, Kroger’s profits sunk nearly 8% to $0.39 a share, which missed our estimate of $0.40 a share.The biggest supermarket chain in the U.S. saw its margins shrink due to increased competition from other grocers, which forced Kroger to cut prices.On Friday, shares of Kroger dropped by nearly 10% to hit a new 52-week intraday trading low of $20.41. Kroger’s stock price was already down almost 30% over the last year. But the grocery chain remained positive, at least in the short-term, despite the increased pressure.""As our business continues to improve, we remain committed to delivering on our guidance in 2017 and believe we have the ability to grow identical supermarket sales and market share in 2018,” Kroger CEO Rodney McMullen said in a statement.The bad news for Kroger is that it began slashing prices well before Amazon’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) acquisition of Whole Foods became official. And the e-commerce giant’s presence in the grocery industry might have contributed to Kroger’s decision to stop providing long-term guidance.“In this dynamic operating environment, we will continue to provide annual guidance as we have done for many years but will no longer provide longer-term guidance,” McMullen continued.Grocery Industry Amazon wasted little time lowering prices at Whole Foods, on everything from milk and cheese to meat, fish, and eggs.On top of cheaper groceries, Amazon’s move into the industry threatens to shake up how people shop in general. The undisputed online retail king’s purchase of Whole Foods has the potential to shift grocery shoppers to online ordering and delivery much sooner than if they had moved into the sector on their own.Kroger’s disappointing second-quarter results, along with the fear of increased competition from new players, helped send shares of Costco (COST  -  Free Report) down over 2% on Friday. Shares of Target (TGT  -  Free Report), which has a substantial grocery business, dipped by 3.68%.Shares of Casey's General Stores (CASY  -  Free Report) and Ingles Markets (IMKTA  -  Free Report) both fell by around 1.5%. Sprouts Farmers Market (SFM  -  Free Report) saw its stock price dip 2.1%Weis Markets  stock sunk 4.77%, while shares of Smart & Final Stores (SFS  -  Free Report) and SUPERVALU Inc. (SVU  -  Free Report) plummeted 8.61% and 7.30%, respectively.Bottom LineNot all grocery store chains need to fear in the near-term, but if the industry does not begin to make changes to its business model soon, Amazon’s Whole Foods deal could make life a whole lot harder. More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

3225,TGT,"Tuesday, September 26, 2017Looking for economic data? You’ve come to the right week. Only trouble is, most of it is coming out after the opening bell today and beyond — which means, by definition, after the Ahead of Wall Street column is published. August New Home Sales and September Consumer Confidence reports come out at 10am ET. Also, Fed Chair Janet Yellen speaks this afternoon, as do other Fed players — specifically Lael Brainard, Loretta Mester and Raphael Bostic. After today’s closing bell, we will see fiscal Q1 2018 earnings results from Nike (NKE  -  Free Report).Ahead of today’s start to normal-day trading, the Case-Shiller Home Price Index report came in slightly better than expected: 5.9% versus 5.7% for the month of July. Yes, this data is from the middle of summer, but is considered to be the most accurate of all metrics regarding U.S. home pricing. This is something the Fed should be happy to see — that real estate price growth is higher than analysts were anticipating — because this lends itself to increased inflation, which will help the Fed (finally) see its 2% goal. Even if this takes longer than expected, increased home pricing is better than a decrease.The other side of the Fed’s dual mandate, apart from 2% inflation, is job growth. This has been solid for the past year and even previously. What has puzzled economists is the lack of wage growth, and on this issue, a new report released by The Hamilton Project, headed by a Brookings Institute fellow, indicates we have seen 0.2% wage growth over the past year. This report, which looks at more than four decades’ worth of data, tracks how productivity and wage growth has decoupled.From 1947 through roughly 1977, wage growth and productivity were in-line with one another. By the late 1990s, productivity had zoomed past wage growth. It flattened during the Great Recession in the last decade, and has been up only gradually ever since. But productivity is still far above wage growth in 2017.Companies like Target (TGT  -  Free Report) independently raising its minimum wage — reported on here by Zacks’ Maddy Johnson — should help a bit, but only if all other retailers, restaurants, etc. follow suit. One company is not enough to create wage growth pressure, which is exactly what is needed for that inflation metric to hit the Fed’s goals.As mentioned above, we expect some interesting statements from Fed Chair Yellen and other members of the Federal Reserve today. Perhaps markets will take direction from these statements later today and for the rest of the week.Equifax (EFX  -  Free Report) CEO Richard Smith is stepping down from his post effective today, a couple weeks after news that 143 million Americans’ data has been compromised by a breach at the company. The stock has fallen precipitously since this news report, and looks to open lower again today.Finally, Carnival Cruise Lines (CCL  -  Free Report) has beaten earnings estimates for at least the fifth consecutive quarter, topping fiscal Q3 2017 estimates by 9 cents per share and coming out ahead of revenue estimates as well. The company did report it expects hurricane and damages in the Caribbean to have a negative effect on Q4 results, but shares are trading up in today’s pre-market.Mark VickerySenior EditorQuestions or comments about this article and/or its author?

3226,TGT,"Holiday season and retail are synonymous, and with the upcoming festive season, the spotlight is back on the sector. Notably, the retailers have started unveiling plans for the busiest part of the year. In keeping with this trend, J. C. Penney Company, Inc. (JCP  -  Free Report) will hire nearly 40,000 seasonal workers to handle the rush, per media report. The seasonal hiring this year is almost same as that of previous year.The company stated that it will be organizing a hiring event on Oct 17. Apart from the seasonal hiring, the company has started hiring an additional 2,500 workers in the Houston area to support hurricane Harvey impacted families whose houses were damaged.Notably, during the holiday season retailers stay on their toes, flooding the market with offers and promotions. They sweep buyers off their feet with early-hour store openings, huge discounts, promotional strategies, and free shipping on online purchases. Since the season accounts for a sizeable chunk of yearly revenues and profits, retailers grab every opportunity to drive footfall.Per media report, other retailers have also announced hiring plans. Target Corp. (TGT  -  Free Report) intends to employ 100,000 associates. Meanwhile, The Gap, Inc. (GPS  -  Free Report) has begun inviting applications for seasonal associate positions at all stores including Gap, Gap Outlet, Banana Republic, Banana Republic Factory and Old Navy across the United States and Canada. Meanwhile, Macy's, Inc. (M  -  Free Report) will hire nearly 80,000 seasonal workers to handle the rush, per media report.Stock PerformanceShares of J. C. Penney have struggled in the past year, as decline in comparable sales has been a major concern for the investors. The stock has tanked 58.8%, wider than the industry’s decline of 26.4%.  In the second quarter, comps decreased 1.3%, compared with an increase of 2.2% in the prior-year quarter. In the first quarter, comps have declined 3.5%. Comps had also declined in the fourth and third quarter of fiscal 2016, by 0.7% and 0.8%, respectively. In fiscal 2017, the company anticipates comps to be in the range of down 1% to up 1%.Further, J. C. Penney continues to struggle with high-debt levels. At the end of the reported quarter, total long-term debt was $3,836 million, reflecting debt-to-capitalization ratio of 77.5%. Earlier, the company had announced plans to lower net debt to EBITDA ratio to less than three times by fiscal 2017.J. C. Penney currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

3227,TGT,"On Monday, big box leader and cheap chic extraordinaire Target Corp. (TGT  -  Free Report) announced that it will be upping its minimum hourly wage over the next few years, increasing it to $11 starting next month and committing to $15 by the end of 2020.Target has previously raised its minimum wage to $10 last May, and before that to $9 an hour in April 2015. The federal minimum wage is $7.25 per hour, which has not increased since July 2009.""Target has always offered market-competitive wages to our team members,"" CEO Brian Cornell said in prepared remarks. ""With this latest commitment, we'll be providing even more meaningful pay, as well as the tools, training, and support ... that set Target apart.""The pay initiative is another part of Target’s reinvention strategy that includes remodeling stores, growing its smaller store footprint (dubbed City Targets), and expanding and bettering its online presence. The company also hopes to use a higher minimum wage to “recruit and retain” top-level team members.Target said that the wage increase beginning in October will also apply to the 100,000 temporary employees the retailer plans to bring aboard ahead of the holiday season, a 43% increase from last year. The company also reiterated its sales and earnings outlook for the third-quarter and full year; this means that these new wage expenses “aren’t expected to impact the retailer's bottom line, as Target baked the wage hike into its $7 billion investment plan,” notes CNBC.Cornell went on to say that Target will address any potential impacts to company profits from the $15 wage at the retailer’s next analyst day for Wall Street this upcoming winter.Many other retailers have offered competitive minimum wages over the years. Rival Walmart (WMT  -  Free Report) recently increased its own minimum hourly wage, raising entry-level hourly pay to $10 last year; the company, which is the country’s largest private employer, also raised wages to $9 an hour in 2015. Additionally, Costco (COST  -  Free Report), Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report)-owned Whole Foods, Swedish giant Ikea, and even apparel retailer Gap Inc. (GPS  -  Free Report) have all boosted their own hourly pay for workers.  But how many will follow in Target’s $15-an-hour footsteps? That number gained serious traction during the last presidential campaign, and Democrats recently introduced a $15 minimum wage bill that is backed by Sen. Bernie Sanders. And, the city of Seattle is gradually increasing its hourly pay to $15, with many cities across the nation proposing similar legislation.However, it is much different for a private company to instill a minimum wage than it is for a city or a federal government. $15-an-hour, though, is hot right now, and there is no doubt Target is using it to help set it apart from other retailers.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana. Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

3228,TGT,"While the retail sector has been struggling with a higher number of store closures or bankruptcy filing, early holiday sales forecasts point to healthier sales that would put a cap on the tumultuous year.This is especially true as Deloitte projects holiday sales to rise as much as 4.5%, up from 3.6% seen last year while RetailNext and AlixPartners forecast 3.8% and 3.5-4.4% growth, respectively. E-commerce sales will likely grow 18-21% year over year, up from 14.3% last year per Deloitte while RetailNext expects a 14.9% jump (read: 4 ETFs & Stocks to Dodge Harvey's Ire and Retail Sales Slump).      An improving labor market, strong job additions, growing wages, rising consumer confidence and higher spending bode well for this holiday season. Notably, the implementation of Trump’s tax reform by the end of the year will bolster spending into the holidays. As a result, retailers are gearing up to attract customers through promotions, early-store openings, heavy discounts, as well as free shipping on online purchases. Additionally, many retailers like Target (TGT  -  Free Report), Macy’s (M  -  Free Report), Gap (GPS  -  Free Report) are on hiring spree in an effort to meet higher store traffic.ETFs in FocusGiven this, we have highlighted retail ETFs for investors seeking to tap the early strong holiday sales.SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT  -  Free Report)This product tracks the S&P Retail Select Industry Index, holding 90 securities in its basket with each accounting for less than 1.4% of assets.

3229,TGT,"On this week’s episode of Shopping for Stocks, Editor Maddy Johnson dives into Target Corp. (TGT  -  Free Report), and looks into how the big box favorite stacks up against its biggest competitors, Walmart (WMT  -  Free Report) and Amazon.com (AMZN  -  Free Report).While its latest earnings report showed the company was gaining ground financially, what stood out most was Target’s pointed efforts to grow its private label brands portfolio.From its baby brand Cloud Island to its kids’ apparel brand Cat & Jack, which have generated double-digit comparable store sales this past quarter, and $2 billion in sales just a year after its launch, respectively, Target’s in-house labels are a significant part of its increasing success.Analysts, too, recognize the power of these private label brands, and it’s one of the main factors luring customers back to Target stores, as well as separating Target from the crowded retail pack.For years now, customers have both loved and trusted the design and overall product collections of Target’s collaborations with high-end designers; its new private labels are a continuation of that strategy, and when Walmart and Amazon have yet to establish well-known in-house brands, Target walks away with a distinct advantage.As a reminder, if you feel that something was missed, or if you want a different topic covered, send an email to podcast@zacks.com.

3230,TGT,"Shares of women’s fashion boutique Francesca's FRAN plummeted to a new 52-week low on Monday after the struggling company announced the departure of a top executive.The boutique chain announced that its chief merchandising officer and executive vice president, Laurie Hummel, who previously held leadership positions at Kohl's (KSS  -  Free Report) and Macy's (M  -  Free Report), is set to leave the company after less than two years at Francesca's.It is unclear at this point if Hummel was relieved of her duties or if she stepped away, but Francesca's now finds itself in flux during a tumultuous time for retail.“We have a lot of talent in our merchandising team and are confident in their ability to execute our strategy as we search for a new Chief Merchant,” Francesca's President and CEO Steve Lawrence said in a statement. “During this period, the team will report directly to me. We wish Laurie well in her future endeavors.” Francesca's also released some preliminary results for the company’s upcoming second-quarter earnings report. The Houston-based retailer expects its quarterly comparable store sales to fall by 3% from the year-ago period. Francesca's also projects to report second-quarter earnings of $0.20 per share, which surpassed the company’s previous expectations.“That said, we note that back-to-school has been off to a very challenging start and our comparable sales have further decelerated from July,” Lawrence continued. “We will provide additional detail on our second quarter performance, as well as discuss our third quarter and full year outlook, on our upcoming earnings call.”Shares of Francesca's plummeted by over 10% on Monday morning to touch a new 52-week low of $6.71 a share. The stock now hovers down around 7% through mid-afternoon trading.Francesca's is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) but scored an “A” grade for Value and a “B” for Growth and Momentum in our Style Scores system, giving it an overall VGM grade of an “A.” The fashion retail company is set to report its second-quarter results on September 6.Retail Sector Francesca's is a small company with a market cap of roughly $275 million, so even though its shares have traded hands over four times above its average volume on Monday, it isn’t likely to drag the whole retail sector down with it. But the fact that the company cited poor back to school sales as a reason for its projected revenue decline might frighten some retail investors.Shares of fellow fashion-focused retailers, such as American Eagle (AEO  -  Free Report), Nordstrom (JWN  -  Free Report), and The Gap (GPS  -  Free Report) all fell on Monday. American Eagle took the biggest hit, as its shares dipped by 3.83%, also touching a new 52-week low.Shares of retail sector ETFs also fell on Monday. The SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT  -  Free Report), the Amplify Online Retail ETF (IBUY  -  Free Report), and the PowerShares Dynamic Retail Portfolio ETF (PMR  -  Free Report) all dropped marginally.

3231,TGT,"Online grocery shopping and delivery is a booming industry in the United States and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report) has been aggressively adopting a number of initiatives of late to gain traction in the market. Per media sources, the retailer is testing a delivery service in partnership with San Francisco-based smart-lock maker August Home and Menlo Park-based same-day delivery startup Deliv, wherein customers can get groceries delivered to their fridge directly.The testing started this week, where a group of August Home customers voluntarily tested this grocery delivery service. Customers can order grocery on Walmart.com and get them delivered directly to their fridge. Deliv. August Home’s system informs customers when the delivery person reaches the gate and after entering the one-time code on the screen lock, they put the grocery into the fridge. Customers can watch monitor the entire activity through their home surveillance cameras.We believe this is a innovative step in the online grocery delivery segment. While the move is restricted to August Home customers and shoppers who are willing to allow delivery people enter their home, it is definitely another significant move in offering multiple choices to online grocery shoppers amid increasing competition from Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report).Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. QuoteWalmart’s Other E-Commerce ActivitiesWalmart is trying every means to develop an impressive digital brand portfolio and has been aggressively adopting a number of initiatives in this regard to compete with e-commerce biggie Amazon. Last week, Walmart announced a program wherein it will allow food stamp receivers to order food and groceries online. However, they will have to pick up the items from any of the five specific stores in the United States. The giant retailer also enables customers to order groceries online and collect them from 900 locations. Also, with Easy Reorder on walmart.com, customers can repurchase items by looking into their previous in-store and online purchases records. The company also has a dedicated back-to-school destination on walmart.com which enables customers to shop school supply lists for more than 1 million classrooms across the country.In order to expand in the online grocery and delivery market, the retailer has partnered with the ride hailing service provider Uber and Lyft for speedy online grocery deliveries. Walmart now operates online grocery delivery service in six markets. Walmart’s own mobile payment system called Walmart Pay has also enabled shoppers to pay through its existing smartphone app in all of its 4,500-plus U.S. stores. This system, launched in July 2016, marked another step toward accelerating the company’s online business and making shopping easier and faster.The company’s free two-day shipping service to U.S. shoppers on a minimum order of $35 and that too without a membership fee has also proved to be a success. This service replaced Walmart's existing two-day shipping program named 'Shipping Pass' that charged shoppers an annual membership fee of $49 and competed strongly with Amazon’s Prime shipping program, which charges customers $99 a year for two-day shipping with additional features like a streaming video service. In August, the giant retailer teamed up with Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL  -  Free Report) Google to enter the budding voice-shopping market, following the footsteps of Amazon.Per media sources, Google will offer numerous Walmart items on the Google Express, Google’s online marketplace and through the voice-controlled Google Assistant starting from September end. Google Express already offers products from a variety of stores, such as Target Corporation (TGT  -  Free Report).In April, Walmart introduced a program wherein it offered discounts on online items, only if shoppers picked their orders from a nearby store. The discount given had an added feature to Walmart’s already existing delivery service called Walmart Pickup, which enables customers to place orders online and then pick them up from a store for free.Not only this, Walmart is trying every means to compete with brick-and-mortar rivals and e-Commerce king Amazon. In this regard, the company continues to make huge investments in e-Commerce initiatives, including acquisitions. The company has acquired four e-commerce businesses (Bonobos, ShoeBuy, Moosejaw, ModCloth) since the Jet.com acquisition (in September 2016) is in line with the Walmart’s expansion efforts. Recently, the company plans to invest in online cosmetics startup Birchbox. If the deal materializes, it will become the fifth e-commerce acquisition, since the buyout of Jet.com. The company is also expanding in Mexico and China to gain substantial market share in those regions.If we look into the share price performance on a year-to-date basis, we note that Walmart’s shares have rallied 15.1%, higher than the industry, which grew 7.5%. The broader Retail-Wholesale sector has increased 17.9% on a year-to-date basis.Our TakeAs we can see, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company is making huge investments in e-commerce activities. While growing e-commerce business is boosting the company’s sales, higher costs involved in it is pressuring margins. We remain encouraged by the company’s efforts to boost sales and regain investors’ confidence. However, it still faces many deterrents, which are likely to impact earnings in the near term. Declining international sales and currency headwinds are also expected to impact the results negatively.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

3232,TGT,"Technology plays a crucial role in the evolution of various sectors, retail being prominent among them. The retail landscape has been witnessing a sea change with its focus shifting gradually from brick-and-mortar to online shopping.Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report) has been in the spotlight for the last few years, as changing customer patterns have made the retail industry fall back more on e-Commerce. The company’s technological prowess has provided it an upper hand over other retailers who are still at their nascent stage in the e-Commerce field.Story Behind Amazon’s SuccessTechnology is giving shape to Amazon’s innovative business ideas. Apart from providing customers a seamless retail experience — user friendly website and mobile app as well as payment and delivery system — technology has been helping the company in saving costs and increasing transaction efficiency.Amazon has been also testing waters with innovations. These include a drive-in-grocery delivery service AmazonFresh Pickup wherein one can order groceries online and collect them from a store nearby, and “cashier-less” stores (Amazon Go – the company’s first brick-and-mortar grocery store). It has also added online and offline features to its bookstores.Not only this, Amazon always tries to bring in different user-friendly technological gadgets that even big tech companies haven’t thought of. The best example of this is Dash Button and Echo devices. These devices are highly coveted for their multi-utility feature.Amazon’s cloud computing arm, Amazon Web Services (AWS) is providing the entire technological infrastructure. The company is continuously investing in enhancing its cloud infrastructure and Artificial Intelligence capabilities that are helping it to execute plans, better understand customer needs and simplify the overall retail process.Why NVIDIA & Other Tech Stocks Are in FocusWith Amazon’s recent acquisition of Whole Foods Market, the situation has worsened for retailers now. The acquisition has provided Amazon the scope to fortify its position in the brick-and-mortar space, and will enhance its distribution and fulfilment capabilities.Amazon’s move has raised question about the survival of other grocery store operators, particularly in the United States. Grocery stores already operate under razor thin margins and will thus face extreme difficulty in coping with Amazon’s pricing strategy and the technique of bringing in customers, for which it is well known.Computer and Technology Sector 5YR % Return Computer and Technology Sector 5YR % ReturnLooking at the successful run of Amazon, retailers have understood by now that in a changing landscape, market understanding and data information hold the key to gaining an edge over rivals. Therefore, to counter the growing threat from Amazon, various retail bellwethers are teaming up with tech companies.The latest tech company to benefit from this trend is NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report). Recently, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report) announced that it will build its own cloud-based data centers by using NVIDIA chips. Wal-Mart currently uses Amazon’s AWS for its cloud needs. The move will help it to shift from the rival’s infrastructure. Also, Wal-Mart partnered with Alphabet’s (GOOGL  -  Free Report) Google last month to give shoppers the ability to order thousands of products through Google Express using voice-activated shopping.Wal-Mart is not the only company making efforts to counter Amazon. Earlier this year, Target Corporation (TGT  -  Free Report) announced that it will invest $7 billion over the next three years in different areas, of which digital transformation is primary. Last month, the company also announced that it will reduce its use of AWS.As retailers are increasingly pumping up their investments to stay afloat, tech companies stand to benefit the most. The front-runners among them will be self-checkout technology and point-of-sale software providers. The space is dominated by players like NCR Corporation (NCR  -  Free Report), Honeywell International Inc. (HON) and Diebold Nixdorf, Incorporated (DBD  -  Free Report).Salesforce.com Inc. (CRM  -  Free Report) will benefit the most. It should be noted that with last year’s acquisition of Demandware, the company has forayed into e-Commerce shopping solution.Going forward, as more retailers try to shift from Amazon’s AWS, other cloud computing providers will likely prosper. In the cloud computing space, companies like Microsoft Corporation (MSFT  -  Free Report) and Alphabet’s Google may see a rise in demand for their services by retailers.Apart from this, semiconductor companies NVIDIA, NXP Semiconductor (NXPI  -  Free Report) and ON Semiconductor (ON  -  Free Report) will also be the major beneficiaries. These semiconductor companies provide microchips that are complex tiny modules that store computer memory as well as provide logic circuitry for microprocessors.Currently, NVIDIA sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) while Microsoft, Alphabet, Salesforce, NCR, Honeywell, NXP Semiconductor and ON Semiconductor carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

3233,TGT,"Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report) is leaving no stone unturned to attract holiday shoppers with great deals this year. This year, in the holiday layaway program, initiated on Sep 1, the company plans to offer more than 1,000 new toys, including more than 300 exclusive toys, to have an edge above competitors. Notably, these items were witnessing sluggish sales for quite some time owing to tough competition from videogames and YouTube videos. The company is thus planning to unveil the much awaited ""Star Wars"" Droid kit, ""Frozen""-branded sleigh and ""Paw Patrol"" lookout tower from Hatchimals and Fingerlings. Walmart anticipates demand for toys to improve this year, thanks to the Star Wars items. About 25% of the toys will be available exclusively at Wal-Mart stores and on Walmart.com.Layaway programs, which starts with 'Toy Week', allow shoppers to buy holiday merchandise like electronics and toys and pay in installments. Further customers can also enjoy the privilege of picking up products at a later date. This program helps the company to gain 15% of holiday revenues at Walmart stores in remote areas of the United States. In this year’s annual holiday season layaway program, customers can pay as low as $10 for items worth $50 and can also shop till Dec 11 at no extra fee.The holiday shopping season is crucial for retailers like Walmart, Best Buy Co. Inc. (BBY  -  Free Report), Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report) and Target Corp. (TGT  -  Free Report) and they try all means to drive footfall. Be it early-hour store openings, promotional events, free shipping on online purchases or heavy discounts, retailers try every mean to boost sales during the holiday season.Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. QuoteApart from boosting store traffic, Walmart is also trying to gain traction in the e-Commerce market and to catch up with online giant Amazon. In a recent move, the company has opened its 1,000th Online Grocery Pickup location, which enables customers to order groceries online and pick them up at their local Walmart store.Walmart’s Other Services to Take on AmazonWalmart is trying every means to develop an impressive digital brand portfolio and has been aggressively adopting a number of initiatives in this regard. Recently, it has teamed up with Alphabet Inc's Google to enter the budding voice-shopping market, following the footsteps of Amazon.In order to expand in the online grocery and delivery market, the retailer has partnered with the ride hailing service provider Uber and Lyft for speedy online grocery deliveries. Walmart now operates online grocery delivery service in six markets. The giant retailer also enables customers to order groceries online and collect them from 900 locations. Also, with Easy Reorder on walmart.com, customers can repurchase items by looking into their previous in-store and online purchases records. The company also has a dedicated back-to-school destination on walmart.com which enables customers to shop school supply lists for more than 1 million classrooms across the country.The company’s free two-day shipping service to U.S. shoppers on a minimum order of $35 and that too without a membership fee has also proved to be a success. This service replaced Walmart's existing two-day shipping program named 'Shipping Pass' that charged shoppers an annual membership fee of $49 and competed strongly with Amazon’s Prime shipping program, which charges customers $99 a year for two-day shipping with additional features like a streaming video service. In April, Walmart introduced a program wherein it offered discounts on online items, only if shoppers picked their orders from a nearby store. The discount given had an added feature to Walmart’s already existing delivery service called Walmart Pickup, which enables customers to place orders online and then pick them up from a store for free.Not only this, Walmart continues to make huge investments in e-Commerce initiatives, including acquisitions, in order to compete with brick-and-mortar stores and online retailers. The company has acquired four e-Commerce businesses (Bonobos, ShoeBuy, Moosejaw, ModCloth) since the Jet.com acquisition (in September 2016) is in line with the Walmart’s expansion efforts. Recently, the company plans to invest in online cosmetics startup Birchbox. If the deal materializes, it will become the fifth e-Commerce acquisition, since the buyout of Jet.com. The company is also expanding in Mexico and China to gain substantial market share in those regions.If we look into the last six months’ performance, we note that Wal-Mart’s shares have rallied 14.7%, higher than the industry, which grew 10.6%. The broader Retail-Wholesale sector has increased 11.7% in the said time frame.Our TakeAs we can see, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company has been undertaking a number of initiatives to boost sales. While the layaway program is expected to help the company increase store traffic, it will also help shoppers with a long shopping list but limited credit.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions. Apple sold a mere 1 billion iPhones in 10 years but a new breakthrough is expected to generate more than 27 billion devices in just 3 years, creating a $1.7 trillion market.Zacks has just released a Special Report that spotlights this fast-emerging phenomenon and 6 tickers for taking advantage of it.

3234,TGT,"The investing world may go gaga over the rapid emergence and acceptance of Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) and be enamored by its 94% share price gains in two years against 10.5% decline in SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT  -  Free Report),butthere is a section that still doubts this monumental success. Moody’s Investors Service falls in this category. Let’s delve a little deeper”:Still Low Online Penetration in the United StatesAs per Moody’s, Amazon.com Inc. is far from ruling the U.S. retail market: “Online sales still account for only about 10% of overall U.S. retail sales, with a much lower percentage in the grocery segment, leaving the big brick and mortar retailers, led by Walmart (WMT  -  Free Report), still really formidable competitors in the industry,"" as noted by Moody’s. This makes the e-commerce behemoth’s foray into the grocery segment with the Whole Foods acquisition appear not as profitable as many thought it will be (read: Tough Time Ahead for Grocery Stocks and ETFs?).Amazon’s Top Line Promising, Bottom Line a Drag Moody’s went on to explain that Amazon is doing great on sales growth but not on profitability. The company reported earnings per share of 40 cents, way below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.40 and down 77% year over year. Revenues climbed 25% year over year to $37.95 billion and topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $37.21 billion.In comparison, Target (TGT  -  Free Report), Nordstrom (JWN  -  Free Report), Home Depot (HD  -  Free Report) and Wal-Mart beat our earnings and revenue estimates on both lines. Nordstrom raised the lower end of its earnings guidance for fiscal 2017 too. Investors’ unloved bet Kohl's Corporation KSS also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate on the bottom line by a nickel while revenues came in slightly higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate by $6 million (read: Solid Q2 Revenue Beat Fails to Boost Retail ETFs).Amazon's Prime Membership Exaggerated by Analysts?Some market watchers estimate Amazon's Prime membership base as high as 85 million. But Moody's calculations show Prime membership somewhere around 50 million against Costco's paid membership of 47.6 million and total membership of 86.7 million as of the fiscal year ended August 2016, as per the source.Wal-Mart Not Amazon Has Upper Hand in Food Market Last but not the least, Moody’s noted that U.S. food sales total about $800 billion a year, of which Walmart takes about 25%. Kroger is responsible for about $130 billion while Albertson's accounts for about $60 billion and Costco about $50 billion. Moody’s agreed that Whole Foods provided Amazon with an important crucial brick-and-mortar presence, which should prove beneficial for the latter.  Moody’s sees that “even with Whole Foods in its basket, [Amazon’s] food sales still amount to less than $20 billion annually.""However, Moddy’s is bullish on Amazon Web Services or AWS, which constitutes a significant portion of the company's operating income. Amazon's cash cushion and excellent liquidity profile are also well liked by Moody’s.Traditional Retailers Cashing on Amazon Success Investors should note that traditional retailers are capitalizing on Amazon’s popularity lately. For example,Kohl’shas formed a partnership with Amazon under which the former will start selling Amazon devices, like Echo and Fire tablets, at 10 stores in Los Angeles and Chicago from October. Prior to this, in July, Sears SHLD entered into a deal to sell its Kenmore home appliances on Amazon.Inside the Stock’s Unimpressive ScoresAmazon has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) with a Value and Momentum Score of F. Only a Growth Score of A looks promising. The company’s Zacks Industry Rank is in the bottom 41%, at the time of writing.ETF Strategies Investors may be cautious on ETFs heavy on Amazon given the above-mentioned analysis. VanEck Vectors Retail ETF (RTH  -  Free Report), Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLY  -  Free Report) and Fidelity MSCI Consumer Discretionary Index ETF (FDIS  -  Free Report). AMZN holds the top spot in these funds with a double-digit exposure each.On the other hand, ETFs like First Trust Nasdaq Retail ETF (FTXD  -  Free Report), XRT, PowerShares Dynamic Retail Portfolio ETF (PMR  -  Free Report) and Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLP  -  Free Report) can be considered for gains. FTXD is low on Amazon while PMR, XLP and XRT do not have it in their top-10 holdings.Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week.

3235,TGT,"The final weeks of the back-to-school are keeping retailers on the edge with initiatives to push up sales. Representing the second-busiest shopping season after Christmas holidays, back-to-college spending is expected to hit an all-time high this year while back-to-school spending is expected to see its second-highest spending level on record.As per the National Retail Federation (NRF), the combined spending on back to school and college supplies is expected to reach $83.6 billion this year, up 10% from $75.8 billion last year (read: Retail Sales Off to a Great Start to Q3: ETFs to Buy).Families with children in elementary through high school are expected to spend $687.72 per child on clothing, electronics such as computers or calculators, apparels and other school supplies such as notebooks, folders, pencils, backpacks and lunchboxes, for a total of $29.5 billion, up 8% year over year.While more than one-fourth of the families are being perceived to shop two months before the beginning of school, 46.7% are expected to shop three weeks to one month before school starts and 21% to wait until the last week or two. This suggests that budget-constrained parents are looking to shop last minute to get extra discounts from retailers, which will come mostly at the end of summer or the Labor Day weekend.Departmental stores and discount stores are definitely attractive shopping destinations but online sales will remain a hot spot for shopping with 45.5% expected from back-to-school and 44.1% from back-to-college customers. As per eMarketer, online sales for back-to-school will grow 14.8% this year.What’s Hot?In the final days of the ongoing shopping season, retailers continued to lure customers with more promotional offers such as cash back, coupon discounts and free shipping.E-commerce behemoth Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) is offering up to 80% off on essentials such as school supplies, kids' apparel, and electronics. Meanwhile, the world's largest retailer, Wal-Mart (WMT  -  Free Report), introduced a rollback sale in addition to a higher number of back-to-school and back-to-college items through both its Online Grocery Pickup and Pickup Today services, offering tens of thousands more items than in the past. In fact, Wal-Mart is still selling more than 300 items under $1.00 (read: Why You Should Buy the Dip in Amazon Shares with ETFs).Tech giant Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) is offering a free pair of $300 Beats Solo3 Wireless headphones with the purchase of a new Mac computer or iPad Pro. Best Buy (BBY  -  Free Report) is not behind, offering a series of student-exclusive deals including $100 off on select MacBook and iMac models, $125 off on select computers and 10% off on select Surface devices.For school supplies, Target (TGT  -  Free Report) could be an exciting bet as character backpacks with a lunch bag and pencil pouch could be found starting at $14 while school supplies are for less than $1, $3, $5 and $10. On the other hand, Staples  is proposing store-brand paper, notebooks, pens and other school supplies at 50 cents and $1 in stores only. Office Depot (ODP  -  Free Report) is selling pencils, pens, markers, notebooks and more for as little as 1 cent (read: Will Big-Box Retailers Push Up Retail ETFs in Q2 Earnings?).For school uniforms and clothes, Kohl’s (KSS  -  Free Report) is offering school uniforms at less than $10 and an extra 20% off on juniors' and kids' clothing, shoes and backpacks with a promo code.How to PlayAll these attractive offers will definitely boost sales of all types of retailers, leading to a surge in their stock prices. Investors could easily tap this opportune moment through the following ETFs in a diversified way:VanEck Vectors Retail ETF (RTH  -  Free Report)This fund provides exposure to the 26 largest retail firms by tracking the MVIS US Listed Retail 25 Index. It is highly concentrated on the top firm – Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) – at 19.9% while other firms hold no more than 5.2% share.

3236,TGT,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put Target Corporation (TGT  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Target has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 12.2, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 stands at about 20.3. If we focus on the long-term PE trend, Target’s current PE level puts it below its midpoint of 14.5 over the past five years. Moreover, the current level stands well below the highs for the stock, suggesting that it could be a solid entry point.Further, the stock’s PE compares favorably with the Zacks Retail-Wholesale sector’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 28. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers. We should point out that Target has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of 13.2, so it is fair to expect an increase in the company’s share price in the near future.P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, Target has a P/S ratio of about 0.5. This is significantly lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.2 right now. Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.If anything, TGT is in the lower end of its range in the time period from a P/S metric, suggesting some level of undervalued trading—at least compared to historical norms.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Target currently has a Value Score of A, putting it into the top 20% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes Target a solid choice for value investors, and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too.For example, the P/CF ratio (another great indicator of value) for Target is just 6.5, a level that is far lower than the industry average of 13. Clearly, TGT is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles.What About the Stock Overall?Though Target might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of A and a Momentum Score of C. This gives TGT a Zacks VGM score — or its overarching fundamental grade — of A. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Notably, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been quite encouraging. The current quarter and full year have seen six and nine estimates go higher in the past sixty days, respectively – compared to no downward revisions.This has had a meaningful impact on the consensus estimate, as the current quarter consensus estimate has risen by roughly 9% in the past two months, while the full year estimate has inched higher by 1.8%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:Target Corporation Price and Consensus  Target Corporation Price and Consensus | Target Corporation QuoteHowever, this somewhat bullish trend has likely not yet been reflected in the stock, as we have just a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), which indicates expectations of in-line performance in the near term. Nonetheless, the positive analyst sentiment hints at favorable near-term prospects.Bottom LineTarget is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. Further, this Zacks Rank #3 company enjoys a solid Zacks Industry Rank (among Top 37% of more than 250 industries). However, owing to a challenging retail landscape and evolving consumer preferences, the industry has underperformed the broader market in     the past year. This is visible from the chart below:So, value investors might want to wait for the broader industry factors to turn favorable, but once that happens, this stock could be a compelling pick.New Report: An Investor’s Guide to CybersecurityCyberattacks have become more frequent and destructive than ever.

3237,TGT,"On Friday, reports surfaced about three of America’s biggest retailers that detailed each was making further headway into the ultra-competitive online delivery space.Amazon.com (AMZN  -  Free Report)Just weeks after the e-commerce giant finalized its acquisition of organic grocer Whole Foods, Amazon has announced a new partnership with Olo, a New York-based food delivery service. The up-and-coming delivery option provides digital order and pay technology to 200 restaurants like Applebee’s, Chipotle (CMG  -  Free Report), Denny’s (DENN  -  Free Report), Shake Shack (SHAK  -  Free Report), and Wingstop (WING  -  Free Report).As part of the deal with, Olo’s clients would be listed on the Amazon Restaurants section of Amazon.com; Olo will then provide the tech that published menus and take orders while Amazon arranges deliveries. Amazon Restaurants has also implemented Rails, which is an Olo product that allows restaurants to take delivery orders from Amazon and other third-party services.Not only will this partnership help Olo’s customers connect with Amazon Restaurant’s delivery services, but it will also give Amazon’s customers access to more restaurant options.Shares of food delivery leader GrubHub (GRUB  -  Free Report) has taken a beating on the news, falling as much as 7% before regaining some ground; the stock is currently down about 3.3%.Walmart (WMT  -  Free Report)In a blog post, big box leader Walmart announced that it is testing a service that delivers groceries to your home, and unloads them for you straight to your refrigerator—even when you’re not home.Working with smart-lock startup August Home and same-day delivery service Deliv, Walmart customers can order groceries and other items online, and orders will then be securely brought in to their homes when ready. When the delivery person rings a customer’s doorbell, it triggers a smartphone notification, which you can then watch the delivery take place if you choose.Delivery associates enter a customer’s home by pressing a one-time, pre-authorized passcode into the smart lock; the worker would then carry groceries to the kitchen and unload them in the fridge, while any other items would be left by the front door.Walmart said the test will take place in Silicon Valley, with a small number of August Home users that have chosen to use the service. It is not clear how long this current test will last, or how this aspect of Walmart’s delivery program will evolve.Target (TGT  -  Free Report)Fellow big box frontrunner Target recently upped its delivery service game, with Target Restock offering city dwellers next-day delivery on everyday essentials ordered online.After testing the service over the summer, the company expanded Target Restock to eight additional cities, which makes it available to over 70 million people. It’s now available in Atlanta, Chicago, Los Angeles, New York, Philadelphia, San Francisco (coming mid-October), St. Louis, and the Washington, D.C./Baltimore, MD areas. Similar to Amazon’s Prime Pantry, customers can fill a box (up to 45 pounds) with typical household items—think laundry detergent and cleaning supplies—for a flat $4.99 fee; Amazon charges $5.99 per box. Another advantage: Target doesn’t charge an annual membership fee, and is available to any online Target shopper in the supported metropolitan regions.This is just one of the many new initiatives Target is trying out, and many seem to be hitting their mark; the company’s smaller format stores and in-house brands were a big reason for its better-than-expected results last quarter. And, Target Restock’s expansion is a sign that shoppers are consciously choosing Target over other online options for things like paper towels and other grocery-related items.Perhaps Amazon’s dominance is not as all-encompassing as it appears.Interested in the other top stories of the week?

However, these improvements were marred by higher freight and buying costs.

3241,TGT,"On Aug 16, we issued an updated research report on Williams-Sonoma, Inc. (WSM  -  Free Report), a multi-channel specialty retailer of premium quality home products.Innovation & Positive Housing Market Are TailwindsProduct innovation plays a huge role in the company’s success. Williams-Sonoma addresses the ever-changing preferences of the customers’ demand with much expertise.  The company has studios providing infrastructure for development of new products, techniques and collaboration with other artists. The company offers exclusive designs for home-furnishing products, textiles, accessories and entertaining essentials. Williams-Sonoma also collaborates with celebrated brands and designers to offer exclusive designs on home-furnishing products.Apart from its innovative drive, Williams-Sonoma is one of the largest e-commerce retailers in the United States. The company’s direct-to-customer segment operates through e-commerce websites and direct mail catalogues. This segment generates around 52% of its revenues and regularly posts strong operating margins.Also, the company’s investment in merchandising the brands, efficient catalog circulations and digital marketing boosts its e-commerce revenues. In addition, it is consistently improving its website and mobile shopping experience. The company will continue to strengthen its competitive advantages through innovation in e-commerce in the upcoming quarters.Importantly, Williams-Sonoma’s products primarily focus on home-furnishings and demand for its products is therefore related to the broader housing construction market’s performance. Positives like an improving economy, modest wage growth, low unemployment levels, a positive consumer confidence as well as a tight supply situation raise optimism about the housing sector’s performance in 2017. Thus, demand for William-Sonoma’s products should increase as well, thereby driving its revenues further.Soft Comparable Revenues a Major HeadwindWilliams-Sonoma has been witnessing soft comparable brand revenues for quite some time. The rate of increase of comparable brand revenues has decreased significantly from 7.1% in 2014 to 3.7% in 2015 and 0.7% in 2016. Comparable brand revenues inched up 0.1% in the first quarter of fiscal 2017, significantly lower than the 4.5% rise recorded in the preceding quarter. The rate of comparable brand revenue increase has softened across all the brands over the years.The PBteen brand has been hurt the most, thus reporting a 6.2% decline in comparable brand revenues in 2016 compared with a 2.7% fall in 2015. Comparable brand revenue of PBteen brand declined 14.3% in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 compared with a 1.9% increase in the year-ago quarter. In fact, the company expects comparable brand revenues growth in the modest 1–3% range for 2017. This does not indicate any significant improvement from the current trend.Share Price PerformanceThough Williams-Sonoma’s shares have lost 8.6% so far this year compared with the 0.5% gain of its industry, earnings estimate for the current year has moved slightly upward. This signals analysts’ optimism for the stock. Going forward, strong brand portfolio along with focus on innovation and transformation should drive the stock’s performance in the upcoming quarters as well.Zacks Rank & Other Key PicksWilliams-Sonoma carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Some other top-ranked stocks in the same sector are Dollar General Corp. (DG  -  Free Report), The TJX Companies, Inc. (TJX  -  Free Report) and Target Corp. (TGT  -  Free Report), each carrying a Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Full-year 2017 earnings for Dollar General will likely increase 0.1%.TJX Companies’ earnings are expected to rally 10.8% in fiscal 2018.Target delivered positive earnings surprises in three of the last four quarters with the average beat being 16.46%.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion.

3242,TGT,"With the objective of capitalizing on the booming online grocery delivery market, Target Corporation (TGT  -  Free Report) is expanding Target Restock to eight new markets. Notably, Target Restock is a next-day delivery service, which the company had launched in June. Customers opting for next-day delivery services will have to shell out nearly $5 to avail the service.The company began this service in Minneapolis but latter on expanded it to Denver as well as Dallas markets in the month of August. Following the recent expansion, the service will now be available in Atlanta, New York, Chicago, Philadelphia, St. Louis, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and the Washington D.C./Baltimore. The service is now available in 10 markets but the company will cover San Francisco by the middle of October. We believe this is a smart move by Target, considering the increasing demand for online grocery delivery.The Target Restock program allows customers to restock their shipping box with essential items online and get them delivered at door steps by the next business day for a nominal charge. Further, in order to improve supply chain and expand delivery capabilities, the company had acquired Grand Junction. This transportation technology company provides a platform that allows retailers, distributors and third-party logistics providers to manage local deliveries through a network of over 700 carriers.Other Strategic InitiativesThe Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s initiatives such as the development of omni-channel capacities, diversification and localization of assortments along with emphasis on flexible format stores bode well for the stock. The shares of Target have outpaced the industry in the past three months. The stock has advanced 14.9%, outperforming the industry’s gain of 7.8%.Management plans to expand its merchandise assortments with special emphasis on Style, Baby, Kids, and Wellness categories that are performing well. Moreover, Target is also concentrating on rationalization of supply chain, technology and process improvements. These initiatives aided it to continue with upbeat performance in fiscal 2017 as reflected from impressive second-quarter results and an encouraging earnings outlook.3 Stocks Occupying Retail’s CenterstageBetter-ranked stocks, which warrant a look in the retail sector includes, Costco Wholesale Corporation (COST  -  Free Report), Tilly's, Inc.

3243,TGT,"A decent run in the U.S. stock market, sturdy retail sales data along with solid job addition in July and improvement in the manufacturing sector have lifted investors’ mood as well as highlighted the solid economic report card. These were reflected in Consumer Confidence — a key determinant of the economy’s health — that reached its second highest level in August since late 2000. As per the Conference Board data, the Consumer Confidence Index surged to 122.9 last month from July’s revised reading of 120.The rebound in oil prices from all-time lows, improving labor market and gradual recovery in the housing market signal that the economy is on a recovery mode. Per the Labor Department, the economy added 209,000 jobs in July, up from 231,000 and 145,000 in June and May, respectively, while the unemployment rate was 4.3%. These factors are favorable for retailers and definitely play a crucial role in raising buyers’ confidence. We expect this positive sentiment to translate into higher consumer spending that may help revive sales.U.S. retail sales in July recorded biggest increase this year. The Commerce Department stated that U.S. retail and food services sales in July rose 0.6% to $478.9 billion — following a revised reading of 0.3% growth registered in June. Retail sales increased 4.2% from July 2016. Sales were widespread in July, mostly led by strong demand for new autos and Internet shopping. Meanwhile, sales at non-store retailers jumped 1.3%.This latest report on retails sales unveils that consumers have significant buying power as the third quarter got underway. We note that the consumer outlays grew 2.8% in the second quarter. Consumer spending at retail outlets was off to a good start, banking on strong labor market and improved household finances. This looks favorable for retailers.Changing Retail DynamicsGiven the favorable economic indicators, the Zacks Retail-Wholesale sector holds some promise. We note that so far in the year, the sector has registered an increase of 14.9% compared with the S&P 500’s gain of roughly 9.4%. Kiplinger’s latest forecast shows that retail sales, excluding gasoline, are expected to jump 4% in 2017. The report further suggests that e-commerce sales are expected to increase 14% this year.The retail landscape has been undergoing a fundamental change, with technology playing a major role and the focus shifting to online shopping. Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report) has been in the spotlight for the last few years, as changing customer patterns made the retail industry more dependent on e-commerce.This transition in consumer shopping pattern is compelling retailers to fast adapt to the changes in the ecosystem. Retailers now have no option left but to keep pace with the changing retail scenario or get eliminated. They are now focusing more on enhancing omni-channel capabilities, optimizing store fleet and restructuring activities.Retailers are efficiently allocating a large chunk of capital toward a multi-channel growth strategy focused on improving merchandise offerings, and developing IT infrastructure to enhance the web and mobile experience of customers. Further, the retailers are renovating stores, developing fulfillment centers to enable speedy delivery, implementing an enterprise-wide inventory management system along with enhancing relationship with existing and new customers.The Children's Place, Inc. (PLCE  -  Free Report), Best Buy Co., Inc. (BBY  -  Free Report), Macy's, Inc. (M  -  Free Report), Target Corporation (TGT  -  Free Report), Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report) and other renowned retailers are trying all means to reach their target customers.Zacks RankAmong the aforementioned stocks, The Children's Place flaunts a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and Best Buy carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), while the remaining stocks carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

3244,TGT,"Shares of several grocery store chains, including Kroger and Sprouts Farmers Market, dipped on Monday after Amazon’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) acquisition of Whole Foods  officially went into effect. The online retail giant’s $13.7 billion purchase of the organic grocer helped send rival grocery chains stocks plummeting last week after the FTC approval was finalized. One of the biggest causes of concern for fellow grocery stores, at least initially, was the fact that Amazon announced it would lower prices on many items at Whole Foods.“Everybody should be able to eat Whole Foods Market quality – we will lower prices without compromising Whole Foods Market’s long-held commitment to the highest standards,” CEO of Amazon Worldwide Consumer Jeff Wilke said in a statement last week.“To get started, we’re going to lower prices beginning Monday on a selection of best-selling grocery staples, including Whole Trade organic bananas, responsibly-farmed salmon, organic large brown eggs, animal-welfare-rated 85% lean ground beef, and more.”Jeff Bezos’ company did precisely what it said it would. Amazon lowered a ton of prices at Whole Foods on Monday. The total price of a 15-item grocery purchase at a Brooklyn, New York-based Whole Foods fell by almost 23% on Monday, according to a Business Insider article.“Whole Foods + Amazon"" signs can now be seen throughout Whole Foods locations and new discounted tags labeled ""New Lower Price,"" are also widespread. Prices of items such as milk, cheese, meat, fish, eggs, and many more commonly purchased foods have also already been cut.Whole Foods is far from the biggest grocery store chain in the U.S., with only 470 locations. But the size and reach of Amazon has already enabled it to lower prices at the notoriously high-priced grocer over night. And investors continued to flee from grocery store stocks on Monday as the initial price cuts went into effect.Shares of Target (TGT  -  Free Report), with its large grocery business, dipped by 1.04%, while Kroger (KR  -  Free Report), which owns multiple grocery subsidiaries, dipped marginally.Less well-known chain Sprouts Farmers Market (SFM  -  Free Report) saw its stock price crash 9.71%, while Ingles Markets (IMKTA  -  Free Report) sunk by 9.69%. SUPERVALU Inc. (SVU  -  Free Report) and Smart & Final Stores (SFS  -  Free Report) both saw their stock prices fall by more than 2%, while Weis Markets  stock dipped by 1.60%.Bottom LineGrocery Store chains most likely don’t need to fear for their short-term stability or even viability. But, if the industry does not begin to make changes to their business models going forward, Amazon’s Whole Foods and its new lower prices could make life a lot harder—especially if investors continue to flee the allies.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

3245,TGT,"Shares of several grocery store chains, including Kroger and Costco, tumbled on Thursday after Amazon’s purchase of Whole Foods became official.DealThe Federal Trade Commission finally approved the online retail behemoth’s purchase of the organic grocer, which was first announced in mid-June. The FTC determined Amazon’s acquisition passed U.S. antitrust laws, shortly after Whole Foods’ shareholders formally approved the $13.7 billion deal.“Based on our investigation, we have decided not to pursue this matter further,” the Commission said in a statement late Wednesday. “Of course, the FTC always has the ability to investigate anticompetitive conduct should such action be warranted.”Initial PlansAside from adding roughly 470 organic grocery stores in North America and the United Kingdom to its ever-growing list of diversified assets, Amazon wasted little time in making its initial Whole Foods plans known.The Texas-based chain grew in popularity because of its wide selection of natural and organic offerings, but they often came with steep price tags. So naturally, one of Amazon’s first major steps, which will begin as soon as Monday, is to lower Whole Foods’ prices—and soon, it will make Amazon Prime the grocery store’s customer rewards program.“Everybody should be able to eat Whole Foods Market quality – we will lower prices without compromising Whole Foods Market’s long-held commitment to the highest standards,” CEO of Amazon Worldwide Consumer Jeff Wilke said in a statement.Lost In The Super MarketWhole Foods is far from the biggest grocery store chain in the U.S., and its deal with Amazon will not change that—at least not in the foreseeable future. But the FTC approval sent investors fleeing from grocery store stocks as long-term disruption in the grocery sector seems possible, if not inevitable.Shares of Costco (COST  -  Free Report) fell by over 5% on Thursday, while Target, (TGT  -  Free Report) with its large grocery business, dipped by 3.99%. Kroger (KR  -  Free Report), which also owns multiple grocery subsidiaries, share prices tanked by 7.71% and nearly touched its 52-week low.Less well-known chains such as Casey's General Stores (CASY  -  Free Report), Weis Markets (WMK), and Village Super Market  all saw their stock prices fall by over 1.60%. Shares of Ingles Markets (IMKTA  -  Free Report) fell by 3.54%, while Smart & Final Stores (SFS  -  Free Report) dipped by 2.76%.Sprouts Farmers Market (SFM  -  Free Report) saw its stock price crash 6.95% and shares of SUPERVALU Inc. (SVU  -  Free Report) dropped by 6.60%.Whole Foods  stock gained 0.72%, but Amazon’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) stock price took a hit and closed down 0.58% on Thursday (also read: Here's The Reason For Amazon's Recent Stock Pullback).Bottom LineGrocery Store chains don’t likely need to fear for their short-term stability or even viability. But, if the industry does not begin to make changes to their business models going forward, Amazon’s Whole Foods and its new lower organic food prices could make life a lot harder—especially if investors continue to flee the allies.One Simple Trading IdeaSince 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year.

3246,TGT,"Shares of Target (TGT  -  Free Report) jumped 3% in morning trading on Wednesday after reporting better-than-expected second quarter fiscal 2017 results.Target reported adjusted earnings of $1.23 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.20. The company also reported revenue of $16.429 billion, surpassing our estimate by $147 million.The company’s growing online sales helped Target increase its revenue, with comparable digital sales jumping 32%. The retailer has been making investments to expand its delivery capabilities this past year. Just this week, Target acquired the delivery tech company Grand Junction to help develop a same-day delivery program.“This continues to be a challenging, competitive… environment [and] that’s why we’re particularly pleased by the ongoing progress we saw on the second quarter,” said CMO Mark Tritton during Wednesday’s earnings conference call.Despite worries about the state of the retail industry and changing consumer trends, Target saw a growing number of consumers shop at their brick-and-mortar stores. The company credits their 1.3% rise in same-store sales to its store remodeling program.  Target finished remodeling 42 stores during the quarter and will now work towards upgrading more than 300 stores in 2018.Target has also revised its guidance for the rest of 2017. The retail giant expects fiscal 2017 earnings between $4.34 and $4.54, up from $3.80 and $4.20 per share previous projected. Target also expects third quarter earnings to be in the range of $0.75 and $0.95 per share.“We continue to focus on our long-term strategy, as we work to transform every part of our business and build an even better Target,” said CEO Brian Cornell. “While our recent results are encouraging, we will continue to plan prudently as we invest in building our brands, our digital channel, and the value we provide our guests.”Target remains a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), with a VGM score of ‘A.’The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion.

3247,TGT,"Wednesday, August 16th, 2017Ahead of today’s opening bell, stock futures are once again up, even as domestic news cycles deliver drama and tension regarding the recent words and actions of President Trump. An impromptu press conference yesterday saw the President double-down on his initial comments on the weekend tragedy in Charlottesville, which were heavily criticized by people on both the Left and the Right. Nevertheless, the Dow is enjoying a 3-day winning streak, although the S&P 500 and Nasdaq are down 4 of the last 6 sessions.Trump’s Chief Economic Advisor Gary Cohn said he was “disgusted and upset” by the President’s latest address. Even still, he is quoted as expecting tax reform to be on track for passage before Thanksgiving. As far as healthcare reform, Cohn said he’s “not sure where that will wind up.”More leaders from Trump’s manufacturing council are leaving in response to this continuing public relations development. Further, PayPal (PYPL  -  Free Report) has announced it will no longer process payments to fun “alt-right” groups, and privately-held GoDaddy has already booted alt-right website Daily Stormer from its server. However, work-arounds are already occurring among groups protesting the removal of Confederate statues, among others things (nine more such protests are reportedly scheduled for the upcoming weekend). These groups are finding the Bitcoin trade useful in this regard.Housing Starts & PermitsHousing Starts posted a disappointing headline number of -4.8% for the month of July; +0.4% had been expected. A total of 1.155 million seasonally adjusted, annualized new starts is below the 1.23 million expected, and June results were revised slightly downward as well. Consider that we’re still in the zone of warmer seasonal months, and a big negative result in new starts does demonstrate a real cooling of the new home market, near-term.Permits fell 4.1% to 1.223 million, also a disappointment; June results were revised down to 1.227 million, and these numbers represent the weakest permits data since May. These figures overall represent the topsy-turvy world of spending and consumer confidence — for every better-than-expected Retail Sales number, like yesterday, we see a headwind with the next domestic growth metric, like Starts & Permits.Target, Urban Outfitters OutperformBig-box retailer Target (TGT  -  Free Report) posted a 3-cent beat on the bottom line ahead of the opening bell this morning to $1.23 per share. Revenues, however, missed the Zacks consensus of $16.82 billion in the quarter, reporting $16.42 billion. Nevertheless, this represents 1.6% growth in sales year over year, on 1.3% comps. The Zacks Rank #2 (Buy)-rated company was trading as high as +6% in today’s pre-market, but shares are now roughly +3.3%.Urban Outfitters (URBN  -  Free Report), however, is trading way up — more than 21% at this hour — following a fiscal Q2 2018 beat on both top and bottom lines. The company’s 44 cents per share outperformed the 37 cents expected, and revenues of $873 million topped the Zacks consensus estimate of $834 million. Same-store sales were also up in the quarter, and URBN shares — which had been down nearly 41% year-to-date — look to be making a nice bounce off multi-year bottoms.Mark VickerySenior EditorQuestions or comments about this article and/or its author?

3248,TGT,"It has been another tough earnings season for the retail industry, but the upcoming reports from big-box retailers Target (TGT  -  Free Report) and Walmart (WMT  -  Free Report) could very well reverse the trend.Target is set to report its second-quarter earnings before the market opens on Wednesday, while Walmart will release its second-quarter results on Thursday morning. Both of these companies are currently sporting Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) rankings, so anticipation for these reports is understandably high.But which big-box report will be best? Let’s take a closer look.Current EstimatesHeading into Target’s report date, our Zacks Consensus Estimates call for earnings of $1.20 per share and revenues of $16.22 billion. These results would represent year-over-year growth rates of -2.53% and 0.32%, respectively.Walmart will also face tough year-over-year comparisons, with the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of $1.07 per share representing -0.47% growth and our consensus revenue estimate of $122.8 billion representing modest 1.61% growth.According to additional consensus estimates, which are pulled from our exclusive non-financial metrics file, both Target and Walmart are expected to post relatively flat comparable-store sales, which means that we don’t have many exciting growth metrics to highlight prior to these reports.Target has been continuing to improve its supply chain, while Walmart has poured money into its e-commerce business. Both brands are still dealing with customers spending less in stores—or less overall customers coming into stores. Nevertheless, these new initiatives have helped the companies stay competitive and could prove to be major performance drivers soon.While earnings and revenue growth rates for either company won’t be blowing any investors out of the water, Walmart has the slightest edge in this category. Still, investors may well turn their attention to other areas of these reports.Earnings WhispersAs with all earnings reports, investors will be interested in seeing if Target and Walmart can exceed expectations. One way to gauge whether a company is poised to beat earnings estimates is by looking at the Zacks Earnings ESP.Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.With that said, Target’s Earnings ESP currently sits at 0.00%, while Walmart has a positive Earnings ESP of 0.94%. Because the Earnings ESP’s surprise prediction capabilities are most effective with stocks ranked at Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better, Walmart’s strong Zacks Rank and positive ESP should give investors more confidence here. Again, we have to give WMT the edge in this category.Share Price TrendsThe final thing investors will want to consider here is recent share price trends, as oftentimes even solid earnings beats are not rewarded with massive gains because a stock has already moved significantly higher and investors feel the beat is priced in. On the flip side, even a slightly disappointing earnings report could send a recently-soaring stock exponentially lower.With that said, shares of Target closed more than 2.5% lower on Tuesday and now sit nearly 32.5% off their 52-week high. On the other hand, WMT has climbed recently and sits just below its 52-week high.While this says nothing about how the reports will turn out, it does imply that Target might have more upside potential, which could be appealing to investors looking to make a bigger profit on an earnings play.Bottom LineWalmart is going to be the more attractive pick for investors looking for earnings and revenue growth, and its most recent estimate activity should make investors more confident about the potential for an earnings beat. However, if Target can pull off a beat, it might just have more room to soar.Want more stock market analysis from this author?

3250,TGT,"It seems Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report) is leaving no stone unturned ina bid to gain traction in the e-Commerce market and to catch up with online giant Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report). In a recent move, the giant retailer is teaming up with Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL  -  Free Report) Google to enter the budding voice-shopping market, following the footsteps of Amazon.Per media sources, Google will offer numerous Walmart items on the Google Express, Google’s online marketplace and through the voice-controlled Google Assistant starting from September end. Google Express already offers products from a variety of stores, such as Target Corporation (TGT  -  Free Report). Customers will now be able to order items online through Google Home using their voice by linking their Walmart accounts to Google Marketplace. In fact, the company expects to start voice shopping experience in its 4,700 U.S. stores and its fulfilment network by next year.Is Walmart Poised to Gain From the Latest Move?The latest move is expected to pose tough competition to Amazon’s voice-controlled aide Alexa. While Google will is likely to offer free delivery on Google Express orders on a minimum order of $35, Amazon will offer free delivery to Prime members or on orders of $25 or more that include only eligible items.Google also plans to use consumers’ past history to understand their evolving shopping needs and improve its services and shopping experience accordingly. However, we note that Google introduced its Express platform to Google Home in February, but Amazon already has an edge over it as it has been offering voice-activated shopping on Echo devices since 2014.Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. QuoteWalmart’s Other Services to Take on AmazonWalmart is trying every means to develop an impressive digital brand portfolio and has been aggressively adopting a number of initiatives in this regard of late. In order to expand in the online grocery and delivery market, the retailer has partnered with the ride hailing service provider Uber and Lyft for speedy online grocery deliveries. Walmart now operates online grocery delivery service in six markets. The giant retailer also enables customers to order groceries online and collect them from 900 locations. Also, with Easy Reorder on walmart.com, customers can repurchase items by looking into their previous in-store and online purchases records. The company also has a dedicated back-to-school destination on walmart.com which enables customers to shop school supply lists for more than 1 million classrooms across the country.Walmart’s own mobile payment system called Walmart Pay has also enabled shoppers to pay through its existing smartphone app in all of its 4,500-plus U.S. stores. This system, launched in July 2016, marked another step toward accelerating the company’s online business and making shopping easier and faster.The company’s free two-day shipping service to U.S. shoppers on a minimum order of $35 and that too without a membership fee has also proved to be a success. This service replaced Walmart's existing two-day shipping program named 'Shipping Pass' that charged shoppers an annual membership fee of $49 and competed strongly with Amazon’s Prime shipping program, which charges customers $99 a year for two-day shipping with additional features like a streaming video service. In April, Walmart introduced a program wherein it offered discounts on online items, only if shoppers picked their orders from a nearby store. The discount given had an added feature to Walmart’s already existing delivery service called Walmart Pickup, which enables customers to place orders online and then pick them up from a store for free.Not only this, Walmart is trying every means to compete with brick-and-mortar rivals and e-Commerce king Amazon. In this regard, the company continues to make huge investments in e-Commerce initiatives, including acquisitions. The company has acquired four e-Commerce businesses (Bonobos, ShoeBuy, Moosejaw, ModCloth) since the Jet.com acquisition (in September 2016) is in line with the Walmart’s expansion efforts. Recently, the company plans to invest in online cosmetics startup Birchbox. If the deal materializes, it will become the fifth e-Commerce acquisition, since the buyout of Jet.com. The company is also expanding in Mexico and China to gain substantial market share in those regions.If we look into the last six months’ performance, we note that Wal-Mart’s shares have rallied 11.5%, higher than the industry, which grew 7.2%. The broader Retail-Wholesale sector has increased 9.3% in the last six months.Our TakeAs we can see, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company is making huge investments in e-Commerce activities. While growing e-Commerce business is boosting the company’s sales, higher costs involved in it is pressuring margins. We remain encouraged by the company’s efforts to boost sales and regain investors’ confidence. However, it still faces many deterrents, which are likely to impact earnings in the near term. Declining international sales and currency headwinds are also expected to impact the results negatively.One Simple Trading IdeaSince 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year.

3251,TGT,"Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report) is gearing up to handle the holiday-season pressure in its own unique way. Like last year, instead of hiring seasonal and temporary employees, the retail giant has planned to offer extra working hours to its existing employees during the holiday season.Though the company has decided not to hire any additional employees, Walmart remains committed toward meeting customers’ satisfaction with its existing employee base by helping them to shop with ease. The latest move will provide customers with personal shoppers and pick-up associates for online operations. The move will also entitle its permanent employees such as cashiers and shelf stockers, a chance to work for additional hours and earn more during the season.However, Walmart’s peers are hiring seasonal workers to manage the rush. While Target Corp. (TGT  -  Free Report) has announced plans to employ 100,000 temporary holiday workers, Macy's Inc. (M  -  Free Report) will bring on nearly 80,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season.If we look into the last six months’ performance, we note that Walmart’s shares have rallied 14.6%, higher than the industry, which grew 9.5%. The broader Retail-Wholesale sector has increased 12.1% in the said time frame. Holiday Season: A Boon or a Curse for Retailers?Since the season accounts for a third of their annual sales and generates nearly 40% of their profits, retailers try to grab every opportunity to win customers. However, it doesn’t come that easy. Through initiatives such as early-hour store openings, free shipping on online purchases and varied promotional strategies along with huge discounts, retailers are leaving no stone unturned to attract shoppers. However, in the process of winning customers and driving sales, companies lose out on margins due to extreme promotional environment.The Evolving Retail Environment  The retail environment has been changing dramatically, with technology playing a major role. Customers are inclined more toward online shopping which has hurt sales at brick-and-mortar sales. This transition in shopping pattern is compelling retailers to rapidly address the evolving changes. As a result, retailers are now focusing more on enhancing omni-channel capabilities and developing their e-commerce operations to compete better in an environment, which is dominated by online king Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report).Moreover, the recent soft retail sales data for the month of August have somewhat subdued the enthusiasm for the holiday season. Further, the National Retail Federation recently announced a cut in 2017 retail sales forecast, making retailers jittery. A surge in gasoline prices will pinch the pockets of consumers who make bulk purchases during the holiday season. Hurricane Harvey and Irma impact along with North Korea’s back-to-back nuclear tests on Japan have spurred global tensions and unnerved investors. Nevertheless, we believe these short-term headwinds can be overlooked as we can see signs of continuing strength in consumer confidence which in turn will lead to higher consumer spending and fuel growth in the near term.Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.

3252,TGT,"A recent report from Deloitte shows that retail holiday sales are expected to rise 4 - 4.5% compared to last year’s shopping season. Total holiday sales (seasonally adjusted and excluding autos and gas) are expected to reach $1.04 to $1.05 trillion in the November – January timeframe. This compares to retail sales of $1 trillion in the November 2016 – January 2017 timeframe (data as per the U.S. Commerce Department).Meanwhile, e-commerce sales are expected to increase 18 - 21% in 2017 and reach $111 - $114 billion during this holiday season. This compares to e-commerce sales (seasonally adjusted and excluding autos, gas, food services and parts dealers) of $93.8 billion between November 2016 and January 2017.Factors that will Drive the IncreaseThe retail sector has been showing signs of stabilizing with the industry performing better than the overall market year to date.With the holiday season round the corner, retailers are gearing up to attract customers through promotions, early-store openings, heavy discounts, as well as free shipping on online purchases. Retailers like Macy’s (M  -  Free Report) and Target Corporation (TGT  -  Free Report) are hiring seasonal associates for the upcoming Christmas and holiday season.As per Deloitte’s senior U.S. economist, one of the factors that will drive consumer spending is the strong growth in personal income that is expected this year – disposable personal income, which grew 2% over the year to the holiday period in 2016, is expected to grow to 3.8-4.2% this season. Other driving factors include high levels of consumer confidence, a strong labor market and a low level of personal savings.How to Pick the Right StocksWhile things are looking up for the retail sector, there are still certain factors that could lead to lower-than-expected sales. These include the impact of the recent hurricanes which could affect spending as well as a tendency to save more that would lead to lower spending. Moreover, spending on essential services like healthcare could also curtail retail spending.Given this scenario, it makes sense to zero in on stocks which carry a strong Zacks Rank – Zacks Rank #1(Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy).We have picked four stocks from the Zacks Apparel and Shoes industry which enjoys a good Zacks Industry Rank (top 36% out of 256 industries).Abercrombie & Fitch Co.

3253,TGT,"With the holiday season approaching, retailers are gearing up for the busiest part of the year and it goes without saying that competition will be tough, be at brick-and-mortar stores or online. Its a foregone conclusion that retail bellwethers will leave no stone unturned to make the most of the season that accounts for a sizeable chunk of yearly revenues and profits. They will sweep buyers off their feet with early-hour store openings, huge discounts, promotional strategies, and free shipping on online purchases.However, the recent soft retail sales data for the month of August have somewhat subdued the fervor of retailers. Adding to the woes, is the recent cut in 2017 retail sales forecast by the National Retail Federation. Per the retail trade association, retail sales — excluding autos, gas and restaurant — are expected to jump in the band of 3.2-3.8% down from 3.7-4.2% projected previously.Market experts asserted that while recent hurricanes resulted in short-term derailment in the economic activity, a lift in the later part of the year remains on the cards. However, they cautioned that a surge in gasoline prices will pinch the pockets of consumers who make bulk purchases during the holiday season. Nevertheless, improving labor market, rising disposable income and elevated consumer confidence indicate sturdy sales during this shopping season.According to Deloitte, sales during the holiday season are likely to go up as much as 4.5%, while e-commerce sales are envisioned to improve 18-21%. The data unveiled by Kantar suggests that sales during the fourth-quarter holiday period is expected to jump 3.7%. Data compiled by eMarketer forecasts 3.1% jump in holiday sales (November and December) to $923.15 billion, while retail e-commerce holiday season sales are anticipated to rise 16.6%.Retailers Taking E-RouteThe retail landscape has been undergoing a fundamental change, with technology playing a major role and the focus shifting to online shopping. This transition in shopping pattern is compelling retailers to rapidly adapt to the changes in the ecosystem. Retailers now have no option left but to keep pace with the changing retail scenario or get eliminated. They are now focusing more on enhancing omni-channel capabilities, optimizing store fleet and restructuring activities. Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report) has been in the spotlight for the last few years, as changing customer patterns made the retail industry more dependent on e-commerce.Amazon’s recent takeover of Whole Foods Market sent shivers down major grocery retailers. Analysts are looking at this acquisition as an amalgamation between online marketplace and physical stores. The deal gave Amazon an easy access to roughly 400 plus stores and a foothold in the grocery business. The e-commerce giant acquired online retail platform Souq.com to tap the Middle East market and entered the Chinese market with the buyout of Joyo.com, an online retailer of music, books, videos and DVDs. Further, NIKE Inc.’s (NKE  -  Free Report) plans to sell directly through Amazon raised concerns for other sporting goods retailers. Sears Holdings entered into an accord to sell Kenmore-branded appliances on Amazon’s platform.Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report) is also making huge investments in e-commerce initiatives. The company’s acquisitions of ShoeBuy, Moosejaw, ModCloth and Jet.com fall in line with its quest to build an impressive digital brand portfolio. The company partnered with Alphabet’s Google to enable shopping through Google Express using voice-activated service. Target Corporation (TGT  -  Free Report) has been also focusing on developing its online business. Recently, it waged war against other retail big-wigs by aggressively cutting prices on a range of items.Hiring on Track to Meet the Holiday RushRetailers such as Macy’s, Inc. (M  -  Free Report), Target, The Gap, Inc. (GPS  -  Free Report) have announced hiring plans for the upcoming holiday season as they expect higher store traffic based on renewed consumer confidence.Per media reports, Target intends to employ 100,000 associates, while Macy's will hire nearly 80,000 seasonal workers to handle the rush. Meanwhile, Gap has begun inviting applications for seasonal associate positions at all stores including Gap, Gap Outlet, Banana Republic, Banana Republic Factory and Old Navy across the United States and Canada. Gap’s hiring events will be organized at all concerned stores on Sep 23, 2017. 1-800-FLOWERS.COM, Inc. (FLWS  -  Free Report) plans to hire about 8,000 associates nationwide for the season.Be Hawk-Eyed on the Extra MilesThe holiday season is nothing less than a battlefield for the retailers fighting hard to win over consumers. Companies will go the extra mile — offering discounts or indulging in promotional activities — to trap the bargain hunters. But we wonder whether these will come at the price of margins, not to say the impact on the bottom line.We believe that with the advent of the holiday season, the retail sector will hog all the attention. So, how about betting your bucks on lucrative options? Out of the stocks mentioned above, Wal-Mart, Target, Macy's, Nike and Gap all carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

3254,TGT,"On Tuesday, after reports that the toy retailer was preparing for financial restructuring, Toys ‘R’ Us filed for bankruptcy Monday night after years of struggling to keep up with competitors and to pay down billions of dollars in debt.Toys ‘R’ Us’s Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing came in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of Virginia in Richmond; the company said that its Canadian unit will also seek reorganization in Ontario’s bankruptcy court. Toys ‘R’ Us will remain open, but is protected from creditors’ claims as it begins a court-supervised restructuring plan.“Today marks the dawn of a new era at Toys ‘R’ Us where we expect that the financial constraints that have held us back will be addressed in a lasting and effective way,” said Dave Brandon, chairman and chief executive of Toys R Us, in a statement. “…We are confident these are the right steps to ensure that the iconic Toys ‘R’ Us and Babies ‘R’ Us brands live on for many generations.”For years, Toys ‘R’ Us was the first stop for shoppers during the holiday rush or if a birthday gift was needed. It’s prominent flagship in New York City’s Times Square, iconic Geoffrey the Giraffe mascot, and stores that held literally thousands of items, a Toys ‘R’ Us was a go-to spot for toys and baby products.But like many brick-and-mortar retailers, and despite having its own website, the toy retailer could not keep up with customer demand, and the changing ways in which those customers shopped. Competitors like Walmart (WMT  -  Free Report), Target (TGT  -  Free Report), and especially Amazon.com (AMZN  -  Free Report) soon eclipsed Toys ‘R’ Us, offering customers much better prices and an overall greater shopping experience.Its $5 billion debt load hasn’t helped the company much either, with much of that stemming from the 2005 deal that took the toy company private. Toys ‘R’ Us is owned by three companies: private equity firms Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Bain Capital, and real estate firm Vornado Realty Trust.We can also look at how traditional toys have declined in popularity among children and teenagers, two demographics that are now more interested in smartphones and tablets, but more importantly, the apps and games for those devices: think Snapchat (SNAP  -  Free Report) and Facebook (FB  -  Free Report)-owned Instagram. For a retailer that primarily sells traditional toys, this rise in electronics certainly hurt.Retail: A Closer LookToys ‘R’ Us is not the only private-equity-owned retailer that has suffered. Kids apparel company Gymboree filed for bankruptcy earlier this year, while David’s Bridal, Neiman Marcus, and Nine West Holdings are facing similar financial problems. Neiman Marcus, which is high-end department store, said it was considering putting itself up for sale after trying to pay down its debt load for over a decade. And then you have the laundry list of retailers that have closed hundreds of store locations, including Macy’s (M  -  Free Report), Sears , and Bebe .Heading into the 2017 holiday season, however, Toys ‘R’ Us’s bankruptcy will likely impact the top two toymakers in the U.S.: Mattel (MAT  -  Free Report) and Hasbro (HAS  -  Free Report). Jakks Pacific (JAKK  -  Free Report), which makes a wide range of licensed toys, could also feel the effects. Mattel is known for the Barbie and Hot Wheels brands, while Hasbro is the maker of Play-Doh, Transformers, and My Little Pony Toys.Since initial reports surfaced that Toys ‘R’ Us was weighing its financial options, shares of both Mattel and Hasbro took a big hit, since the retailer made up a sizable percent of the toymakers’ sales last year. But by today, each stock has bounced back, with MAT and HAS closing the day up 1.2% and 2%, respectively.Toys ‘R’ Us currently operates approximately 1,600 stores, including Babies ‘R’ Us, around the world, and employs 65,000 people in total.4 Promising Stock Picks to Keep an Eye On With news stories about computer hacking and identity theft becoming increasingly commonplace, the cybersecurity industry looks like a promising investment opportunity.

3255,TGT,"The changing retail landscape has had a bitter impact on most retailers. Evolving spending patterns of consumers and inclination toward online shopping have dented traffic and in turn brick-and-mortar sales. This digital transformation in shopping forced most retailers including big-box ones to trim their store count and focus more on their e-commerce model. One such retailer hit hard by the tough retail environment is Kohl’s Corporation (KSS  -  Free Report).Headwinds Plaguing the CompanyKohl’s has been grappling with numerous challenges since the past many quarters due to difficult sales environment and cautious consumer spending. The company witnessed a decline in demand for clothes and accessories like watches and handbags as consumers prefer to loosen the purse strings more on home renovations and cars.This has affected the store traffic significantly. In fact, in 2016, the company closed 19 underperforming stores due to tough retail conditions and heightened competition from discount retailers like Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report) as well as other physical shops such as Macy’s Inc. (M  -  Free Report) and Target Corporation (TGT  -  Free Report). Kohl’s comps have also been decreasing over the last six quarters due to industry wide concerns.In such a bleak scenario, Kohl’s has come up with innovative ways to market its products well and has undertaken initiatives to drive the sales and market share.Measures Adopted to Boost Traffic and Drive SalesKohl’s has been trying hard to attract more shoppers and improve sales. Recently, the company has partnered with e-commerce giant Amazon to provide a new Amazon smart home experience to customers in 10 selected Kohl’s stores across Los Angeles and Chicago, beginning this October. Apart from Amazon, the company had teamed up with Apple Inc. last year to develop small shops within its stores. Kohl’s believes this store-within-store concept will increase buyers’ footfall and boost stores traffic.The company has also started offering more famous external brands, curtailing the number of in-house clothing labels it sells. The addition of Under Armour workout tights, sneakers and other gear in March earlier was a great success and very well-accepted among the customers. The company is also focusing on sales growth with both Nike and Adidas. Kohl’s plans to start selling Clarks shoes to capture the back-to-school shopping season and is looking for other brands to add to store aisles. The company has gained significant a market share in active apparel and footwear segment in the first half of the year and expects the momentum to continue in the latter half, based on assortment improvements.The company also intends to focus on three largest private-label brands such as SONOMA, Croft & Barrow and Apartment 9 in order to propel traffic, thanks to the sales improvement trend posted in the past, driven by an impact of speed initiative in the supply chain.In order to drive comps, the company has also taken an initiative of Greatness Agenda during the first quarter of 2014 to increase transactions per store and sales. Though the plan is currently losing fizz, the company remains optimistic on its strategy to push sales over the long term. As part of this scheme, the company focuses on providing the right merchandise mix with tailoring products for every customer across channels. To execute this, the company expects to put more emphasis on five pillars namely, amazing product, easy experience, personalized connections, incredible savings and winning teams.We believe these efforts are well-reflected in the share prices of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 (Strong Buy) Rank stocks here.In the last three months, the stock has rallied nearly 25% in comparison to the industry and the broader Retail and Wholesale sector. While the industry has increased 9.2%, the sector has grown just 4.8%.Kohl’s also boasts a VGM Score of A, which makes it a favorable investing option.Inventory Reduction InitiativesKohl’s has also undertaken several steps to reduce inventory with a view to raise profits. Lower stock levels have led to improvement in merchandise margins, thus leading to gross margin growth. The company continues to expect supply to be down at low to mid-single digits for fiscal 2017.Growing e-Commerce BusinessThe company is also striving to flourish its e-commerce business since the last few years. As a result, digital conversion improved at a double-digit rate in the recently reported second-fiscal 2017 on the back of better customer experiences on smartphone and smartphone app. In fact, technological advancement in terms of online applications, order placement on phone handsets and omnichannel efforts are expected to leave a substantial impact on customer experience.In order to facilitate online sales via virtual platforms, Kohl’s has been opening on-line fulfillment centers and has also introduced Kohl’s Pay — a payment option allowing customers to pay for their in-store purchases with the Kohl’s credit card via their mobile phones. The company hopes to significantly grow its e-commerce business through these efforts in the near term.Regular InnovationKohl’s also routinely introduces new brands to keep the inventory assortment fresh and the flow of customer traffic to company’s stores and website stable. Popular launches like Fit Bed under the company’s active and wellness business, the Jumping Beans collection featuring Disney characters, IZOD branded menswear and the Juicy Couture brand for women and girls, Gaiam Yoga product, Stride Rite branded kids’ footwear collection and many more further add stimulus to the company’s robust product-portfolio. Kohl’s has also partnered with designer Reed Krakoff to unveil an exclusive, limited-edition collection called REED, exclusively at Kohl’s retail outlets and on Kohls.com in April 2016.Kohl's Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Kohl's Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Kohl's Corporation Quote4 Promising Stock Picks to Keep an Eye On With news stories about computer hacking and identity theft becoming increasingly commonplace, the cybersecurity industry looks like a promising investment opportunity.

3256,TGT,"The Q2 earnings picture for the retail sector is among the weakest this reporting cycle with results tracking below past quarters and leading to 0.5% negative price performance for the broad sector.Total earnings from 90.8% of the sector’s total market capitalization reported so far are down 0.8% on 4.8% higher revenues with 77.4% of the companies beating on earnings and 80.6% exceeding top-line estimates. While earnings growth rate is unimpressive, the proportion of retailers beating revenue estimates is the third highest of all 16 Zacks sectors, behind only the conglomerates (83.3%) and technology (85.2%).Positive earnings reports from Target (TGT  -  Free Report), Nordstrom (JWN  -  Free Report), Wal-Mart (WMT  -  Free Report) and Home Depot (HD  -  Free Report) offset some negativity of weak results from department stores like J.C. Penney (JCP  -  Free Report), Macy’s (M  -  Free Report), and Kohl’s KSS.Let’s dig into the details of the earnings releases:Earnings Sending Stocks HigherBig-box retailer, Target, emerged as the real champion in the Q2 earnings season as the stock surged as much as 4.9% following robust second-quarter fiscal 2017 results on August 18. The company topped our estimates by three cents for earnings and by $147 million for revenues. It expects earnings per share in the range of 75-95 for the ongoing quarter and raised its outlook to $4.34-$4.54 from $3.80-$4.20 for the fiscal year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate at the time of earnings release was 78 cents for the third quarter and $4.42 for fiscal 2017 (read: Will Big-Box Retailers Push Up Retail ETFs in Q2 Earnings?).Specialty retailer, Nordstrom, rose as much as 2.5% following second-quarter fiscal 2017 results. The company beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings by three cents and for revenues by $61 million. The company raised its lower end of its earnings per share guidance to $2.52-$3.00 from $2.75-$3.00 for fiscal 2017.The DampenersOne of the leading department store retailers, J.C. Penney, dampened investors’ mood as its share price plunged 19.9% following the earnings announcement on August 11. The company posted loss per share of 9 cents, wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 6 cents. However, revenue came in higher than our estimate by $92 million. For fiscal 2017, the company continued to expect earnings per share in the range of 40-65 cents (see: all the Consumer Discretionary ETFs here).The second-largest department store retailer, Macy’s tanked 10.8% following the earnings announcement on August 10, marking the biggest daily loss since January 5. Though the retailer beat our estimates for earnings by three cents and for revenues by $51 million, it reported drop in same-store sales, sparking concerns on the prospect of its turnaround before the crucial holiday season. For fiscal 2017, it continues to project sales decline of 3.2-4.3% and earnings per share in the range of $2.90-$3.15.One of the leading departmental stores Kohl’s also had its worst day since January 8, falling 5.8% posting a bigger-than-expected drop in quarterly sales on August 10. Earnings per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a nickel and revenues came in slightly higher than our estimate by $6 million.Home Depot, the world's largest home improvement retailer, beat on second-quarter fiscal 2017 earnings by three cents and on revenues by $267 million. For fiscal 2017, Home Depot raised the earnings per share guidance to $7.29 from $7.15, which represents 13% increase year over year. However, the stock dropped as much as 3.9% on the day of its earnings announcement on August 15.The world's largest retailer, Wal-Mart, lost as much as 3.2% on August 17 on bleak guidance.

3257,TGT,"Wal-Mart (WMT  -  Free Report) announced on Wednesday that the company will partner with Alphabet’s (GOOGL  -  Free Report) Google to give shoppers the ability to order thousands of products through Google Express using voice-activated shopping.Wal-Mart customers can soon link their Wal-Mart accounts directly to Google Express, Google’s online marketplace. Google Express already offers products from a variety of stores, such as Target (TGT  -  Free Report) and Whole Foods . However, Wal-Mart will offer the largest selection of products on the Express platform.Once customers link their Wal-Mart accounts to Google Marketplace, they can order items quickly through Google Home using their voice or by shopping online. Google plans to use consumers’ past Wal-Mart history to learn their shopping patterns and to determine which products the service should recommend.“It makes sense for us to team up with Google,” said Marc Lore, Wal-Mart’s head of e-commerce, in a Wednesday morning blog post. “They’ve made significant investments in natural language processing and artificial intelligence to deliver a powerful voice shopping experience.”This partnership will directly challenge Amazon.com (AMZN  -  Free Report), which currently dominates voice shopping with its Alexa-powered Echo devices. While Google introduced its Express platform to Google Home this past February, Amazon has offered voice-activated shopping on Echo devices since 2014.Google will also put pressure on Amazon by offering free delivery on Google Express orders, starting Wednesday. Consumers just need to make sure their orders reach retailer’s minimum threshold. Wal-Mart, for example has a minimum of $35. Currently, Amazon offers free delivery to Prime members or on orders of $25 or more that include only eligible items.Lore expects the partnership between Wal-Mart and Google Express to grow. “Next year, we will also leverage our 4,700 U.S. stores and our fulfillment network to create customer experiences that don’t currently exist within voice shopping anywhere else,” Lore wrote.These additional services would allow customers to use voice-activated shopping for pick-up orders in stores, at a discount, and to purchase fresh groceries. Just this Monday, Wal-Mart announced an expansion of their partnership with Uber to deliver groceries in Dallas and Orlando.Wal-Mart products will be available on Google Express in late September.4 Surprising Tech Stocks to Keep an Eye on Tech stocks have been a major force behind the market’s record highs, but picking the best ones to buy can be tough.

In June, Target launched a next-day delivery service in Minnesota called Target Restock.“Target is seizing a tremendous opportunity to leverage local delivery as a retail differentiator,” said Rob Howard, Grand Junction’s founder and CEO. “We’re thrilled about helping to pursue this opportunity, and to join Target at this unprecedented time in retail.”When the deal is closed, Howard will become vice president of technology at Target. All Grand Junction employees will become Target team members as well.Investors reacted positively to the news, with Target stock rising over 1% in morning trading on Monday.5 Trades Could Profit ""Big-League"" from Trump PoliciesIf the stocks above spark your interest, wait until you look into companies primed to make substantial gains from Washington's changing course.Today Zacks reveals 5 tickers that could benefit from new trends like streamlined drug approvals, tariffs, lower taxes, higher interest rates, and spending surges in defense and infrastructure.

3259,TGT,"The Q1 earnings season has reached the tail end for all sectors save retail, which has seen about half of its total releases. Total earnings for the sector reported so far are down 1.7% from the same period last year on 6.7% revenue growth with 73.9% beating EPS estimates and 78.3% beating revenue estimates.While the growth pace is well below the four-quarter average, revenue and earnings surprises are much better than recent quarters. This is especially true as woes for departmental stores continued given the shift toward digital shopping.  Though departmental stores - Macy’s (M  -  Free Report) and Kohl’s (KSS  -  Free Report) - topped our revenue and earnings estimate, they reported a drop in same-store sales, sparking off concerns on the prospect of their turnaround before the crucial holiday season. As a result, Macy’s dropped 10.2% following the earnings announcement on August 10, marking their biggest daily loss since January 5 while Kohl's shares had its worst day since January 8 falling 5.8%. Another department store chain Dillard's (DDS  -  Free Report) also tanked 15.9% on August 10 after it missed on both fronts (read: 3 ETFs & Stocks to Buy Post June Retail Sales).J. C. Penney (JCP  -  Free Report) shed as much as nearly 17% at the close on August 11 to reach an all-time low of $3.77 following dismal second-quarter results.All these results continued to weigh on the broad retail sector, suggesting more pain ahead for the retailers. In fact, retail ETFs - SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT  -  Free Report), VanEck Vectors Retail ETF (RTH  -  Free Report) and PowerShares Retail Fund (PMR  -  Free Report) – shed 3.5%, 1.1% and 2.1%, respectively, over the past five trading days.Given that earnings are the most important drivers of stock performance, it is necessary to look at the expected surprise of big-box retailers that are likely to report this week. These also have the potential to push the related ETFs upward or downward (see: all the Consumer Discretionary ETFs here).A Peek into Earnings SurprisesReports from Home Depot (HD  -  Free Report), Staples , Target (TGT  -  Free Report), Wal-Mart (WMT  -  Free Report), and Foot Locker (FL  -  Free Report) will be crucial for the sector this week.According to our surprise prediction methodology, a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) when combined with a positive Earnings ESP has chances of an earnings beat. A Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) is best avoided going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Home Depot is slated to report earnings before the bell on August 15. The stock has a Zacks Rank #2 and Earnings ESP of +0.45%, indicating higher chances of beating estimates this quarter. The company saw negative earnings estimate revision of a penny over the past three months for the to-be-reported quarter but delivered a positive earnings surprise in each of the last four quarters, with an average beat of 3.45%. The stock has a VGM Style Score of B.Staples has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of 0.00%, making surprise prediction difficult. It saw no earnings estimate revision for the to-be-reported quarter over the past three months and did not deliver any earnings surprise over the past four quarters. The stock has a top VGM Style Score of A. The company is expected to report on August 16.Target has a Zacks Rank #2 and an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. The stock has seen solid earnings estimate revision of 21 cents for the to-be-reported quarter over the past three months and delivered a positive earnings surprise of 16.46% in the last four quarters. It has a top VGM Style Score of A. The company is expected to report before the opening bell on August 16 (read: Target Relieves Some Pain of Retail ETFs).Wal-Mart is scheduled to report on August 17 before market open. It has a Zacks Rank #2 and an Earnings ESP of +0.94%, indicating a higher chance of beating estimates this quarter. The company delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 2.98% in the last four quarters and witnessed positive earnings estimate revision of a penny over the past three months for the to-be-reported quarter. It has a top VGM Style Score of A.Foot Locker, which will likely report earnings on August 18 before the opening bell, has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of -3.30%, indicating lower chances of beating estimates. Though the stock has seen negative earnings estimate revision of 13 cents over the past 90 days for the yet-to-be-reported quarter, it delivered positive earnings surprises in three of the last four quarters, with an average beat of 2.06%. Additionally, the stock has a VGM Style Score of B.  ConclusionWith a few earnings surprises in the cards and a favorable stock ranks for big-box retailers, the ETF space might see some good trading in the days ahead even though the sector has an ugly Zacks Rank in the bottom 13%.This is because retail ETFs could stand out well as these can easily counter shocks from some of the industry’s biggest components given their spread-out exposure to a number of firms in various types of industries like specialty retail, hypermarkets, drug stores, food retail, internet retail and many others. Further, the ETFs mentioned above have favorable ranks. Notably, RTH has a Zacks ETF Rank of 1 while XRT has a Zacks ETF Rank of 2.

3260,TGT,"Target Corp. (TGT  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release second-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Aug 16. Well the obvious question that comes to mind is will this operator of general merchandise stores be able to post positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. In the trailing four quarters, it outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 16.5%.The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the second quarter is $1.20 down from $1.23 reported in the year-ago period. We noted that the Zacks Consensus Estimate has improved by 15 cents in the last 30 days. Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $16,220 million.Factors at PlayWe believe that Target’s initiatives such as the development of omni-channel capacities, diversification and localization of assortments along with emphasis on flexible format stores bode well. Management plans to expand its merchandise assortments with special emphasis on Style, Baby, Kids, and Wellness categories that are performing well and recently rolled out Target Restock program. Moreover, the company has also adopted an aggressive cost reduction strategy, including rationalization of supply chain, technology and process improvements. These initiatives are significant in the light of waning top and bottom lines.The company now expects to post positive comparable sales for the first time in five quarters and envisions earnings per share to top the upper end of its guidance range of 95 cents to $1.15, when it reports second-quarter results. Improved sales and traffic trends witnessed during the first two months of the quarter, prompted management to raise its forecast, which otherwise had earlier projected low-single digit decline in comparable sales. We noted that comparable sales had decreased 1.3% in the first quarter of fiscal 2017, following declines of 1.5%, 0.2% and 1.1% in the fourth, third and second quarters of fiscal 2016.Target Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Target Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Target Corporation QuoteWhat Does the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Target is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Target has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% as the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate both are pegged at $1.20. Although, Target’s Zacks Rank #2 increases the predictive power of ESP, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings beat.Stocks with Favorable CombinationHere are three companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:The Gap, Inc. (GPS  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +3.85% and a Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.94% and a Zacks Rank #2.Burlington Stores, Inc.

3261,TGT,"Think all the way back to a week or so ago — the markets were enjoying multi-week gains and all-time highs. It was a late term bull market that looked as if it were just picking up new steam, as there appeared to be nothing in Q2 earnings season or in overall economic metrics that were in a position to stifle such historic positives.Seems like a long time ago now, doesn’t it?We are seeing futures up in the initial pre-market session of this new week, but that’s not to say the mood is the same as it was last Monday. Plenty of question marks float around the market today — in the form of economic data and other actionable information to be released this week, as well as threat of nuclear conflict with North Korea and even the leadership of the identity of the United States itself.For instance, just this morning, Merck (MRK  -  Free Report) CEO Ken Frazier has announced he is stepping down from President Trump’s American Manufacturing Council in reaction to the president’s statement regarding the deadly tragedy in Charlottesville, VA over the weekend. That the standoff between white nationalists ands those protesting white nationalists ended in the tragic death of one protestor and 19 others injured was the result of “hatred, bigotry and violence — on many sides” provoked Frazier to say the U.S. must “honor our fundamental values” and “reject hatred.” “I feel a responsibility to take a stand against intolerance and extremism,” Frazier’s statement read.That this statement resulted in a new Twitter attack on Frazier and his company is not really a surprise, as it is fairly true to form for President Trump. But rather than get into a deeper discussion about this here, suffice it to say this is yet another arena where we see thorns and barbs that either weren’t there or weren’t visible this time last week.July Retail Sales come out tomorrow, with expectations of -0.2% growth looking to be the third straight month of down retail sales. Consumer confidence is apparently up, but if consumers aren’t spending, where exactly is the disconnect here? Another question mark, which may be partially answered by the earnings reports due Wednesday from Walmart (WMT  -  Free Report) and Target (TGT  -  Free Report).Also on Wednesday, we look for answers from minutes released from the most recent Federal Reserve meeting, and whether there is an advancement of language articulating the winding down of $4.5 trillion on the Fed’s balance sheet, even as chances of a new rate hike in September are close to nil at this point. Will working off this massive debt be postponed or stalled in any way now that inflation metrics have yet to find their way into the economy as expected by this time? Questions, questions everywhere.

3262,TGT,"Off-price retailer of apparel and home accessories, Ross Stores Inc. (ROST  -  Free Report) is leaving no loose ends in its efforts to retain investor faith. The company has time and again showcased its ability to deliver on targets. That said, Ross Stores has completed its target of inaugurating 28 new stores in second-quarter fiscal 2017, with the opening of 21 Ross Dress for Less (“Ross”) and seven dd’s DISCOUNTS outlets.These store openings that happened in June and so far in July marked the company’s expansion in 15 different states, including both new and existing markets. In this set of store openings, the company opened Ross outlets in the newest Midwest market, while also expanding presence in the existing California, Texas and Florida markets. Further, the company opened its 200th dd’s DISCOUNTS store in June and also expanded in the newest Pennsylvania market.Notably, these store openings represent a significant progress on its plans to open 90 stores in fiscal 2017, including 70 Ross and 20 dd’s DISCOUNTS outlets. As a first step toward achieving this goal, the company had opened 28 new stores in first-quarter fiscal 2017, including 23 Ross Dress for Less and five dd’s DISCOUNTS stores. With the recent store openings, the company has achieved more than 60% of store expansion plans for the current fiscal.Including the aforementioned store openings, Ross Stores operated 1,384 Ross Dress for Less stores across 37 states, the District of Columbia and Guam as well as 205 dd’s DISCOUNTS outlets across 16 states as of Jul 17, 2017.Going forward, the company remains optimistic about expansion plans and views immense opportunity to grow in new as well as existing markets. Consequently, the company reiterated long-term goal of expanding store count to 2,500, comprising 2,000 Ross and 500 dd’s DISCOUNTS stores.We remain confident of the company’s growth potential and its ability to successfully attain long-term store growth target. Additionally, we believe the company is underpenetrated in the 37 states it serves and holds promise to substantially expand store base in these markets.Ross Stores has outperformed the Zacks categorized Retail – Discount Stores industry in the past one year. Though this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock has dropped 7.5%, the decline is narrower than the industry’s fall of 15.1%.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the Discount Stores space are Burlington Stores Inc. (BURL  -  Free Report), Target Corp. (TGT  -  Free Report) and Dollar General Corp. (DG  -  Free Report). All the three stocks carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Burlington Stores’ long-term EPS growth rate of 15.9% and a share price growth of 7.1% in the last six months help it to stand strong in the industry. Moreover, the company flaunts a superb earnings surprise history.Target has a long-term EPS growth rate of 5.4%. Moreover, the stock has seen positive estimate revisions in the last seven days and has to its credit an average positive surprise of 16.5% in the trailing four quarters.Dollar General, with long-term EPS growth rate of 10.6%, has grown 4.1% in the last three months.5 Trades Could Profit """"Big-League"""" from Trump PoliciesIf the stocks above spark your interest, wait until you look into companies primed to make substantial gains from Washington's changing course.Today Zacks reveals 5 tickers that could benefit from new trends like streamlined drug approvals, tariffs, lower taxes, higher interest rates, and spending surges in defense and infrastructure.

3263,TGT,"With store expansion efforts on track, Nordstrom, Inc. (JWN  -  Free Report) recently announced plans to inaugurate a Nordstrom Rack store at the Orchard Town Center in Westminster, CO, in spring 2019. Spanning across 25,000 square feet, the new store marks the seventh Rack store in the state.This new outlet will share space with various restaurants and specialty shops as well as renowned retailers, including Macy's, Inc. (M  -  Free Report), Target Corporation (TGT  -  Free Report), AMC Theatres, H&M, REI and Gap Inc.’s (GPS  -  Free Report) Old Navy.Situated off I-25 in the northern Denver metro area, The Orchard Town Center is an open-air retail and entertainment platform, which is owned and supervised by Phoenix-based Vestar. Nordstrom is likely to gain from this convenient location and better cater to its customers by its top-tier merchandise offerings.Being the off-price retail segment of the company, Nordstrom Rack offers fashion-savvy customers a wide range of on-trend apparel, footwear and other accessories at discounted prices. These Racks usually keep items from the main Nordstrom stores as well as online store, Nordstrom.com. Also, these stores stack products from other major brands sold by the company.Notably, the company has three full-line stores in the state of Colorado, alongside six Rack outlets. In fiscal 2017, management intends to introduce 11 Rack stores, and will relocate one store. In addition, the company is on track with domestic store expansion. It is scheduled to inaugurate two full-line store relocations in California in October, at Westfield Century City in Los Angeles and at University Towne Center in La Jolla.As of Aug 18, 2017, the company operates 354 outlets across 40 states. Its portfolio also includes 122 full-line stores across the United States, Puerto Rico and Canada, two Jeffrey boutiques, 221 Nordstrom Racks and two clearance stores.Prior to this Westminster store, the company announced plans to introduce a Rack store at The Promenade at Town Center in Santa Clarita, CA, which is slated to open doors in spring 2018.Interestingly, with digital transformation in shopping and consumers splurging online, store and mall traffic has been hit hard. As a result, most retailers, including the big-box ones, are struggling to compete with eCommerce bigwigs and are being forced to curb their store count to focus more on an online model.On the contrary, Nordstrom is a resilient company that continues with its store expansion plans despite a challenging retail backdrop.Furthermore, we laud the company’s cost-saving initiatives and progress on 2020 strategy. Though its growth strategy bodes well, investments toward occupancy, technology, supply chain and marketing are likely to weigh upon its near-term cost and margin performance.However, its strategic efforts are well reflected in the stock performance.

3265,TGT,"The Gap Inc. (GPS  -  Free Report) gained 5.5% in yesterday’s after-market trading session, as the company raised its fiscal 2017 earnings outlook, following the better-than-expected second quarter results. While the quarter marked the second consecutive positive earnings surprise, it was Gap’s fifth straight quarter of sales beat. Comparable store sales (comps) also continued to witness strength for the third time in a row, mainly driven by sturdy performance of Old Navy. The company’s focus on enhancing product quality and quick response to the changing consumer trends also helped the results.However, foreign currency continued to play foul, resulting in the year-over-year decline in both the top and bottom lines. Nevertheless, yesterday’s upside drove this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock’s last three months’ performance to a solid 7.9%, which shows a marked improvement in comparison to the industry’s 9.4% decline.Q2 Highlights     Gap’s adjusted earnings of 58 cents a share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 52 cents, though it slid 3.3% from 60 cents earned in the year-ago period. Currency dented earnings per share growth to the tune of about 3 percentage points. On a GAAP basis, earnings came in at 68 cents, compared with 31 cents recorded in the year-ago period.Gap, Inc. (The) Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Gap, Inc. (The) Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Gap, Inc. (The) QuoteNet sales dipped 1.4% to $3,799 million, with foreign currency translations bearing an adverse impact of $37 million. Also, international store closures impacted net sales. However, the top-line fared better than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3,765 million. Further, comps climbed 1%, against a 2% decline recorded in the year-ago period.Comps continued to gain from robust Old Navy performance, which was fueled by improved traffic. This was partly offset by persistent softness across Banana Republic. As for the Gap brand, though comps dipped year over year, it improved sequentially thanks to better products. Looking at numbers, Old Nay comps grew 5%, whereas Gap and Banana Republic suffered 1% and 5%, respectively.MarginsGross profit rose 2.9% to $1,479 million, with the gross margin expanding 160 basis points (bps) to 38.9%. Adjusted gross margin grew 120 bps, attributable to a 110 bps increase in merchandise margins and 10 bps rent and occupancy expenses leverage.Operating income surged 61.6% to $451 million, while operating margin expanded about 470 bps to 11.9%. However, the adjusted operating margin contracted 90 bps to 10.2%, owing to higher adjusted operating expenses. These expenses stemmed from greater payroll costs, along with investments in digital and customer service initiatives.FinancialsGap ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $1,609 million, long-term debt of $1,248 million, and total shareholders’ equity of $2,945 million.During the first half, the company generated cash flow from operations of $486 million and incurred capital expenditures of $275 million. The company had free cash flow of $270 million on a year-to-date basis.For fiscal 2017, management projects capital expenditure of approximately $625 million, excluding the planned $200 million spending associated with reconstructing the Fishkill distribution center.Coming to Gap’s shareholder-friendly moves for the second quarter, the company paid dividend of 23 cents per share and bought back 4.5 million shares for $100 million. Year to date, the company payed $182 million as dividend. Additionally, on Aug 10, the company declared third-quarter dividend of 23 cents per share. Looking ahead, the company plans to make buybacks worth roughly $100 million in the third quarter.Store UpdatesIn the quarter under review, Gap introduced 22 stores, while shuttering 32 stores. Of the stores opened, 15 were company-operated and 7 were franchise. Similarly, the stores closed included 22 company-operated and 10 franchise stores. Thus, the company ended the quarter with 3,642 outlets in 47 countries, of which 3,179 were company-operated and 463 were franchise. Gap still anticipates store count for fiscal 2017 to be flat with fiscal 2016 levels.OutlookManagement remains impressed with its long-term growth endeavors, which mainly revolves around improving customer experience and accelerating responsiveness to their evolving demands. In this regard, Gap remains focused on enhancing product categories and boosting its web and mobile offerings. Encouraged by the progress in these initiatives and a solid first-half performance, the company raised its earnings per share projection for fiscal 2017, while retaining its sales and comps view.The company now envisions adjusted earnings for the fiscal year in the range of $2.02-$2.10 per share, compared with the previous range of $1.95-$2.05. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at $2.00, which is likely to witness an upward revision following the upbeat outlook. Comps growth is still anticipated to range from flat to marginal improvement. Net sales, are expected to be little lower than this range, owing to the effect from currency woes and fiscal 2016 global store closures.For the third quarter, management stated that it expects SG&A expenses to increase at a higher rate than the first half. This mainly stems from increased product, marketing and digital investments for the significant back-to-school selling season.Looking for More?

3266,TGT,"Monday, August 14th, 2017Think all the way back to a week or so ago — the markets were enjoying multi-week gains and all-time highs. It was a late term bull market that looked as if it were just picking up new steam, as there appeared to be nothing in Q2 earnings season or in overall economic metrics that were in a position to stifle such historic positives.Seems like a long time ago now, doesn’t it?We are seeing futures up in the initial pre-market session of this new week, but that’s not to say the mood is the same as it was last Monday. Plenty of question marks float around the market today — in the form of economic data and other actionable information to be released this week, as well as threat of nuclear conflict with North Korea and even the leadership of the identity of the United States itself.For instance, just this morning, Merck (MRK  -  Free Report) CEO Ken Frazier has announced he is stepping down from President Trump’s American Manufacturing Council in reaction to the president’s statement regarding the deadly tragedy in Charlottesville, VA over the weekend. That the standoff between white nationalists ands those protesting white nationalists ended in the tragic death of one protestor and 19 others injured was the result of “hatred, bigotry and violence — on many sides” provoked Frazier to say the U.S. must “honor our fundamental values” and “reject hatred.” “I feel a responsibility to take a stand against intolerance and extremism,” Frazier’s statement read.That this statement resulted in a new Twitter attack on Frazier and his company is not really a surprise, as it is fairly true to form for President Trump. But rather than get into a deeper discussion about this here, suffice it to say this is yet another arena where we see thorns and barbs that either weren’t there or weren’t visible this time last week.July Retail Sales come out tomorrow, with expectations of -0.2% growth looking to be the third straight month of down retail sales. Consumer confidence is apparently up, but if consumers aren’t spending, where exactly is the disconnect here? Another question mark, which may be partially answered by the earnings reports due Wednesday from Walmart (WMT  -  Free Report) and Target (TGT  -  Free Report).Also on Wednesday, we look for answers from minutes released from the most recent Federal Reserve meeting, and whether there is an advancement of language articulating the winding down of $4.5 trillion on the Fed’s balance sheet, even as chances of a new rate hike in September are close to nil at this point. Will working off this massive debt be postponed or stalled in any way now that inflation metrics have yet to find their way into the economy as expected by this time? Questions, questions everywhere.Mark VickerySenior EditorQuestions or comments about this article and/or its author? Click here>>

3267,TGT,"Shares of several major U.S. department store chains plummeted on Thursday after Macy’s (M  -  Free Report), which often acts as the sector’s barometer, reported second-quarter earnings that showed further year-over-year declines.Other retailers reported their second-quarter results and have since seen their stock prices fall. Although Kohl’s KSS and Dillard’s DDS beat some Wall Street estimates, weak sales figures continued, which prompted investors to run in fear on Thursday morning.Macy'sMacy’s (M  -  Free Report) reported earnings $0.48 cents per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.45 a share. The company posted revenue of $5.55 billion, beating our Zacks estimate of $5.5 billion. Still, the revenue figure marked a 5.4% decline year-over-year.The nation's largest department store chain reported a 2.8% drop off in established store sales in the second quarter. The Cincinnati-based company now projects full-year earnings of $2.90 to $3.15 a share, and Macy’s expects sales will fall between 3.2% and 4.3%.”I’m encouraged by the second quarter and we’re on track for the year,” Macy’s CEO Jeffrey Gennette said on a conference call. “But I also know that we operate in an environment of intense and destructive competition, and that our customer has more shopping options than ever.”Macy’s stock was up slightly premarket. However, the initial positivity based on earnings and revenue beats has been countered with extreme pessimism in the once-powerful retail giant. Shares of Macy’s fell 9.18% in morning trading to reach a new 52-week intraday trading low of $20.85 per share.Kohl’sKohl’s (KSS) reported earnings of $1.24 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.19 and up 49% from the year-ago period. The company posted revenues of $4.14 billion, which just beat our Zacks estimate. Kohl’s revenues fell by 0.9% year-over-year.The department store chain’s comparable store sales were down 0.4%, which is up from the 2.7% decline the company experienced in the first quarter.”The improvement in our sales trend was driven entirely by an improvement in traffic,” Kohl’s CEO Kevin Mansell said on a conference call.Still, despite some signs of improvement, shares of Kohl’s fell 6.42% on Thursday. The stock has already traded hands over 12 million times, well above its 4.6 million average volume.Dillard's Dillard’s (DDS) reported a quarterly loss of $0.58 cents per share, which management attributed to markdowns. The company reported earnings of $0.35 a share in the year-ago period.The company posted $1.46 billion in revenue, which marked a 1.7% decline year-over-year, even though it beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.42 billion.Dillard's merchandise sales dropped by 1% to roughly $1.39 billion. Comparable-store merchandise sales were also down 1% from the year-ago period.Shares of Dillard’s sank 14.64% on Thursday on the back of its less-than impressive second-quarter results.Other Department Stores Macy’s often has the power to swing the whole retail sector when it reports, as it showed last quarter. Now, on the back of the department and retail giant’s second-quarter earnings, other retail chains have felt the hit.Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS  -  Free Report) stock plummeted 7.37% to hit a new 52-week intraday low of $33.49 per share.Shares of American Eagle (AEO  -  Free Report) dropped by 5.4% on Thursday, while Target (TGT  -  Free Report) fell 3.96%. Nordstrom (JWN  -  Free Report) and The Gap (GPS  -  Free Report) stock both dipped by roughly 2%. Shares of Wal-Mart (WMT  -  Free Report) sunk just under 1%.Retail sector EFTs also fell on Thursday. Shares of the SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT  -  Free Report) fell 2.39%, while the Direxion Daily Retail Bull 3x Shares ETF (RETL  -  Free Report) dropped 5.49%.The Amplify Online Retail ETF (IBUY  -  Free Report), VanEck Vectors Retail ETF (RTH  -  Free Report), and PowerShares Dynamic Retail Portfolio ETF (PMR  -  Free Report) all fell marginally as well.One Simple Trading IdeaSince 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year.

Lauderdale/Miami area.The office supply company will offer same-day delivery in the three areas with help from Deliv, a third-party provider. Customers can schedule same-day delivery through Office Depot’s website and request a delivery between specific, pre-set times depending upon the time they shop.Same-day delivery service will launch on August 28th in Atlanta and Los Angeles and on September 6th in the Ft.

3269,TGT,"Wal-Mart (WMT  -  Free Report) has announced changes to its U.S. food leadership team in an internal memo on Friday, reports Reuters. Executive Vice President Charles Redfield said Wal-Mart is working to position leaders from the company in new roles to make the company more competitive.One such change is for Shawn Baldwin, senior vice president and general merchandise manager for produce and global food sourcing. He will begin to focus on a new initiative for Hispanic customers. Martin Mundo, who has worked for Wal-Mart in Argentina, will replace Baldwin.Earlier this month, Target Corporation (TGT  -  Free Report) CEO Brian Cornell said that Hispanic customers are shopping less this year. “They are staying at home,” Cornell said. “They are going out less often. Particularly around border towns in the United States, you’re seeing a change in behavior.”The memo did not elaborate on the new initiative, but it seems Wal-Mart is facing similar issues with its Hispanic customers.Wal-Mart will also split leadership in its bakery and deli departments. Kerry Robinson used to be in charge of both the bakery and deli business, but now will just oversee the bakery while Tyler Lehr will take over the company’s deli services.The company announced leadership changes in its merchandising operations in a separate memo sent on Friday. One such change for Wal-Mart is the company naming Greg Hall as senior vice president of merchandise operation for food.The retail giant has made this move at a time when grocery companies are competing heavily for consumers. German grocery chain Lidl opened its first U.S. stores last month and plans to have 100 open by the summer of 2018. Aldi, another grocery store competitor, recently announced expansion plans to open 900 additional stores over the next five years. Both chains offer low prices similar to Wal-Mart.Wal-Mart’s leadership changes also follow Amazon.com’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) purchase of Whole Foods  for $13.7 billion. While Amazon has experimented with food delivery through its Prime Fresh grocery delivery service, the retail giant’s acquisition of Whole Food suggests a full investment into food and grocery services.While Wal-Mart dominates brick-and-mortar retail, Amazon has a superior online presence. Amazon’s purchase of Whole Foods could threaten Wal-Mart’s current position.Time will tell if these leadership shake-ups make a difference for Wal-Mart in the long run.More Stock News: 8 Companies Verge on Apple-Like RunDid you miss Apple's 9X stock explosion after they launched their iPhone in 2007?

3271,TGT,"Target (TGT  -  Free Report)It has been a very challenging operating environment for retailers and very few of them have been immune to the Amazon effect. For Target, some of the recent initiatives to compete with Amazon appear to be working.The company reported better than expected yesterday, beating on both the top and bottom lines. They also raised their guidance for the year.Their efforts to improve their e-commerce operations and lower prices helped them.  Comparable digital sales were up 32% in the quarter, up from 16% in the same quarter a year ago.Foot traffic also improved at the stores.

3272,TGT,"Ahead of today’s opening bell, stock futures are once again up, even as domestic news cycles deliver drama and tension regarding the recent words and actions of President Trump. An impromptu press conference yesterday saw the President double-down on his initial comments on the weekend tragedy in Charlottesville, which were heavily criticized by people on both the Left and the Right. Nevertheless, the Dow is enjoying a 3-day winning streak, although the S&P 500 and Nasdaq are down 4 of the last 6 sessions.Trump’s Chief Economic Advisor Gary Cohn said he was “disgusted and upset” by the President’s latest address. Even still, he is quoted as expecting tax reform to be on track for passage before Thanksgiving. As far as healthcare reform, Cohn said he’s “not sure where that will wind up.”More leaders from Trump’s manufacturing council are leaving in response to this continuing public relations development. Further, PayPal ((PYPL  -  Free Report)) has announced it will no longer process payments to fun “alt-right” groups, and privately-held GoDaddy has already booted alt-right website Daily Stormer from its server. However, work-arounds are already occurring among groups protesting the removal of Confederate statues, among others things (nine more such protests are reportedly scheduled for the upcoming weekend). These groups are finding the Bitcoin trade useful in this regard.Housing Starts & PermitsHousing Starts posted a disappointing headline number of -4.8% for the month of July; +0.4% had been expected. A total of 1.155 million seasonally adjusted, annualized new starts is below the 1.23 million expected, and June results were revised slightly downward as well. Consider that we’re still in the zone of warmer seasonal months, and a big negative result in new starts does demonstrate a real cooling of the new home market, near-term.Permits fell 4.1% to 1.223 million, also a disappointment; June results were revised down to 1.227 million, and these numbers represent the weakest permits data since May. These figures overall represent the topsy-turvy world of spending and consumer confidence — for every better-than-expected Retail Sales number, like yesterday, we see a headwind with the next domestic growth metric, like Starts & Permits.Target, Urban Outfitters OutperformBig-box retailer Target ((TGT  -  Free Report) posted a 3-cent beat on the bottom line ahead of the opening bell this morning to $1.23 per share. Revenues, however, missed the Zacks consensus of $16.82 billion in the quarter, reporting $16.42 billion. Nevertheless, this represents 1.6% growth in sales year over year, on 1.3% comps. The Zacks Rank #2 (Buy)-rated company was trading as high as +6% in today’s pre-market, but shares are now roughly +3.3%.Urban Outfitters ((URBN  -  Free Report)), however, is trading way up — more than 21% at this hour — following a fiscal Q2 2018 beat on both top and bottom lines. The company’s 44 cents per share outperformed the 37 cents expected, and revenues of $873 million topped the Zacks consensus estimate of $834 million. Same-store sales were also up in the quarter, and URBN shares — which had been down nearly 41% year-to-date — look to be making a nice bounce off multi-year bottoms.

3273,TGT,"Benchmarks ended mixed on Tuesday despite better than expected retail data and a de-escalation in tensions with North Korea. Weaker than expected earnings from Home Depot weighed on the Dow and pared gains for the blue-chip index. However, the Dow ended in the green following gains from American Express and Apple. The S&P 500 ended in the red overall losses in the market because of the slump in the retail sector. The Nasdaq also ended in the negative territory due to broad based losses for the markets.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) closed at 21,998.99, advancing 5.28 points or less than 0.1%. The S&P 500 Index (INX) declined 1.23 points to close at 2,464.61. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite Index (IXIC) closed at 6,333.01, increasing 7.22 points or 0.1%. Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 1,799 to 946. On the Nasdaq, decliners outnumbered advancers by a 1,671 to 1,016.Retail Sales Notch Up a Seven Month HighSales at U.S. retailers recorded their biggest increase in seven months in July. Retail sales advanced 0.6% last month, the best performance since a gain of 0.9% last December, according to the Commerce Department. Retail sales jumped 4.2% in the past twelve months, which is near the five-year average. Excluding auto and gasoline, retail sales rose 0.5% in July. In fact, excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services, retail sales went up 0.6% last month. June’s retails sales were also revised to show a 0.3% gain, in contrast to the previously reported 0.2% decline. May’s retail sales were revised up to show no change instead of the earlier report of a 0.1% dip.The lion’s share of the spurt in July retail sales was attributable to a pickup in demand for autos and to what is now a national event, Amazon Prime Day. The annual event, during which consumers flock to Amazon.com (AMZN  -  Free Report) for the year’s best shopping deals, contributed to gains for every product category. The Department of Commerce’s report reflects this as a 1.3% monthly increase in what is categorized as non-store retail spending. But for the sudden spurt in auto sales, other notable movements in the consumer spending report also have crucial linkages with Amazon. For instance, the decline in sales at electronics stores is likely a result of most consumers opting to buy this category of products from online alternatives, possibly Amazon.Amazon Fells the Traditional Retail SectorWhile Amazon did end the day around 0.1% lower, investor attention was largely fixed on the fall in traditional retail stocks. Target Corporation (TGT  -  Free Report), Nordstrom, Inc. (JWN  -  Free Report), Kohl's Corporation KSS and Dollar General Corporation (DG  -  Free Report) declined 2.6%, 1.5%, 1.5% and 3.8%, respectively. Only Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report) ended the day unscathed, notching up a minor increase of 0.1%.The Dow closed higher for the third day on Tuesday. The blue-chip index notched 45 points earlier in the day. These gains were offset by weak earnings from the retail sector. The biggest drag on the Dow was falling shares of Home Depot (HD  -  Free Report). The home-improvement company cut about 30 points from the Dow. Such a turn of events makes it amply clear that the company is not immune to “Amazonification” despite its status as a leading specialty retailer. This is particularly surprising since Do-It-Yourself (DIY) and professional customers form Home Depot’s core audience. But the move to sell Kenmore devices via Amazon indicates that even the building products behemoth is now susceptible to the rising power of the Kindle and Fire Stick maker. (Read More: Home Depot (HD  -  Free Report) Beats on Q2 Earnings & Sales Estimates August 15, 2017)Telecom, Consumer Discretionary Stocks Drag S&P 500 LowerThe S&P 500 declined on Tuesday as the telecom and consumer-discretionary sectors disappointed. Five of the eleven primary sectors ended in the red, led by consumer discretionary. The Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR (XLY) was down 0.9%. Moreover, Advance Auto Parts Inc. (AAP  -  Free Report) reported a 16.8% decline in adjusted earnings to $1.58 per share in the second quarter of fiscal 2017 (ended Jul 15, 2017) from $1.90 earned in the prior-year quarter. The figure also missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.65. Adjusted net income declined to $117 million from $141 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2016.

3274,TGT,"Target Corporation (TGT  -  Free Report) continued with its upbeat performance in fiscal 2017, as reflected from its impressive second-quarter results and an encouraging earnings outlook. Better-than-expected results propelled the shares of this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company during the pre-market trading hours that are up roughly 4%. The company’s strategic endeavors as well as improved traffic trends helped boost performance. However, in the past one month, the stock has increased 1.2% compared with the industry’s growth of 0.9%.Let’s Unveil the PictureThe company posted second-quarter adjusted earnings of $1.23 per share that came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.20 but remained flat year over year. We observed that higher sales and lower interest expense provide cushion to the bottom line.

3275,TGT,"The largest increase in retail sales in seven months failed to lift consumer sentiment substantially on Tuesday. Moreover, a selloff in traditional retail stocks followed, raising concerns over the sector’s long-term prospects. Industry watchers may hold differing views on this issue, but it is becoming increasingly difficult to profit from the country's rising purchasing power using traditional retail stocks.At the same time, it is difficult to ignore that a resilient labor market, accompanied by a slow and steady rise in wages, has made U.S. consumers increasingly confident. Traditional retail stocks may have lost their luster, but there are still several other avenues to profit from rising discretionary spending. Investing in consumer discretionary stocks from domains other than retail makes for a smart move at this point.“Amazonification” EffectThe lion’s share of the spurt in July retail sales was attributable to a pickup in demand for autos and to what is now a national event, Amazon Prime Day. The annual event, during which consumers flock to Amazon.com (AMZN  -  Free Report) for the year’s best shopping deals, contributed to gains for every product category. The Department of Commerce’s report reflects this as a 1.3% monthly increase in what is categorized as non-store retail spending. But for the sudden spurt in auto sales, other notable movements in the consumer spending report also have crucial linkages with Amazon. For instance, the decline in sales at electronics stores is likely a result of most consumers opting to buy this category of products from online alternatives, possibly Amazon.Home Depot Leads Retail SlideWhile Amazon did end the day around 0.1% lower, investor attention was largely fixed on the fall in traditional retail stocks. Target Corporation (TGT  -  Free Report), Nordstrom, Inc. (JWN  -  Free Report), Kohl's Corporation (KSS  -  Free Report) and Dollar General Corporation (DG  -  Free Report) declined 2.6%, 1.5%, 1.5% and 3.8%, respectively. Only Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report) ended the day unscathed, notching up a minor increase of 0.1%.But of particular concern was a 2.7% decline in shares of The Home Depot, Inc. (HD  -  Free Report), even after it reported stellar second-quarter results and raised its guidance for the second time for the year. Such a turn of events makes it amply clear that the company is not immune to “Amazonification” despite its status as a leading specialty retailer. This is particularly surprising since Do-It-Yourself (DIY) and professional customers form Home Depot’s core audience. But the move to sell Kenmore devices via Amazon indicates that even the building products behemoth is now susceptible to the rising power of the Kindle and Fire Stick maker.Our ChoicesConsumer’s growing tendency to switch from offline to online alternatives has been apparent even in the recent past. But this is possible the first spurt in retail trade which is being partially attributed to sales derived only from Amazon.com. Clearly, the days of retail are increasingly numbered.However, this doesn’t mean that you should ignore the higher discretionary spending power of the American consumer. Several profitable alternatives from domains other than retail continue to exist. However, picking winning stocks may be difficult.This is where our VGM score comes in. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores. Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners.

3277,TGT,"Target Corporation (TGT  -  Free Report), which is trying all means to rapidly adapt to the changes in the retail ecosystem, gave investors a reason to smile. This general merchandise retailer now expects to post positive comparable sales for the first time in five quarters and envisions earnings per share to top the upper end of its guidance range of 95 cents to $1.15, when it reports second-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Aug 16.Improved sales and traffic trends witnessed during the first two months of the second quarter, prompted management to lift its forecast, which otherwise had earlier projected low-single digit decline in comparable sales. We noted that comparable sales had decreased 1.3% in the first quarter of fiscal 2017, following declines of 1.5%, 0.2% and 1.1% in the fourth, third and second quarters of fiscal 2016.Target’s encouraging outlook was enough to propel the shares that increased 4.8% yesterday. However, of late the stock came under pressure following the news of Whole Foods Market, Inc.’s  buyout by Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report). We notice that in the past one month the stock has decreased 3.9% compared with the Zacks categorized Retail-Discount & Variety industry’s decline of roughly 9.9%.What Else Should You Know?The retail landscape has been witnessing a sea change with the focus gradually shifting to online shopping. Nevertheless, retailers are focusing more on enhancing omni-channel capabilities, optimizing store fleet and restructuring activities, and Target is no exception.Focus on Omni-channel & Merchandise AssortmentsWe believe that Target’s initiatives such as the development of omni-channel capacities, diversification and localization of assortments bode well. The company intends to deploy resources to significantly develop its online platform as well as store facilities to make shopping more convenient for customers.The company plans to expand its merchandise assortments with special emphasis on Style, Baby, Kids, and Wellness categories that are performing well. Moreover, management is keen on expanding the Food category. Target has also adopted an aggressive cost reduction strategy, including rationalization of supply chain, technology and process improvements.Introducing News Brands & Restock ProgramTarget intends to launch 12 new brands across its signature categories by the end of next year. This year in May, the company launched Cloud Island, an exclusive baby brand and plans to introduce four more exclusive brands across Home and Apparel in coming months. The company also rolled out Target Restock program in Minnesota that allows customers to restock their shipping box with essential items online and get them delivered at door steps by the next business day for a nominal charge. Target’s move is being viewed as an effort to compete with Amazon's Prime Pantry.Flexible Format StoresTarget continues to lay emphasis on developing flexible format stores to penetrate deeper into urban areas. The company plans to open 30 small format stores in fiscal 2017 and approximately 40 stores a year by fiscal 2019. During the first quarter of fiscal 2017, the company remodeled 21 existing stores and opened four new small format locations. It remains on track to complete the remodeling of 100 existing stores in fiscal 2017.Bottom LineTarget is leaving no stone unturned when it comes to wooing customers. The stock currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Another top-ranked stock in the space is Burlington Stores, Inc. (BURL  -  Free Report).

3278,TGT,"Just a day after online shopping giant Amazon.com (AMZN  -  Free Report) posted its biggest sales day ever thanks to its Prime Day event, big box favorite Target Corp. (TGT  -  Free Report) increased its second-quarter earnings forecast on Thursday, causing its stock to surge higher.Shares of Target are up over 3% in mid-morning trading. Retail peers have gotten a boost from the announcement as well.

Earnings are now projected to fall above the high end of its forecast range, which was 95 cents to $1.15 per share. Target said this was helped by a net tax effect related to global sourcing operations.""Following better-than-expected results in the first quarter, we've seen additional, broad-based improvement in traffic and category sales trends in the second quarter, despite continued challenges in the competitive environment,"" Target chief Brian Cornell said in a statement.""The launch of Cloud Island in May was a success, and our team will be rolling out four more exclusive brands across Home and Apparel in the next few months, in support of our plan to launch 12 new brands by the end of 2018,” he continued.Despite being caught in the middle of Amazon and Walmart’s ongoing retail war, Target has remained focused on fixing its own operational problems.

3279,TGT,"Shares of some of the world’s biggest retail companies—including Macy’s, Walmart, and Target—jumped on Tuesday, marking a rare day of positive trading for this struggling sector.Indeed, the retail space was up nearly across the board on Tuesday. Shares of the SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT  -  Free Report) were up 2.44%, while the Direxion Daily Retail Bull 3x Shares ETF (RETL  -  Free Report) skyrocketed 7.41%.The Amplify Online Retail ETF (IBUY  -  Free Report), VanEck Vectors Retail ETF (RTH  -  Free Report), and PowerShares Dynamic Retail Portfolio ETF (PMR  -  Free Report) were all up marginally.Tuesday’s retail ETF gains can be attributed to gains from some retail giants, most of which have seen their shares dip in the last year amid a shifting shopping climate.Wal-Mart (WMT  -  Free Report), Target (TGT  -  Free Report), and Kohl’s KSS all jumped over 2% on Tuesday. Nordstrom (JWN) rose 2.96%, and Macy’s (M  -  Free Report) climbed 3.72%. The Gap (GPS  -  Free Report), up 4.01%, was one of Tuesday’s biggest retail movers.Also among the day’s top movers was Dillard’s (DDS  -  Free Report), a department store chain which gained more than 7% on Tuesday after a report surfaced that suggested the stock appears to be heading for an “infinity squeeze” similar to Volkswagen’s now-legendary 2008 short squeeze (read more: Dillard's Stock Soars on Report of Imminent ""Infinity Squeeze"").Still, despite today’s upward movement, talk of Amazon’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) apparent takeover of the entire retail world aren’t likely to stop just yet.It is true that the industry has been shaken and most likely altered forever by Jeff Bezos’ behemoth.

3280,TGT,"""The four most dangerous words in investing are: 'this time it's different.'"" - Sir John TempletonThe above quote pretty much defines the nature of the stock market. Well, the Retail – Wholesale space is no exception, as the sector has been constantly struggling to keep pace with the evolving consumer trends. Consumers’ rapid shifts to online shopping have hit retailers hard, by affecting their top line. Consequently, retailers are in the process of switching from their traditional store concept to the new and attractive omni-channel concept.This in turn has led to intensifying industry competition, which in turn remains a threat for margins. Additionally, unfavorable U.S. retail sales data for the month of June raise doubts over the expected rebound in the economy in the second half of 2017.Retail Won’t Let You DownOn the contrary, the rebound in oil prices from all-time lows, improving job scenario and a gradual improvement in the housing market signal chances of recovery. Moreover, the Retail – Wholesale sector registered an increase of 15.6% so far this year, compared with the S&P 500 market’s growth of 10%. While this outperformance underscores the sector’s fundamental strength, it is difficult to ignore the aforementioned industry hurdles. Thus, investors are bound to feel perplexed.However, even amid such uncertainties in the retail industry, investors can still profit. All investors need to do is use the right strategies and strike the correct balance.Safeguard Your Portfolio – Invest in Dividend StocksTo fight the odds, we suggest investing in dividend stocks. Adding dividend stocks to ones portfolio is always a good decision. These stocks not only provide a steady return for countering short-term market challenges but also help to stay afloat in the long term as well.Further, dividend stocks are generally less volatile than non-dividend stocks and proven long-term outperformers. Thus, investors should simply resort to by picking stocks that have the potential to pay steady dividends.4 Retail Stocks You Can’t MissAll said, we used our Zacks Stock Screener to discover three Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stocks in the retail industry with dividend yields of at least 2.5%. Well, some of these stocks also flaunt a favorable Growth Style Score, thus doubling the treat. Well, our research shows that a Growth Style Score of ‘’A’’ or ‘’B’.’ when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 offer the best opportunities in the growth investing space. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Minneapolis-based Target Corporation (TGT  -  Free Report) is one solid bet, which has a dividend yield of about 4.6%. This departmental store retailer has been actively managing its capital and returning much of its free cash via share repurchases and dividends. In the last reported quarter, Target repurchased shares worth $305 million and paid dividends of $332 million and plans to invest between $2–$2.5 billion of capital in fiscal 2017 and more than $7 billion over the next three years.Flaunting a Growth style score of B, Target’s earnings have outperformed our estimate by an average of 16.5% in the trailing four quarters. Target has gained 5.6% in the last month, as against the Zacks categorized Retail – Discount & Variety industry’s dip of 1.7%.Investors can also look at Barnes & Noble, Inc. , which has a Growth Score of A. Based in New York, the company is engaged in the retail sale of trade books, mass market paperbacks, children's books, off-price bargain books and magazines. Notably, Barnes & Noble has dividend yield of a solid 8.2%, and long-term EPS growth of 10%.The company, which spent $23 million in share repurchases and $44 million in dividend payments in fiscal 2017, plans to maintain its practice of paying dividends regularly in future as well. Well, the company has surged 12.3% over the last month, when the Retail – Miscellaneous industry dropped 4.2%.We also suggest investing in Fastenal Company (FAST  -  Free Report), which has outperformed our earnings estimate by an average of 1.8% in the trailing four quarters. Based in Minnesota, Fastenal is a national wholesale distributor of industrial and construction supplies. The company paid dividends worth $92.5 million in the last reported quarter, alongside incurring $56.7 million in share buybacks.Further, management’s confidence in its ability to continue with dividend payments reflects the company’s sound liquidity position. With a dividend yield of roughly 3%, Fastenal has long-term EPS growth rate of 16%. While Fastenal has gained just 0.5% over the last one month, it has fared better than the Zacks categorized Building Products – Retail industry’s drop of 3%.  The Bottom LineDividend payments and share buybacks not only reflect a company’s sound financial status but it also speaks about its commitment toward investors.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

3281,TGT,"Dollar Tree Inc. (DLTR  -  Free Report) seems to be gaining traction since the past one month, after the decline witnessed following the dismal earnings report in May and soft fiscal 2017 view. Notably, the stock recovered to decline only 5.7% in the last one month compared with the 10.8% fall recorded in the last three months.Further, the Chesapeake, VA-based discount store retailer has outperformed the Zacks categorized Retail – Discount Stores industry’s fall of 9.9% in the last one month. Though Dollar Tree is yet to take flight, let’s take a close look at some factors that have aided recovery.Robust Comps PerformanceDollar Tree has displayed remarkable comparable-store sales (comps) growth driven by its competitive pricing and strategic store expansion plans, including remodeling and relocations. The company’s positive comps trend continued in first-quarter fiscal 2017, which marked its 37th straight quarter of comps growth. The first-quarter comps growth was backed by improved transaction count and average ticket. Moreover, the company anticipates comps growth in the range of slightly positive to low-single digit increase in the second quarter and fiscal 2017.Strategic Growth InitiativesFurther, we believe the company is on track with its long-term growth initiatives, which include store expansion strategies, enhancement of store productivity, creating new store formats, tapping of new markets and incorporating innovative sales channels to serve patrons better. Further, the company continues to implement strategies such as increasing consumables mix, rolling out freezers/coolers at stores along with multi-price point expansion, aimed at boosting top-line performance. Additionally, it is focusing on imported goods, supply chain efficiency and aggressive cost cuts to improve operating margin.Store Expansion StrategyRegarding stores, the company leverages an extensive network of stores to effectively penetrate targeted markets, enabling it to generate healthy sales and gain market share. During first-quarter fiscal 2017, the company opened 164 new stores and expanded or relocated 51 stores. With this, the company remains on track to operate over 10,000 Dollar Tree and over 15,000 Family Dollar outlets across the U.S.Family Dollar IntegrationThe company is also well on track with Family Dollar’s integration, which it had acquired in Jul 2015. The company is set to undertake store renovation initiatives for Family Dollar in the second quarter, which is likely to attract more customers. While the increased costs and cannibalization during the integration and re-banner process are expected to weigh on the company’s results for some time, it anticipates generating annual run rate synergies worth at least $300 million by the end of the third year of this acquisition.In fact, on completion of the integration, Dollar Tree is on track to become a mega U.S. discount retailer that can counter competition single handedly from retail bellwethers in the dollar-discount store segment. Further, the company will be well poised to reach out to more value-seeking consumers through a network spanning vast geographies. It will not only offer broader and multiple assortments at more compelling prices, but also will be better positioned to negotiate with suppliers which will enhance purchasing power.DeterrentsDollar Tree’s earnings missed our estimate in the last reported first-quarter fiscal 2017, after posting back-to-back surprises in the last two. Though sales improved year over year, it was somewhat impacted by delay in tax refunds and cycling of reduced SNAP benefits from last year. Moreover, management cut  fiscal 2017 earnings view.Notably, reduction in SNAP benefits has been a concern for Dollar Tree for a while now, and with chances of President Trump’s proposed food stamp cut getting passed, the situation could get worse. Trump has suggested reducing food stamps program by $193 billion, which is approximately 25% of the budget for the program. Cut in SNAP benefits is likely to hamper Dollar Tree’s performance, as people with low income will have less money to spend and could restrict their spending to low margin products.Bottom LineThough the company’s near-term performance is likely to be troubled, its long-term initiatives and the Family Dollar integration provide a positive outlook for the future. With these initiatives on the cards, we believe the company can surely overcome these near term hurdles.Aptly, Dollar Tree currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Investors looking for growth may, however, consider placing bets on Target Corp. (TGT  -  Free Report) with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), as well as Dollar General Corp. (DG  -  Free Report) and Ross Stores Inc. (ROST  -  Free Report), both carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Target has a long-term EPS growth rate of 5.4%. Moreover, the stock has seen positive estimate revisions in the last 60 days and has to its credit an average positive surprise of 16.5% in the trailing four quarters.Dollar General, with long-term EPS growth rate of 10.6%, has grown 2.1% in the last three months.Ross Stores, with long-term EPS growth rate of 10.5%, has witnessed positive estimate revisions in the last 60 days. Moreover, the company has delivered an average positive surprise of 5.8% in the trailing four quarters.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.
