20,DTE,"If you like ""The Odd Couple,"" May was your kind of market. A mix of technology stocks and defensive sectors outperformed. The tech stocks were driven by secular themes that seem able to keep growing even if the overall economy's growth is tepid.The S&P 500 gained 1.41% last month while U.S. diversified stock mutual funds inched ahead by a more modest 0.38%. Global science/technology funds and science-technology funds led sectors, advancing 5.88% on average and 4.69% respectively.Other leading sectors were more defensive. Utility funds gained 3.43% and international real estate funds tacked on 3.12%. Consumer goods funds also did well, growing 2.00%.""The technology sector did well because of across-the-board interest in cell phones, mobile devices and software,"" said Bernie Horn, a manager of $431.8 million Polaris Global Value Fund (PGVFX), an IBD Best Mutual Fund Awards winner, having outperformed the MSCI EAFE over the past one, three, five and 10 years that ended Dec. 31.Some cloud computing leaders also added to tech's showing. Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon.com (AMZN) posted gains. ""They are growing their cloud services dramatically,"" said David Chalupnik, head of equities for Nuveen Asset Management.IBD'S TAKE: Amazon has a solid 97 Composite Rating. It posted a 32.1% earnings surprise last quarter. See how its additional easy-to-understand fundamental and technical data stack up against rivals' at IBD's Stock Checkup.Defensive sectors also did well as investors sought safety amid doubts about the strength of economic growth. ""The market was having a debate,"" Chalupnik said. ""Investors aren't sure which way the economy is headed. The economic numbers that (came out) in May were mixed. The employment number was OK, but retail sales were a little light. The CPI (inflation rate) number was low for the second month in a row."" That last item is a sign that the U.S. economy is not heating up very fast.Precious metals funds, a defensive group, inched up 0.34% due to investor jitters over Washington, D.C., Horn said. ""The weekly hysteria over Trump comments regarding Russia tends to make some people think that the Federal Reserve may not be able to increase rates as expected,"" he said. ""That puts monetary policy into flux, which usually drives money into precious metals.""Large-cap growth funds gained 2.87%, leading U.S. diversified stock mutual fund categories.World equity funds easily topped U.S. stock funds with a 2.92% gain.Taxable bond funds inched up 0.64% on average. Tax-exempt funds tacked on 1.20%.Going forward, Horn expects stock markets to benefit from improving economic growth and diminished political drama. ""Notwithstanding political volatility around the world, underlying economic growth is slowly increasing,"" Horn said. ""And there's less of the uncertainty that was holding back individual and corporate spending. The U.S. elections, Brexit (the initial decision), the French election — all are in the past. The U.S. market has seen valuations rise. But outside the U.S., there are lots of great values.""Magna International (MGA), a Canada-based maker of car and truck parts, is one such name he likes. ""In an environment where competition among parts suppliers has been reduced, surviving companies like this are well-positioned to provide components whether the world goes electric or not,"" he said.And he still sees U.S. stocks that he likes. ""Quest Diagnostic (DGX) is the largest provider of medical tests in the country,"" Horn said. ""They're doing a better job of creating efficiencies in their operations, keeping costs in line.""He also likes NextEra Energy (NEE). ""It's one of the best-run utilities in the country if not the world, with a strong presence in clean fuels like natural gas and wind and solar to a lesser extent. It's not the cheapest stock, but management makes continuous improvements in their cost structure.""Horn also expects health insurers and managed care providers Anthem (ANTM) and UnitedHealth Group (UNH) to benefit from the reduction of regulatory burdens of any arrangement that replaces or reforms ObamaCare.Chalupnik sees potential for better growth from key foreign markets than the U.S. Europe, China, Japan and emerging markets are growing at decent rates, he says. ""The whole global economy is growing together,"" he said. ""It's the first time since 2010 that you could say that.""His team has overweights in materials and industrials relative to the S&P 500, although it has trimmed its overweights. It has held its energy weighting steady.Detroit Edison (DTE) illustrates his appetite for energy. ""People and businesses still need electricity,"" he said. ""It is a very well run utility. It has good management, a good regulatory environment. It delivers quarter-in, quarter-out."" In addition, the stock has a 3% dividend yield.He also likes Wal-Mart Stores (WMT). ""It's a very stable company, probably the next big growth company out there. It's one of the few retailers that's growing same-store sales. And its e-commerce business is tremendous. And it's trading at an attractive multiple.""Share price is up 15% so far this year, including a 5% gain in May. But the stock has a weak 59 Composite Rating from IBD, on a scale from 1 to 99.Douglas Burtnick, a manager of $1.8 billion Aberdeen U.S. Small Cap Equity (GSXIX), an IBD Best Mutual Funds Award winner for topping the S&P 500 over one, three, five and 10 years, likes Ellie Mae (ELLI). ""They sell software and services to banks, which help them create more efficiency around the mortgage origination process,"" he said.Ellie Mae's systems are helping to transform what has been a paper-oriented industry into a digitally focused one. ""That makes the process faster and easier,"" Burtnick said. ""Banks are willing to pay for that efficiency.""And Chalupnick likes the outlook for Lamb Weston (LW), a producer and distributor of frozen foods that was spun out of ConAgra (CAG) late last year. ""It is a relatively new company, and it is under-followed,"" he said. ""They are one of the few packaged-goods food companies that is growing its unit volume. General Mills unit volume is down (in its North American retail segment).""RELATED:Mutual Fund Managers Look For Winners In Industrials, Materials, Tech, BanksThe Painless Way To Add $140,000 To Your Retirement Account

26,DTE,"Five exchange traded funds in utilities stocks made new highs last week or are near new highs, as the sector emerges as a tempting alternative during the stock market's slump.With some of these ETFs in buy areas on their charts, investors have opportunities to invest in one of the few areas showing solid price action.Utility stocks weakened in April, as bond yields spiked. That was an unwelcome development for utilities because higher rates increase capital costs for an industry that constantly has to spend on plants and equipment. Also, higher bond yields can make utilities' dividends less attractive by comparison.But as Treasury yields started falling, utility ETFs reacted with gains in the past two weeks.The profit outlook for utilities is relatively favorable. The sector's combined profit is expected to drop 2% for the first quarter but rise about 4% for the full year, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. By both measures, earnings will be well above the S&P's total but below better-performing sectors such as consumer discretionary and health care.The sector's most popular ETF is Utilities Select Sector SPDR (XLU), which trades an average of more than 17 million shares a day. It has climbed back above its 50-day moving average and is near a new high. IShares U.S. Utilities (IDU) has traced a similar chart.Thinly traded PowerShares DWA Utilities Momentum (PUI) broke out of a flat base Wednesday and is in buy range from a 25.63 entry. The fund, which is diversified among various types of utility companies, is based on an index that emphasizes utility stocks showing relative strength, which helps explain its move to new highs.Some of DWA Utilities' top components hit new highs in the past week, including DTE Energy (DTE), WEC Energy (WEC) and American Water Works (AWK). Also, Westar Energy (WR) made a new closing high.Vanguard Utilities (VPU) touched a new high Thursday after finding support around the 50-day moving average. Investors can use that support to purchase shares. But ideally, investors would use the March breakout past a 102.68 buy point to buy the bulk of shares and use the pullback to add a smaller amount.Vanguard Utilities and Fidelity MSCI Utilities (FUTY) are both based on the same index: The MSCI U.S. Investable Market Utilities 25/50 Index.The index is more heavily weighted on Duke Energy (DUK), NextEra Energy (NEE) and Southern Co. (SO), with each representing 6% to 7% of the total fund. In fact, Utilities Select Sector SPDR and iShares U.S. Utilities (based on the Dow Jones U.S. Utilities Index) also have the same companies as top components. NextEra broke out Wednesday but is back below the 119.47 buy point.                   The IBD ETF Leaders index shows the performance of a model portfolio of exchange traded funds that are leading the overall market.

28,DTE,"Big-cap stocks are sometimes like the tortoise in the Aesop's fable ""The Tortoise and the Hare,"" lumbering along while rabbit-like growth stocks speed ahead. But sometimes, as in the fable, slow-and-steady really does win the race.Just look at the charts of Starbucks (SBUX), Reynolds American (RAI) and O'Reilly Automotive (ORLY) in recent years.IBD's Big Cap 20 column, which appears in IBD every Tuesday, showcases stocks that have solid growth potential. They must also have a market capitalization of at least $15 billion.These behemoths often trade millions of shares a day and yet give investors a chance to reap significant capital gains with less volatility than small-cap growth stocks, which can fall much faster.Furthermore, big-cap stocks often pay dividends, which can significantly boost returns over time.Top big-cap stocks should still have fundamental and technical characteristics similar to the strongest growth stocks. High-quality big caps should show good profit and sales growth, rising mutual- and hedge-fund sponsorship column has featured Reynolds American more than a dozen times this year.Both IBD Big Cap 20 and the Dividend Leaders screen have showcased Starbucks, which has given shareholders stellar returns for those patient enough to sit through a number of bases formed over the years. The coffee seller has risen nearly 600% in the five years since it broke out past a 13.34 buy point (adjusted for a 2-for-1 split) of a cup-with-handle base in the week ended Oct. 15, 2010.At the time, Starbucks had Composite and Earnings Per Share Ratings of 87 out of 99. The annualized dividend of 64 cents a share produces a 1% yield; the long-term dividend growth rate is 24%. And with a 3-year Earnings Stability Factor of 1 on a scale of 0 (stable) to 99 (wild), investors stand a reasonable chance of continuing to reap steady stock price and dividend gains.A number of real estate investment trusts and utility stocks have also fared well in recent years, as low interest rates reduced their borrowing costs and made it easier for them to invest in new power plants or assets such as apartments and hospitals.DTE Energy (DTE) and Omega Healthcare Investors (OHI) have been a fixture in the Dividend Leaders and REIT Leaders screens.DTE, an electricity and natural gas supplier that also operates gas pipelines, has been a slow-but-steady gainer since it cleared a long consolidation with a 49.16 buy point in March 2011.The stock briefly stumbled, triggering the 8% loss rule during the steep summer correction that year. However, DTE formed a new base with a 52.92 buy point and broke out again for good in December. Through a Jan. 28, 2015, high of 92.27, it gained 74%. DTE's long-term dividend growth rate is 5% and its annual dividend of $2.92 a share currently yields 3.6%.The accompanying table shows some big caps and dividend plays that have performed well so far this year.

39,DTE,"DTE Energy Company (DTE  -  Free Report) is slated to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 25, before the opening bell.Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 2.44%. DTE Energy surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 5.32%.Factors at PlayThe company’s service territories mostly witnessed colder-than-normal winters in the first quarter. In particular, Michigan had its wettest cold season on record this year, which indicates higher electricity demand. This in turn is expected to boost DTE Energy’s revenues in the quarter under review.On the bottom-line front, management expects the recent tax reform to be accretive to DTE Energy’s 2018 earnings by 10 cents. We believe part of this accretion to benefit the company’s first-quarter earnings and will duly get reflected in the form of higher quarterly earnings. In line with this, the consensus estimate for DTE Energy’s earnings of $1.89 per share for the yet-to-be-reported quarter reflects year-over-year growth of 5.6%.However, higher interest expense is expected to weigh on the company’s first-quarter results.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not show that DTE Energy will beat estimates this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: DTE Energy has an Earnings ESP of +1.15%.

40,DTE,"DTE Energy Company (DTE  -  Free Report) unveils plans to double its electricity generation capacity from renewable resources of energy in the State of Michigan by 2022. The proposal is part of the company’s 2018 Renewable Energy Plan, which was submitted to the Michigan Public Service Commission on Mar 30.  The plan is in sync with DTE Energy’s earlier announced initiative to lower carbon emissions. Notably, the company projects to achieve this goal by reducing carbon emissions from its power plants up to 30%, 45%, 75% and more than 80% by early 2020s, 2030, 2040, and 2050, respectively.If approved, these projects will enable DTE Energy to produce 2,000 megawatts (MW) of renewable electricity along with boosting investments of more than $1.7 billion in Michigan. The entire work is scheduled to be completed by 2022, post regulatory nod.2018 Renewable Energy PlanPer the recently submitted Renewable Energy Plan, DTE Energy intends to generate additional 1,000 MW of electricity from new wind and solar projects in Michigan. These projects include the company’s Pine River and Polaris wind parks, which have the combined capacity to generate 330 MW. While Pine River is expected to commence commercial operations later in 2018, Polaris will be operational in 2019.The company plans to build two wind parks by 2022 that will produce around 375 MW of electricity and begin operations in 2021 and 2022. This includes a wind project with a capacity to generate 300 MW for large commercial customers.The plan has provisions for the installation of approximately 15 MW of new Michigan-based solar capacity over the next three years, which will enhance DTE Energy’s solar capacity by almost 25%. This includes the launch of a pilot program for battery storage technology to improve the overall reliability of energy resources.Our ViewThe recent filing outlines DTE Energy’s efforts to meet Michigan's Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) that requires the state’s electricity providers to generate 15% of their retail electricity sales from renewable energy resources by 2021. Notably, the company successfully lowered its carbon emissions in the last decade up to 25%, courtesy of investments worth $2.5 billion in Michigan and the addition of 1,000 megawatts of wind and solar capacity.In fact, DTE Energy is investing steadily to enhance its renewable generation assets. Over the next 15 years, DTE Electric plans to lower coal-fired generation and boost natural gas-fired generation and renewables mix. In this context, DTE Electric retired four coal-fired generation units at its Trenton Channel, River Rouge and St. Clair facilities and announced plans to retire by 2023. The units at the Belle River and Monroe facilities are expected to be retired by 2040. These facilities will be replaced with natural gas-fired generation and renewables.Moreover, the recent tax reform has compelled the company to reduce electricity and gas rates. On Jan 23, 2018, DTE Energy announced that it has reduced its electricity and gas rates by 3% to pass on the tax savings to its customers. This is expected to widen the company’s customer base. The gains from lower tax rate will enable it to upgrade its infrastructure and invest in clean energy generation.We expect the recent developments to enable DTE Energy to achieve its target of reducing, carbon emissions by 80% in 2050 by incorporating new renewable energy projects and eventually transitioning its power sources from coal to natural gas as well as renewable.Price PerformanceDTE Energy’s shares have gained 2% in the last 12 months, against the broader industry’s decline of 2.9%. The outperformance can be attributed to the company’s disciplined capital spending program and investments to enhance renewable generation assets.Zacks Rank & Key Picks    DTE Energy carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in the same space are CenterPoint Energy (CNP  -  Free Report) and Dynegy  and Exelon Corporation (EXC  -  Free Report).

42,DTE,"Ameren Corporation (AEE  -  Free Report) subsidiary — Ameren Transmission Company of Illinois (“ATXI”) — recently received approval from the Missouri Public Service Commission (MoPSC) to proceed with the construction of the Mark Twain Transmission Project. The approval followed ATXI’s receipt of the certificate of convenience and necessity (CCN) from the MoPSC.Details of the ProjectThe transmission project is a 100-mile, 345,000-volt transmission line and substation, which will run from Palmyra to Kirksville in Missouri and north to the Iowa border. Per Ameren management, once completed, this project will accomplish a critical link in the region's energy infrastructure. The project is also expected to deliver greater energy reliability, economic growth and better access to clean energy sources to the residents of Missouri.The route will run through the Adair, Knox, Lewis, Marion and Schuyler counties of Missouri and will include the construction of the Zachary Substation adjacent to the Adair Substation in Adair. The route will co-locate on Northeast Missouri Electric Power Cooperative’s 161,000-volt line between Palmyra and Kirksville and Ameren Missouri's 161,000-volt line from Kirksville to the Iowa border.Construction of the project, worth $250 million, is expected to begin in April 2018 with a targeted in-service date of December 2019. The company plans to work with Northeast Power, landowners, county commissioners and various local and state agencies on the project.About the Mark Twain ProjectThe Mark Twain project is a MISO-approved transmission line to be built in Northeast Missouri. In the third quarter of 2017, ATXI finalized an alternative project route and reached agreements with a cooperative electric company in Northeast Missouri and Ameren Missouri to locate nearly the entire Mark Twain project on existing transmission line corridors. It also received consent for road crossings from five affected counties in Northeast Missouri. In September 2017, ATXI filed for the certificate of CCN with the MoPSC and anticipated a decision from the MoPSC in the first half of 2018. The recent approval was in line with the company’s expectation.Our ViewAmeren follows a systematic investment strategy, primarily for growth projects and infrastructure upgrades. This strategy has helped the company provide reliable services and maintain a dependable and safe transmission system which will help meet rising demand.The company’s current long-term capital-expenditure plan worth $11.2 billion comprises up to $0.6 billion of investment in ATXI. These investments will support its overall system reliability, environmental compliance and electric and natural gas utility infrastructure improvements.Missouri, being the national transportation hub for rail, river, road, and air shipments in the United States, has energy consumption per capita at the national median. Naturally, energy demand is high in the state that offers solid opportunities to companies like Ameren.Toward this end, the Mark Twain project approval will help the company deliver more reliable electricity in various regions of the state as well as cost-effective energy savings beyond new efficiency standards. This in turn will attract more customers, subsequently allowing Ameren to expand its revenue margin.Price MovementAmeren’s stock has moved up about 8.1% in a year, compared with the broader industry’s gain of 2.6%. The modernized approach and focus on increasing customer reliability might have led to the outperformance. Zacks Rank & Key PicksAmeren carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).A few better-ranked stocks from the same space are Pampa Energia S.A.

43,DTE,"Consolidated Edison, Inc.’s (ED  -  Free Report) regulated utilities help to generate earnings regularly. These utilities offer transmission and distribution with limited commodity exposure as most electric and gas supply costs are passed on to customers.Moreover, the company is investing strategically for developing infrastructure. To this end, the company plans to invest approximately $11.1 billion in the 2017-2019 time frame. Roughly 84% of the investment has been allocated for regulated utility operations.Consolidated Edison is also spending prudently to enhance renewable generation assets. The company is gradually converting some of its operations to gas, which is environmental friendly. As of Sep 30, 2017, Consolidated Edison had renewable generating capacity of 1,291 megawatts (MW), up from 2016-end level of 1,098 MW.Coming to its earnings performance, Consolidated Edison delivered a positive earnings surprise in two of the last four quarters, with an average beat of 0.06%. Notably, the company’s Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 earnings is $4.26, reflecting an annual improvement of 4.3%.Further, the company maintains a stable liquidity level backed by a strong cash generation capacity, which in turn enables it to follow a disciplined capital spending program. Buoyed by the solid cash balance position, the company's shares have outperformed the broader industry over a year. Evidently, Consolidated Edison’s share price has rallied 9.9% compared with its industry’s gain of 3.8%.  On the flip side, Consolidate Edison faces interest rate risk owing to variable rate debt and new debt financing which is needed to fund capital requirements, including the construction expenditures of the Utilities and maturing debt securities. Management estimates that as of Sep 30, 2017, the company witnessed a 10% increase in interest rates due to variable rate debt which might result in an increase in annual interest expense of $2 million.Moreover, Consolidated Edison is overvalued compared to its broader industry in terms of EV/EBITDA multiple. Evidently, the EV/EBITDA multiple for the company stands at 10.52, while that for the broader industry is 10.43. The company also faces commodity price risk related to the purchase and sale of its electricity, gas and related derivative instruments.Zacks Rank & Key PicksConsolidated Edison carriesa Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in the same space are DTE Energy Company (DTE  -  Free Report), Atlantic Power Corporation (AT  -  Free Report) and WEC Energy Group, Inc.

44,DTE,"WGL Holdings, Inc.’s , subsidiary Washington Gas, has announced plans to file recommendations with state regulatory commissions, in the District of Columbia, Maryland, and Virginia for reducing natural gas rates for 1.1 million customers it serves in this region.The rate filing aim to reduce customer rates, which is expected to lower annual customer bills by approximately $34 million, beginning in the first quarter of 2018. This development will certainly be a relief for customers as the company earlier expected up to 18% increase in heating bills compared with last winter due to the mild weather last year.What Led to the Decision?The unit’s decision to file for rate decline is a result of the federal tax savings that the company expects to attain in future.WGL Holdingsanticipates realizing the federal tax savings on the back of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, a law that was passed on Dec 22, 2017. The law came into effect on Jan 1, 2018. Going ahead, Washington Gas will bear only 21% of corporate income tax, which is significantly lower than its previous tax rate of 35%.A 14% cut in federal income tax means that the company will naturally be able to save up considerable amount in tax savings. This 169-year old utility company has been working relentlessly to provide quality services to customer at best possible prices. Sharing tax reduction benefit will allow its customers to enjoy reliable services at a reduced price.How is WGL Gaining?The company’s decision to propose a rate slash in customer bill is a clear indication of its commitment in retaining the large customer base. We have witnessed reliable results on the back of customer additions in the past, which can be evidenced from 16,689 customer additions during fiscal 2017, compared with year-ago period. In fact, high customer additions along with investment initiatives, must have aided the company to deliver positive surprise of 8.5% during in fiscal 2017.For the past six years, the company has invested $100 million annually on an average in the form of investments in the energy systems. The company is currently equipped with 235 generation projects in the US, representing approximately 145 megawatts (MW) in service, with additional 66 MW under construction. These factors will aid the company in delivering growth targets and position it in meeting the increasing needs of its expanding customer base.Price MovementShares of WGL Holdings have outperformed the industry in the last three months. The company’s shares gained 1.3%, against the industry’s decline of 1.4%. Such outperformance can be attributed to the company’s performance during fiscal year ended Sep 30, 2017, that benefited strongly owing to higher customers among other factors.Zacks Ranks & Key PicksWGL Holdings currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

45,DTE,"DTE Energy Company (DTE  -  Free Report) follows a disciplined capital spending program to maintain and upgrade the reliability of its electric utility systems with $6.5-billion investment planned over the next 10 years. Notably, DTE Electric’s total investment is expected to be $18 billion over the next 10 years.Moreover, the company is investing steadily to enhance its renewable generation assets. Over the next 15 years, DTE Electric plans to withdraw a portion of its coal-fired generation and boost the natural gas-fired generation and renewables mix.Further, the company aims at constructing natural gas turbine plants to provide approximately 1,100 megawatts of energy from the beginning of 2022. Apart from natural gas, the company plans to continue investing in wind and solar to maintain a balanced portfolio. In September 2016, MPSC approved DTE Energy’s two 150 megawatt wind projects.

46,DTE,"The year 2018 has just started and this is the right time to look into utilities as an investment option. Staying invested in fundamentally strong and domestic-focused utility stocks assure investors a steady performance and regular dividends. These highly regulated capital intensive stocks are subject to heavy regulation, both at the federal and state levels. Utility business is known for stability and visibility of its earnings and cash flow.Over the last few years, we have noticed that utilities are gradually changing their preference of fuels to produce electricity. In the United States, natural gas currently contributes the largest portion of the fuel mix, removing coal from the top spot.Utilities, apart from investing in generating plants that produce electricity with low and negligible amounts of emissions, are also focused in improving transmission and distribution networks. Utilities are also investing in power storage facilities and guiding investors for efficient usage of electricity. They are also undertaking plans to shift the transmission lines underground in weather sensitive areas to lower chances of power outages.Natural gas utilities depend on pipelines to deliver their product to the end users. Water utilities are also required to upgrade and replace old pipelines and water mains. So, to upgrade and strengthen the existing infrastructure, utilities depend on capital markets.These capital intensive utilities therefore routinely take recourse to capital markets to meet the above requirements. Though regulated utilities are cash generators, the funds generated from internal sources are not sufficient to carry out long-term projects. Utilities have been benefiting from the rock-bottom interest rate environment. However, the Fed raised interest rates four times in the last five quarters (December 2016, March 2017, June 2017 and December 2017), which will certainly hurt utilities.The rise in interest cost will no doubt increase cost of capital for utilities and might limit their ability to pay dividends and buy back shares. These developments could lower attractiveness of utilities and investors might turn to bonds as an alternative source of investment.Weather continues to impact the operation of utility services. Hurricanes in Texas and Florida have adversely impacted normal operation of the utilities operating in the region. Even with efficient work of a large team of workers it took weeks to bring back services at normal levels. The results of the utilities were adversely impacted by disruption of normal services.Per the Bureau of Economic Analysis, GDP rose 3.3% in the third quarter of 2017, up from 3.1% in the second quarter. The improvement in GDP is expected to continue in 2018 as well.All other industries depend on utilities for the basic requirements of electricity, gas and water. The ongoing growth will result in higher demand from industrial, commercial and residential space for utility services and boost its performance.Repeal of Clean Power Plan: Impact on UtilitiesHistorically, electric utilities have heavily relied on coal for a large part of power generation, which has become a big challenge for the group in these times of enhanced environmental awareness. In line with this, in August 2015, President Obama introduced the Clean Power Plan to lower emissions levels from electricity generation by around 32% by 2030 from 2005 levels.President Trump acted on his pre-election promises and has taken steps toward repealing the Clean Power Plan. Trump believes that such plans will make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive in the global markets. This new development will help in running the coal fired electricity generation units for a longer period than previously expected.Per a U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) release, the overall emission of carbon dioxide declined 1.7% in 2016 and 0.8% in 2017 due to initiatives undertaken by the utilities. According to EIA carbon dioxide emission is likely to rise 1.8% in 2018, due to higher coal usage. However, utilities are overall focusing on sources on fuel that helps to lower emission levels. Utilities like NextEra Energy (NEE  -  Free Report) and Dominion Energy Inc. (D  -  Free Report), among others, have already invested and plan to spend more to create green energy generation portfolio.Zacks Industry Rank - NegativeWithin the Zacks Sector classification, utilities are a stand-alone sector, one of 16 Zacks sectors. The rural wire-line telephone companies are also grouped within the Zacks Utility sector, but the three major industries within this sector include Electric Power, Gas Distribution and Water Supply.We rank the 265 sub-industries in the 16 Zacks sectors based on the earnings outlook and fundamental strength of the constituent companies in each industry. We put our industries in two groups — the top half (industries with the best average Zacks Rank) and the bottom half (the industries with the worst average Zacks Rank). Over the last 10 years, using a one-week rebalance, the top half beat the bottom half by a factor of more than two to one. To learn more visit: About Zacks Industry Rank.)All three industries related to the utility sector — Gas Distribution, Electric Power and Water Supply — fall in the second group, having the Zacks Industry Rank of #161, #202 and #212, respectively.Our present outlook for the utility sector is negative, with all the major industries placed in the second group of the Zacks Industry Rank.Utility Trading at Mid-RangeThe valuation of the sector (Considering Gas Distribution, Water Supply and Electric Power industry) looks attractive at present. The Water Supply industry is currently trading at 19.7x forward 12-month EPS estimates, Gas Distribution industry is trading at 21.6x while Electric Power industry is trading at 12.4x, compared with S&P 500 trading average of 19.8x.The current 21.6x multiple for Gas Distribution companies compares to the five-year range of 16.6x to 24.6x (median of 20.3x) while 19.7x multiple for Water Utilities compares to five-year multiple ranged from a low of 12.4x to a high of 23.3x (median of 18.6x). The current 12.4x multiple for Electric Utilities compares to a five-year range of 11.5x to 16.4x (median of 13.9x).The above study shows that the current multiples are within the five-year ranges, but are trading above its median level (except Electric Power) and offers some room for increase from the current levels.Earnings Review & OutlookThird-quarter earnings in the utility space were down 3.6% due to a 2.1% drop in revenues. Inconsistent weather and hurricanes impacted their performance.However, cost control, new electric rates and customer growth will help the utility sector to come up with earnings growth in the fourth-quarter reporting cycle. Fourth-quarter earnings from the utility sector are expected to improve 4.9% on the back of revenue growth of 3.2%.The domestic defensive Utility sector’s earnings in 2018 is expected to improve 4.8%, on the back of revenue growth of 1.5%.

49,DTE,"ONEOK Inc. (OKE  -  Free Report) announced that it is going to issue 19 million shares and expects gross proceeds from the issue, before deducting offering expenses, to be nearly $1.0355 billion. The company will allow the underwriters of the issue to purchase up to 2.85 million additional common shares to cover over-allotments, if necessary.The company has plans to utilize the net proceeds from the equity issue to fund capital expenditures — including a portion of its recently announced natural gas liquids growth projects — to pre-fund additional projects, which are in the late stages of development. It also aims to use the proceeds for general corporate purposes, which may include repaying a portion of outstanding indebtedness.Reasons Behind the IssueAt the end of third-quarter 2017, the diluted outstanding shares of the company were 383.4 million. With the fresh issue of equity, the total diluted outstanding shares will go beyond 400 million.It is a well-documented fact that utilities are capital intensive companies and are in constant need of funds.  At present, debt to capital of ONEOK is 59.46%, which is higher than the industry ratio of 47.77%. So, rising debt burden would further increase interest expenses. In addition, its current ratio is 0.55, much lower than the S&P 500 average of 1.35. Interest rates have increased four times in last five quarters, which will definitely make borrowing costlier than before.So ONEOK had to depend on the equity holders to get additional funds to carry on its capital projects and lower its debt levels.Capital Projects ONEOK, at present, has nearly $2.5-$3.5 billion of capital projects under development, which include Natural gas and NGL pipelines and development of export infrastructure. Most of the capital projects, which are underway, already have some degree of commitments from its customers.  The completed projects will be accretive to earnings and further strengthen performance of the company.Price MovementShares of the company have returned 6.8% in the last six months compared with the Zacks Gas Distribution industry’s rally of 1.4%.ONEOK has already completed projects worth $9 billion between 2006 and 2016 in highly productive regions, which is driving the performance of the company.Zacks Rank & Key PicksONEOK currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

51,DTE,"Sales growth is an important metric for any company, as it is a vital part of growth projections and instrumental in strategic decision making. By monitoring this key metric over multiple time periods, one can understand a company’s growth trend.Sales growth is essential to justify the fixed and variable expenses incurred to operate a business. Low revenues lead to an unprofitable business and dismal financial performance. Stagnant companies may generate near-term profit, but can’t register enough growth to attract new investors.Also, in a growing economy, lack of sales growth shows that the company is not gaining market share over its competitors. In simple terms, some sustained sales growth is necessary to support the bottom line.Focusing solely on sales growth is not enough though. A healthy sales growth rate is certainly a positive indicator for picking good stocks, but it does not ensure profits. So, taking into consideration a company’s cash position along with its sales number can prove to be a more dependable investment strategy.Substantial cash on hand and a steady cash flow provide the company with more flexibility in relation to business decisions and potential investments. Cash also enables a company to endure market downturns. Most importantly, a sufficient cash position indicates that revenues are being channelized in the right direction.Choosing the Winning StocksIn order to shortlist stocks that have witnessed impressive sales growth along with a high cash balance, we have selected 5-Year Historical Sales Growth (%) greater than X-Industry and Cash Flow greater than $500 million as our main screening parameters.But sales growth and cash strength are not the absolute criteria for selecting stocks. So, we added certain other factors to arrive at a winning strategy.Price-to-Sales (P/S) Ratio less than X-Industry: This metric determines the value placed on each dollar of a company’s revenues. The lower the ratio, the better it is for picking a stock since the investor is paying less for each unit of sales.% Change F1 Sales Estimate Revisions (4 Weeks) greater than X-Industry: Better-than-industry estimate revision has often been seen to trigger an increase in the stock price.Operating Margin (Average Last 5 years) greater than 5%: Operating margin measures how much every dollar of a company's sales translates into profits. A high ratio indicates that the company has good cost control and sales are increasing faster than costs, an optimal situation for the company.Return on Equity (ROE) greater than 5%: This metric will ensure that sales growth is translated into profits and the company is not hoarding cash. A high ROE means the company is spending wisely and is in all likelihood profitable.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Here are five of the nine stocks that qualified the screening:Based in Bethesda, MD, CBRE Group, Inc.  operates as a commercial real estate services and investment company.

52,DTE,"In the current market scenario with changing customer preferences and habits, evolving needs, demographic changes and an extremely competitive environment, maintaining steady sales growth is the key to survival for any business. Companies are always looking for ways to boost their marketing initiatives to drive sales.Revenues are often more closely monitored than earnings at the time of assessing the growth of a business. It’s worth keeping in mind that in cases when companies incur a loss, albeit transitorily, they are valued on their revenues, as top-line growth (or decline) is usually an indicator of a company’s future performance. Therefore, the Price-to-Sales (P/S) ratio can turn out to be a suitable metric for stock valuation. It remains a key stock selection criteria keeping in mind that management usually has limited opportunities to tamper with revenues as they can with earnings. Thus, the P/S ratio is subject to lesser manipulation than the Price-to-Earnings ratio.  Sales growth in isolation is, however, not enough. Consideration of a company’s cash position along with its sales number can be a more dependable strategy. Substantial cash in hand and a steady cash flow give a company more flexibility with respect to business decisions and investments.Choosing the Winning StocksIn order to shortlist stocks that have witnessed impressive sales growth along with a high cash balance, we have selected 5-Year Historical Sales Growth (%) greater than X-Industry and Cash Flow greater than $500 million as our main screening parameters.But sales growth and cash strength are not the absolute criteria for selecting stocks. So, we added certain other factors to arrive at a winning strategy.Price-to-Sales (P/S) Ratio less than X-Industry: This metric determines the value placed on each dollar of a company’s revenues. The lower the ratio, the better it is for picking a stock since the investor is paying less for each unit of sales.% Change F1 Sales Estimate Revisions (4 Weeks) greater than X-Industry: Better-than-industry estimate revision has often been seen to trigger an increase in the stock price.Operating Margin (Average Last 5 years) greater than 5%: Operating margin measures how much every dollar of a company's sales translates into profits. A high ratio indicates that the company has good cost control and sales are increasing faster than costs, an optimal situation for the company.Return on Equity (ROE) greater than 5%: This metric will ensure that sales growth is translated into profits and the company is not hoarding cash. A high ROE means the company is spending wisely and is in all likelihood profitable.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.

53,DTE,"New highs have become commonplace in today’s bull market. Time and time again, investors have profited by jumping on a stock as it hits a peak, only to ride that stock even higher.

71,DTE,"Sempra Energy (SRE  -  Free Report) is set to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 30, before the market opens.Last quarter, the company posted a positive earnings surprise of 37.50%. Moreover, it surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 14.78%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that Sempra Energy may beat earnings estimates because it has the right combination of two key components.Zacks Rank: Sempra Energy currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Note that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings.  You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Zacks ESP: Sempra Energy has an Earnings ESP of +0.72%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at $1.06, higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.05. A favorable Zacks ESP serves as a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.The combination of Sempra Energy’s Zacks Rank #3 and a positive ESP make us reasonably confident of a positive earnings beat.Please note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Factors at PlayAt the onset of the third quarter, Sempra Energy’s Mexican unit IEnova secured a liquid fuels project worth $155 million from the Mexican authority. Per the terms, IEnova will construct a receipt, storage and send-out liquid fuels marine terminal on the Mexican Gulf Coast. This deal will expand business operations for IEnova in Mexico by exploiting the booming energy market in the region.We believe impacts from this project to get reflected in the company’s third-quarter sales growth. In line with this, the Zacks Consensus estimate for Sempra Energy’s third-quarter revenues is pegged at $2.78 billion, displaying a 9.5% annual upside.Moreover, Sempra Energy faces foreign exchange exposure in Mexcio and South America, wherein it does not hedge additional costs. These might weigh on the company’s quarterly earnings. Nevertheless, during second-quarter earnings call, management declared that it expects to gain $30 million of additional hedge income in the second half of the year, which in turn will largely offset its year-to-date foreign exchange losses in Mexico. Surely, this additional hedge income will have a partial favorable impact on the company’s to-be-reported quarterly result.Further, the Aliso Canyon gas leak event lead to an estimated loss of $832 million for the company by the end of the second quarter, higher than the prior-quarter figure. On a bright note, Sempra Energy received approval to reinstate natural gas injections at the Aliso Canyon storage field. However, management has expressed concern in relation to system reliability for resuming these gas injections this summer and in the coming winter given the limitations on targeted gas storage levels.A disciplined cost-management system has been driving Sempra Energy’s earnings. In line with this, for the third quarter, our consensus estimate for the company’s earnings is pegged at $1.05, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 2.7%.Sempra Energy Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Sempra Energy Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Sempra Energy QuoteStocks That Warrant a LookHere are some other players in the Utility sector that also have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.NiSource, Inc.

74,DTE,"Canadian energy distributor Enbridge Inc. (ENB  -  Free Report) is planning to finish its Ohio to Ontario Nexus natural gas pipeline in the third quarter of 2018. To build the pipeline, the company has partnered with Detroit-based electric utility DTE Energy Company (DTE  -  Free Report).The project's construction received approval from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) a few days back. The regulatory approval will ensure that the project stays on track. In July 2017, the partnership estimated that it would take seven to 10 months to build the pipeline after receiving FERC approval for the project.About the PipelineThe $2 billion Nexus natural gas pipeline will be 255 miles long, of which 47 miles will be in Michigan and 208 miles in Ohio. It will have a transportation capacity of 1.5 billion cubic feet of gas per day. The pipeline will carry natural gas from West Virginia and the Marcellus and Utica shale in Ohio, Pennsylvania to Eastern Canada and the Midwest of the United States.The pipeline will meet growing natural gas demand in Ohio, Michigan, Chicago and Ontario, Canada. The pipeline will carry Appalachian shale gas to high-demand markets, which will be used for cleaner power generation, industrial and commercial use. Household usage also creates a huge demand for the natural gas in the region. Moreover, the company expects the project to create 6,800 jobs.About EnbridgeHeadquartered in Calgary, Alberta, Enbridge is a leading energy infrastructure company. One of its businesses is the transportation of energy through the most extensive and advanced crude and liquids pipeline system that is spread across 17,511 miles globally. Through the Mainline and Express pipelines, the company transports 2.8 million barrels of crude every day, which accounts for almost 68% of the Canadian crude oil production that is transported to the United States.In Canada, the company is touted to be the largest natural gas distributer. Hence, it is quite obvious that a significant portion of the company’s earnings is generated from transportation operations, driven by a string of long-term contracts. The substantial contract base will likely provide the company with stable cash flow in the coming years.However, the persistently weak oil and natural gas prices have resulted in lower production in 2016 compared with the massive volumes of 2015. This could lead to decreased demand for new midstream infrastructure assets like oil and gas pipeline facilities, which might hurt cash generation for Enbridge.Price PerformanceEnbridge has lost 1.5% of its value year to date against 2.9% growth of its industry.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderEnbridge currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the oil and energy sector are Enbridge Energy, L.P. (EEP  -  Free Report) and Par Pacific Holdings, Inc. (PARR  -  Free Report). Both sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

80,DTE,"The Q2 earnings season is gradually unfolding, with nearly 800 companies – including 183 S&P 500 members – expected to come up with earnings results this week. As of Jul 21, 97 S&P 500 members came up with earnings results. Total earnings for these companies are up 8.4% from the same period last year on 5.1% higher revenues, with 78.4% beating EPS estimates and 72.2% beating revenue estimates.Combining results of the reported index members (97 members) with the remaining 403 members of S&P 500, earnings are estimated to improve 8.6% on 4.7% higher revenues.Let us now focus on the utility sector, which is characterized by its defensive nature and domestic orientation. Earnings are expected to drop 2.9% this season.The utility sector is capital-intensive. These companies need huge capital to set up generation facilities, and transmission and distribution infrastructure. They also require considerable funds to maintain and upgrade the existing systems in order to meet emission-control standards. Utilities have been benefiting from the rock-bottom interest-rate environment. However, the Federal Reserve has raised rates twice in 2017 – in March and June. This will definitely hurt the utilities. The Fed has maintained its forecast for one more rate hike in 2017.However, the U.S. coal-based utilities did get a respite with President Trump’s decision to repeal the Climate Power Plan. Moreover, Trump has walked out of the Paris Climate Agreement.    Five out of the 16 sectors in the Zacks coverage universe are expected to witness an earnings decline this season.

81,DTE,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for DTE Energy Company (DTE  -  Free Report). Shares have lost about 2.5% in that time frame.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is DTE due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.DTE Energy Beats on Q1 Earnings, Reaffirms '18 ViewDTE Energy reported first-quarter 2018 operating earnings per share of $1.91, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.89 by 1.06%. Operating earnings improved 6.7% from the year-ago quarter’s figure of $1.79.On a GAAP basis, reported earnings came in at $2.00 per share compared with $2.23 in the prior-year quarter.Highlights of the ReleaseDuring the quarter, the company submitted a plan to double its renewable energy capacity by early 2020 to the Michigan Public Service Commission.During the quarter, the company lowered natural gas prices for its customers in March and again in April, resulting in a drop of 20% from the year-ago period.Net income in the reported quarter was $342 million compared with $322 million in the year-ago quarter.Segmental DetailsUtility OperationsDTE Electric:  The segment’s operating earnings were $142 million, up from $106 million in the prior-year quarter.DTE Gas: The segment incurred operating earnings of $111 million compared with $107 million in the prior-year quarter.Non-Utility Operations: The operating earnings from Non-Utility operations were $105 million compared with $93 million in the prior-year quarter.GuidanceThe company reaffirmed its 2018 operating earnings per share guidance in the range of $5.57-$5.99.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates.

Charting a somewhat similar path, the stock was allocated a grade of C on the value side, putting it in the middle 20% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of B. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.Based on our scores, the stock is more suitable for momentum investors than those looking for value and growth.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock and the magnitude of this revision indicates a downward shift. It's no surprise DTE has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). We expect a below average return from the stock in the next few months.

82,DTE,"Rising rate worries are bothering investors since the start of this year. Higher inflationary expectations and upbeat economic growth have already driven the benchmark treasury yields to 3%. The yields went on to score even higher on May 15 to touch the highest level in seven years at 3.08%.Apparently, a strong retail sales report led to the recent spike in bond yields. Plus, San Francisco Fed president John Williams’ comment that he sees three or four rate hikes in 2018 as being in the ""right direction"" pushed up bond yields. Traders have priced in a 100% chance of a June rate hike and a 54% chance of three more U.S. rate hikes this year. Notable, the Fed enacted a 25-bp hike in March.Also, trade tensions between the United States and China are yet to be resolved. If both countries fail to come to a deal, a full-blown trade conflict is likely to push up prices and inflation, which would be a negative for the bond market. If this was not enough, a member of the ECB’s governing council recently commented that the conclusion of its asset purchases is imminent, which pushed up bond yields in the Euro zone too.While the stock market will mostly likely continue to be volatile in the coming weeks as investors try to reposition their portfolios, this may be the right time to look at which sectors and related stocks are likely to emerge winners and losers in the rising rate environment.Winners FinancialsBanks are in the best position to benefit in the current environment of rising longer-term rates and steepening yield curve. Since banks borrow money at short-term rates and lend the capital at long-term rates, the latest spike in long-term bond yields bode well for bank stocks.Civista Bancshares Inc. (CIVB  -  Free Report)It is a bank holding company involved in the business of community banking, through its subsidiaries. The stock has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). It comes from a top-ranked (top 12%) Zacks industry.Consumer Discretionary Consumer discretionary stocks should perform well as the labor market showed clear signs of strengthening. Further, a rising housing market and a steady stock market added to the “wealth effect”, which in turn gave a boost to consumer confidence. Tax reform is another positive.The Buckle Inc. (BKE  -  Free Report)The Zacks Rank #1 company is a leading retailer of medium to better-priced casual apparel, footwear and accessories. It belongs to a top-ranked (top 38%) Zacks industry.Losers UtilitiesHigh dividend-paying and high-debt sectors like Utilities are likely to underperform. This capital-intensive sector needs huge debt for their operation. As a result, a rising rate environment works inversely for such sectors as companies will have a higher interest obligation. Also, these high-yielding sectors fall out of income-hungry investors’ favor if rates rise.DTE Energy Company (DTE  -  Free Report)The Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company is a diversified energy company involved in the development and management of energy-related businesses and services nationwide.Real EstateREITs are also heavily dependent on debt for acquisitions and development. And higher interest rates raise the debt-financing costs and lower profitability. Also, the appeal for higher payouts by REITs gets quelled in a rising rate environment.A V Homes Inc. (AVHI  -  Free Report)The Zacks Rank #4 company is into the homebuilding, land development and other real estate operations in Florida and Arizona.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

88,DTE,"DTE Energy Company (DTE  -  Free Report) is slated to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 25, before the opening bell.Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 8.08%. Also, DTE Energy surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 11.45%.Let’s see how things are shaping up at the company prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayDuring the first quarter earnings call, DTE Energy said that it expects earnings to be lower in the third quarter and reiterated its projection during the second quarter earnings call. Currently, the company is of the view that third quarter will witness sequential earnings reduction by as much as $10 million to $20 million, including base rate increases. In line with this, the Zacks Consensus Estimate pegged at $1.59 per share reflects an annual decline of 18.9%.On the brighter note, the company’s investment strategy aims at improving reliability and customer experience while maintaining affordability. In fact, the 50 megawatt (MW) Pinnebog Wind Park in Huron County, which became operational in the first quarter, is likely to contribute to the revenues in the to-be-reported quarter.Again, improved weather conditions in its Electric Utility and Gas Utility segments in the third quarter are likely to boost the company’s top line in the quarter.DTE Energy Company Price and EPS Surprise DTE Energy Company Price and EPS Surprise | DTE Energy Company QuoteEarnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that DTE Energy will beat estimates this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: DTE Energy has an Earnings ESP of -4.40% as the Most Accurate estimate is $1.52, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged higher at $1.59. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: DTE Energy carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company’s negative ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) while going into an earnings announcement.Stocks That Warrant a LookInstead, here are a few players in the utility sector that have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.NiSource, Inc. (NI  -  Free Report) will report third-quarter results on Nov 1. The company has an Earnings ESP of +7.69% and a Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.EverSource Energy (ES  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +1.85% and a Zacks Rank #3.

92,DTE,"CMS Energy Corporation’s (CMS  -  Free Report) principal subsidiary, Consumers Energy recently announced that it will invest approximately $250 million to boost small businesses in Michigan over the next two and a half years, under the Pure Michigan Business Connect (PMBC) initiative.About PMBCThe Pure Michigan Business Connect (PMBC) developed by the Michigan Economic Development Corporation (MEDC) began as a multi-billion dollar public/private initiative in 2011. The initiative aims at connecting Michigan goods and service suppliers with corporate purchasers free of charge.Our ViewWe note that, being one of the founding members of PMBC, Consumers Energy has already spent approximately $2.9 billion with Michigan businesses under the initiative since June 2015. CMS Energy’s robust financial commitment toward the PMBC program not only reflects the solid financial flexibility it boasts but also is a testament to the company’s focus on expanding its business across Michigan.Moreover, PMBC’s commitment to generate new jobs is in line with the company’s aim of stimulating economic growth in the state. This in turn will aid small businesses to flourish.We believe CMS Energy aims at expanding customer base by boosting the small businesses. Indeed if business expansion takes place in the state, need for energy consumption will rise and CMS Energy being the largest energy provider in Michigan will surely benefit from that.As of 2015, Michigan is ranked 11th among the U.S. states in terms of energy consumption and with gradual growth in economy, the energy consumption is likely to grow. To tap this expanding market, energy providers like CMS Energy are taking varied initiatives to instil growth in the state and consequently enhance their business.Toward this, another utility provider, DTE Energy Company (DTE  -  Free Report) has recently commenced operations in its Lapeer solar park — one of the largest utility-owned solar parks, located in Michigan. On completion, the park is expected to generate sufficient clean energy to power 11,000 homes. (Read more : DTE Energy (DTE  -  Free Report) Brings Lapeer Solar Park Online in Michigan.) Price MovementCMS Energy has outperformed the industry in the last 12 months. The company’s shares have gained 19.4% compared with the industry’s growth of 13.3%.The company’s ongoing capital investments to strengthen infrastructure and initiatives to lower operation and maintenance expenses are driving its performance.Zacks Rank & Key PicksCMS Energy carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

93,DTE,"DTE Energy Company (DTE  -  Free Report) has recently started the commercial operation of its Lapeer solar park — one of the largest utility-owned solar parks, located east of the Mississippi River. The construction of the project started on the spring of 2016.Located in Lapeer, MI, the 200,000-panel array solar project covers over 250 acres. On completion, it is expected to generate sufficient clean energy to power 11,000 homes.Scope of Alternate EnergyRegulations pertaining to pollution control are becoming increasingly stringent, making it crucial for utilities to spend more on emission control infrastructure. Meanwhile, because of their clean-burning nature, investment in the alternate energy space could prove to be profitable over the long run. In particular, solar energy, which presently contributes to only 1.2% of the total electricity generation in the United States, represents ample scope of improvement in the days to come.Our ViewDue to declining costs of solar and wind energy producing technologies the global renewable energy market has been witnessing enhanced growth in the last two years. The trend to curb energy production from fossil fuel is gaining traction these days. DTE Energy is striving to position itself in this ever-expanding market.In an initiative to transform itself into a full-fledged renewable energy provider, DTE Energy in May announced its plan to get rid of all coal-fired units by 2040. The company is gradually trying to reduce carbon emissions by more than 80% by 2050 (compared to 2005 levels).Notably, the latest news was reported at a crucial time, when the United States slipped to the third position in the latest EY (Ernst &Young) Renewable energy country attractiveness index (RECAI). In fact, the new U.S. Government's decision to roll back many of the past administration's climate change policies, reviving the coal industry and repealing the U.S. Clean Power Plan has been hampering the growth trajectory of alternative energy industry.We believe that DTE Energy’s promise of sumptuous investment in the renewable energy space may uplift the nation on the RECAI. However, we remain on the sidelines considering the fact that President Trump has been calling the climate change a “Chinese Hoax” and has long been in favor of reviving the coal industry. It also remains a matter of question as to whether his newly made policies, if approved, will let energy providers like DTE Energy to wholly shift to renewable resources. In that case, the entire investment plan of DTE Energy will go down the drain, causing a loss for the company. The company has already spent more than $2 billion in wind and solar resources since 2009.Price MovementIn the last six months, shares of DTE Energy have returned 16.9% outperforming the industry’s growth of 8.7%.The company’s focus on expanding its renewable portfolio and gradual recovery of Michigan’s economy has most likely boosted its performance.Zacks Rank and Stock to ConsiderDTE Energy carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

94,DTE,"DTE Energy Company (DTE  -  Free Report) is slated to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 16, before the opening bell.Last quarter, the company posted a negative earnings surprise of 3.27%. However, DTE Energy surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing four quarters, the average beat being 3.81%.Let’s see how things are shaping up at the company prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayDuring the third-quarter earnings call, DTE Energy’s management announced that it expects to witness higher revenues from the company’s subsidiary DTE Gas in the fourth quarter, primarily driven by higher gas main renewal revenues at base rates. We expect the yet-to-be-reported quarter’s results to reflect this.However, the company’s service territories as a whole faced warmer-than-normal temperature in the fourth quarter, which in turn is expected to weigh down on revenues. In line with this, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for DTE Energy’s fourth-quarter revenues of $1.91 billion reflects a year-over-year decline of 33.7%.On a brighter note, banking on its stronger year-to-date results as of Sep 30, 2017, DTE Energy raised its 2017 bottom-line guidance. Notably, improved performance at the company’s Gas Storage and Pipelines, Power and Industrial segments backed the guidance raise.The consensus estimate for DTE Energy’s earnings of $1.20 per share for the fourth quarter reflects year-over-year growth of 48.2%.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that DTE Energy will beat estimates this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: DTE Energy has an Earnings ESP of -0.28%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: DTE Energy carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company’s negative ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) while going into an earnings announcement. DTE Energy Company Price and EPS Surprise  DTE Energy Company Price and EPS Surprise | DTE Energy Company Quote Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some utility companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:NiSource, Inc.

95,DTE,"Public Service Enterprise Group Inc.’s (PEG  -  Free Report) subsidiary — Public Service Electric and Gas Co. (PSE&G) — recently requested the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities (“BPU”) to increase its electric and gas base delivery rates. If approved, the new rates will boost the company’s revenues by 1%.This filing comes as a mandate of the company’s Energy Strong program worth $1.2 billion that got approved by the New Jersey BPU in 2014.Other Details Once approved, the combined residential electric and natural gas customers' annual bill will witness a nominal rise of 1%. The company has assured customers that even after this proposed increase, residential customer bills are expected to be more than 15% lower than they were in 2010.Per management, this rate hike will enable Public Service Enterprise to recover costs that the company incurred to strengthen its electric and gas distribution systems, thereby making them more reliable. Moreover, this proposal reflects the company’s first regulatory rate review in more than eight years.Through this rate filing, Public Service Enterprise has also sought BPU approval for a rate design change, called the Green Enabling Mechanism (GEM). This new rate structure aims at separating the company’s revenues from sales volumes and thereby encourages energy efficiency.  If approved, the GEM will remove the incentive to sell more energy and will instead encourage utility investments in energy efficiency, renewables and other clean energy technologies that will benefit customers by bringing down bills and reducing carbon emissions.The company expects the new base rates as well as the GEM to come into effect from Oct 1, 2018.Our ViewIn May 2014, Public Service Enterprise announced that the New Jersey BPU approved its Energy Strong proposal to proactively protect and strengthen its electric and gas systems to withstand severe weather conditions. Per this proposal, the company aimed at significantly upgrading its infrastructure, which included adding intelligence to its system to help speed restoration during outages.Under the agreement, it was announced that PSE&G will earn an authorized return on equity of 9.75% on the first $1 billion of investment based on an accelerated recovery mechanism.  The impact of the $1-billion investment on the typical residential customer bill is expected to be approximately 2% in 2018 which will be more than offset by transitional charges stemming from deregulation that are expiring in the same time frame.For the remaining $220 million, the company aimed at filling a base rate case after Nov 1, 2017. We believe the latest rate review proposal has been filed by the company to recover this $220 million of the Energy Strong program.Notably, in March 2017, Public Service Enterprise announced plans to spend $12.3 billion for PSE&G’s baseline infrastructure program, which in turn reflects 7% CAGR growth in rate base. The latest rate reform request, if approved, will allow the company to achieve this target.Moreover, Public Service Enterprise continues to undertake several initiatives to support New Jersey Senate’s bill that requires utilities in the state to source 80% of their electricity from renewable energy by 2050. We believe to further comply with this bill, the company has included the GEM clause in the latest rate filing.Notably, in the clean energy space, the company is currently pursuing two solar initiatives, namely, the Solar Loan Program and the Solar 4 All and Solar 4 All Extension programs. In November 2016, the BPU approved a settlement providing for an extension of PSE&G’s existing solar program to construct up to 33 MW of grid-connected facilities with projected investment of approximately $80 million through May 2020.Also, the projected addition of 1,858 megawatts of new gas-fired capacity over 2017 through 2019 will help the company transform itself. Banking on these recently adopted initiatives, management expects nuclear and gas-fired generation facilities to provide more than 90% of the company’s electric output, by the end of this decade.Price PerformanceBuoyed by the solid investment plans, the company's shares have outperformed the broader industry over a year. Evidently, Public Service Enterprise’s share price has rallied 13.7% compared with its industry’s gain of 2.2%.Zacks Rank & Key PicksPublic Service Enterprise carriesa Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in the same space are Pampa Energia S.A.

103,DTE,"California Water Service Group’s (CWT  -  Free Report) subsidiary, Hawaii Water Service (Hawaii Water), recently announced that it has filed a General Rate Case with the Hawaii Public Utilities Commission (“HPUC”) for a rate increase. Notably, the company is seeking to recover the cost of capital investments made toward the Waikoloa Village and Waikoloa Resort systems.The HPUC will review Hawaii Water’s ongoing operations and capital improvements as well as other factors before approving changes in rates.  Changes in the rates, if approved, will take place after the fourth quarter of 2018.Recovery of Investments & UpgradesThe rate hike, if approved, is expected to bolster the total annual revenues by $3.8 million. With respect to the Waikoloa Resort systems, the filing request is aimed at recovering additional revenues worth $0.2 million for the Waikoloa Resort water system, and $2 million for the wastewater system. Further, the rate hike is anticipated to generate additional revenues of $0.5 million for the irrigation system that offers recycled water service to customers.From the Waikoloa Village, the company anticipates to realize additional revenues worth $0.7 million for the water system and $0.7 million for the wastewater system.Among the upgrades covered in this request are Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (“SCADA”) improvements and construction of the two new water wells shared with the Waikoloa Resort system. Furthermore, improvements to a third water well and electrical building shared with the Resort system, wastewater piping repairs, construction of the wastewater treatment plant (K-plant), an extension to the wastewater treatment plant (R-plant), and purchase of a jetting/vacuum truck are also featured.Why This Move?Utility being a capital-intensive sector, major players in this space need to make ample investments from time to time, to meet the increasing customer demand as well as conduct operations seamlessly. In particular, water utilities are frequently required to upgrade and replace old pipelines and water mains. Being no exception, Hawaii Water has also made significant investments to strengthen existing infrastructure. In line with this, we have witnessed the company’s capital investments totaling to $180.4 million during the first nine months of 2017, reflecting an increase of 8.4% compared with year-ago period.Naturally being a profitable organization, Hawaii Electric will certainly try to recover the cost of those investments. We believe the filing for rate hike by the company is one such initiative to recoup capital expenses.Interestingly, Hawaii’s tourism industry — a significant driver of Hawaii’s economy — ended with growth of 4.9% in visitor spending and 7.1% in arrivals, during third-quarter 2017. This expansion in tourism industry reflects solid increase in demand for water service and potential improvement in days ahead. To make most of the situation, the rate hike decision seems to be a wise move on Hawaii Water’s part.In fact, given the growing opportunities in this state, California Water is currently aiming to extract higher revenues from Hawaii, by making similar rate case proposals. Evidently, in October 2017, the HPUC approved an increase in the company’s annual revenues by $0.7 million 771,000 in Pukalani wastewater system. If approved, the latest rate case will add impetus to the company’s top-line growth.Price MovementCalifornia Water has outperformed the industry in the last three months. The company’s shares have returned 6.6% compared with industry’s gain of 3.5%.Zacks Rank & Key PicksCalifornia Water currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

104,DTE,"CenterPoint Energy, Inc. (CNP  -  Free Report) recently unveiled capital expenditure plan for 2018-2022 time period, wherein the energy provider plans to invest $8.3 billion. Notably, this represents 18% growth from the prior five-year plan (2017-2021).Details of the Capex PlanCenterPoint Energy aims to spend $1.66 billion in 2018, and almost the same amount in each of the following four years.Per management, solid growth, reliability and grid strengthening duly witnessed in operations enhanced the capital expenditure.The projected capital plan incorporates the Freeport transmission project worth $250 million that has been approved by the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, last month. CenterPoint Energy expects a decision from the Texas Public Utility Commission on the project in 2019.How Will CenterPoint Energy Benefit?The Utility sector is a fundamentally capital-intensive sector, where in service providers need to focus on strengthening their transmission and distribution lines. Since Center point Energy provides both electricity as well as natural gas, the company has to spend a lot for upgrading and strengthening its existing infrastructure, like replacing old distribution lines and repairing old gas pipelines.To withstand severe weather conditions as well utilities have to keep their transmission and distribution systems upgraded. During third-quarter 2017 earnings call, the company hinted at increasing its next five-year capital expenditure for both electric as well as gas distribution businesses. The latest investment plan worth $8.3 billion duly reflects the company’s commitment toward offering improved and safe utility services to customers.With increasing demand for utility services, we believe this enhanced capital spending plan will attract more customers to take up the utility services those CenterPoint Energy provides, which in turn will add on to the company’s profitability.Moreover, last week the company issued an updated 2017 guidance hinting at an improvement in its full-year earnings. Therefore, it is reasonable to deduce that the solid capital investments that CenterPoint Energy has made so far got duly payed off in terms of the company’s improved bottom-line guidance. The latest investment plan can also be expected to provide further impetus to CenterPoint Energy’s bottom-line growth.Price MovementCenterPoint Energy’s stock has moved up about 12% over a year compared with the broader industry’s gain of 5.4%. This outperformance must have been led by significant customer growth as well as investments to upgrade infrastructure.  Zacks Rank & Key PicksCenterPoint Energy carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Investors interested in the same space can consider some better-ranked stocks such as FirstEnergy Corporation (FE  -  Free Report), PPL Corporation (PPL  -  Free Report) and DTE Energy Company (DTE  -  Free Report) , all of which carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

105,DTE,"Duke Energy Corporation (DUK  -  Free Report) announced that its subsidiary, Duke Energy Florida, has filed an application with the Florida Public Service Commission (“FPSC”) to recoup the expenses incurred by it to restore normalcy of utility services in the state post Hurricane Irma.Hurricane Irma hit Florida on Sep 11, with wind speed of more than 100 miles and knocked out power of 64% or 6.7 million electricity customers in the state, per a date provided by the U.S. Energy Information Administration.  Thanks to the continuous hard work of the line and field workers, Duke Energy could restore power to nearly 99% of users in Florida.The company will ask for a restoration cost recovery of $381 million and an additional $132 million to replenish its storm reserve account.Increase in Monthly BillIf approved by the FPSC, the monthly bill of a residential customer consuming 1,000 kWh of electricity will increase $5.20 per month for the expected recovery period of three years. The utility bills of commercial and industrial customers are expected to rise in the range of 2.5% to 6.6%, subject to certain conditions.The storm restoration charge is expected to begin from March 2018 as the commission is expected to provide its decision on the same within next 60 days.Investments Help in RestorationDuke Energy has invested more than $5 billion in Florida since 2004 to strengthen its power delivery system in the Southeast.  These investments helped the company in strengthening its distribution lines, vegetation management and automation of the grid.Another utility, NextEra Energy Inc. (NEE  -  Free Report) through its subsidiary Florida Power & Light Company (“FPL”) invested nearly $3 billion to strengthen its electricity transmission and distribution capabilities in the state since 2006. FPL already filed with the FPSC to recoup its $1.3 billion expenses in restoration work.All investments made by these companies gave them an opportunity to provide initial resistance against the destruction of Irma. However, the companies had to incur an additional expenditure to restore operation.We expect the recovery of the storm related expenditure to help the utility continue with further investment to strengthen the existing infrastructure and focus more on renewable source to produce electricity.Price MovementDuke Energy has returned 8.2% in the last 12 months, outperforming Zacks Electric Power industry’s rally of 6.6%.The company’s focus on core domestic regulated and highly-contracted renewable business, its stable financial position and streamlining of portfolio will help it deliver a strong performance.Zacks Rank & Key PicksDuke Energy currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).
