0,DRI,"A key IBD tenet is to focus on leading stocks in leading industry groups. It's a good rule to live by, but sometimes rules have a little wiggle room. Out of 197 industry groups ranked by IBD based on six-month price performance, the top 40 are shown Monday through Thursday in the print edition (today on B4).
"
1,DRI,"It's OK to venture outside the top 40 groups for ideas so long as there is more than one top-performing stock in the group.
"
2,DRI,"As of Monday's close, IBD's restaurant group ranked just outside the top 40, but four names owned Composite Ratings of 90 or higher.

3,DRI,"The group was resilient Tuesday despite a weak performance by Sonic (SONC), one of its leaders.
"
4,DRI,"Buyers had been coming into the stock ahead of its earnings report late Monday, but shares gapped down Tuesday.
"
5,DRI,"Early Tuesday, Darden Restaurants' (DRI) results impressed. Shares popped nearly 6% early, but the stock faded by the close, giving back most of the gain.

21,DRI,"Restaurants that are innovating in mobile and digital technology are gaining market share and outperforming their peers, according to a report from BTIG analysts, who launched coverage of 15 restaurant stocks, eight of them with buy ratings.
"
22,DRI,"Of the eight, five ""best leverage a digital platform"" and will continue to take market share from small and independent operators, they said.
"
23,DRI,"They include two pizza chains, Papa John's (PZZA) and Domino's (DPZ); Starbucks (SBUX), Buffalo Wild Wings (BWLD) and Brinker International (EAT).
"
24,DRI,"Pizza delivery operators lead the industry in digital technology, with around 50% of their U.S. sales generated through digital channels, the analysts noted. While pizza delivery lends itself well to mobile ordering and delivery, quick-service and fast-casual restaurants are in the early stages of leveraging the technology, the analysts noted.
"
25,DRI,"Starbucks recently expanded advanced mobile ordering from 600 units in the Pacific Northwest to more than 4,000 U.S. restaurants. Mobile payments now account for nearly 20% of transactions in Starbucks' stores ""and continue to grow at an accelerated pace,"" BTIG noted.
"
26,DRI,"Casual dining restaurants are also getting tech savvy. Brinker's Chili's, for example, now has Ziosk tablets in all its U.S. restaurants. They help to raise the average check, speed up table turns and drive loyalty reward programs, BTIG said.
"
27,DRI,"Buffalo Wild Wings, Red Robin Gourmet Burgers (RRGB) and Darden Restaurants' (DRI) Olive Garden chain are in various stages of rolling out tablet technology as well.
"
28,DRI,"Darden, which BTIG also rates a buy, is moving to an ""asset light model,"" with the planned sale of more than 500 real estate assets and the sale and leaseback of its corporate headquarters in Orlando to free up capital.
"
29,DRI,"Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) and Jack in the Box (JACK) are also rated buys. BTIG noted that Jack in the Box's underpenetrated Qdoba Mexican Grill concept could potentially double if not triple its U.S. store base ""to rival Chipotle's current footprint.""
"
30,DRI,"Chipotle, meanwhile, could add ""hundreds if not thousands"" of U.S. restaurants to its current footprint in the coming years, the analysts noted. The development of ShopHouse Southeast Asian Kitchen and Pizzeria Locale could add ""another leg of growth.""
"
31,DRI,"Of the eight stocks with buy ratings, Starbucks is rated the highest by IBD, with a Composite Rating of 98 out of a best-possible 99.
"
32,DRI,"Next highest is Papa John's, with a 92, and Chipotle and Jack in the Box, each with 91 ratings.

"
36,DRI,"The top-line number in the Commerce Department's May durable goods report showed a 1.8% decline and a downward revision to April's number to minus 1.5%. Economists had forecast a more mild 0.6% slip. The bulk of the miss was apparently due to a sharp decline in aircraft orders during the month.

"
37,DRI,"Housing prices improved steadily in May, lifting the Federal Housing Finance Agency's House Price Index 0.3%. That increase was equal to March's increase but just below consensus forecasts for a 0.4% gain. Year over year, the index is up 5.3%.

"
42,DRI,"Citrix Systems (CTXS) pecked out a 2% gain, the best increase among Nasdaq 100 stocks. The Fort Lauderdale-headquartered software developer is still in buying range, 4% above a 69.33 buy point in a cup-with-handle base.

167,DRI,"THE BUZZAmericans love their hamburgers and are about to be dished up a tasty IPO of fast-casual restaurant chain Shake Shack.Burger chains are the largest dine-out segment in the U.S., with more than $77 billion in 2014 sales, according to research firm Technomic. The burger industry is estimated to be twice the size of the pizza market, which is the next largest category.While McDonald's (MCD) and other international burger chains take the biggest bite out of sales, the fast-casual segment is booming, with annual sales growing at double-digit rates. Among the giants in the fast-casual space are Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) and Panera Bread (PNRA).Shake Shack (SHAK), which serves premium burgers, hot dogs, fries, shakes, frozen custard, beer and wine, is attracting lots of buzz with its upcoming IPO.On Wednesday it raised the initial public offering price to a range of 17 to 19 a share, up from 14 to 16. It plans to sell 5 million shares and raise about $90 million. The shares are set to price Thursday and begin trading Friday on the NYSE.Research firm IPOboutique said its channel checks indicate strong demand for Shake Shack stock among institutional investors.""It's a fast-growth story,"" said Jeff Zell, research analyst at IPOboutique. ""Almost all of the fast-casual restaurant deals in the past year have all popped above their offering price.""The latest IPO in the fast-casual space was Habit Restaurants (HABT). It soared 120% from an IPO price of 18 on its first trading day, Nov. 20, and raised $90 million. The stock hit a high of 44.20 on Dec. 12, but has since fallen to near 32.Another is El Pollo Loco (LOCO), which popped 60% from an IPO price of 15 on its first trading day, July 25, and is now near 25. One additional recently public name is Zoe's Kitchen (ZOES), which now trades at more than double its early-April IPO price of 15.THE COMPANYShake Shack started out as a hot-dog cart in 2001 in New York City's Madison Square Park as the park was getting a revamp. The food was an instant hit, receiving widespread media attention and long lines of customers.The first official Shake Shack eatery then opened in 2004 as a kiosk in the park .The company started serving burgers and has since grown to 63 Shacks, of which 27 are licensed Shake Shack restaurants operating in offshore markets. Twenty operate in the Middle East. Shake Shack operates in 10 Eastern U.S. states and Washington, D.C. Fifteen of its restaurant locations are in New York.The company plans to open at least 10 new Shacks each year for the foreseeable future. Over the long-term it sees the market potential to operate least 450 Shake Shacks. On average, each store produces annual revenue of about $5 million.""Over the last decade, Shake Shack has become a beloved New York City institution that generates significant media attention, critical acclaim and a passionately devoted following,"" the company states in its IPO prospectus.In its IPO filing, Shake Shack continually describes creating an experience — a word often used in the prospectus to define its success.""We never stop looking for the best culinary ingredients and the best partners in order to exceed our guests' expectations in every aspect of their experience,"" it said, for example.Shake Shack, while passionate about providing customers a compelling experience, is equally dedicated to employees.""Through our leadership development program, The Shacksperience, we teach our team members the principles of Enlightened Hospitality and how to live and breathe our Shack Pact, the agreement that encompasses our value system and brand ethos,"" it said in the filing.RISKS/CHALLENGESThe restaurant industry is highly competitive and fragmented, with various regions having highly dedicated customers.""Some of our competitors, including some of our 'better burger' competitors, have significantly greater financial, marketing, personnel and other resources than we do, and many of our competitors are well-established in markets in which we have existing Shacks or intend to locate new Shacks,"" Shake Shack said.The fast-casual dining segment has, on average, seen sales growth in the double-digit rates for the past 15 years, according to Technomic.The fast-casual restaurant segment in total took in revenue of about $38.5 billion in 2014. Sales in the burger category are around $3 billion.The largest competitor in the fast-casual space that focuses on hamburgers is Five Guys, which is based in Alexandria, Va. Five Guys has more than 1,000 shops and revenue of about $1 billion, said Darren Tristano, executive vice president at Technomic.In second is Denver-based Smashburger, with about 300 outlets.Shake Shack, which is small in comparison, faces a formidable group of competitors.""Shake Shack is late to game,"" said Tristano. ""Their customers say it's a great burger experience, but today there are a lot of good burgers.""He added: ""The burger market continues to do well, but it's also maturing. A lot more burger chains are opening up as we speak.""Shake Shack has been cautiously methodical in its expansion. ""We are still in the very nascent stage of our story,"" it said.THE RESULTSFor the 39-week period ended Sept. 24, Shake Shack reported revenue of $83.8 million, up 41% from the $59.5 million reported in the year-earlier period. Net income fell 20% to $3.54 million.Shake Shack reported revenue of $31.8 million in the third quarter, up 40% from the year-earlier period, and income from operations of $759,000.PROCEEDSShake Shack expects to receive $83.7 million in net proceeds and will use that to repay debt of $36 million. Another $44.7 million will be used for general corporate purposes, including the opening of new Shake Shacks and renovation of existing shops.MANAGEMENTDaniel MeyerChairmanMeyer, 56, has served as chairman since its formation.

The Nasdaq dropped 135 points that day, but has erased all of the loss over the past four sessions, including part of Wednesday's session.When the bears can't follow up any better than that, it suggests funds are determined to hold onto most of their positions.In some cases, beaten-up stocks that have given up their 50-day moving averages are now finding support at the 200-day lines. The restaurant group has some stocks that fit that description. Red Robin Gourmet Burger (RRGB) popped 2.5% midday Wednesday. The stock last week found support at its 200-day line.Other restaurant stocks finding support at the 200-day area include Domino's Pizza (DPZ), Darden Restaurants (DRI), Dave & Buster's Entertainment (PLAY) and Ruth's Hospitality Group (RUTH).The best action among restaurant stocks recently belongs to 2015 initial public offering Wingstop (WING). The small-cap stock, which was featured recently in IBD (""Can Next Breakout Work For This IPO Restaurant Stock?""), is on track for a fifth consecutive up day. Wingstop is trading near the top of a 5% buy zone from a breakout past 33.35. The stock is above both its 50-day and 200-day lines.Institutional favorite Apple (AAPL) edged up 0.3% to 162.10. Apple recently moved above a 156.75 buy point and remains in a 5% buy zone up to 164.59. Apple was featured in this week's Big Cap 20 column (""Could Apple Be Setting Up For A New Run-Up?"").Among IBD's 197 industry groups, laggards were doing the best. Steel, metal ores and retail apparel posted gains. The day's worst performers also came from laggard groups — vehicle parts and oil drillers.West Texas intermediate crude oil was virtually unchanged, holding above the 47.50 level. Light sweet crude appears to be finding support near 47 and resistance near 50.40.In the IBD 50, advancing issues led declining issues by about an 8-to-3 ratio. Chip-equipment maker Lam Research (LRCX) appeared on track for a fourth up day in a row. The stock rose 3.60 to 163.81 as it works on a new base.Meanwhile, landscape equipment maker Toro (TTC) plowed 2% higher. The stock climbed back above a 73.10 buy point that Toro had initially topped on Aug. 8. In fiscal 2016 ended in October, Toro's pretax margin rose to 13.8%. This represented the seventh consecutive year of rising pretax margin.RELATED:Is There A Breakout In This Stock's Near-Term Future?Are Two Apple-Topped ETFs Setting Up?

255,DRI,"When an UberEats driver heads to Paul Tulaphorn's McDonald's (MCD) on Lakewood Boulevard in Bellflower, Calif., a loudspeaker pings sharply, loud enough to be heard over the frappe machine, to let the staff know.Behind the counter, employees manage those orders via an iPad next to a dedicated register. A designated tech worker helps install that technology, and stands ready to fix a register when it goes down, change over the store's data-processing systems, or upgrade the ""smart clock"" that changes the restaurant's digital menu displays.Restaurants often lag other industries in adopting new technology, lacking the time or budget for massive digital overhauls. But as industry sales have slowed recently, smartphone conveniences have found their way into the world of burgers and fries. Many in the industry are betting that its future lies in that technology — in large part through mobile orders, payments and delivery.""We have to be ready,"" Tulaphorn, a four-decade McDonald's veteran who owns nine McDonald's locations in Southern California, said of the coming technological wave. ""And I think we'll be ready.""Mobile ordering and delivery from the likes of McDonald's, Jack in the Box (JACK), Wendy's (WEN) and Burger King mark the biggest change in the way people order fast food since the drive-thru. As that change ripples through the industry, restaurants are facing down questions like how to preserve margins, avoid parking-lot traffic jams, and keep French fries crispy once they enter the balmy ecosphere of the delivery bag.IBD'S TAKE: McDonald's is one of the best performers on the Dow Jones industrial average this year. But it's only the 8th in IBD's Retail-Restaurant group. To see which eateries are the true leaders, and how they stack up vs. rivals, go to IBD Stock Checkup.Just as the drive-thru accommodated generations shaped by mass-market car culture, the new digital efforts cater to a new cohort of fast-food customers shaped by e-commerce, social media, smartphones, streaming video and, in one way or another, a lack of time.Restaurants' trial runs and partnerships with delivery services could give chains a head start in capturing today's tech-savvy diners. Cowen & Co. estimated last year that U.S. restaurant delivery alone could become a $35 billion market by 2025.""We're currently very optimistic that we're tapping into a new customer base and serving them in a new way,"" Bill Garrett, corporate vice president of delivery at McDonald's, said in an interview. ""It's a customer that otherwise would likely have not gone out to eat.""The company is still trying to glean precise details about core delivery customers, Garrett says. He sees ""a lot of research"" ahead.Some restaurants have been on the delivery and digital path for a while. Domino's Pizza (DPZ) and Papa John's (PZZA) are old pros. Starbucks (SBUX) began offering mobile order and pay in 2014.The Golden Arches already offered delivery internationally and has dabbled with it in the U.S. This year it has expanded its partnership with UberEats, the ride-hailing service's food-delivery segment, to major cities like Los Angeles and Chicago. McDonald's said that as of the end of June at least 3,500 of its 14,000 U.S. restaurants offered UberEats delivery. The burger chain also plans to offer mobile ordering via an app in thousands more locations this year.Restaurant Brands International's (QSR) Burger King is also testing mobile order and payments. Wendy's, Jack in the Box, Dunkin' Brands (DNKN) Dunkin' Donuts and Yum Brands' (YUM) Taco Bell and KFC have partnered with the delivery service DoorDash. Panera Bread (PNRA), which is being taken private, also has jumped into delivery and plans to hire 10,000 drivers.So far, McDonald's delivery customers tend to skew younger, Garrett says. Delivery demand has been spread evenly across the day, though the end-of-dinner, late-night period appears to draw a slightly higher share of business compared to the company's traditional business. Dunkin' Donuts, in an email, said its delivery service is popular with millennials and ""a younger generation who live in an on-demand world.""As fast-food chains figure out who these new consumers are, they also have to solve the logistical puzzle that digital ordering can bring to restaurants, which face space limitations in their kitchens and parking lots.No massive problems have been reported by the delivery newcomers. McDonald's says its kitchens, drive-thrus and parking lots are able to handle more orders. At the same time, McDonald's shares are reaching new highs, rising to a record intraday peak of 156.56 on Friday.But digital orders can come with a learning curve.Starbucks has said the customer flow at some locations slowed as customers who ordered ahead on its popular mobile order and pay app crowded into restaurants. Management said in April that Starbucks would add staff to its busiest stores at peak times and consider new equipment and layouts to speed throughput. The company was introducing a digital order management system to help baristas track orders with a tablet and notify customers via mobile app when drinks were ready.Even a few seconds can make a big difference in processing orders and deliveries. The fast-food business, Cowen analyst Andrew Charles said, is ""maniacal about drive-thru speeds."" Years ago, then-McDonald's CEO Jack Greenberg said unit sales got a 1% bump for every six seconds shaved off the drive-thru time.Tulaphorn says French fries take three minutes to cook and have a seven-minute holding time. When an UberEats driver arrives, the restaurant aims to have orders in the car and on the road within five minutes.DoorDash aims to deliver within around 20 minutes. That means different things in different areas.""Manhattan, on a bike, could be 20 blocks or 30 blocks,"" said Eitan Bencuya, DoorDash's head of communications. ""In Dallas, Texas, 20 minutes could be five miles away.""Early on, UberEats drivers sometimes got address numbers wrong, Tulaphorn says. And as with any other change, the new technology requires training for employees and older customers.McDonald's initially thought sending drivers through the drive-thru would be best, Garrett says. The company later found it was better to let drivers choose whether to take the drive-thru or go inside the restaurant. In Southern California, McDonald's restaurant operators can decide whether they want to allocate parking spaces just for UberEats drivers.DoorDash, meanwhile, found that the drive-thru wasn't the way to go. ""Just by looking at the number of deliveries that we bring to a restaurant, we found that it would actually overload the drive-thru to have Dashers lining up through their cars,"" Bencuya said.Some foods hold up better than others inside a delivery container. Pizza works, and ideally is still cooking when it's being delivered, Normura-Instinet analyst Mark Kalinowski says. Chinese food, tacos, soups, sandwiches, pasta and salads also hold up fine. French fries, however, are a delicate situation.At Tulaphorn's McDonald's, fries go into a sleeve, then into their own separate bag, then into a bigger delivery bag that's sticker-sealed to verify that it hasn't been opened on its way. The UberEats driver also has a thermal bag to carry this delivery bag.Garrett says the company is looking at packaging changes that might help keep drinks and desserts from spilling, but wouldn't get into specifics.Restaurants that work with DoorDash get access to the deliverer's own packaging. DoorDash drivers can wrap the takeout container in a thin, metallic ""space blanket"" and put that inside an insulated bag.Similarly, some companies are more naturally suited to delivery, analysts say.In general, digital ordering benefits bigger brands with deep pockets for technology, Kalinowski says.McDonald's cites its massive geographic reach as an advantage. By its own estimates, nearly three-quarters of the population in its top five markets — the U.S., France, U.K., Germany and Canada — lives within three miles of one of its restaurants.Charles says a place like Wingstop (WING), which has limited seating and already does a lot of to-go business via digital, could be well-positioned for delivery.Canaccord Genuity analyst Lynne Collier says Panera's food — soup, sandwiches, salads — travels well. She notes that Darden Restaurants' (DRI) Olive Garden has been strong in to-go orders; Italian food also tends to withstand delivery better than French fries.""I think that's McDonald's biggest challenge,"" she said.Wall Street likely will focus more on the profit impact when the novelty of digital ordering wears off and restaurants gain more sense of who their digital customers are. Commissions paid to third-party delivery services risk degrading margins, so restaurants need to watch their delivery sales trends to justify the hit, Charles says.Delivery fees also raise costs for consumers. A McDonald's Quarter Pounder with cheese meal, with a medium Coke and fries, delivered via UberEats to IBD's Los Angeles office from the Marina del Rey area takes an estimated 20 to 30 minutes. A $4.99 ""booking fee"" is tacked on to the food charge of $6.89 and 60 cents in taxes, bringing the total cost to $12.48.Independent restaurants' sales growth has outpaced that of restaurant chains, a pattern that could continue for the rest of the decade, food-industry consulting firm Pentallect estimated in April. Customers, it said, felt independent restaurants were more community oriented, with better quality, value and service. The trend comes on top of the day-to-day difficulties of competition, discounting and higher labor costs.""I think that simply put, you've got a pretty mature industry out there that's experiencing periods of weakness,"" Charles said. ""So essentially operators are looking for: 'What's the shiny object out there? What's the lever I can pull to really get my sales going?' It increasingly seems like it's delivery.""RELATED:These Are The Dow's Top 5 Stocks In 2017 — And Apple Isn't No. 1McDonald's Delivers Beefy Earnings; Execs Talk Deliveries, Digital StoresDomino's Pizza Eyes Delivery Wars As McDonald's Expands ServiceJack In The Box Beats Views, Eyes 'Potential Alternatives' For Qdob

256,DRI,"Shares of Cheesecake Factory (CAKE) had a meltdown on Tuesday after the sit-down restaurant chain cut its second-quarter same-store sales guidance, citing signs of ""uncertainty on the part of many consumers"" and bad weather.Cheesecake Factory on Tuesday said it expected same-store sales to fall roughly 1%. The new forecast comes several weeks after the company's first-quarter results missed analyst estimates, when it also predicted a Q2 same-store sales increase of 1%-2%.CEO David Overton said in a statement that the company had seen ""heightened volatility in week to week sales trends, indicative of uncertainty on the part of many consumers.""""Specifically,"" he added, ""we have seen pockets of softness as we moved through the quarter, notably in the East and Midwest where we also faced unfavorable weather that reduced patio usage.""Shares crashed 9.9% to 52.58 in the stock market today, hitting the lowest level in seven months and sending their Relative Strength line to the lowest in more than five years.Other sit-down restaurant chains followed suit: Brinker International (EAT), which runs Chili's, fell 3.8%. BJ's Restaurants (BJRI) lost 0.9% after tumbling 6.7% Monday, though it did rebound from its 200-day line intraday Tuesday. Darden Restaurants (DRI), the parent of Olive Garden, dropped 2.2%.IBD'S TAKE: Even as many restaurants struggle short-term, many appear to believe that mobile ordering and delivery are crucial elements to the industry's future.Cheesecake Factory said that it had ""continued to outperform the casual dining industry quarter to date,"" turning out positive same-store sales in more than half its regions over that time.Still, the general climate for the sector has been tough. Casual dining chains, and the restaurant industry overall, have been facing competition from cheaper groceries and discounts from fast-food restaurants.Stephens analyst Will Slabaugh on Tuesday said he was waiting for Cheesecake Factory to shore up same-store sales trends before become more bullish on the stock.""Although we (continue) to appreciate the historical consistency and best-in-class quality of CAKE, this continuation of recent softer-than-expected top-line trends has us remaining (equal-weight) until we gain more visibility into SSS stabilization/reacceleration,"" he said in a research note.RELATED:Wendy's Sizzles To Decade High On Earnings; Fast-Food Price War End Near?Jack In The Box Beats Views, Eyes 'Potential Alternatives' For Qdoba

257,DRI,"The Federal Reserve's unexpectedly hawkish policy outlook on Wednesday foiled a few homebuilder stock breakouts, at least temporarily, with D.R. Horton (DRI) and Lennar (LEN) slipping below buy-zone territory.But the recent news out of Washington isn't all bad for homebuilders. On Thursday, Wedbush upgraded Beazer Homes (BZH) to outperform from neutral, with a 15 price target, citing easier mortgage standards at Fannie Mae (FNMA).Analyst Jay McCanless said that Fannie Mae's policy change should be supportive for homebuilders, and especially so for Beazer, whose ""entry-level consumers"" stand to benefit most from lower lending standards.Wedbush also raised its price target for KB Home (KBH) to 24 from 22, with an outperform rating, citing looser credit from Fannie and expectations of a strong quarter when the homebuilder reports earnings in two weeks.Last week, Fannie Mae, which buys conforming mortgages from lenders and turns them into securities that carry an implicit government guarantee, said that it will ease debt-to-income requirements for borrowers starting July 29 to from 45% to 50%. That means total monthly debt payments can add up to half of income for qualified borrowers, though low credit scores can still doom a mortgage application.Beazer Homes rose 4.6% to 12.88 on the stock market today, off intraday highs of 13.27. KB Home dipped 1.3% to 21.68, a day after hitting its best levels since June 2013.Lennar fell 1.6% to 53.09, back below a 53.89 buy point cleared on Wednesday. D.R. Horton slid 1.6% to 33.80. D.R. Horton topped a 34.64 buy point intraday Wednesday, but closed below that level after the Fed announcement. Pulte Group (PHM) dipped 0.8% to 24.08, still above a 23.71 buy point cleared on Tuesday.The National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index out Thursday dipped to 67 in June from a downwardly revised 69 in May, but still signaled industry optimism about current and future sales. Readings over 50 are positive. While the gauge of buyer traffic dipped 2 points to 49, the main industry complaint has focused on ""an ongoing shortage of skilled labor and buildable lots that is impeding stronger growth in the single-family sector,"" NAHB Chief Economist Robert Dietz said.Even as the Fed has hiked rates three times, the Building-Residential/Commercial industry group has climbed to No. 5 from No. 118 six months ago among 197 industry groups tracked by IBD. That's because market interest rates came have come down about 50 basis points since December, meaning financial conditions have eased as the Fed has tightened policy. But if the Fed is right about the need to hike rates four more times in the next 18 months, even as it shrinks its balance sheet comprised of $4.5 trillion in mortgage and Treasury holdings, that benign trend for housing will begin to reverse.RELATED:Fed Hikes Rates, But Hawkish Tone Unnerves MarketsHomebuilders Surge; Pulte Still In Buy RangeHomebuilder Stocks To Watch And Housing Market & Real Estate News

Consumer spending rose at a 1.1% rate, revised up from 0.6%. Economists expect growth near 3% in the just-ending second quarter, resulting in a steady but unimpressive 2.2% rate for the first half of the year. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve's primary inflation gauge, the PCE price index, rose just 1.4% from a year ago in May, down from the 2.1% annual gain in February. Core PCE inflation, stripping out food and energy, slipped to 1.4% from 1.8% in February, undercutting the case for near-term rate hikes.European Central Bank President Mario Draghi put investors on notice that his days of bond buying to boost the economy and elevate asset prices are winding down. Stock prices took a tumble, particularly technology stocks, after Draghi's Tuesday speech that economists interpreted as a signal that the ECB will begin to taper off its bond purchases by the start of 2018. Meanwhile, Federal Reserve chief Janet Yellen and Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer both talked about fairly rich equity prices as the U.S. central bank gears up to begin slowly unwinding its financial crisis asset purchases later this year. The takeaway: Less supportive central banks will be a headwind for stocks, but not a hurricane, as long as policymakers don't move too fast.RELATED:Draghi Drama Undercuts Key Stock-Market SupportThe Federal Reserve OK'd JPMorgan, Citigroup and all other large U.S. banks to move forward with their dividend and buyback increases after the central bank released results from part two of its annual stress tests.

Hertz (HTZ) got an extra pop later in the day on reports said Apple AAPL was leasing a handful of its cars to test self-driving technology.

But it announced a deal in which Walgreens would pay $5.18 billion for 2,186 Rite Aid stores, or roughly half of the total. The new deal is expected to close in six months. It would follow months of attempts to ease regulators' concerns that the merger would not harm competition and reports on the merger's prospects that whiplashed Rite Aid's stock. Rite Aid also pulled out of a deal with Fred's (FRED), the pharmacy chain set to receive hundreds of Rite Aid stores under the merger agreement with Walgreens. Walgreens rose 1.7% on Thursday.

Alphabet (GOOGL) led the declines, down more than 0.8%.

262,DRI,"The Federal Reserve surprised markets with its relatively hawkish outlook Wednesday after raising interest rates for the second time in 2017. Most Fed policymakers still expect another rate hike in 2017, and three more next year. The central bank also said it will start to normalize its massive $4.5 trillion balance sheet by year-end, with the details suggesting a slightly faster run-off that some had expectedBefore the Fed announcement, market pricing implied no more rate hikes for another year, and stocks did not react well to Fed hawkishness.The Fed's decision followed the latest in a series of surprisingly tame inflation reports. The Labor Department reported earlier in the day that core consumer price inflation, stripping out volatile food and energy prices, fell to a two-year low 1.7%.After the Fed's policy statement, the weak-Nasdaq, strong-Dow trade resumed as Fed Chair Janet Yellen elaborated on the U.S. central bank's views.The Nasdaq fell 0.7% in late afternoon trade, while the S&P 500 fell 0.25%. But the Dow industrials turned up 0.2%, helped by rebounding banks.Expectations of a slower rate-hike trajectory hit Dow component JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC) and other bank stocks ahead of the Fed announcement. But JPMorgan and Bank of America erased nearly all their losses by the close, with several banks turning positive.Housing-related stocks were among the lead performers on the stock market today ahead of the news, thanks to the benign rate outlook. Homebuilder D.R. Horton (DRI) rose to a buy zone and hit an 11-year high, but pulled back somewhat as the markets soured.  Home Depot (HD), another Dow component, climbed 1.8%, rebounding from its 50-day line. Whirlpool (WHR) gained 1.4%.Fed policy expectations may continue to be volatile. On Tuesday, market participants were expecting the next rate hike by December. Before the announcement, they saw the Fed on hold until  next June. The 10-year Treasury hit the lowest level since the week of the November election and the 2-year yield saw its sharpest single-day drop since Brexit, but yields rebounded somewhat after the Fed statement.Even as the Fed has been on a tightening path, financial conditions have been easing, with the 10-year Treasury yield sinking about 50 basis points since mid-December.While economists still expect inflation to firm in the months ahead, their confidence in that outcome is waning after broad weakness in airline, apparel, auto and medical care costs.The Fed noted that inflation has been cooling, but Yellen said in her press conference that ebbing inflation appeared to be related to one-time changes, citing wireless data and prescription drug prices.""On a 12-month basis, inflation has declined recently and, like the measure excluding food and energy prices, is running somewhat below 2%,"" the Fed said in its statement. The Fed lowered its inflation forecast for 2017 but expects inflation to hit its 2% target over the medium term.Separately, the Fed detailed how it plans to reduce its balance sheet gradually. It'll let some expiring assets roll off the balance sheet, starting with $10 billion a month, or $6 billion from Treasuries and $4 billion from mortgage-backed securities.Jefferies economists characterized the telegraphed balance-sheet reductions as ""fairly aggressive"" compared to expectations.The caps will rise every three months by $6 billion for Treasuries and $4 billion for MBS until they reach $30 billion and $20 billion, respectively.Officials didn't reveal the exact timing of when the process will begin this year, as well as specifically how large the portfolio might be when finished.The CME Group FedWatch tool showed that markets now don't expect the next rate hike until March 2018. At that point, the Fed will likely have a new leader, with Fed Chair Janet Yellen's term ending in February.With job growth running ""well in excess"" of the trend growth in the labor force, Yellen said it's prudent to remove accommodation to avoid having to tighten too quickly later.RELATED:These Stunning Economic Reports Could Give Fed PauseBank Stocks Testing Key Levels Amid Fed, Weak DataThis Hot Sector Is Putting Stocks In Buy Range: Investing Action PlanHome Depot Finds Support In Buy Zone As Amazon Rattles Retailers

They then fell three weeks in a row but are up so far this week.Meanwhile, in the restaurant group, Darden Restaurants (DRI) gapped up 8% to clear a cup-with-handle base in huge volume.

Darden topped the Street's estimate on quarterly earnings and raised guidance.Strong volume kicked in for Red Robin Gourmet Burger (RRGB), which edged above a cup-with-handle pattern recently.

Revenue is seen climbing 15% to $269.77 million.Results: EPS of 63 cents on revenue of $270.2 million. Same-store sales rose 3.4%, below Wall Street views for a 3.7% gain.Outlook: Full-year revenue of $1.155 billion-$1.17 billion, with the midpoint slightly below consensus for $1.164 billion, and comp sales growth of 2%-3%.Stock: Dave & Buster's sold off 3.2% late. Shares closed up 2.3% at 62.19 in the stock market today, climbing out of their buy zone. The IBD 50 stock initially broke out in February.The chain, whose large locations glow with arcade games and sports on TV, gets higher margins than rival restaurants due to its focus on entertainment and experience — something that has become more valuable to younger consumers.Sales growth could come from new games only found at the chain, such as a life-size version of ""Rock 'Em, Sock 'Em Robots."" A research note from Piper Jaffray last week also cited new smarter technology, and potentially more video-game/movie tie-ins than in years past, as things that could make for a better experience and draw more traffic.RELATED:Beer, Wings And Fighting Robots Work For Dave & Buster'sEstimates: Fiscal second-quarter EPS of 14 cents, a 22% drop, with a 21% slide in revenue to $104.97 billion.

Same-store sales flat to down 2%.Stock: Sonic fell 3.4% late. Shares rose 2.4% to finish at 23.92 but are still below their 50- and 200-day averages.As with other restaurants, analysts expect bad weather and sparser mall and retail traffic over the holidays to weigh on Sonic's results. Stephens analyst Will Slabaugh, in a research note Monday, also cited ""a lack of high-impact product news during a period of aggressive peer discounting.""""However,"" he continued, ""we expect more aggressive menu additions in the spring and summer that likely focus on Sonic's core competencies and coincide with the brand's seasonal uptick in sales volumes."" But McDonald's (MCD) cheap-drink promotions in April could hurt, Cowen analyst Andrew Charles warned in a note last week.The results from Sonic and Dave & Buster's come a day after Darden, the parent of Olive Garden and LongHorn Steakhouse, reported quarterly results and full-year profit guidance that topped views.Shares jumped 9.3% to close at 82.62 Tuesday, blowing past a 77.21 buy point, soaring through the buy zone, and hitting a record high.RELATED:Happy Meals On Wheels: McDonald's Touts '3-Mile' Delivery AdvantageEstimates: Fourth-quarter EPS of 35 cents, a 13% increase, on a 15% boost in sales to $280.38 million.Results: EPS of 39 cents on revenue of $283.4 million.

272,DRI,"A blowout private-payroll report from ADP and rebounding oil prices initially helped put the major U.S. stock indexes on pace for weekly gains. A strong start from the tech sector, led by Tesla (TSLA), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL) and its suppliers also helped send the Nasdaq to fresh record highs.But that all changed with the minutes from the Federal Reserve's March meeting, as policymakers signaled a surprise tilt toward more monetary tightening. Signs of disarray in Washington, D.C., on the effort to overhaul taxes also weighed on markets. Official U.S. jobs data showing conflicting signals Friday failed to bolster the market, nor did a strong IPO from tech company Okta. The Dow Jones industrial average closed about flat  for the week, while the S&P 500 was down 0.3% and the Nasdaq was off 0.6%.The Labor Department's March payroll report showed a gain of just 98,000 jobs, barely over half of what analysts expected, and January's and February's gains were revised lower. But the unemployment rate fell to a 10-year low of 4.5% as a separate survey found a robust jump in employment. Much of the weakness in payrolls was blamed on unseasonable weather. Underlying trends could be stronger. ADP's private-sector hiring report earlier in the week put March's jobs gain at 263,000. The overall direction of jobs, wages and inflation is seen putting pressure on the Fed to tighten monetary policy.RELATED:Minutes of the Federal Reserve's March 14-15 meeting released Wednesday afternoon revealed that policymakers are ready to start shrinking the central bank's $4.5 trillion balance sheet later this year.The move, which amounts to a tightening of monetary policy, would begin to reverse the accommodation from the Fed's unconventional asset-buying programs launched in late 2008 to combat the financial crisis.The revelation helped turn a solid stock market advance into a small loss. Some analysts suggested that the Fed's policy signal could mean an unexpected rate hike in September, following a widely expected one in June. That would allow the Fed to start reducing the size of its balance sheet in December by no longer reinvesting all of the principal returned when its bond holdings mature.Separately, Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Richmond regional Fed bank, abruptly resigned after admitting that he violated the Fed's confidentiality rules in 2012 by speaking with a financial analyst about policy deliberations.RELATED:Okta (OKTA) raised $187 million late Thursday, pricing 11 million shares at 17, the high end of its estimated range. The stock climbed 38% over its IPO price to close at 23.51 on the Nasdaq Friday. That price values the company at over $2 billion. Okta's Identity Cloud platform provides identity management services for businesses. The San Francisco-based company is the fourth new company worth more than $1 billion to come public this year, following the successful IPOs of MuleSoft (MULE) Presidio (PSDO) and Snap (SNAP).RELATED:Tesla stock soared to a record high, following its Sunday report on car deliveries that beat expectations. Tesla now has a higher market valuation than Ford (F), which sold off Monday on weak U.S. auto sales for March. CEO Elon Musk mocked Tesla short sellers in a Monday tweet. Tesla delivered just over 25,000 vehicles in the first quarter, above its target of 23,000-24,500 vehicles and above Wall Street estimates for about 24,200.RELATED:Panera Bread (PNRA) agreed to be bought by Luxembourg's JAB for $7.5 billion including debt, or $315 per share. The deal is expected to close in the third quarter. JAB also owns Caribou Coffee, Krispy Kreme Doughnuts, Keurig Green Mountain and Peet's Coffee & Tea. It's the fourth major restaurant acquisition this year following Restaurant Brands' (QSR) purchase of Popeyes, Golden Gate Capital's buyout of Bob Evans Farms and Darden Restaurants (DRI) buying Cheddars. Other transactions could be on the horizon given analysts' forecasts for restaurant traffic to remain under pressure this year as consumers opt to save money and eat at home.RELATED:Google continued introducing remedies to quash an advertising crisis at YouTube that derailed a rally in parent Alphabet's (GOOGL) stock in mid-March. Google introduced a new system that lets outside firms verify ad quality standards on its video service. The advertising uproar began in Europe when major brands complained about ad placement next to videos that promoted hate, violence and racism. Analysts say some advertisers that have suspended ads on YouTube are seeking concessions from Google, aside from resolving the ad placement issue. YouTube, meanwhile, launched a $35 monthly TV streaming service in five U.S. markets — New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Chicago and Philadelphia.Meanwhile, Amazon's video business rolled ahead. It won rights to stream 10 National Football League games this fall — taking the ball from Twitter (TWTR), which held the same rights last year. Amazon is paying a big price for the privilege. It's paying $50 million, which is $40 million more than Twitter paid.

It means Merck still has some work to do to get approval for including cardiovascular outcomes data on the labels for Januvia, Janumet and Janumet XR. Merck said it is exploring its options. The stock lost ground early Friday but recouped most of the losses, closing down 0.2%.U.S. airstrikes on Syria lit up defense stocks Friday.

274,DRI,"Shares of Dow Jones industrial average component McDonald's (MCD) cleared a buy point Wednesday, as several other restaurant stocks closed in on their own entries amid JAB's $7.5 billion buyout of Panera Bread (PNRA).The takeover of the fast-casual chain was the latest in the restaurant sector in the last few months. Olive Garden parent Darden Restaurants (DRI) announced last week the acquisition of Cheddar's Scratch Kitchen for $780 million in cash. And Burger King parent Restaurant Brands International (QSR), which also owns Tim Hortons, said in late February that it would acquire Popeye's Louisiana Kitchen for around $1.8 billion.Shares of McDonald's closed 0.9% higher at 130.41 on the stock market today, topping a 130.10 buy point, bucking the Dow index's 0.2% retreat, and getting closer to its all-time high of 131.96, reached in May of last year.McDonald's stock had formed a nearly yearlong cup-with-handle base, with shares rising steadily in 2017 as the 50-day moving average crossed above the 200-day line in mid-January, which is generally a bullish technical indicator.Shares of the Big Mac maker also got a bit of a boost after announcing last week that it will offer fresh-beef Quarter Pounders, served cooked to order.IBD'S TAKE: Can a ""golden cross"" be your ticket to profits? When a shorter-term moving average crosses above a longer-term moving average, it can be positive confirmation of an uptrend. (Though it isn't mentioned often in IBD ""because it tends to be late compared to most of our buying rules,"" says markets writer Justin Nielsen. Restaurant Brands rose 0.5% to 56.06, working its way through a flat base with a 58.08 buy point. Jack in the Box (JACK) ended flat at 101.68 vs. a 113.40 buy point, and Wendy's (WEN) rose 1.2% to 13.53, nearing its 14.57 entry.Meanwhile, Cheesecake Factory (CAKE) dipped 0.1% to 63.42, below a 64.51 buy point, and Habit Restaurants (HABT) ended unchanged at 17.45, near an 18.10 entry. Shake Shack (SHAK) fell 2.1%, and BJ's Restaurants (BJRI) was flat.

Wall Street expects same-store sales to fall 1.3%, according to Consensus Metrix.""Key sales drivers cited by franchisees incl.: (1) expansion of Big Mac platform (launched nationwide in ~late Jan.), (2) $1 drip coffee/$2 McCafe promo and (3) local McPick 2 deals,"" Credit Suisse analyst Jason West wrote in a research note on Friday.He said he believed that McDonald's U.S. same-store sales were ""flattish"" in January, but picked up in February and the first half of this month prior to Winter Storm Stella.That storm, which this week disrupted air travelers' plans, forced some store closures and likely hurt McDonald's sales in parts of the Northeast, West wrote. But its impact on the chain's U.S. same-store sales overall might be only around 15 to 20 basis points for the first quarter.The apparent gains from McDonald's cheaper coffee and drinks deals would come as Starbucks (SBUX) showed signs of losing foot-traffic share in the U.S. in January.McDonald's has said it is testing out food delivery and will launch a mobile order and pay system by the end of the year. It's reported begun testing mobile order and pay  in some markets. That technology is among the biggest breakthroughs for convenience in generations for the restaurant industry. But it has also resulted in problems managing the flow of people in and out of restaurants, as Starbucks has found.McDonald's rose as high as 129.98 in the stock market today, just below a 130.10 cup-with-handle buy point. Shares closed up 0.5% at 128.64.Starbucks (SBUX) rose 1.8% to 55.78, closing just below its 200-day moving average and topping that key level intraday. Starbucks is working its way through a flat base.Dunkin' Brands, whose coffee service could be threatened by McDonald's price cuts, climbed 1.6% to 56.53, barely retaking a 56.23 buy point from a cup base. But volume is light.Olive Garden parent Darden Restaurants climbed 1.7% to 76.66, rising to 77.07 intraday.

283,DRI,"She turned down a headhunter five times in one month — passing on such enticements as higher pay and four weeks of paid vacation — but Lisa Aragon just couldn't get the job recruiter to take no for an answer.Aragon doesn't work in Silicon Valley or on Wall Street. Far from it. She manages a Wendy's (WEN) in Albuquerque, N.M. In 20 years, Aragon had never been pursued as aggressively as she had by the recruiter from the Pilot Flying J chain of truck stops, a major franchisee of fast-food restaurants.""I told him, 'I'm happy where I'm at,'"" said Aragon, 41, who already looked forward to quarterly bonuses and a bump for her work as a trainer. ""There's no need for change right now.""In today's tight labor market, restaurants are embroiled in a full-on food fight over workers. The rank-and-file is winning referral bonuses, free meals and days off, and the scarcity of candidates may be raising the minimum wage without help from lawmakers.The U.S. unemployment rate was 4.7% in December, near a nine-year low. With its insatiable appetite for new workers, the fast-food business serves as a leading indicator of a labor shortage. In September, annual turnover for restaurant workers jumped to 113%, the highest since industry-tracker People Report began collecting data in 1995.While that's good news for workers, it may not be for companies and customers. Restaurants will either have to raise prices or accept falling margins. Some stores' service is suffering.Andrew Puzder, President-elect Donald Trump's nominee for U.S. Labor Secretary, will be acutely aware of the phenomenon. A foe of raising the minimum wage, he is chief executive of privately held CKE Restaurants, which owns the Hardee's and Carl's Jr. burger chains. Further intensifying demand for lower-skilled employees, Trump has promised to curb illegal immigration.""It's a hot job market,"" said Michael Harms, executive director of operations at Dallas-based TDn2K, People Report's parent. ""Every employee, whether they're 17 years old or 40 years old, has options.""Aragon's boss is already pulling out all the stops to keep employees. Over the last year, Eddie Rodriguez, who operates 177 Wendy's in Florida, New Mexico and Texas, raised hourly pay by nearly a dollar, to an average $9.05.Rodriguez gave referral bonuses of up to $250 to employees who found prospects. He offered more flexible schedules and used his own headhunters to find staff for his corporate office in Pompano Beach, Fla. He also makes sure he doesn't take anyone for granted.""Today's employee, they want to feel wanted,"" Rodriquez said.Customers, however, may feel less appreciated. Rodriguez can't find enough employees for the lunchtime rush, which means it takes longer to get a junior bacon cheeseburger.Diners also are kept waiting at Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG), which is trying to hire about 600 ""crew members"" for its U.S. restaurants. To be able to pay more, the company, for the first time since 2014, is considering raising prices in some parts of the country.Chipotle is already paying an average $10 an hour. (For those inside the Federal Reserve looking out for evidence that the tightening labor market is sparking inflation, this could be exhibit A.)CEO Steve Ells in a December conference call complained that the lack of well-trained workers has resulted in napkins left on tables, untidy drink stations and slower meals.""We took our eye off the ball on the customer service side,"" Ells told investors.Restaurants aren't just competing with the fast-food joint down the street. Wal-Mart Stores (WMT) last year raised wages of more than a million employees to either at least $10 an hour or by 2% for those making more.Casual restaurants such as Olive Garden-owner Darden Restaurants (DRI) and quick-service haunts like Yum Brands' (YUM) Taco Bell are all struggling to hire.""It's as hard as it's ever been to attract and retain great people,"" said Greg Flynn, Chairman and CEO of Apple American Group, a franchisee of Applebee's, Taco Bell and Panera Bread (PNRA) restaurants.Terry Smith, a franchisee who owns three McDonald's (MCD) restaurants, said he has been able to avoid the crunch and maintain his staff of 150 to 160 employees with small perks such as free meals and paid days off. He also visits each of his restaurants every day, making sure he knows workers by name.""I rotate through the restaurants and they see me,"" he said. ""If you treat them right and have a vested interest in them, they'll stick around.""

284,DRI,"The employment report out on Friday at 8:30 a.m. ET is expected to show that the economy added 175,000 jobs in December, continuing the solid trend of recent months.But the real focus will be on wage growth and the jobless rate, which both delivered big surprises in last month's report.After the rise in average hourly earnings hit a seven-year high of 2.8% in October, wages backslid in November, slipping 0.1% and bringing the annual rate down to 2.5%. Friday's report could indicate whether that was just a statistical quirk.The consensus view is that December's report will show a 0.3% rise in average hourly earnings from November. Jefferies economists Ward McCarthy and Thomas Simons expect a 0.4% jump, lifting annual wage gains to a new cycle high of 2.9%.In November, the jobless rate surprisingly fell to a nine-year low of 4.6% from 4.9% amid a drop in workforce participation. The volatile household survey had been showing that more workers had been coming off the sidelines to participate in a stronger job market. Economists expect Friday's report to show the jobless rate rising to 4.7%, indicating that November's report somewhat overstated how tight the labor market is.Wage gains and the unemployment rate are both key indicators for the real question on everyone's mind: Can the job market accommodate President-elect Donald Trump's fiscal fuel without overheating? That won't be clear for some time and depends greatly on the size of the fiscal package that comes out of Congress, but Friday's report will offer some clues and could affect expectations for how fast the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates in the coming year.IBD'S TAKE: The Federal Reserve, long worried about paltry growth, has shifted to the role of traffic cop. Now the key question is whether Donald Trump's fiscal fuel will raise the economy's speed limit, allowing for faster growth without pushing inflation much above the Fed's comfort zone.On Thursday, ADP reported that private employers added 153,000 jobs in December, somewhat less than expected. The ADP has an uneven record of predicting Labor's nonfarm payrolls. Meanwhile, initial jobless claims tumbled by 28,000 to 235,000 in the week ended Dec. 260,000.Incoming evidence from corporate earnings reports suggests that wage pressures are continuing to rise moderately.On a Dec. 6 earnings call, Dave & Buster's Entertainment (PLAY) said it expected wage inflation of about 5% in the fourth quarter, up from its September projection of 4% to 4.5% for the second half of 2016.Casey's General Stores (CASY) highlighted ""increased wage pressures"" on a Dec. 8 earnings call as the prime factor behind a 4.9% increase in same-store operating costs.Casey's management also said they would stick by a planned annual salary increase of $10 million to avoid overtime pay under the Obama administration's Labor Department rule that was to take effect on Dec. 1., even though the election and an eleventh-hour injunction mean it's unlikely to be implemented without major changes.While it would be hard for any company to retract commitments for pay hikes once announced, Chief Financial Officer Bill Walljasper said the decision is in keeping with Casey's goal ""to be the employer of choice in our market area, and so part of that for us is to have competitive wages at competitive benefits.""Wal-Mart (WMT) boosted minimum salaries for assistant store managers to $48,500 from $45,000, effective in September, to avoid being liable for overtime pay.""Labor is under some pressure,"" Darden Restaurants (DRI) CEO Gene Lee said on a Dec. 20 earnings call, when asked about the company's guidance for modestly higher labor inflation.""We're operating in a low unemployment situation and in that environment we're going to continue to see wage increases,"" Lee said, according to a Seeking Alpha transcript. But he added that such environments have been ""great for our business"" in the past, and he's optimistic that ""this wage inflation that we're seeing is going to turn into discretionary income and some of it's going to end up back in our restaurants.""RELATED:Jobless Rate Dives To 9-Year Low; Is Labor Market Too Tight?How Overtime Pay Ruling Affects Wal-Mart, Dollar Tree, Fast Food

285,DRI,"The U.S. economy added 156,000 jobs in December as the unemployment rate ticked up to 4.7%, the Labor Department reported on Friday.The consensus of Wall Street forecasters was for a 175,000 payroll gain and a 4.7% jobless rate.November payrolls were revised higher and October jobs lower, reflecting a net increase of 19,000. The jobless rate rose as more people entered the labor force.Average hourly earnings rose 0.4% from November and 2.9% from a year ago, the best annual growth since 2009. That followed a reported 0.1% fall in hourly wages in last month's report.After the report, stock futures climbed into positive territory. The 10-year Treasury yield rebounded to 2.40%, recovering much of the steep drop seen on Thursday, amid a mixed picture of faster wage growth but slightly higher unemployment. The dollar also bounced back from a bout of selling.The faster pace of wage gains in December reported by the Labor Department jibes with what companies have been saying:On a Dec. 6 earnings call, Dave & Buster's Entertainment (PLAY) said it expected wage inflation of about 5% in the fourth quarter, up from its September projection of 4% to 4.5% for the second half of 2016.Casey's General Stores (CASY) highlighted ""increased wage pressures"" on a Dec. 8 earnings call as the prime factor behind a 4.9% increase in same-store operating costs.""Labor is under some pressure,"" Darden Restaurants (DRI) CEO Gene Lee said on a Dec. 20 earnings call, when asked about the company's guidance for modestly higher labor inflation. ""We're operating in a low unemployment situation and in that environment we're going to continue to see wage increases.""The retail sector added 6,300 jobs in December, ahead of a wave of post-holiday store closings and layoffs announced by Macy's (M) and Sears (SHLD), which are being hurt by competition from Amazon (AMZN) and low mall traffic. Macy's will cut 10,000 jobs as it named the 68 stores it will shut down soon, part of a plan to shutter 100 stores. Sears will close 150 Sears and Kmart locations.IBD'S TAKE: The Federal Reserve, long worried about paltry growth, has shifted to the role of traffic cop. Now the key question is whether Donald Trump's fiscal fuel will raise the economy's speed limit, allowing for faster growth without pushing inflation much above the Fed's comfort zone.The health care sector added 43,200 jobs; food service and drinking places 29,600; manufacturers 17,000; financial firms 13,000; and government 12,000. Most of the factory job gains came in durable goods manufacturing, where a 15,000 rise was the biggest in two years.The reported rise in the unemployment rate comes after minutes of the Federal Reserve's December 14 meetings showed that most policymakers see the labor market as being close to achieving the central bank's maximum-employment objective. A few policy committee members expressed concern that the jobless rate could substantially undershoot the target, leading to a buildup of inflationary pressures.The details of the household survey, which is used to derive the unemployment rate, showed that the number of people working part-time by choice jumped 192,000 on a seasonally adjusted basis to a record 21.3 million.The wage levels in the December report incorporate changes made by companies in preparation for the Obama administration's overtime rule that was slated to take effect Dec. 1 before a federal judge granted an 11th-hour injunction to states and business groups that filed suit.Casey's management said they would stick by a planned annual salary increase of $10 million to avoid overtime pay. While it would be hard for any company to retract commitments for pay hikes once announced, Chief Financial Officer Bill Walljasper said the decision is in keeping with Casey's goal ""to be the employer of choice in our market area, and so part of that for us is to have competitive wages at competitive benefits.""Wal-Mart (WMT) boosted minimum salaries for assistant store managers to $48,500 from $45,000, effective in September, to avoid being liable for overtime pay, which would be required for employees earning below $47,476 under the rule. The current salary threshold below which companies have to pay overtime is $23,660.Wal-Mart has raised base pay to attract and retain better staff, improving customer service and productivity.RELATED:Amazon Wins Christmas, And Its 50-Day, As Macy's, Malls MauledHow Overtime Pay Ruling Affects Wal-Mart, Dollar Tree, Fast Food

307,DRI,"Yum Brands (YUM), the owner KFC, Taco Bell and Pizza Hut, reported third-quarter earnings that missed Wall Street forecasts, and a key China metric fell far short of views less than a month before the spin-off of its operations in that countryEstimates: Earnings per share up 10% to $1.10, with revenue up 1% to $3.464 billion.Results: Adjusted EPS was $1.09. Revenue was $3.316 billion. China same-store sales fell 1%, below views for 4.1% growth, amid anti-Western protests after a court ruling against China's territorial claims in the South China Sea. KFC comp sales rose 4%, Pizza Hut comps dipped 1%, and Taco Bell's rose 3%.Outlook: Full-year core operation profit growth to be at least 15%, up from prior view of at least 14%.Stock: Yum Brands stock fell 2% in after-hours trading. During the regular session, shares closed down 1.9% to 88.61 in heavy volume on the stock market today, dropping below their 50-day line where they had found support last week.Why It Matters: Cheaper groceries and lingering dread over global politics have dampened customers' enthusiasm about dining out. Even pizza stocks like Domino's Pizza (DPZ) and Papa John's (PZZA) have lost support, after weeks of being outliers, in part due to their digitally focused model that makes ordering in easier. Both pizza stocks closed Wednesday above their 50-day lines.Yum Brands's Q3 results may have benefited from Taco Bell's Triple Double Crunchwrap and KFC's Extra Crispy chicken promotion, RBC said in a research note last month. But competition from Domino's may have hurt Pizza Hut, and the pizza chain's limited-time offerings may have been less effective, the firm added.Yum is set to complete its spinoff of its China business at the end of this month, and the company's U.S. results could become more important. Late Wednesday, Yum said Yum China Holdings will begin trading Nov. 1 on the NYSE under the ticker symbol YUMC.""Speaking of YUM! U.S. more broadly,"" Nomura analyst Mark Kalinowski said in a recent research note, ""investors may watch the U.S. same-store sales numbers a little more closely than they usually have in the past given that YUM! China is scheduled to become a master franchisee market shortly – thus likely rendering the U.S. business relatively more important to YUM's results post-spin than it has generally been pre-spin.""Yum's results come a day after Darden Restaurants (DRI), which operates Olive Garden, reported fiscal Q1 same-store sales and revenue that missed forecasts, while EPS topped and the company raised full-year EPS guidance.Last week, fast-food chain Sonic (SONC) gave preliminary Q4 EPS figures that were below consensus, warning about ""lower consumer spending in restaurants and continued aggressive competitive activity.""RELATED:Kroger Is Latest To Warn On Food Deflation, Doesn't Fear Wal-Mart

405,DRI,"Shares of specialty drugmaker Depomed (DEPO) jumped Friday after an activist investor took a stake in the company and challenged the management.Starboard Value LP, which has led high-profile efforts to shake up Darden Restaurants (DRI) and Yahoo (YHOO), announced that it had acquired a 9.8% stake in Depomed and sent a scathing letter to the company's CEO, James Schoeneck, and the board of directors.""Specifically, we have significant concerns regarding serious corporate governance deficiencies, questionable capital allocation decisions, and egregious actions taken by the board to stymie strategic interest in acquiring Depomed,"" wrote Starboard member Jeffrey Smith in the letter.The last item referred to the board's poison-pill provision adopted last year when Horizon Pharma (HZNP) attempted a hostile takeover, which was ultimately foiled. That seemed to be at the root of Starboard's complaint, and Smith charged that Depomed's board is making further moves to limit shareholder power.Smith cited a proposal to reincorporate Depomed, currently headquartered in Newark, Calif., in the state of Delaware, mentioned in the recent notice of the annual shareholder meeting to be held May 18. ""Upon further review, we identified unconventional provisions that indicate management and the board are using the reincorporation proposal as a tactic to further entrench themselves by suppressing shareholder rights that currently exist under Depomed-California,"" Smith wrote.Starboard filed a Record Date Request Notice asking to call a special shareholder meeting.Depomed issued a brief response saying that the company ""welcomes open communications with its shareholders"" but that it hadn't received any communication from Starboard before the letter. It urged shareholders to take no action.The moved came three days after Smith resigned as chairman of Darden Restaurants, a position he gained in 2014 after leading a similar, successful fight to replace Darden's board. Starboard is also currently attempting to replace the board of Yahoo.Depomed stock shot up more than 12% in morning trade on the stock market today, near 17.

412,DRI,"McDonald’s (MCD) took over the top spot from Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) as the favorite restaurant destination among U.S. teens and young adults in 2015, according to a new poll released Wednesday, with the burger giant benefiting from a rebound in the quick-service sector.Meanwhile, Starbucks (SBUX) remained a pretty popular destination among female respondents -- though less so than in previous years -- while Yum Brands’ (YUM) Taco Bell was a hit with young males.William Blair’s annual Teen/Young Adult Survey found that restaurant sentiment “weakened somewhat” in 2015, with about 43% of respondents saying they ate out more often than a year earlier vs. 48% in 2014. Still, those numbers compared well to the apparel category, where only 31% of respondents said they spent more on apparel in 2015.“For those eating out less often, financial reasons were by far the main culprit (40%), while the response ‘too expensive’ jumped to roughly 25% from 18% last year, perhaps reflecting push-back to price increases taken by restaurants on structural government-mandated wage inflation,” William Blair analyst Sharon Zackfia said in a report.She said the quick-service sector “had a quantum leap in popularity” in 2015. Eateries in this category accounted for 38% of total restaurant visits by respondents in 2015, up from 30% in 2014. This represented an all-time high for the survey, driven by strong share gains from McDonald’s and Taco Bell.Fast-casual visits fell to about 20% of total visits in 2015 from 28% the prior year, and Chipotle lost the biggest chunk of share. That was the case even though the survey was completed before the E. coli outbreak at Chipotle restaurants, which was first reported in the fall. Casual dining surpassed fast casual to become the second-most-frequented subsector in 2015.“In terms of frequency (of visits), McDonald’s topped the list across genders, while Chipotle fell to second among females (from first the prior year) and third among males (from second the prior year),” Zackfia said.Among female respondents, Panera Bread (PNRA) held the third spot behind McDonald’s and Chipotle for the second year in a row. Starbucks remained in fourth place, though the percentage of female respondents who said they ate there most often fell to 6.3% in 2015 from 7.2% in 2014. Darden Restaurants' (DRI) Olive Garden rounded out the top five among females.“McDonald’s gained material share over the past year across both genders, with the second-highest share gains behind Olive Garden for females and Taco Bell for males,” Zackfia noted.Among male respondents, Taco Bell ranked second behind McDonald’s as the most-visited restaurant. It was followed by Chipotle, DineEquity’s (DIN) Applebee’s and Wendy’s (WEN).Shares of McDonald’s closed down 0.3% on the stock market today.Chipotle rose 3.1%, Starbucks lost 0.8%, Yum fell 1%, Panera fell fractionally, Darden and  Dinequity climbed 0.7%, and Wendy’s retreated 0.4%.Image provided by Shutterstock.
"
413,DRI,"The collapse in crude oil prices has slashed the U.S. oil rig count by 75%, but those expecting Texas to suffer an economic meltdown as it did during the 1980s should think again, economists say.First, the bad news. The Dallas Federal Reserve's region, which is more exposed to energy markets, had another bad month. While its general activity index improved slightly to -31.8 in February from -34.6 in January, it remains deep in contraction and at levels not seen since the recession.The production subindex was also up slightly but still negative, while gauges for new orders and employment were at their lowest since 2009.Layoffs in the energy sector began at the blue-collar level and are working their way up to the white-collar level, according to Patrick Jankowski, senior vice president of research at the Greater Houston Partnership.The Texas unemployment rate rose in December to 4.7%, thought it's still below the national average of 4.9%. A 70% plunge in crude oil prices since June 2014 has been a big culprit.Since 2014, Houston-based oilfield services giant Halliburton (HAL) has cut 22,000 employees worldwide, or 25% of its workforce. Rival Schlumberger (SLB), also based in Houston, has laid off 34,000 globally, or 26% of its workforce, since the end of 2014.Energy's problems are also impacting everything from homebuilders to restaurants. During their most recent quarterly earnings reports, KB Home (KBH), PulteGroup (PHM) and Lennar (LEN) each reported weakness for homes in the Houston market.Meanwhile, Olive Garden parent Darden Restaurants (DRI) reported seeing some weakness in its Texas chains, and Polaris Industries (PII), a maker of all-terrain vehicles and motorcycles, also found that oil and gas regions hurt Q4 earnings and predicted continued softness this year.So, while things are grim, it's important to keep some perspective. Texas has a population of more than 26 million people, spread out in 254 counties and living in several dozen metropolitan areas and countless rural communities. While Houston has a significant exposure to oil, major cities such as Dallas-Fort Worth, Austin, San Antonio and El Paso do not.""The economic impact varies across the state,"" said Bud Weinstein, associate director of the Maguire Energy Institute at Southern Methodist University. ""The oil-producing regions of the state have been hit the hardest.""Texas also has a $16 billion rainy day fund, largely derived from the energy sector, which can cover any shortfalls in state tax revenue caused by the oil bust. Texas also relies less on oil and gas taxes than other energy-heavy peers do.The Lone Star State generates about 9% of its revenue from oil and gas taxes vs. more than 40% for states like Alaska and North Dakota.Texas is better suited to withstand sustained low prices than it was during the 1980s, when the bottom fell out of the oil market. With help from the rise of technology, health and other industries, the Texas economy is more diverse.Oil and gas represents about 14% of the state's economy vs. more than 20% in the 1980s, Comptroller Glenn Hegar told lawmakers last month.The Dallas-Fort Worth area, a laggard during the economic recovery after the recession, currently has thriving business services and technology sectors. Its tax incentives, major international airport, and affordable housing costs have attracted companies seeking to relocate their headquarters. For example, Toyota Motor (TMC) is moving its U.S. base to the Dallas suburb of Plano.The petrochemical sector, which often runs counter-cyclical to oil, is performing well, with Dow Chemical (DOW) and Chevron (CVX) building projects in the Houston area.Lastly, limits on interstate banking helped exacerbate the economic crisis in Texas during the 1980s, when collapsing oil prices as well as overbuilding in commercial and residential real estate led to smaller Texas banks failing.Today, big banks such as JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Wells Fargo (WFC) and Bank of America (BAC) have footholds in Texas. Although each lender has boosted its energy loan loss reserves (JPMorgan alone increased its reserve to $1.5 billion for Q1), sustained low oil prices are unlikely to lead to widespread banking failures.Like any industry during a downturn, the Texas oil sector will be forced to become more efficient.""The energy industry will be smaller,"" Jankowski said. ""It will find a way to produce the same amount of oil with fewer people and more technology.""

416,DRI,"A winter storm bearing down on the East Coast will likely have a significant impact on sales at publicly traded restaurants with a large exposure to the area, with Darden Restaurants (DRI) and Texas Roadhouse (TXRH) considered to be two of the most vulnerable.Winter Storm Jonas is expected to unload heavy snow and possible blizzard conditions on large swaths of the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast, including major metro areas like Washington, D.C., New York and Philadelphia. Because the storm will hit over the weekend, when a lot of eateries see heavy traffic, restaurant operators are bracing for a big slowdown in revenue.""We see the snowstorm headed for the East Coast, which to date has had a rather uneventful winter, as a significant weather event for this weekend,"" Maxim Group analyst Stephen Anderson noted in a Thursday morning report. That's especially true for full-service restaurant chains that depend on weekend traffic for a big chunk of their business, he said.""Casual-dining restaurants with a significant exposure to weekend traffic in the Northeast, particularly Darden and Texas Roadhouse, will be most affected by the storm,"" Anderson said, adding that both companies have more than 20% of their units in the affected states.Anderson sees a more limited impact on quick-service and fast-casual chains, with the most affected there expected to be Dunkin' Brands (DNKN), Panera Bread (PNRA) and Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG).""However, we contend that these chains can take some solace in the fact that they are more dependent on weekday traffic than on weekend traffic, and that temperatures in the area are forecast to rebound above freezing for the work week, thereby minimizing the potential impact for these names,"" Anderson said.Shares of Darden, whose holdings include the Olive Garden and Capital Grille chains, rose 1.1% on the stock market today. Texas Roadhouse fell 1.25%, Dunkin' rose 1% and Panera fell 0.65%. Chipotle fell 0.9% as it attempted to crawl back up from the pounding it has taken following E. coli and norovirus outbreaks at some of its restaurants.Meanwhile, airlines have issued warnings due to the storm. Southwest Airlines (LUV) announced a travel advisory stating that its Friday and Saturday services will likely be delayed, diverted or cancelled. Delta Airlines (DAL) issued an advisory as well and said travelers flying through certain parts of the affected areas from Jan. 22 to Jan. 24 are entitled to refunds if their flights are canceled or significantly delayed.Follow Vance Cariaga on Twitter: @IBD_VCariaga.

Earnings also grew 33.1% from the year-ago quarter driven by higher revenues and lower food costs.Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. Quote Chipotle had a good share of negative publicity throughout 2016 due to an issue of food-borne illnesses that surfaced toward 2015-end. As a safety measure, the company was forced to close several outlets. Ever since then, this fast-casual Mexican chain has been undertaking aggressive efforts to restore its economic model as well as regain customer trust.In order to chalk out a viable business strategy, Chipotle discarded its former co-CEO model and recently appointed former Yum! Brands' (YUM  -  Free Report) executive Brian Niccol as the CEO. Niccol’s expertise in restaurant operations, digital technologies and branding has significantly helped Chipotle in first-quarter earnings. Shares jumped 10.7% in after-hours trading on Apr 25. The company’s shares have also rallied 48.2% in the past six months, outperforming the industry’s gain of 1.5%. Let’s have a detailed look at the quarter’s results.Revenues and Comparable Restaurant SalesQuarterly revenues of $1.15 billion met the consensus estimate but grew 7.4% year over year. The revenue growth is primarily attributable to improvement in comps and restaurant openings. The company opened 35 new restaurants in the first quarter and closed two restaurants, bringing the total restaurant count to 2,441.Comps in the quarter increased 2.2%, which include an underlying comp sales growth of 2.7% and 50 basis points (bps) impact related to deferred revenues, recognized during the year-ago quarter due to the Chiptopia Summer Rewards program. Comps were driven by an increase in average check, including 4.9% benefit from menu price increase, partially offset by fewer transactions and resistance that have been less than 20%. The check average also benefited from customers, adding queso to their orders, which added about 200 bps.Costs, Operating Highlights & Net IncomeFood costs, as a percentage of revenues, decreased 140 bps to 32.4% driven by cost savings in paper and packaging usage, as well as higher menu prices, partially offset by higher costs associated with preservative-free tortillas.General and administrative expenses came in at 6.7% of total revenues, reflecting an increase of 20 bps year over year, due to rise in headcount and higher bonus expenses. However, the increases were partially offset by lower stock-based compensation expense as a result of forfeitures of stock during the quarter. Restaurant-level operating margin was 19.5%, up 180 bps from 17.7% in the year-ago quarter. The upside was primarily driven by lower marketing and promotional expenses, and comps growth, partially offset by wage inflation at the crew and manager level.Net income in the quarter was $59.4 million, up from $46.1 million in the prior-year quarter.Balance SheetCash and cash equivalents as of Mar 31, 2018 were $231.8 million, compared with $184.6 million as of Dec 31, 2017.Inventory totaled $17.4 million as of Mar 31, 2018, down from $19.9 million as of Dec 31, 2017. Goodwill, as a percentage of total assets, was 1.04% at the end of the first quarter compared with 1.07% at the end of 2017.During the first quarter, the company’s board of directors approved an investment of up to an additional $100 million, exclusive of commissions, to repurchase shares of the company’s common stock.2018 OutlookFor 2018, management continues to expect comps growth in low single digits and launch 130-150 restaurants.Effective tax rate is estimated in the range of 32.5-33.5% (up from the previously guided range of 30-31%), including an underlying effective tax rate of about 29% in the second and third quarters, and up to 38.5% high in the fourth quarter as a result of an additional anticipated write-off of deferred tax assets associated with stock-based compensation awards.Zacks Rank & Peer ReleasesChipotle carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

501,DRI,"Restaurant Brands International, Inc.’s (QSR  -  Free Report) first-quarter 2018 earnings and revenues surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate.The company’s top line in the quarter was favored by continued positive sales momentum at Burger King while the bottom line benefitted from strong growth in revenues and favorable tax rate.Changes in Accounting StandardsThe company announced that it has implemented two new accounting standards that impacted first-quarter results.From the beginning of 2018, Restaurant Brands adopted a new revenue recognition accounting standard, under which the company is complying the initial and renewal franchise fees and recognizing revenues over the term of the related franchise agreement instead of franchise fee, at the time of executing all material obligations and services.Additionally, Restaurant Brands also adopted a new guidance related to hedge accounting. Under this guidance, the company will not include amounts pertaining to cross-currency rate swaps in net interest expenses. In this way, management expects to spot a benefit in net interest expense.Earnings & Revenue DiscussionPer the new accounting standard, adjusted earnings of 66 cents in the first quarter surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 56 cents by 17.9%. Earnings under the previous accounting standard came in at 67 cents, which also grew 86.1% year over year.Total revenues of $1,253.8 million surpassed the consensus estimate of $1,126 million by 11.3%.

Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Restaurant Brands International Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Restaurant Brands International Inc. QuoteDetailed Revenue Discussion by SegmentsRestaurant Brands operates through three segments — Tim Hortons, Burger King and Popeye’s Louisiana Kitchen.Tim Hortons reported revenues of $763.5 million, reflecting a rise of 4.1% from the prior-year quarter, primarily owing to greater franchise and property revenues. Under the previous standards of accounting, total revenues declined 3% year over year, primarily reflecting a decrease in supply chain-related revenues, partially offset by a favorable impact of FX movements.System-wide sales increased 2.1% on the back of net restaurant growth. Comps at this segment declined 0.3% in the quarter versus 0.1% decrease in the prior-year quarter and 0.1% increase in the preceding quarter. Comps were affected due to relatively flat Canada comparable sales.Burger King’s revenues were up 46% from the prior-year quarter to $389.9 million, mainly on the back of system-wide sales growth. Considering the previous accounting standard, total revenues in the quarter grew 9.7%.System-wide sales rose 11.3%, higher than 6.2% growth in the year-ago comparable period and 12.3% increase in the preceding quarter. System-wide sales growth can be attributed to net restaurant growth of 6.9% and positive comps growth.Comps grew 3.8% in the quarter under review versus 0.1% decline in the prior-year quarter and 4.6% increase in the preceding quarter. The upside was driven by U.S. comps growth of 4.2%.Popeye’s Louisiana Kitchen, which was acquired on Mar 27, 2017, reported revenues of $100.4 million in the quarter.System-wide sales rose 10.9%, owing to net restaurant growth of 6.7% and comps growth of 3.2%. Comps in the segment were driven by U.S. comparable sales growth of 2.3%.Operating Performance (Per the Previous Accounting Standard)The company’s adjusted EBITDA rose 8.7% (5% FX neutral), owing to revenue increase and cost management. Segment wise, Tim Hortons EBITDA fell 2.2% (6.1% on an FX neutral basis) year over year due to a decline in revenues. Burger King’s EBITDA was up 14.9% (11.5% on an FX neutral basis) year over year, driven primarily by revenue growth and cost control. Popeye’s EBITDA grew 80.5% (on both actual and organic count) on revenue growth.Cash and Capital The company exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalent balance of $852.4 million under the new accounting standard. Accounts and notes receivable balance was $467.6 million and inventories were $74.6 million.

Earnings increased 29.5% year over year on the back of higher revenues. Notably, the quarter marked the 14th consecutive earnings beat for the company. Darden’s impressive earnings also resulted from the company’s relentless efforts in improving the basic operating factors of the business — food, service and atmosphere.Total revenues of $2.13 billion slightly lagged the consensus mark of $2.15 billion. Revenues, however, increased 13.3% from the prior-year quarter. The upside was driven by 11.3% growth from the addition of 154 Cheddar's Scratch Kitchen and 34 other new restaurants.Revenues by SegmentsDarden reports its business under four segments: Olive Garden, LongHorn Steakhouse, Fine Dining, which includes The Capital Grille and Eddie V's, and Other Business.In the reported quarter, the company’s legacy brands posted blended comps growth of 2%. In the previous quarter, comps had increased 3.1%. Meanwhile, the company witnessed increased sales across all its segments in the fiscal third quarter.Sales at Olive Garden were up 3.7% year over year to $1.07 billion.

As a result, operating margin in the quarter contracted 124 basis points (bps) on a year-over-year basis.Net earnings in the third quarter were $217.8 million, recording 31.5% growth from the year-ago level.Balance SheetCash and cash equivalents as of Feb 25, 2018 was $146.8 million, down from $233.1 million as of May 28, 2018.Inventories totaled $208 million at the end of the reported quarter.

503,DRI,"Darden Restaurants, Inc.’s (DRI  -  Free Report) effective sales-boosting initiatives, Brand Renaissance Plan and synergies from Cheddar’s acquisition put the company on growth trajectory. However, high costs related to restaurant operations and stiff competition in the industry remain major concerns.Last month, Darden posted mixed third-quarter fiscal 2018 results, wherein earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate while revenues lagged the same. Also, both earnings and revenues in the last reported quarter grew 29.5% and 13.3%, respectively, from the prior-year quarter.The company’s relentless efforts in improving the basic operating factors of the business — food, service and atmosphere — remain the key growth driver.Notably, shares of Darden have rallied 7.4% in the past six months, outperforming its industry’s gain of 3.8%.Cheddar's Acquisition Drives Top LineDarden’s acquisition of small restaurant chain, Cheddar's Scratch Kitchen (Cheddar's), in April 2017, added an undisputed casual dining value to the company’s portfolio of differentiated brands. It also helped Darden to further enhance its scale.In the fiscal third quarter, total sales were favored by 11.3% from the addition of 154 Cheddar’s and 34 other new restaurants. Segmental sales also improved owing to Cheddar’s integration in the Other Business segment, which jumped 71.4% year over year to $438 million in the last reported quarter.Brand Renaissance Plan for Olive Garden & Other Sales-Building Efforts Boost CompsDarden implemented a set of initiatives under its Brand Renaissance Plan to boost the performance of the Olive Garden brand. These include simplifying kitchen systems, improving sales planning and scheduling, operational excellence to improve guest experience, developing new core menu items, allowing customization and making smarter promotional investments.Also, the brand is focusing on remodeling and bar refreshes. The revamped restaurants are already generating high same-restaurant sales and returns. In fact, the remodeling program has gained momentum in the last couple of quarters and the company intends to continue investing in remodeling for optimal returns. In fact, supported by these initiatives, Olive Garden posted the 14th consecutive quarter of positive comps in third-quarter fiscal 2018.Meanwhile, Darden is also focusing on technology-driven initiatives like the system-wide rollout of tablets, in order to capitalize on the digital wave that has hit the U.S. fast-casual restaurant sector. This initiative has boosted sales for the past few quarters. Sales of the company have also picked up momentum with the launch of mobile ordering in November 2014.High Costs Pose ConcernHigher labor costs due to increased wages and those incurred on implementation of the Affordable Care Act are expected to continue keeping Darden’s profits under pressure.Further, the non-franchised model makes the company susceptible to increased expenses. Since all the restaurants are owned and operated by Darden, so instead of signing franchise agreements and putting the burden of costs on the franchisee, the company is solely responsible for the expenses of operating the business.In fact, in the first nine months of fiscal 2018, total operating costs and expenses increased 14.4% year over year.Competitive Industry Puts Pressure on DardenDarden operates in the retail restaurant space that is highly dependent on consumer discretionary spending. Although higher disposable income and increased wages are favoring the industry right now, it can change with the slightest disruption in the economy. Darden, therefore, is highly vulnerable to the inconsistent nature of consumer discretionary spending. If the company does not make pragmatic use of advanced technologies to innovate across value chains, it has high chances of fading out like many other retailers. In fact, for the restaurant industry as a whole, the fourth quarter comps were up by a meager 0.4% after seven consecutive quarter of declining comps.Moreover, the retail restaurant space is highly competitive as numerous restaurant operators are adapting advanced and prudent strategies to increase their sales. These initiatives involve high costs. Darden also is bearing the brunt of higher operating cost from these sales building initiatives. In fact, in the first nine months of fiscal 2018, total operating costs and expenses increased 14.4% year-over-year. Amid such stiff competition, Darden is also missing out on international presence that other restaurant chains like McDonald's (MCD  -  Free Report), Domino’s (DPZ  -  Free Report) and Yum! Brands (YUM  -  Free Report) are aggressively pursuing.We believe that the company needs to expand its presence beyond the United States in order to offset the impact of cut-throat competition in the saturated domestic market.Zacks RankDarden carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

504,DRI,"Shares of Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG  -  Free Report) surged more than 1.2% in early morning trading Wednesday, making it one of the few glimmers of hope amid market-wide selling—inspired, in large part, by heightened concerns about a trade war between the U.S. and China.Trade war fears got very real on Wednesday after Chinese regulators announced additional tariffs on 106 U.S. products, or up to $50 billion worth of goods. The country’s new 25% levy on American imports will impact soybeans, cars, whiskey, and a number of other economic staples.China’s move comes less than a day after President Donald Trump released a list of Chinese imports that his administration plans to target as part of a proposed crackdown on what it deems to be unfair trade practices. Sectors impacted by Trump’s tariffs would include IT and communication technology, robotics, and aerospace.All 11 sectors of the S&P 500 were in negative territory early Wednesday morning following reports of these trade war maneuvers. However, companies like Chipotle—which famously sources its ingredients locally and is therefore less exposed to international tariffs—might stand to benefit as investors look to move away from heavily-trade-exposed segments of the economy.But is this embattled stock actually a smart pick right now? Let’s take a closer look.ValuationChipotle shares are currently trading at about 35.7x forward 12-month earnings. That might look cheap considering CMG has traded as high as 51.7x within the past year, but it is actually above the stock’s median 52-week Forward P/E of 35.1. What’s more, Chipotle is trading at a significant premium compared to the broader restaurant market:Chipotle might be less exposed to the potential trade war, but the stock is still more expensive than its peers—including companies like Brinker International (EAT  -  Free Report), Bloomin Brands (BLMN  -  Free Report), and Darden Restaurants (DRI  -  Free Report), which are also likely to be less affected by tariff issues. Investors scooping up CMG shares right now must seriously consider whether the stock warrants this premium.OutlookAnother thing to consider is that Chipotle’s analyst outlook has deteriorated substantially over the past few months. In fact, within the past 60 days, the company has witnessed 15 revisions to its current fiscal year earnings estimates, with 100% agreement to the downside. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Chipotle’s annual earnings has slipped $1.69 over that timeframe.Our proven Zacks Rank model places an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions, so this negative activity has earned CMG a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Possible UpsidesWhile Chipotle’s sluggish earnings outlook and questionable valuation present concerns, the stock does have some upside that might interest investors. First of all, it is still an interesting growth option as the company looks to recover from food safety concerns, and despite negative revisions, our consensus estimates are calling for Chipotle to witness EPS growth of 25% and revenue growth of 8% this fiscal year.Meanwhile, the company has undergone a significant transformation in terms of its management team recently, bringing on former Taco Bell chief Brian Niccol as its new CEO. Niccol has already shown signs that he will use his experience at the fast-food taco chain to his advantage, adding Chris Brandt, who led marketing efforts at Taco Bell for years, as the company’s new chief marketing officer.These positive trends might be enough to inspire some investors, especially considering that Chipotle is likely less exposed to the possible trade war that is dominating headlines.Want more market analysis from this author?

505,DRI,"Sonic Corp. (SONC  -  Free Report) has announced mixed results for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 wherein earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate but revenues missed the same.Adjusted earnings of 17 cents outpaced the consensus estimate and improved from the prior-year quarter’s 15 cents by 13.3%. The reported figure incorporated benefits of the lower tax rate and improved costs. Without the impact of the tax reform, the bottom line would have declined 13% from the year-ago quarter, primarily due to lower comps.The company’s second quarter generally faces volatility due to weather conditions. Moreover, since Sonic’s product mix primarily consists of ice-creams and beverages, winters do not particularly mark an ideal time for sales growth. Further, a highly competitive industrial landscape with restaurant bigwigs doling out offers and discounts has led to a sales slump during the reported quarter. Meanwhile, management lowered its fiscal 2018 outlook.Sonic Corp. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Sonic Corp. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Sonic Corp. QuoteAll the above factors might have also hurt investors’ sentiment as shares of Sonic lost 4.7% in after-hours trading post the company’s earnings release on Mar 27. Additionally, the stock has gained 0.5% in the past year, underperforming the industry’s rally of 10.2%.Let us delve deeper into the numbers.Revenues and CompsTotal revenues of $88.1 million missed the consensus estimate of $93.9 million by 6.2%. The top line also declined 12% year over year, affected by an unfavorable weather and intense competitive pressure.System comps dipped 2.9% in the quarter, consisting of a 2.8% comps decrease at franchise drive-ins and a 3.7% decline at company drive-ins.Operating Highlights & Net IncomeTotal costs and expenses dropped 5.6% year over year in the fiscal second quarter to nearly $73.2 million. This upside was mostly attributable to an overall reduction in the total cost of company drive-in sales, having declined 17.8% year over year to $47.1 million. Company drive-in margins expanded by 40 basis points with the opening of eight new drive-ins.Net income for the period came in at $19.6 million, reflecting a whopping 78.8% year-over-year increase, favored primarily by tax benefits.Balance SheetCash and cash equivalents as of Feb 28, 2018 were $64.2 million, up from $22.3 million as of Aug 31, 2017. Long-term debt increased to $706.5 million at the end of the fiscal second quarter from $628.1 million reported as of Aug 31, 2017.Stockholder’s deficit rose to $252.7 million from $201 million in the same time period. During the quarter, the company repurchased 1.2 million outstanding shares.Fiscal 2018 Outlook TrimmedFor fiscal 2018, Sonic expects adjusted earnings per share to be up 2-7% year over year, excluding the impact of the U.S. tax reform (lower than the earlier guided range of 5-10%). Including tax benefits, adjusted EPS is expected in the range of $1.43-$1.50. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in 2018 is pegged at $1.52, higher than the company’s guided range.Comps are projected in the band of down 1% to up 1% year over year, lower than the earlier view of flat to up 2% comps. Drive-in-level margins are anticipated within 15-15.5%, down from the previous prediction of 15.1-15.7%, depending on the degree of comps growth at company drive-ins.Sonic is likely to repurchase approximately $160 million shares across the fiscal year and deliver a quarterly cash dividend of 16 cents per share. Free cash flow is estimated at $60-$63 million (tweaked from $60-$65 million in the past) for 2018.Zacks Rank & Peer ReleaseSonic carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Darden (DRI  -  Free Report) reported mixed third-quarter fiscal 2018 results wherein adjusted earnings of $1.71 per share beat the consensus mark of $1.64 by 4.3%. Earnings also increased 29.5% year over year on the back of higher revenues.Stocks to ConsiderTwo better-ranked stocks in the restaurant space are Dine Brands (DIN  -  Free Report) and Ruth’s Hospitality Group (RUTH  -  Free Report).

509,DRI,"PVH Corporation (PVH  -  Free Report) is slated to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Mar 28. The question lingering in investors’ minds is whether this designer and marketer of branded apparel, footwear and other accessories will be able to deliver positive earnings surprise in the to-be-reported quarter.The company delivered positive earnings surprise of 3.8% in the previous quarter. In the trailing four quarters, it outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 2.6%. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.What to Expect?The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is $1.47 per share, reflecting growth of 19.5% from the year-ago quarter. We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter has been stable in the last 30 days. Analysts polled by Zacks anticipate revenues of $2.34 billion, up 11.2% from the year-ago quarter.PVH Corp. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  PVH Corp. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | PVH Corp. QuoteMoreover, we note that the stock outperformed the industry in the last three months. The company’s shares have increased 6.7%, while the industry inched up 1%. Factors at PlayPVH boasts a spectacular positive earnings surprise record for 14 consecutive quarters along with five straight quarters of sales beat. This robust surprise trend is mainly backed by significant momentum at its premium Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger brands, particularly in the international regions.Going forward, PVH expects to deliver robust revenues and earnings in fourth-quarter and fiscal 2017. In fourth-quarter fiscal 2017, the company expects total revenues to jump 11% year over year, while it is anticipated to advance 8% on a constant-currency basis. Brand-wise, revenues are expected to jump 16% (or 12% on a currency-neutral basis) at Calvin Klein and 12% (or 7% on a currency-neutral basis) at Tommy Hilfiger, while revenues for Heritage Brands are anticipated to decline nearly 1%.Adjusted earnings per share for the fiscal fourth-quarter are expected to be $1.42-$1.44, including 2 cents per share positive impact from foreign currency translations. On a GAAP basis, the company envisions earnings per share of $1.35-$1.37.For fiscal 2017, the company anticipates revenues to increase 7% year over year while currency neutral revenues are anticipated to grow 6%. Also, management envisions fiscal 2017 adjusted earnings per share to be $7.78-$7.80.However, concerns regarding the volatile macroeconomic and geopolitical environment remain. Moreover, PVH Corp.’s significant international presence, as well as outlets in various tourist destinations across the United States, exposes it to foreign currency risks. In fact, currency headwinds have been hurting the company’s results for a while now.While currency rates are expected to improve in the fourth quarter, it is likely to hurt fiscal 2017 earnings by 17 cents per share.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not show that PVH Corp. is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.PVH Corp. has an Earnings ESP of -0.80%.

The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because Darden Restaurants is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings—with the most up-to-date information possible—is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for DRI in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently $1.65 per share for DRI, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.64 per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for DRI, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +0.76% heading into earnings season.Darden Restaurants, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Darden Restaurants, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Darden Restaurants, Inc. QuoteWhy is this Important?A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market.

511,DRI,"Rite Aid Corporation (RAD  -  Free Report) is slated to report first-quarter fiscal 2019 results on Jun 27. The big question facing investors is whether this drug store retailer will be able to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported.In the last reported quarter, the company reported a positive surprise, with loss of 1 cent per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of loss of 2 cents. Further, the company has topped estimates in two of the trailing four quarters. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.What to Expect?The Zacks Consensus Estimate suggests that the company is likely to post break-even results for the quarter under review, against loss of 5 cents per share reported in the year-ago quarter. We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate has been stable in the last 30 days. Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $5.35 billion, down 31.2% from the prior-year quarter.Rite Aid Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Rite Aid Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Rite Aid Corporation QuoteHowever, Rite Aid’s shares have surged 11.8% in the past month, outperforming the industry’s increase of 1.7%. This could be attributed to the optimism arising from the completion of store sales to Walgreens (WBA  -  Free Report) and the pending merger deal with Albertsons. Clearly, there is positive momentum for the stock, ahead of the fiscal first-quarter earnings release. Factors at PlayRite Aid stock is witnessing an increase due to positive developments such as its recent merger deal with grocer Albertsons Companies. The transaction is expected to close in the second half of the calendar year 2018. Moreover, Rite Aid’s efforts to boost market share through wellness remodeling and other strategic initiatives bode well. The company remodeled 38 outlets and relocated six stores in fourth-quarter fiscal 2018. As of Mar 3, 2017, it had 1,805 wellness stores.Furthermore, in fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 earnings call, Rite Aid outlined a robust initial view for fiscal 2019. The company anticipates benefiting from generic drug purchasing efficiencies, a stable reimbursement rate environment compared with fiscal 2018, and TSA fees related to the Walgreens deal along with other initiatives to grow sales and drive operational efficiencies.The company estimates sales of $21.7-$22.1 billion in fiscal 2019 with comps anticipated to be flat to up 1%. Further, the company expects adjusted net income per share of 2-6 cents compared with loss of 2 cents per share reported in fiscal 2018.However, the company’s dismal past performances, particularly the top line, remain concerns. Though its bottom-line results surpassed estimates in fourth-quarter fiscal 2018, sales lagged for the third straight quarter. Moreover, both earnings and sales dropped year over year. While the bottom-line beat was attributed to the improvement in reimbursement rates, it declined year over year due to the fall in adjusted EBITDA, higher Walgreens deal-related costs along with increased lease termination and impairment charges. Further, sales dipped on account of soft comps as well as the decline in revenues at Retail Pharmacy and Pharmacy Services segments.Though the company’s future prospects look bright, owing to the pending acquisition, solid fiscal 2019 outlook and other strategies, we remain a little skeptical about the near-term performance due to the company’s dismal past trends.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Rite Aid is likely to beat estimates this quarter.

512,DRI,"Darden Restaurants, Inc. (DRI  -  Free Report) is set to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Jun 21, before the opening bell.The company, like most other restaurant operators, has been bearing the burden of high costs associated with labor, food and beverage, and other restaurant operations. Moreover, Darden is particularly susceptible to increased expenses due to its non-franchised model. However, aggressive cost-saving initiatives are likely to aid the company in expanding margins. Thus, earnings are also likely to improve as a result.Notably, shares of Darden have gained 4.2% in the past year, outperforming its industry’s growth of 3.9%.Bottom-Line PictureDarden, like several other restaurant operators, is shouldering increased labor costs due to the Affordable Care Act. Moreover, sales-building strategies like greater focus on culinary innovation, restaurant remodeling and technology-driven initiatives are likely to add to the company’s expenses.Subsequently, in the first three quarters of fiscal 2018, Darden’s total operating costs and expenses increased 14.4% year over year to nearly $5.4 billion. This was caused by an overall increase in food and beverage costs, restaurant labor and expenses, marketing, as well as general and administrative expenses. This trend is likely to have continued in the fourth quarter as well.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for food and beverage expenses for the to-be-reported quarter is pegged at $606 million, suggesting an 8.6% year-over-year increase. Also, costs from labor and restaurant-level operation are estimated to be $684 million and $367 million, mirroring a year-over-year hike of 13.4% and 9.2%, respectively.However, despite prevailing high cost, Darden is focusing on an aggressive cost-management plan. For fiscal 2018, the company expects 10-40 basis points year-over-year margin expansion as a result of cost savings. We believe that cost savings and increased revenues across all brands are likely to have favored its margins in the to-be-reported quarter, which in turn should have boosted earnings of the company. The consensus estimate for fourth-quarter earnings is pegged at $1.35, mirroring 14.4% year-over-year growth.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderCurrently, Darden carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Some better-ranked stocks in the U.S. restaurant space include BJ’s Restaurants (BJRI  -  Free Report), Dine Brands (DIN  -  Free Report) and Wingstop (WING  -  Free Report), each sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

The brand is particularly focusing on remodeling and bar refreshes.The revamped restaurants are already generating high same-restaurant sales and returns. In fact, supported by these initiatives, Olive Garden posted the 14th consecutive quarter of positive comps in third-quarter fiscal 2018. Expecting this forward trend to continue, the consensus estimate for comps growth is pegged at 0.01% in the to-be-reported quarter.Comps at LongHorn are expected to grow year over year, owing to culinary innovation in the segment. Darden is also working on a marketing strategy to improve execution, customer-relationship management and digital advertising. Further, the company continues to focus on strengthening its in-restaurant execution through strategic investments in quality.Owing to these efforts, segment comps have been growing since the past 20 consecutive quarters and the trend is likely to continue in the to-be-reported quarter as well. The consensus estimate for the segment’s fourth-quarter comps is projected to grow 0.01%.Meanwhile, the acquisition of Cheddar’s seems to be a great fit in the company’s portfolio, as it not only complements its existing brands but is also expected to aid in attracting more customers, given its extensive appeal. Synergies from the buyout of Cheddar’s are expected to continue favoring the segment’s revenues in the to-be-reported quarter as well.Cost-Saving Efforts to Favor Bottom LineDarden has an aggressive cost-management plan, under which it has significantly cut operating costs.

515,DRI,"Darden Restaurants, Inc. (DRI  -  Free Report) is set to report third-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Mar 22, before the market opens.The company, like most other restaurant operators, has been bearing the burden of high costs associated with labor, food and beverage, and other restaurant operations. Moreover, Darden is particularly susceptible to increased expenses due to its non-franchised model. However, aggressive cost-saving initiatives are likely to aid the company's expand margins, thereby improving earnings.Notably, shares of Darden have rallied 23.2% in the past year, outpacing its industry’s gain of 13.8%. High Costs Likely to PrevailDarden, like several other restaurant operators, is shouldering increased labor costs due to the Affordable Care Act. Moreover, sales building strategies like greater focus on culinary innovation, restaurant remodeling and technology-driven initiatives are likely to add to the company’s expenses.Subsequently, in the second quarter of fiscal 2018, Darden’s total operating cost and expenses increased 14.8% year over year to nearly $1.8 billion. This was led by an overall increase in food and beverage costs, restaurant labor and expenses, marketing as well as general and administrative expenses.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for food and beverage expenses in the to-be-reported quarter is pegged at $618 million, suggesting a 14% year-over-year increase.Also, costs from labor and restaurant-level operation are estimated to be $677 million and $368 million, mirroring a year-over-year hike of 17.1% and 15%, respectively.Cost Savings to Benefit EarningsAmid a challenging cost environment, Darden is focusing on an aggressive cost management plan. For fiscal 2018, the company expects 10-40 basis points (bps) year-over-year margin expansion as a result of cost savings.In the second quarter of fiscal 2018, adjusted EBIT margin increased 10 bps from the year-ago quarter. The upside was favored by the company’s cost savings and comps growth. Food and beverage costs in the quarter compared favorably with 20 bps in the prior-year quarter. Pricing of roughly 1.5% and costs savings more than offset commodity cost inflation in the quarter.We believe, cost savings and increased revenues across all brands are likely to continue favoring the company’s EBIT margin and drive the to-be-reported quarter’s earnings. The consensus estimate for third-quarter earnings is pegged at $1.64, mirroring 24.2% year-over-year growth.Zacks Rank & Other Stocks to ConsiderDarden carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Other top-ranked stocks in the industry include DineEquity (DIN  -  Free Report), BJ's Restaurants (BJRI  -  Free Report) and Carrols Restaurant Group (TAST  -  Free Report).

517,DRI,"After surviving the seven-quarter long tragedy of declining comps, the U.S. restaurant industry received a pleasant surprise in the fourth quarter of 2017. According to TDn2K’s The Restaurant Industry Snapshot, comps for the fourth quarter were up 0.4%, comparing favorably with the third quarter’s comps decline of 1%.Should We Be Optimistic of Growth?The positive momentum in sales growth in the fourth quarter was not enough to outweigh the sluggish growth of the industry in 2017. For the full year, comps declined 1.1%, the same as in 2016. Traffic for the year also fell 3.2%.Amid declining traffic trends for the year, comps growth may have been aided by promotions and discounting strategies by restaurant managements. Over the past year, the restaurant industry’s shares have returned 14.9%, underperforming the growth of 16.2% for the S&P 500.However, most of the restaurants are undertaking aggressive sales-building strategies to drive demand. The fourth quarter already bore the fruit of these efforts. We believe that 2018 is set to witness an overall improvement in restaurant sales given an increase in consumer discretionary spending coupled with the restaurant bigwig’s sales-improvement efforts.Restaurant Operators Bullish About Industry ScenarioA turnover for most restaurants showed up in November 2017 and is ongoing. Moreover, according to TDn2K market research, the overall restaurant industry is starting to improve. Although not all brands may have an opportunity to rake in profits, many of the restaurants operators foresee consumer demand to rise and discretionary spending to increase in 2018.So, with growth around the corner, investors can consider a few stocks from the space that appear to hold promises for 2018.Picking the Right StocksWe have taken help of the Zacks Stock Screener to zero in on restaurants stocks that project year-over-year sales growth in 2018 and carry a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).

(BJRI  -  Free Report) is known for its continued menu innovation to drive sales growth.

518,DRI,"BJ’s Restaurants, Inc.’s (BJRI  -  Free Report) multiple sales boosting and cost-cutting initiatives are impressive. However, rising labor costs amid a tepid sales environment along with a slowdown in the company’s development plans remain potent headwinds.Recently, BJ’s Restaurants posted better-than-expected results in the fourth quarter of 2017. Adjusted earnings of 37 cents per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 32 cents by 15.6%. However, higher costs resulted in 32.7% year-over-year decline in earnings.Meanwhile, the company’s shares have returned 47.6% over the past six months, outpacing the industry’s gain of 4.4%. Ongoing upward earnings estimate revisions also reflect optimism in the stock’s prospects. Over the last 60 days, current-year earnings estimates have moved up 8.4%. Given its solid fundamentals, the stock should keep performing well in the quarters ahead.Menu & Digital-Based Innovations Drive the Top LineBJ’s Restaurants has implemented several major sales building initiatives in 2017 that have been tested over the year and have contributed positively to the company’s fourth-quarter sales. Management has been refining and streamlining its menu, with particular emphasis on its EnLIGHTened menu category to improve traffic. The company’s slow-roast menu also continues to drive healthy check growth.Moving ahead, the company plans to introduce new flavors. In fact, it expects to offset some of the labor cost through prudent menu innovation and pricing. Additionally, its promotional offers along with bundled lunch offerings should boost sales and drive guest traffic.BJ’s Restaurants is also investing heavily in technology-driven initiatives like digital ordering, to boost sales. The company’s app and digital platforms are allowing it to more effectively and efficiently offer promotions.Additionally, the company’s loyalty guest database continues to grow well with the steady increase in transactions. Other productivity improvement initiatives such as a centralized call center to capture more online orders are also expected to boost the top line, going ahead.Cost Cutting Leads to Margin ImprovementThrough an array of cost-containment strategies, BJ’s Restaurants is constantly trying to improve its operating margin. The company is focusing more on its smaller prototype restaurants that cost roughly $1 million less than the prior prototype. This should help in reducing operating costs. Due to lesser food wastage and improved labor productivity, these new restaurants generate higher margins.Moreover, in 2017, the company initiated an additional $5 million of efficiency savings in areas such as sourcing, distribution, supplies and maintenance.Higher Costs & Slowdown in Development Add to ConcernsHigher cost of sales and labor costs that characterize the restaurant industry are expected to continue keeping the company’s profits under pressure. Moreover, pre-opening costs, higher marketing expenses as well as costs related to sales-boosting initiatives might further pressurize margins. Particularly, BJ’s Restaurants’ slow roasting ovens and handheld tablets are adding to the labor costs. Subsequently, labor costs, as a percentage of sales, increased 90 basis points (bps) in the fourth quarter of 2017 to 35.8%, whereas operating costs were 21.4% of net sales, up 70 bps year over year.Meanwhile, after reducing the number of restaurant openings to 10 in fiscal 2017 compared with 17 restaurant openings in fiscal 2016, the company plans to open just four to six restaurants in fiscal 2018. The reduction is due to the company’s continued belief that the sales headwinds in the industry call for greater focus on traffic and sales building initiatives. However, the slowdown in the company’s development plan may somewhat dent sales growth.Zacks Rank & Other Stocks to ConsiderBJ’s Restaurants carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Other top-ranked stocks in the industry include Darden Restaurants (DRI  -  Free Report), DineEquity (DIN  -  Free Report) and Ruth’s Hospitality Group (RUTH  -  Free Report).

519,DRI,"Papa John’s International, Inc. (PZZA  -  Free Report) has been grappling with declining sales for quite some time. Soft consumer demand in the U.S. restaurant space has resulted in constant deceleration of comps, whereas high costs associated with restaurant operations have been potential headwinds for the company.Recently, the company posted mixed fourth-quarter 2017 results, wherein earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate while revenues beat the same. Adjusted earnings of 65 cents per share missed the consensus estimate of 68 cents by 4.4%. The bottom line also fell 6% from the year-ago quarter due to weak operating results.Moreover, shares of Papa John’s have lost 19.4% in the past year against 15.4% growth recorded by the industry. With this unfavorable trend, earnings estimates for 2018 have been revised downward by 10.1% over the past 30 days, reflecting analysts’ concern surrounding the stock.Difficult Sales Environment Results in Declining CompsOver the past few quarters, comps growth in restaurants has been dull, traffic has been weak, and Papa John’s is not exempted from this challenging scenario.In the fourth quarter of 2017, domestic company-owned restaurant comps declined 4.7% against comps growth of 4.8% in the year-ago quarter. Comps for North America franchise restaurants fell 3.5%, comparing unfavorably with comps growth of 3.4% in the fourth quarter of 2016.The company expects North America comps in the range of negative 3% to flat in 2018 and anticipates continued pressure in domestic sales.Higher Expenses Remain a ChallengePapa John’s is plagued with high costs associated with restaurant operations. Costs related to marketing initiatives, unit expansion, digital ordering, and increasing use of online and mobile web technology is keeping the company’s profits under pressure. Moreover, the company is also shouldering higher labor costs due to the implementation of The Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare that is expected to have an adverse impact on margins, going forward.In the fourth quarter, total costs and expenses amounted to $429.3 million, up 7.8% from the prior-year quarter. Total operating margin was 7.8%, a decrease of 390 basis points (bps) year over year.Expansion & Franchising AidsMany of Papa John’s restaurants are located in international markets like Europe, the Middle East, Latin America and China, continuing to perform strongly. The China region continues to experience solid growth, driven by optimization of the company’s restaurant model, brand design enhancements and increased integration with third-party aggregators that is broadening its accessibility channels. Papa John's has inked developmental agreements in many regions including Mexico, Egypt, Russia, Spain, Chile, the Netherlands, Colombia and Boston. It also debuted in France and Israel in the past year and Morocco in 2017. Meanwhile, the company plans to open five units in Bahamas by 2021.Notably, the company is committed to develop and maintain a strong franchise system. Management is continually striving to eliminate barriers to expansion in existing international markets and identify new market opportunities. Except for 35 company-owned restaurants in Beijing and North China, all of Papa John’s international restaurants are currently franchised. Over the next several years, the company plans to increase its international units, a large part of which will be franchised.We believe, re-franchising a large chunk of its system reduces the company’s capital requirements and facilitates earnings per share growth and ROE expansion. Alongside, free cash flow continues to grow, allowing reinvestment to increase brand recognition and shareholders’ return. Moreover, since a major portion of its business is re-franchised, Papa John’s is less affected by inflation than its peers.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderPapa John’s carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).A few better-ranked stocks in the same space include BJ’s Restaurants (BJRI  -  Free Report), Darden (DRI  -  Free Report) and Ruth's Hospitality Group (RUTH  -  Free Report), each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

520,DRI,"Domino's Pizza, Inc. (DPZ  -  Free Report) is a leading pizza restaurant chain in the world. Although the company’s roots are in convenient pizza delivery, a significant amount of sales also come from carryout customers.In fourth-quarter 2017, the company’s adjusted earnings came in at $1.94 per share and increased 31.1% year over year. The improvement was backed by higher net income and lower diluted share count as a result of share repurchases.Quarterly revenues of $891.5 million were up 8.8% year over year. The increase was driven by higher supply chain revenues as well as higher royalties from retail sales and positive currency impacts.Domino's Pizza Inc Revenue (TTM) Domino's Pizza Inc Revenue (TTM) | Domino's Pizza Inc Quote Notably, this marked the 27th consecutive quarter of positive U.S. comparable sales and the 96th consecutive quarter of positive international comps. Meanwhile, Domino’s continues to increase store count at a decent pace and opened more than 400 net new stores in the quarter.We observe that Domino’s shares have returned 21.9% in the past year, outperforming the 15.1% rally of the industry it belongs to. Franchising Strategy Facilitates Earnings Per Share GrowthDomino’s has a wide franchise network, both domestically and internationally. Notably, by reducing its ownership of restaurants and focusing more on re-franchising, the company minimizes capital requirements and facilitates earnings per share growth and ROE expansion.In addition, free cash flow continues to grow thereby allowing reinvestment for increasing brand recognition and shareholder return. In fact, the company has increased its dividend by 25%, 24%, 23%, 21% and 20% in 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018, respectively, after initiating regular dividends in 2013.Moreover, Domino’s is less affected by food inflation as a result of franchising compared with other pizza companies with global operations. Meanwhile, the company’s recapitalization deal also makes cash available for potential special dividend and share repurchases, depending upon the board’s approval.Digital Ordering Boosts SalesDomino’s is investing heavily in technology-driven initiatives like digital ordering to boost sales. In 2017, the company’s AnyWare suite of ordering platforms that allow customers to order from various ordering apps and platforms such as — Google Home, Facebook Messenger, Apple Watch, Amazon Echo, Twitter and via a Pizza emoji on text — grew significantly. Also, its digital loyalty program — Piece of the Pie Rewards — continues to contribute significantly to traffic gains.In late 2015, Domino's had announced the design and launch of DXP (Delivery Expert), a purpose-built pizza delivery vehicle, and extended it to more markets in May 2016. Taking a step further, Domino's and Ford Motor Co. also initiated a research on consumers’ responses to Pizza delivery using self-driving vehicles. As a part of the initiative, researchers from both the companies will be analyzing customer reactions from their interactions with a self-driving vehicle delivering their food. This research would help the companies understand consumers’ perspective on technologically advanced methods of food delivery.Notably, digital leadership is helping the company expand its brand in the domestic market as well as overseas. In 2017, Domino’s invested $90.3 million in its proprietary point-of-sale system — Domino’s PULSE, digital ordering platform, supply chain centers, new Company-owned stores, reimaging existing Company-owned stores internal enterprise systems and other technology initiatives.To ConcludeThe extended ways to order a pizza has kept Domino’s in the forefront of digital ordering and customer convenience.

521,DRI,"Darden Restaurants, Inc. (DRI  -  Free Report) is set to report second-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Dec 19, before market opens.Notably, the company has surpassed estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 2.29%. Shares of Darden have rallied 20.5% so far this year, outperforming the industry’s growth of 13.5%.Cost DetailsDarden undertakes various initiatives to drive sales which in turn are likely to boost profit margins. In addition, the company has an aggressive cost management plan, under which it has significantly cut operating costs. However, in the first quarter, total operating cost and expenses increased 13.4% primarily due to costs associated with adverse effects from Hurricane Harvey.Food and beverage costs in the first quarter increased 12.6% from the year-ago level but was somewhat favored by 10 basis points (bps) as cost savings and pricing of approximately 1.5% more than offset commodity cost inflation. In the to-be-reported quarter, these costs are expected to increase year over year mainly owing to effects of cost inflation. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter food and beverage expenses is pegged at $535 million, reflecting an increase of 11.9%.Coming to restaurant labor expenses, the first quarter saw a 14.4% increase from the prior-year quarter. The trend is expected to persist owing to brand mix and wage inflation. The consensus estimate of $612 million for labor expenses calls for a 13.8% increase in the to-be-reported quarterRestaurant expenses increased 12.9% year over year in the last reported quarter. It is further expected to rise in the upcoming quarter mainly due to higher pre-opening expenses. The consensus estimate for restaurant expenses calls for a 12.1% rise in the to-be-reported quarter.Marketing expenses are expected to contract on better brand mix and a promotional shift at Olive Garden.Margin ScenarioDespite the company’s overall increase in costs in the first quarter, sales increased at every segment which drove margins by 20 bps at Olive Garden. However, profit margin at the other business segment was 200 bps lower than the prior year. This is because the addition of Cheddar’s altered the segment’s profit margin mix and the exclusion of consumer-packaged goods from the segment.In the first quarter, adjusted EBIT was down 10 bps owing to last year’s asset sale gains of $8 million. Moreover, Cheddar’s integration had a 40-bps unfavorable impact on EBIT margin on a year-over-year basis. The company expects this impact to be lower in the upcoming quarter with the completion of this integration.

522,DRI,"Darden Restaurants, Inc. (DRI  -  Free Report) is set to report second-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Dec 19, before market opens.Shares of Darden have rallied 19.8% so far this year when compared with the industry’s gain of 13.1%.Let’s see how the company’s brands are integrating to give shape to its top line.Revenue Scenario    Darden started off fiscal 2018 on a solid note. The company’s initiatives to boost the top line have been reflected in first-quarter results. The company recorded $1.9 billion in total sales from continuing operations. The figure marked 12.9% year-over-year growth.Despite recent hurricanes hitting the U.S. restaurant space, Darden has somewhat managed to record substantial revenue growth across its brands in the first quarter. Overall sales for company are expected to rise in the to-be-reported quarter on the back of several initiatives. In fact, The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-quarter net sales is pegged at $1.9 billion, reflecting 12.6% year-over-year growth.Segment RevenuesOlive Garden, being the most promising of all brands and accounting for 51.1% of total revenues, witnessed the 12th consecutive quarter of positive comps in first-quarter fiscal 2018. Net sales in the quarter grew 3% on a year-over-year basis while comps rose 1.9%.In order to boost the Olive Garden brand, the company adopted a set of initiatives under its Brand Renaissance Plan. These included simplifying kitchen systems, improving sales planning and scheduling, operational excellence to improve guest experience, developing new core menu items, allowing customization and making smarter promotional investments. Also, the brand is planning on remodeling bar refreshes. Additionally, Olive Garden’s To Go business, which offers online ordering at selected locations, is growing at a rapid pace (increasing 12% year over year in the first quarter). The brand has also launched catering services in the United States, which is expected to add to the top line.The consensus estimate for current-quarter net sales at the segment is pegged at $933 million, reflecting 2% year-over-year growth. However, the segment revenues will likely decline 5.8% sequentially. Comps are expected to increase 0.2% in the to-be-reported quarter.At LongHorn (accounting for 20.9% of the company’s net sales) the company is focusing on core menu, culinary innovation and providing regional flavors. It is also working on marketing strategy to improve execution, customer relationship management and digital advertising. Further, the company continues to focus on strengthening its in-restaurant execution through strategic investments in quality and simplification of operations in order to enhance guest experience. Owing to these efforts, segment comps have grown over the last 18 quarters. In the last reported quarter, comps at the segment grew 2.6%, beating the industry mark, excluding Darden, by 560 points. The consensus estimate for current-quarter comps growth is at 0.2%.Meanwhile, net sales in the last reported quarter increased nearly 4.7%. The consensus estimate for net sales in the to-be-reported quarter is pegged at $375 million, reflecting a 2.7% year-over-year growth. However, on a sequential basis the segment’s sale are likely to decline 7.2%.Sales at Fine Dining, accounting for 6.3% of total revenues, increased 7% to $122.2 million in the first quarter. Comps at The Capital Grille rose 2%, higher than the prior-quarter comps growth of 0.5%. Meanwhile, Eddie V's posted comps growth of 2.5%, lower than 3.3% recorded in the preceding quarter. The consensus estimate for comps growth in the second quarter is at 0.1% for Capital Grille and 0.2% for Eddie.Revenues at Other Business (21.7% of net sales) rose 66% year over year to $419.5 million in the first quarter on the addition of Cheddar’s in April 2017. Darden is currently integrating Cheddar’s and is making significant non-guest-facing changes that would improve the brand’s performance over time. Comps in the first quarter surpassed industry benchmarks, excluding Darden, but declined 1.4%. Cheddar’s has an extensive presence in Texas which exposed it more to the effects of Hurricane Harvey than Darden. However, the company expects Cheddar’s to perform well in the quarters ahead.Darden Restaurants, Inc. Revenue (TTM)  Darden Restaurants, Inc. revenue-ttm | Darden Restaurants, Inc.

523,DRI,"Dave & Buster's Entertainment, Inc. (PLAY  -  Free Report) generates strong returns, courtesy of its unique business model and favorable store economics. The company continues to perform well on the customizable experience it offers across its platforms — Eat, Drink, Play and Watch.However, rising labor costs amid a tepid sales environment along with limited geographical presence remain potent headwinds for this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Recently, Dave & Buster’s reported mixed third-quarter fiscal 2017 results. The bottom line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate, while the top line lagged the same. Notably, the third quarter marked the 13th successive earnings beat for the company.Key Growth DriversDave & Buster’s distinctive business model sets it apart. Along with food and beverages, the company has a robust entertainment business. In fact, in the first nine months of fiscal 2017, amusement and other revenues accounted for 55.6% of total revenues. In fact, the segment’s revenues grew 17.1% year over year as increased dependence on gaming has cushioned the company against headwinds in restaurant space. It will also drive market share and comps for the company. Also, the increased focus on its higher-margin amusement business is driving earnings.Dave & Buster's continues to pursue a disciplined new-store growth strategy in both new and existing markets. In fiscal 2017, the company expects to open 14 new stores, including 10 large and four small outlets. The company currently has 11 stores under construction and a total of 27 times leases, and is expected to continue with the expansion in fiscal 2018 as well as 2019. In fiscal 2018, the company plans to open 14 to 15 new stores and achieve a 13% to 14% annual unit growth rate, including a combination of large and small format stores.For third-quarter fiscal 2017, the company has planned on a smaller-store format of about 15,000 to 20,000 square feet in order to capitalize on demand in smaller and untapped markets. Management expects to open 20-40 stores in the long term, including two that are to be opened in 2018. The company believes that this new format will expand brand potential and spread growth runway. The first store under this new format will be opened in Rodriguez, AR, at the beginning of fiscal 2018.Apart from an efficient business model and expansive strategies, Dave & Buster’s relies heavily on menu and entertainment innovation to drive sales. Notably, the company continues to evolve its amusement section on new and interesting content, including games based on some of the world’s finest movies. In this regard, the company continues to collaborate with various game manufacturing partners and remains steadfast on its strategy of including proprietary content that is exclusive to the company.Additionally, the company believes that it can drive traffic by enhancing in-store and out-of-store customer experience via digital and mobile strategic initiatives as well as through employing better technology.Notably, Dave & Buster's delivered return on equity (ROE) of 24.8% in the trailing 12 months, compared with the industry’s gain of 6.9%. This indicates that the company reinvests more efficiently compared to peers which drives its growth trajectory.ConcernsIncreased labor costs due to the implementation of Obamacare continues to have an adverse impact on margins of restaurant operators like Darden Restaurants Inc. (DRI  -  Free Report), Brinker International Inc. (EAT  -  Free Report), Red Robin Gourmet Burgers, Inc. (RRGB  -  Free Report) and many others, including Dave & Buster's. Also, pre-opening costs of outlets given the company’s unit expansion plans and expenses related to sales initiatives are driving costs and are likely to weigh on margins.Subsequently, shares of Dave & Buster's lost 2% year-to-date as against the industry’s gain of 14.5%. The underperformance has been led by downward estimate revisions. Over the last 60 days, earnings estimates for the current-quarter and year have moved down 8.2% and 0.7%, respectively, reflecting analysts’ pessimism over the stock. Also, a decelerating comps growth rate given the persistently challenging sales environment in the U.S restaurant space is a concern.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +18.8% from 2016 - Q1 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +157.0%, +128.0%, +97.8%, +94.7%, and +90.2% respectively.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon.

525,DRI,"Oracle Corporation (ORCL  -  Free Report) is set to report fiscal fourth-quarter 2018 results on Jun 19. Notably, the company has beaten estimates in the trailing four quarters, recording an average positive surprise of 8.49%.In the last reported quarter, the company delivered modest third-quarter fiscal 2018 results. Non-GAAP earnings of 83 cents per share comfortably beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 72 cents. However, revenues of $9.776 billion came almost in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate figure of $9.771 billion. This represented 6% year-over-year growth in revenues.Expect What?The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at 94 cents, up 5.6% year over year. The earnings estimates have remained stable in the last 30 days. Further, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $11.2 billion, up roughly 2.3% from the year-ago quarter.Oracle underperformed the industry in the past year. While the stock gained just 3.4%, the industry recorded growth of 38.4%.Let's see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors Likely to Impact Q4 ResultsSoft outlook for the cloud business remains an overhang for Oracle. Cloud revenues including Software as a service (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) are expected to grow between 19% and 23% (17-21% in constant currency), much lower than 32% (29% in constant currency)  reported in the last quarter.Further, higher investments on IaaS platform will affect gross margin expansion in the near term.Oracle recently announced the accessibility of its next-generation Oracle Cloud Platform services. The move is aimed at providing required programmability, performance and flexibility for rapid service deployment in the cloud economy. We believe, the company’s cloud platform will be one of its key revenue generating businesses in the to-be-reported quarter.The latest addition to its cloud platforms reflects Oracle’s focus on expanding cloud computing product portfolio inorganically. The strategy will enable the company to scale up its cloud operations much faster. Despite expanding its foothold in the cloud space, the presence of already established players like Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) and Microsoft in both the PaaS and IaaS may remain a potential headwind.Going forward, the next-generation autonomous database launched by Oracle, which is supported by machine learning, is a key catalyst.Oracle is gaining traction in its cloud business as evident from its third-quarter fiscal 2018 performance, which benefited from the ongoing cloud-based momentum. Total cloud revenues (16% of total revenues compared with 13% in the year-ago quarter) advanced 32% to $1.57 billion.Moreover, total cloud and on-premise software revenues increased 8% to $7.98 billion. We believe that the company’s growing cloud market share will continue to drive top-line growth in the foreseeable future.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total cloud revenues is currently pegged at $1.71 billion, while total software revenues are currently pegged at $9.27 billion, up 9.8%.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Oracleis likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen. However, that is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Oracle’s Earnings ESP is -0.35%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Oracle currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) which when combined with earnings ESP of -0.35% makes surprise prediction difficult.

526,DRI,"The Michaels Companies Inc. (MIK  -  Free Report) is slated to report first-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Jun 14. The question lingering in investors’ minds is whether this operator of arts and crafts specialty retail stores will be able to deliver positive earnings surprise in the to-be-reported quarter.The company delivered negative earnings surprise of 1.7% in the last reported quarter. However, it outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, with an average of 4.2%.

QuoteNonetheless, we note that the stock has outperformed the industry in the past month, reflecting positive sentiment on the stock ahead of first-quarter earnings. The company’s shares have increased 11.7% while stocks in the broader industry recorded growth of 8.8%.Factors at PlayMichaels Companies has a mixed surprise trend, with earnings beat in three of the last six quarters, while sales lagged estimates in four of the last six quarters. However, earnings and sales improved year over year in fourth-quarter fiscal 2017, due to solid holiday period sales. Comparable store sales (comps) also improved, driven by higher average transaction value and increased foot traffic to Michaels' stores.Nonetheless, the results for fiscal fourth-quarter 2017 were followed by a modest view for fiscal 2018 and the fiscal first quarter. The company anticipates sales of $1,139-$1,150 million, with comps growth of flat to up 1%. Adjusted earnings per share are estimated to be 36-38 cents per share. The company expects fiscal 2018 to be a year to rebuild and remodel, positioning it for robust growth in 2019 and beyond. The company will continue to remodel stores to standard formats, link e-commerce with store networks by bringing in-house fulfillment of online orders and invest in enhanced data analysis to support retail operations.Following the progress made on these initiatives in fiscal 2017, the company expects to reinvest benefits from the tax reform into its business to drive sales and earnings growth. However, these efforts are likely to result in elevated operating expenses for fiscal 2018.What the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model conclusively shows that Michaels Companies is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter.

527,DRI,"Bob Evans Farms, Inc.  reported second-quarter fiscal 2018 earnings per share (EPS) of 35 cents, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The figure increased 16.7% from the prior-year quarter earnings of 30 cents on higher revenues.Net sales of $117.6 million were up 22.3% year over year.

Also, the top line came slightly above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $117.1 million.While pounds sold in the fiscal second quarter increased 48.2% year over year (11.4% growth excluding Pineland and BER), average net selling price per pound declined 17.4% from prior-year quarter.

The decline was due to lower gross profit margin along with higher operating expenses and increased amortization expenses. Also, adjusted operating income margin contracted 340 basis points (bps) to 8.4% of net sales.Meanwhile, adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) in the quarter fell 1.9% year over year to $17.7 million.

530,DRI,"DineEquity, Inc. (DIN  -  Free Report) reported third-quarter fiscal 2017 earnings of 91 cents per share, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 88 cents by 3.4%. However, the figure declined 37.8% from the prior-year quarter earnings of $1.46 due to decrease in gross profits.Total revenues of $144.7 million fell 7.3% year over year due to lower franchise and restaurant, rental as well as financing revenues. Also, the top line missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $146.5 million by over 1%.DineEquity currently operates under the Applebee's Neighborhood Grill & Bar and International House of Pancakes (IHOP) brands. It is focused on developing a strong performance-based culture, driving sustainable positive sales at both brands thereby bringing its growth story back on track. In fact, the initial progress along with positive comps growth at both brands in October is heartening and management is optimistic on realizing the company's full potential.Consequently, the company’s shares were up more than 5% in yesterday’s trading session, reflecting investors’ confidence regarding the initiatives undertaken to drive growth at both the brands.Behind the Headline NumbersIHOP's domestic system-wide comps declined 3.2%. This compares unfavorably with the fiscal second quarter’s comps decrease of 2.6% and the prior-year quarter’s comps decline of 0.1%. Despite witnessing soft sales in the last few quarters, the company believes that the IHOP brand remains on solid ground.Moreover, initiatives to improve guest satisfaction via remodelling efforts, growing its off-premise business that include online ordering and delivery, and development of an IHOP mobile application are expected to create improved revenue channels.Applebee's domestic system-wide comps were down 7.7% comparing unfavorably with the last quarter’s comps decline of 6.2% and the prior-year quarter’s fall of 5.2%. Notably, Applebee’s casual dining restaurants are facing stiff competition from fast-food and quick-service restaurants. Furthermore, consumers are favoring ordering in meals over going to brick-and-mortar retailers.Nonetheless, DineEquity believes that fiscal 2017 will be a transitional year for Applebee's. In fact, the steps taken to revitalize the brand via increased focus on food and culinary innovation, marketing efforts, simplification of restaurant operations and elevating the guest experience are expected to drive comps over the long term with an improvement likely 2018 onwards.Fiscal 2017 OutlookFor fiscal 2017, Applebee's domestic system-wide comps are now expected to decrease in the range of 5.5-6.5% (a decline of 6% to 8%, expected earlier).IHOP's domestic system-wide comps are still expected to be down in the band of 1% to 3%.Meanwhile, DineEquity continues to expect general and administrative expenses to range between $166 million and $172 million.Applebee's franchisees are still anticipated to develop between 20 and 30 new restaurants globally, the majority of which are likely to be international openings. Additionally, its closures are projected to range between roughly 105 and 135 restaurants.  IHOP franchisees and its area licensee are estimated to develop between 80 and 95 restaurants globally, with the majority being domestic openings. IHOP closures are anticipated to range between 25 and 30 restaurants (earlier 20-25 restaurants).  The company also reiterated its expectations of capital expenditures of roughly $14 million in fiscal 2017.DineEquity carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

531,DRI,"Darden Restaurants, Inc.’s (DRI  -  Free Report) effective sales-boosting initiatives and synergies from Cheddar’s acquisition put the company on growth trajectory. However, high costs related to restaurant operations and stiff competition remain major concerns.Last month, the company reported better-than-expected results in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018. Earnings and revenues not only surpassed analysts’ expectation but also grew 17.8% and 10.3%, respectively, from the year-ago quarter. The upside was driven by sales growth across every brand. Notably, the quarter marked the 15th consecutive earnings beat for the company.Darden’s shares have rallied 23.3% in the past year, outpacing its industry’s collective growth of 1%. Earnings estimates for the current fiscal have also climbed 2.4% over the past month. This reflects ongoing optimism in the stock. Given management’s progress on improving core operating fundamentals, the stock is anticipated to keep performing well in the quarters ahead.Positive Synergies to be Realized From Cheddar’s IntegrationDarden’s acquisition of the small restaurant chain, Cheddar's Scratch Kitchen (Cheddar's) in April 2017 added an undisputed casual dining value to the company’s portfolio of differentiated brands. It also helped Darden to further enhance its scale. In the fiscal fourth quarter of 2018, total sales were favored by 8.1% growth from the integration of Cheddar’s into the other segment.Apart from making significant progress with the integration of Cheddar’s, the company seems to gain more confidence of its outcome. In fiscal 2018, management realized roughly $10 million of cost synergies and expects to realize the same in the range of $22-$27 million by the end of fiscal 2019. Over the current fiscal, Darden plans to make significant non-guest facing changes that are expected to have an impact on restaurant-level execution. Moving forward, Darden expects Cheddar to bring in incredible opportunity for long-term growth. Given the brand is already delivering higher growth rate compared with Olive Garden, Darden expects Cheddar’s integration to add to the company’s overall growth.High Costs & Intense Competition HurtDarden’s non-franchised model makes the company susceptible to increased expenses. Since all the restaurants are owned and operated by Darden, the company is solely responsible for the expenses of operating the business, instead of signing franchise agreements and putting the burden of costs onto the franchisee. Total operating costs and expenses increased 7.9% year over year in the fourth quarter to $1.9 billion. This was caused by an overall increase in food, beverage and marketing costs, as well as restaurant labor and expenses. As a result, operating margin in the quarter contracted 198 basis points (bps) on a year-over-year basis.The retail restaurant space is highly competitive as numerous restaurant operators are adapting advanced and prudent strategies to increase their sales. Amid such stiff competition, Darden is missing out on international presence that other restaurant chains like McDonald's (MCD  -  Free Report), Domino’s (DPZ  -  Free Report) and Yum! Brands (YUM  -  Free Report) are aggressively pursuing. We believe that the company needs to expand its presence beyond the United States in order to offset the impact of cut-throat competition in the saturated domestic market.Currently, Darden carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion.

533,DRI,"Zoe’s Kitchen, Inc.’s  third-quarter fiscal 2017 results were affected by the recent hurricanes — Harvey and Irma.Adjusted earnings of a penny in the quarter bettered the Zacks Consensus Estimate of break-even earnings. However, earnings deteriorated 75% from the year-ago figure of 4 cents owing to the impact of hurricanes and lower restaurant contribution margin. The hurricanes particularly impacted earnings by 2 cents.Revenues of $77.9 million lagged the consensus mark of $78.6 million by 1% but improved 15.7% year over year backed by restaurant openings. In fact, Zoe’s Kitchen opened 11 company-owned restaurants in the quarter and expects to open another 38 to 40 this year.However, due to the natural disasters, this fast-casual restaurant chain lost 187 full and partial operating days leading up to roughly $1.1 million of revenue loss.Zoe's Kitchen, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Zoe's Kitchen, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Zoe's Kitchen, Inc. QuoteBehind the Headline NumbersComparable restaurant sales declined 0.5% owing to a 2.3% decrease in transactions and product mix, offset by a 1.8% increase in price. Notably, hurricanes had an estimated 0.9% negative impact on comps.Consequently, the figure compared unfavorably with the year-ago quarter’s comps growth of 2.4%. However, it compared favorably with the prior-quarter’s comps decline of 3.8%.Restaurant contribution margin went down 30 basis points (bps) year over year to 18.8% as increased labor and operating expenses offset the improvement in cost of goods.2017 Fiscal Outlook CutFor fiscal 2017, the company expects total revenues of $314.0 million to $316.0 million (earlier $314-$322 million).Meanwhile, management projects comps in the range of negative 2% to 2.5% (earlier flat to negative 3%).Further, the company predicts restaurant contribution margin in the band of 18.3% to 18.5%, as compared with the previous range of 18.3% to 19.0%.We note that Zoe’s Kitchen currently has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Peer ReleasesChipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.’s (CMG  -  Free Report) third-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings of $1.33 lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.56 by 14.7%.Darden Restaurants, Inc.’s (DRI  -  Free Report) first-quarter fiscal 2018 adjusted earnings of 99 cents per share outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 98 cents by more than 1%.

534,DRI,"Shares of Red Robin Gourmet Burgers Inc. (RRGB  -  Free Report) tanked nearly 19% in after-hours trading on Nov 6, after the company reported lower-than-expected third-quarter 2017 results and lowered its profit outlook for the year.Earnings & Revenue DiscussionRed Robin’s adjusted earnings of 21 cents per share lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 27 cents by 22.2% and declined 44.7% year over year.Revenues of $304.2 million came below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $308.1 million by over 1% but increased 2.3% year over year. This improvement was driven primarily by new restaurant openings.Behind the Headline NumbersCompany-owned restaurants comps decreased 0.1% year over year, as against the prior-quarter comps increase of 0.5%. The downturn was led by a 0.1% decline in average guest check and flat guest counts. Notably, the decrease in average guest check comprised a 1.6% drop in menu mix, partly offset by a 1.5% increase in pricing.Restaurant-level operating profit margin decreased 120 basis points (bps) to 17.4% due to rise in occupancy costs, higher cost of sales, elevated labor costs and increase in other restaurant operating expenses.Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, and amortization (EBITDA) decreased 4.9% to $25.5 million from $26.8 million in the year-ago quarter.Fourth-Quarter ViewFor the fourth quarter, earnings per share are estimated between 45 cents and 60 cents. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 99 cents is pegged much higher than the guided range.Guidance for 2017For 2017, Red Robin now anticipates adjusted earnings in the band of $2.16-$2.31 per share. Previously, the company projected the same to fall in the low end of the $2.80-$3.10 per share range. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 is pegged at $2.78.Red Robin projects comparable restaurant revenues to be flat to up 0.5% compared with the rise in the band of 0.5-1.5%, anticipated earlier.Cost of sales, as a percentage of restaurant revenues, is projected to be in the range of down 25 bps to up 25 bps in 2017 compared with 2016, owing to the impact of higher beef prices in the second half of the current year.Restaurant labor costs, as a percentage of restaurant revenues, are expected to be up 50 bps year over year.Red Robin has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Red Robin Gourmet Burgers, Inc.

535,DRI,"Starbucks Corporation (SBUX  -  Free Report) reported in-line earnings but failed to meet the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues in fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results.Apart from the earnings release, Starbucks made other major announcements. First, Starbucks lowered long-term financial targets, cutting the annual earnings growth forecast to 12% versus the prior guidance for 15%-20%. The company expects global same-store sales or comps of 3-5% and high single-digit net revenue growth (versus prior expectation of 10% or greater).Second, the premium coffee giant has entered into an agreement to sell Tazo tea to Unilever for $384 million. The deal includes the Tazo brand, signature recipes, intellectual property and inventory and allows Starbucks to focus its tea strategy on Teavana.Starbucks shares dipped more than 3% following the news release on Nov 2, possibly in response to the lowered long-term targets and weak fourth-quarter results.Earnings, Sales & Comps DiscussionAdjusted earnings per share (EPS) of 55 cents came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate, but grew 10% year over year.Total fourth-quarter sales of $5.7 billion missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.73 billion by 0.6% and remained unchanged from the year-ago level. The underperformance was due to the impact of hurricanes Irma and Harvey, which affected the company’s overall top line as well as U.S. comp growth by 1%. This was because more than 1,000 stores had to be temporarily closed due to storm-related reasons.Global same-store sales increased 2%, lower than 4% growth in the preceding quarter. Global traffic increased 2% in the quarter compared with 4% in the previous quarter. Transactions increased 1%.Margin DownOperating margin decreased 360 basis points (bps) year over year to 17.9% in the quarter due to higher partner investments, primarily in the Americas segment, and the lapping of the 53rd week in the year ago quarter. Again, product mix shift, largely towards food, a higher donation to The Starbucks Foundation, and restructuring and impairments cost added to the woes.On a non-GAAP basis, operating margin declined 90 bps to 20%.Quarterly Segment DetailsAmericas: Net revenues in this flagship segment were down 0.5% year over year to $3.9 billion.Comps rise of 3% in the quarter was softer compared with an increase of 5% in the last quarter. U.S. comps grew 2%, comprising 1% increase in average ticket.The company's core espresso, tea and refreshment beverages contributed 2% to comps growth in the U.S. Food sales contributed 2%.Membership increased 11% year over year in the My Starbucks Rewards (MSR) program. Customers in the U.S. are using the chain's mobile app to order and pay for their drinks and are joining the company's rewards program. Mobile payments represented 30% of U.S. transactions, reflecting an increase of from 25% a year ago.Operating margin in the segment, however, contracted 390 bps to 24% as strong sales leverage was more than offset by hurricanes, higher investments in store partners and the impact of product sales mix.China-Asia-Pacific (CAP): Net revenues increased 2.5% to $859.9 million on the back of higher revenues from new store opening and comp store sales growth.Comps grew 2%, higher than 1% in the previous quarter. China continued to post stellar comps growth delivering 8% in the quarter, its strongest in nine quarters. Japan’s comp growth improved sequentially. Store and market profitability in Japan were robust, with comp growth in core food, tea, and espresso categories.Starbucks' licensed joint venture markets, including East China and South Korea, continue to contribute to CAP's performance in the quarter. Again, South Korea marks its fifth-largest global market, with system sales exceeding $1 billion in fiscal 2017, with double-digit comp growth in the year, underscoring the broad success Starbucks is having across the region.Operating margin at the CAP segment expanded 60 bps year over year to 23.5% in the quarter buoyed by strong sales leverage and higher JV income. These are partly offset by an extra week in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016.Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA): Net revenues were down 0.1% year over year at $269.9 million in the segment as higher revenues from addition of new stores were offset by an extra week in the year-ago period.That said, comps grew 1% (against 2% growth in the preceding quarter).Operating margin declined 330 bps to 12.9% due to softer performance in its company-owned markets and a 210-basis-point impact from a tax settlement in the quarter.Channel Development (CPG): This segment includes roasted whole bean and ground coffees, premium Tazo teas, a variety of ready-to-drink beverages (like Frappuccino and Starbucks Refreshers) and Starbucks and Tazo-branded K-Cup packs sold through channels such as grocery, specialty retailers, and foodservice, to name a few.Channel Development's net revenues declined 0.7% to $514.9 million.Operating margin expanded 80 bps to 47.9%.All-Other: The segment comprises emerging brands like Teavana (acquired in Dec 2012), Seattle's Best Coffee, Starbucks Reserve and Roastery businesses. Revenues at the segment decreased 9.2% to $104.6 million.Fiscal 2017 HighlightsThe company’s non-GAAP earnings came in at $2.06 per share, increasing 11.4% year over year. Net revenues were $22.4 billion, up 5% on 3% global comps growth.The company’s non-GAAP operating income increased 7.8% to $4.4 billion in the year and corresponding margin expanded 10 bps.Fiscal 2018 GuidanceStarbucks projected global comp growth at 3-5% based on the addition of approximately 2,300 net new stores globally.Consolidated operating margin is likely to be slightly up, excluding the impact of the change in ownership structure in East China on operating margin.The company expects its GAAP EPS to grow more than 40%.Starbucks expects non-GAAP EPS growth of 12-13%, or $2.30-$2.33 per share in fiscal 2018 with growth in the second half to be a shade higher than the first half.Zacks RankStarbucks carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

539,DRI,"El Pollo Loco Holdings, Inc.’s (LOCO  -  Free Report) earnings and revenues missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the third quarter of 2017.Notably, the company’s shares lost more than 7% in after-hours trading on Nov 2, reflecting investor concerns regarding the slashed guidance for 2017 earnings.Earnings and Revenue DiscussionEl Pollo Loco’s third-quarter adjusted earnings of 15 cents per share missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 18 cents by 16.7%. Earnings also declined 16.7% year over year primarily due to the impact of hurricane Harvey.Revenues of $101.2 million rose 5.6% year over year but lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $103.2 million by 2%. El Pollo Loco Holdings, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  El Pollo Loco Holdings, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | El Pollo Loco Holdings, Inc. Quote Behind the Headline NumbersNotably, system-wide comps increased 1.7% due to an increase in comps at both company-operated and franchise restaurants.Company-operated restaurant sales totaled $95 million in the third quarter of 2017, compared with $89.7 million in the year-ago quarter. Sales rose 5.9% year-over-year mainly on the back of the opening of 25 new restaurants during and subsequent to the third quarter of 2016, offset by the closing down of five over the same time frame.Moreover, comps at company-operated restaurants increased 0.9% on a 1.7% rise in average check. However, it was partially offset by a 0.8% decline in transactions. Moreover, the figure compared unfavorably with the prior quarter comps growth of 2.4%.Franchise-operated restaurant sales increased 1.6% year over year to $6.2 million compared with $6.1 million in the prior-year quarter. The upside was mainly driven by higher comps and the launch of 15 restaurants during and subsequent to the third quarter of 2016, partly offset by a decline in franchise and development agreement fees and lower fees received related to use of the company’s point-of-sales system.Comps at Franchise restaurants were up 2.4% during the quarter, lower than the prior quarter comps growth of 3.2%.Restaurant contribution was $17.4 million (18.3% of company-operated restaurant revenues), compared with $18.8 million (20.9%) in the third quarter of 2016. The drop in restaurant contribution margin was mainly due to elevated labor charges reflecting the increased minimum wage, and higher other operating expenses associated with restaurant openings.2017 Outlook RevisedEl Pollo Loco now expects 2017 pro forma earnings per share in the band of 61 cents to 63 cents, down from the earlier guided range of 64 cents to 67 cents. In 2016, adjusted earnings per share were 66 cents. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 earnings is also pegged at 66 cents, above the guide range.Adjusted EBITDA (Earnings before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortization) is expected in the band of $64.0 million to $65.5 million (earlier $66.5 million to $68.5 million). Meanwhile, restaurant contribution margin is projected in the range of 19.3% to 19.6% (earlier 20.3% to 20.7%).Furthermore, the company expects system-wide comparable restaurant sales growth in the range of 1-1.5% (earlier 1-2%).The company revised the range of its restaurant opening and now plans to open 15-16 company-owned restaurants in 2017 (earlier 17 to19).

541,DRI,"This month's rally has been stronger and lasted longer than I expected.
"
542,DRI,"Quite honestly, I thought the reaction to Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner's plan on Monday was euphoric. And I was certainly surprised by the follow-through buying.
"
543,DRI,"Yet, traders were clearly in buy mode.
"
544,DRI,"Rather than argue the point, we added 4 stocks to the Zacks Elite portfolios. None of the stocks were particularly risky, but they should help us profit if market conditions have truly changed.
"
545,DRI,"I remain nervous, but I am seeing signs that the pace of economic deterioration is slowing. February's increase in consumer spending is a good example. Spending has risen for 2 consecutive months after previously falling.
"
546,DRI,"It's not that any of the economic numbers are particularly good, but rather that they are not getting worse. Combine this with more favorable sentiment about the financial crisis and the possibility for a market bottom exists.
"
547,DRI,"I'm not ready to say that a bottom has been set, however, because things could get worse in the banking sector. We'll have to see whether or not the banks and the private investors can agree on a price for those toxic assets. That's been the stumbling block.

550,DRI,"Darden Restaurants (DRI  -  Free Report) and Orion Marine Group (OMGI) were added to the Focus List.
"
551,DRI,"DRI operates Red Lobster, Olive Garden, LongHorn Steakhouse and several other chains. Last week, the company topped expectations and raised its guidance. Though sales are down for most casual restaurants, the decline has generally not been as bad as feared. Plus, the tax cuts will be showing up in paychecks soon, which could provide an additional boost. Though we might be early in adding this type of stock, DRI does give us exposure to any improvement in economic conditions.
"
552,DRI,"OMGI provides construction services such as underwater pipelines, bridges and causeways. We think the company could benefit from state and federal construction projects. Full-year estimates have been raised in the last month and earnings are projected to grow strongly this year and next.
"
553,DRI,"Buckeye Partners (BPL) and Owens & Minor (OMI  -  Free Report) were added to the Growth & Income List.
"
554,DRI,"BPL operates oil pipelines. The partnership has distributed income for 88 consecutive quarters. The current yield of 9.3% understates the actual amount paid to unitholders since the partnership recently raised its distribution.
"
555,DRI,"OMI distributes medical and surgical supplies. The stock fell last month on worries about health care reform and we thought the selling was overdone. Estimates are trending higher for this year and OMI has a history of topping expectations.

556,DRI,"The Markets
"
557,DRI,"Stocks charted their biggest 10-day gain since 1938. A pullback, as we saw today, is expected.

567,DRI,"But Darden is optimistic going forward given the economic conditions.
"
568,DRI,"""As many consumers respond to the current environment by reducing dining out frequency, having strong brands matters more than ever.

576,DRI,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for Darden Restaurants, Inc. (DRI  -  Free Report). Shares have added about 6.5% in that time frame, outperforming the market.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to the stock's next earnings release, or is it due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Darden Beats on Q1 Earnings, Reaffirms FY18 GuidanceDarden reported first-quarter fiscal 2018 adjusted earnings of 99 cents per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 98 cents by over 1%. Further, earnings increased 12.5% year over year on the back of higher revenues. Notably, this quarter marked the 12th consecutive earnings beat for the company.Meanwhile, total revenue of $1.94 billion came slightly above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.93 billion and increased 12.9% year over year.Behind the Headline NumbersSince the beginning of fourth-quarter fiscal 2015, Darden started reporting under four new segments: Olive Garden, LongHorn Steakhouse, Fine Dining that includes The Capital Grille and Eddie V's, and Other Business. The Other Business segment include Yard House, Seasons 52, Bahama Breeze, consumer packaged goods, and franchise revenues.In April 2017, Darden completed the acquisition of small restaurant chain, Cheddar's Scratch Kitchen (Cheddar's), in an all-cash deal worth $780 million from its stockholders including private-equity firms L Catterton and Oak Investment Partners. Excluding certain expenses, Darden anticipates the transaction to be accretive to its adjusted per share in fiscal 2018 by roughly 12 cents per share.For the reported quarter, the company’s legacy brands posted blended comps growth of 1.7%. In the previous quarter, the company’s comps witnessed an increase of 3.3%, excluding Cheddar's. Meanwhile, the company witnessed an increase in sales across all its brands in the fiscal first quarter.Sales at Olive Garden were up 3% year over year to $989.9 million.

Comps at The Capital Grille rose 2%, higher than the prior-quarter comps growth of 0.5%. Meanwhile, Eddie V's posted comps growth of 2.5%, lower than the 3.3% improvement recorded in the preceding quarter.Revenues from Other Business jumped 66% year over year to $419.5 million. But comps at Seasons 52 fell 2.2% for the quarter, as compared to the prior-quarter comps’ decline of 1.3%. Moreover, comps at Yard House inched down 0.4% for the quarter against a 0.1% rise recorded in the last quarter. Meanwhile, comps grew 1.2% at Bahama Breeze, slightly lower than the comps growth of 1.4% in the preceding quarter.At LongHorn Steakhouse, sales rose 4.7% to $404.5 million. Comps at LongHorn Steakhouse increased 2.6%, lower than the prior-quarter comps growth of 3.5%.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2018 earnings is pegged at $4.45 per share.Moreover, the company reaffirmed its outlook for total sales growth of 11.5% to 13% driven by the addition of Cheddar's and other new restaurant openings. Meanwhile, the company’s legacy brands are still anticipated to post comps growth of roughly 1% to 2%.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then? Following the release, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates. There have been three revisions lower for the current quarter.VGM ScoresAt this time, Darden's stock has a great Growth Score of A, though it is lagging a lot on the momentum front with a F. However, the stock was allocated a grade of B on the value side, putting it in the second quintile for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of A. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.Our style scores indicate that the stock is more suitable for growth investors than value investors.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. It's no surprise that the stock has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). We are expecting a below average return from the stock in the next few months.

577,DRI,"Over the past few years, consolidation has become an important trend in nearly every major global industry. There’s no one reason why—although changing consumer trends, globalization, and emerging technologies are our primary culprits—but all around the world, we’ve seen countless household names join forces and shrink the competition pool.2017 has certainly extended this trend. In fact, according to the IMAA, the total global value of M&A deals is expected to once again eclipse the $4.0 trillion mark—on the back of a near-record 40,000 transaction year.Investors will also note that this year’s deals have included some of Wall Street’s most powerful brands and have had industry-rattling consequences. To celebrate this, we’ve compiled our list of the most important M&As of 2017!In no particular order, check them out now:1.       United Technologies (UTX  -  Free Report)) Buys Rockwell Collins (COL  -  Free Report)We’ll start with the newest deal on the list, as the details of this acquisition weren’t made official until early last month. Per the merger agreement, United Technologies will acquire Rockwell Collins for $140 per share in cash and stock.Upon completion, Rockwell Collins’ aircraft avionics business will merge with United Technologies’ wide portfolio—which includes aircraft engines, structures, cockpit and cabin controls, ventilation systems, and other devices—to create a brand new aircraft behemoth.Post-acquisition, United Technologies is expected to have global sales of around $67-$68 billion, and the deal is expected to generate $500 million of run-rate pre-tax cost synergies by the fourth year. Because of Rockwell’s status as a supplier to Boeing (BA  -  Free Report), the acquisition is also expected to give United Technologies greater negotiating power in the industry. 2.       Intel (INTC  -  Free Report)) Acquires MobileyeAs the public grows more and more obsessed with the impending rollout of self-driving cars, Intel’s acquisition of Mobileye has certainly emerged as one of the year’s most meaningful buyouts.The semiconductor giant scooped up the Israeli autonomous vehicle tech firm in a deal worth a staggering $15.3 billion, making it the biggest purchase of a company focused solely on the self-driving market to-date.The acquisition underscored the massive amount of cash that’s being spent on autonomous driving right now. Intel’s own automated driving group has now joined forces with Mobileye’s renowned computer vision technology, immediately cementing Intel’s status as a leader on the chip side of the business. 3.       JAB Holdings Purchases Panera BreadIn a move that has had major ramifications for the retail restaurant industry, German conglomerate JAB Holdings purchased fast-casual chain Panera Bread for $315 per share earlier this year. With the deal, JAB added Panera’s bakery cafes to its portfolio of breakfast-oriented brands, which includes Krispy Kreme, Einstein Bros. Bagels, and Keurig Green Mountain.The buyout was another major deal in a series of several purchases involving notable restaurant chains. Also this year, Darden Restaurants (DRI  -  Free Report) snapped up Cheddar’s Scratch Kitchen, and Burger King owner Restaurant Brands International (QSR  -  Free Report) bought out Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen.In its most recent quarter before the buyout was announced, Panera reported that company-owned comparable store sales increased 5.3%. It had been an up-and-down few years for Panera’s stock, but JAB appeared to snag the brand at an opportune time. 4.       Gilead (GILD  -  Free Report)) Scoops Up Kite Pharma Without a doubt, Gilead’s acquisition of Kite Pharma will go down as one of 2017’s most important biotech deals. Industry behemoth Gilead will pay $180.00 per share in cash for Kite, valuing the buyout at nearly $12 billion.How could a relatively small biotech research firm be worth that much money? Well, it comes down to Kite’s pipeline, which includes a CAR-T therapy that is expected to be approved by the FDA in November.CAR-T is a newly emerging method of treating cancer that includes making genetic changes to a patient’s immune T-cells and reinjecting them into the body to attack cancer cells. Many industry analysts believe that CAR-T will revolutionize the cancer treatment market, and Gilead’s deal with Kite was one of the first major investments in CAR-T by a large biotech company. 5.       Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report)) Buys Whole FoodsLast but not least, we have the monumental Amazon-Whole Foods deal. This one was obviously going to make the list, as it is has been perhaps the biggest headline on Wall Street all year and has major consequences for several industries.The deal was valued at $13.7 billion, or $42 per Whole Foods share. This was a somewhat surprising move by Amazon—and not because the company is shy about spending money. No, what shocked investors was the fact that Amazon was willing to spend nearly $14 billion on what many considered to be a gamble with a brick-and-mortar retailer.We’ve already seen Amazon slash prices on several popular products throughout Whole Foods stores, and we expect to see the e-commerce king parlay its new real estate into an advantage for delivering goods. Whether Amazon paid the right price for Whole Foods is up for debate, but this is a future-minded move that will take years to fully develop. Want more stock market analysis from this author?

Cheddar's seems to be a great fit in the company’s portfolio as it not only complements its existing brands but is also expected to aid in attracting customers. This in turn should drive Darden’s comps and resultantly sales, going ahead. Darden also believes that the addition of Cheddar’s will help boost its scale and wide range of data and insights.Most of Darden’s brands have been witnessing growth over the past few quarters on the back of sales initiatives like simplifying kitchen systems, better in-restaurant execution to enhance guest experience, menu innovation, remodeling along with various technology-driven moves. Also, the company’s efforts to check costs are commendable.However, increased labor costs and a non-franchised business model may dent the company’s profits, while a soft consumer spending environment in the U.S. restaurant space might continue to restrict revenue growth.Investors should note that the current-quarter and year earnings consensus estimate for DRI have remained stable over the last 60 days. However, DRI’s earnings have been strong over the past few quarters. In fact, the company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the last four quarters, with an average beat of 0.47%.

583,DRI,"Shares of RH (RH  -  Free Report) have rallied more than 100% in the past year, beating the Zacks Retail - Home Furnishings industry’s rally of 14.4%, justifying the stock's Momentum Score of A. Efforts to redesign supply chain network and rationalize product offerings work as tailwinds for the company.The company’s consistent bottom-line outperformance on the back of various growth initiatives including the transformation to a membership model and strong demand trends has provided some momentum to the stock. The company’s earnings surpassed estimates in six of the trailing 10 quarters.Also, earnings estimates have risen over the past few weeks, suggesting that sentiments on RH are moving in the right direction. Over the past 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current year earnings rose 17.2% to $5.85. Also, earnings estimates for the next year have increased 7.2%.This positive trend reflects analysts’ bullish sentiments. The company’s Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) indicates robust fundamentals and expectations of outperformance in the near term.  Let us delve into the factors that might help the stock maintain the bull run.Membership Model Bode WellThe one major change which led to a turnaround in RH’s business is the transformation from a promotional to a membership model (RH Members Program). The membership model has eliminated the frantic buying patterns and associated returns, exchanges and canceled orders. This is leading to higher revenues, lower costs and improved margins. With 95% of core RH business driven by members, the shift from a promotional to membership model is a success.Restaurant Chain to Boost RevenuesRH is focusing on the expansion of chain of restaurants within its stores. The company opened RH Toronto and RH West Palm, its second and third locations with integrated cafés, wine vaults and barista bars.  In fact, revenues from RH West Palm are expected to increase in 2018. The company will continue to aggressively invest toward a strong hospitality platform.In 2018, the company is expected to consistently focus on execution, architecture and cash. It also plans on opening four new Galleries in 2018, which include three integrated cafés, wine vaults and barista bars. Such initiatives are expected to enhance overall customer experience and drive demand.Cash Position StrongThe company generated $433 million in free cash flow in 2017 enabling the repurchase of 20.2 million shares of RH’s stock.

584,DRI,"Kohl’s Corporation (KSS  -  Free Report) has been riding on rising comps, fueled by effective strategies to drive sales and brand performances. Well, shares of this renowned department store chain have rallied 48.6% in the past six months compared with the industry’s rise of 37.2%. Let’s take a closer look at the company’s initiatives and see if it can add more laurels to its growth story.Effective Sales Driving StrategiesKohl’s has been striving to attract more shoppers and improve sales. In fact, such efforts have been aiding the company to deliver positive comps since the past three quarters, thereby driving its overall performance. Incidentally, comps increased 3.6% during first-quarter fiscal 2018, following a rise of 6.3% and 0.1% in the fourth and the third quarters of fiscal 2017, respectively. Strong comps indicate that the company’s strategic initiative, Greatness Agenda, has been yielding favorable results. The initiative, which commenced in first-quarter fiscal 2014, was designed to drive transactions per store and sales. We expect such endeavors to continue driving the company’s comps performance in the forthcoming periods.Additionally, the company’s sustained focus on technology improvements and omnichannel expansion have been positively impacting online sales. Markedly, online sales surged 20% year over year during the first quarter. In order to further improve its online offerings, Kohl’s has been expanding its e-commerce fulfillment centers. Additionally, it focuses on strengthening its in-store pickups. To top these, Kohl’s has been strengthening ties with retail giant Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) to drive traffic. Incidentally, the company has started accepting returns for Amazon customers on select products and also provides free packing and shipping services for the merchandise to fulfillment centers. Moreover, Kohl's sells Amazon devices, accessories and smart home products across certain select store locations. In the long run, the company is expected to receive significant boost to its business through this partnership. Further, Kohl’s recent association with Aldi is expected to strengthen store base and boost sales.Apart from these, Kohl’s also regularly introduces new brands to keep the inventory assortment fresh and attract customers to its stores and website. In line with its strategy to draw customers, Kohl's revealed plans to launch a fresh apparel collection — POPSUGAR at Kohl’s — in September. The company also announced plans to launch brands in the toys category.Rising Expenses a ConcernKohl’s has been experiencing rising selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses for a while now. In fact, SG&A expenses increased 3.7% during first-quarter fiscal 2018, preceded by a 7.3% and 1.4% rise during the fourth and the third quarters of fiscal 2017. Further, management expects SG&A expenses to rise in the bracket of 1-2% during fiscal 2018.Although surging SG&A expenses pose the risk of hurting profitability, we expect Kohl’s sales-driving efforts to suitably cushion the company. Additionally, the company’s speed and localization initiatives have been gaining traction and aiding inventory management as well as margin performance. Advancing with such well-planned endeavors, we expect this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company to continue to be in investors’ good books.Looking for More?

585,DRI,"Dave & Buster’s Entertainment, Inc. (PLAY  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Jun 11, after market close. In fourth-quarter fiscal 2017, the company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.4%. The bottom line also outpaced the consensus mark in each of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 16.5%.Which Way Are Estimates Treading?Let’s look at earnings estimate revisions in order to get a clear picture of what analysts are thinking about the company prior to the release. Notably, the consensus estimate has been stable in the last 30 days. For the quarter under review, the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 93 cents. This reflects an improvement of 6.9% from 87 cents in the year-ago quarter. Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $322.3 million, up 6% year over year.Factors at PlayDave & Buster's unique business model with increased dependence on gaming is impressive.  We expect the company’s entertainment business to carry the momentum forward. Consistent efforts to improve sales and margins through various initiatives have also been key growth drivers. In this regard, continual opening of stores, menu innovation and launch of games are anticipated to continue boosting its top and bottom line.Furthermore, menu innovation remains a key attribute of the brand and guests have responded favorably to it. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, Dave & Buster’s also appointed new vice president of Food and Beverage development in order to improve speed of service through menu redesign and positive simplification in the kitchen area. In February, the company streamlined its menu and reduced the number of food orders by about 20% and beverage offerings by 12% to achieve increased efficiency.Meanwhile, the company continues to evolve its amusement strategy backed by new and riveting content, including games based on some of the world’s finest movie properties. In this regard, Dave & Buster’s is consistently collaborating with various game manufacturing partners and remains steadfast on its strategy of including proprietary content exclusive to the company forever.However, rising labor costs and a non-franchised business model might hurt profits. In fact, the non-franchised model makes the company susceptible to increased expenses. Since all the restaurants are owned and operated by Dave & Buster’s, instead of signing franchise agreements and putting the burden of costs on the franchisee, the company is solely responsible for the expenses of operating the business.Dave & Buster's Entertainment, Inc.

586,DRI,"In order to capitalize on rising demand for their products, quite a few restaurant operators are focusing on growing their off-premise, online-ordering business via delivery, carry-out, and catering.Particularly, restaurant operators are concentrating on the delivery channel, which is a growing area for the industry, driven by ease of access. By driving incremental sales at the companies, delivery services might turn out to be a strong revenue growth driver in the long term, given huge demand for the same.Meanwhile, many restaurants are seeing an increase in their take-out business as customers are more willing to relax at home while enjoying their meal. Notably, both take-out and delivery increase a restaurant’s business without significantly raising its operational expenses or demanding an expansion of facility.Red Robin Gourmet Burgers & Brew, Inc. (RRGB  -  Free Report) is one such company that is moving smartly on new revenue streams. Going forward, the company expects the off-premise orders to become a growth engine in the latter half of the year as it begins to actively promote the new offerings, reach out to more guests, thus driving improved profitability.In sync with this, the company plans to expand its service to 198 locations from 118, with its current three third-party service providers like Amazon, DoorDash and GrubHub. By fourth-quarter 2017, Red Robin expects to put all corporate restaurants on the call center and have designated in-store pickup areas. In addition, the company anticipates roughly two-thirds of its units to have curbside delivery.Red Robin currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.McDonald’s Corporation (MCD  -  Free Report) is also planning to provide augmented convenience to customers through increased focus on delivery. In fact, this Zacks Rank #3 company’s delivery service has now expanded to almost 8,000 restaurants across 47 countries. In this regard, McDonald's is also experimenting with different delivery models including partnering with third-party operators, like UberEATS.Another restaurant operator, YUM! Brands, Inc. (YUM  -  Free Report), has deployed an off-premise strategy at all three of its iconic brands. Evidently, Pizza Hut has developed a delivery network algorithm (DNA), which is a multi-faceted technology system that improves the accuracy and reliability of deliveries.YUM! Brands’ KFC division is also aggressively pursuing its global delivery initiative as a strategic growth opportunity. Currently, the division offers delivery out of over 6,000 restaurants and given the fact that it is the fastest growing channel in the business, the brand anticipates expanding its services around the world.The Taco Bell division follows the same strategy as well. In fact, nearly 20,000 restaurants across the entire Yum! Brands system offer delivery, which is almost 50% of the company’s total restaurants. YUM! Brands carries a Zacks Rank of 3.Taking things one step further, BJ’s Restaurants, Inc. (BJRI  -  Free Report) has launched a pilot alcohol delivery program in partnership with DoorDash.

While Olive Garden’s To-Go business increased 16% year over year in the last reported quarter, Chili’s has partnered with Olo – a mobile and online food ordering service – for its To-Go platform. Chili’s has also launched a digital curbside platform to ensure simpler, faster, effortless experience to take-out guests, which should ultimately translate to higher check. Both these companies carry a Zacks Rank #3.Further, Darden and Jack in the Box, Inc.’s (JACK  -  Free Report) Qdoba division have launched catering in the United States. In fact, catering remains a significant opportunity at Qdoba and the company plans to continue with this, which exceeded 11% of its sales in the fiscal third quarter. Moreover, the brand has prepared a new catering menu in a bid to expand this segment.Also, the company’s Jack in the Box segment has expanded its partnership with DoorDash, which is now delivering from roughly 37% of this division.Bottom LineIn addition to the ones mentioned above, there are many other restaurant operators like Starbucks, Buffalo Wild Wings, Cheesecake Factory, Dunkin’ Brands and Wendy’s that have indulged in growing their off-premise sales.Notably, the restaurant industry’s sales trends in recent quarters have been strained, given the soft consumer spending environment. Nevertheless, off-premise channels could be the tide that lifts all boats in the industry, moving it higher from its current position at the bottom 15% among more than 250 Zacks industries.On an average, off-premise sales represent about 10-11% of the industry’s total sales. Therefore, there lies a tremendous opportunity to grow the segment and earn good returns from it.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

However, it is possible that these storms could affect EPS by roughly 15 cents, a major portion of which is expected to be in the fiscal first quarter.Meanwhile, revenues are expected to be approximately $3.1 billion in fiscal 2018 based on the expected opening of eight or nine new Cracker Barrel stores and three or four new Holler & Dash Biscuit House restaurants.

The company’s efforts to redesign its supply chain network and rationalize product offerings bode well.Meanwhile, year-to-date performance has not been an encouraging one for the home furnishing industry. Despite belonging to the same industry, RH has managed to navigate smoothly. So far this year, the Zacks Home Furnishings industry has witnessed a fall of 11.8% against the S&P 500’s gain of 2.3%. However, the sluggish run of the industry has been mitigated to a certain extent by the exceptional performance of RH, whose shares have gained 14% in the same time frame.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayRH’s efforts toward redesigning its supply chain network and rationalizing product offerings are driving its growth, and the trend is expected to have continued in the to-be-reported quarter as well.

These have helped the company report stellar gross, EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) and net margins in the last reported quarter. The upside was mainly due to expansion in its product margins, lower SG&A (selling, general and administrative) expenses and reduced effective tax rate.For the to-be-reported quarter, the company expects adjusted gross margin in the band of 36.4-36.8% versus 30.5% reported in the year-ago level.

589,DRI,"Red Robin Gourmet Burgers, Inc. (RRGB  -  Free Report) banks on various sales-building efforts like continual focus on menu innovation, value offerings, increasing service speed, effective marketing strategy, remodeling programs and online ordering business to drive its top-line growth. Effective cost-cutting efforts are also on the company’s priority list.However, higher expenses from increased investments currently pose a threat to the company’s bottom line. The company’s first-quarter 2018 earnings not only missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate but also declined 22.5% year over year. Revenues in the quarter however rose a meager 0.2% from the prior-year quarter, driven by new restaurant openings and the favorable impact of foreign currency that overshadowed the decline in comps. Shares have lost 29% in the past year, widely underperforming the industry’s decline of 1.8%. Earnings estimates for 2018 have also declined 3.9% over the past month, reflecting analysts’ concern surrounding the company’s future earnings potential.Sales-Building Efforts Bode WellIn order to drive incremental traffic, Red Robin has been undertaking initiatives that have improved its restaurants’ seating efficiency and lowered guests’ waiting times. The company has rolled out its Kitchen Display System (KDS) that is linked to the table management software. This is expected to result in annual sales growth of approximately $50 million, as kitchens can handle higher peak volumes. Meanwhile, Red Robin is focusing on expanding its productivity and service models, and also increasingly supporting To-Go and catering services to drive greater guest check.Red Robin is set to grow its off-premise, online-ordering business via carry-out, delivery and catering. In the first quarter of 2018, the company delivered 9.4% mix in the off-premise business, up 40% year over year. Notably, all the company restaurants currently have online ordering available and 98% also have call center support. Red Robin’s strategy of moving call-in ordering to a centralized call center is also yielding positive results and is thus slowly expanding its reach to ensure quality experience. On the delivery front, the company partnered with Amazon, DoorDash and GrubHub. Also, third-party delivery is now available at more than 70% of its locations.Apart from brand revitalization and digital efforts, Red Robin is focused on menu innovation and operational improvement to make it a better-customer service platform. The company continues to launch a variety of salads, appetizers, innovative desserts and adult beverages, as well as kids’ menu. Notably, the company’s marketing strategy focuses on driving traffic with everyday value advertising of premium burgers, appetizers, beverage and desserts.In addition, the company focuses on promotional and limited-time offers to increase its revenues. Moreover, a key long-term growth driver for the company is its guest-loyalty program — Red Robin Royalty — initiated in 2011 with a goal to increase guest count. The company engages its guests through this program, with offers designed to increase their frequency of visits. It also informs its enrolled guests about new menu items to generate awareness and for trials.  Driven by such sincere efforts, the restaurant chain has been witnessing an uptick in revenues since 2013.High Expenses Hurt Despite Strategic Plan RED2During its ICR Investor Conference in Orlando in 2016, Red Robin outlined its go-forward plan known as RED2. The primary objective of this initiative is doubling the company’s EBITDA by 2020. The initiative aims to focus mainly on three areas — revenue growth, expense management and efficient capital deployment.However, Red Robin is investing heavily in several sales-building initiatives like advertising and technical upgrades, resulting in elevated costs. Remodeling and restaurant maintenance are also adding to the already rising expenses. In the first quarter of 2018, restaurant-level operating profit margin contracted 130 basis points (bps) to 20%. The downturn was due to a 90-bps increase in the cost of sales, 70-bps rise in other restaurant operating expenses and 40-bps surge in occupancy costs.Nonetheless, to curb expenses, the company is focusing on a new supply chain management software, replacing its older manual system. This would result in improved control of waste and cost of goods, significantly reducing inventory levels at the restaurants.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderCurrently, Red Robin carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Some better-ranked restaurants include Darden (DRI  -  Free Report), Dine Brands (DIN  -  Free Report) and Denny’s (DENN  -  Free Report), each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

590,DRI,"Investors with an interest in Retail - Restaurants stocks have likely encountered both Darden Restaurants (DRI  -  Free Report) and Noodles & Co. (NDLS  -  Free Report). But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks? Let's take a closer look.There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks, but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns. The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends, while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits.Darden Restaurants and Noodles & Co. are sporting Zacks Ranks of #2 (Buy) and #3 (Hold) respectively, right now. This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions, so investors should feel comfortable knowing that DRI is likely seeing its earnings outlook improve. But this is only part of the picture for value investors.Value investors analyze a variety of traditional, tried-and-true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics. These include the long-favored P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company's fair value.DRI currently has a forward P/E ratio of 18.33, while NDLS has a forward P/E of 288.33.

NDLS currently has a PEG ratio of 32.95.Another notable valuation metric for DRI is its P/B ratio of 5.08. Investors use the P/B ratio to look at a stock's market value versus its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, NDLS has a P/B of 10.91.These are just a few of the metrics contributing to DRI's Value grade of A and NDLS's Value grade of F.DRI has seen stronger estimate revision activity and sports more attractive valuation metrics than NDLS, so it seems like value investors will conclude that DRI is the superior option right now.

The stock has rallied 8.3% compared with the industry’s growth of 2.2%.Let’s have a look at a few factors in detail that make Darden a profitable investment at the moment. Sales Building Initiatives — Top-Line DriverDarden’s riveting growth potential lies in its strategies to build a robust top line. By focusing on technology-driven initiatives like the system-wide rollout of tablets, the company has been boosting sales since the past few quarters. Sales of the company have also picked up momentum since the launch of mobile ordering in 2014.Apart from technological innovations, Darden implemented a set of initiatives under its Brand Renaissance Plan to boost the performance of the Olive Garden brand. These include simplifying kitchen systems, improving sales planning and scheduling, operational excellence to improve guest experience, developing new core menu items, allowing customization and making smarter promotional investments. Also, the brand is focusing on remodeling and bar refreshes. The revamped restaurants are already generating high same-restaurant sales and returns. In fact, the remodeling program gained momentum in the last couple of quarters and the company intends to continue investing in remodeling for optimal returns. In fact, supported by these initiatives, Olive Garden posted the 14th consecutive quarter of positive comps in third-quarter fiscal 2018.Moreover, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2018 sales is pegged at $8.1 billion, reflecting an increase of 12.6% from 2017. Darden’s relentless efforts to drive sales should put the company on growth trajectory, going forward.Cost Saving Efforts to Reap BenefitsDarden is focusing on an aggressive cost management plan, under which it trying to significantly cut operating costs. In fact, for fiscal 2018, the company expects 10-40 basis points year-over-year margin expansion as a result of cost savings. Moreover, the company plans to reinvest any incremental savings into pricing and long-term growth drivers for the business, particularly emphasizing on enhancing its quality to drive market share gains.We believe that such initiatives will immensely help the company witness earnings growth. Arguably, earnings growth is of the utmost importance for determining a stock’s potential, as surging profit levels often indicate solid prospects (and stock price gains). In 2018, Darden’s earnings per share are expected to grow 18.7%.Valuation Looks StrongLooking at Darden’s Price to Earnings Ratio (P/E) for the current fiscal, investors might be willing to add the stock their portfolio, as the company is undervalued compared to its peers. The company’s P/E ratio for the trailing 12 months stands at 18.9 while that of the industry’s is 24.5x.Moreover, per VGM Score that identifies the most attractive value, growth and momentum characteristics, Darden has a Score of A, indicating that the stock is most likely to outperform. Positive Synergies From Cheddar’s AcquisitionDarden’s acquisition of a small restaurant chain, Cheddar's Scratch Kitchen (Cheddar's), in April 2017, added an undisputed casual dining value to the company’s portfolio of differentiated brands. It also helped Darden further enhance its scale. In the fiscal third quarter, total sales were favored 11.3% from the addition of 154 Cheddar’s and 34 other new restaurants. Segmental sales also improved owing to Cheddar’s integration in the Other Business segment, which jumped 71.4% year over year to $438 million in the last reported quarter.Further, management expects to realize synergies in the range of $22-$27 million by the end of fiscal 2019. Over the current fiscal, Darden plans to make significant non-guest facing changes, which are expected to have an impact on restaurant level execution. The company reported that it is currently integrating the two largest, recently acquired Cheddar’s franchisees. The integration is expected to help the brand take advantage of the scale, synergies and other benefits of Darden’s infrastructure. Moving forward, Darden expects Cheddar to bring incredible opportunity for long-term growth.Attractive ROEDarden delivered an ROE of 28.12% in the trailing 12 months compared with its industry’s 6.17%. This supports the company’s immense growth potential and indicates that it reinvests more efficiently compared with its peers.Other Stocks to ConsiderOther top-ranked stocks in the U.S. restaurant space include Wingstop (WING  -  Free Report), Denny’s (DENN  -  Free Report) and Dine Brands (DIN  -  Free Report).

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter revenues is pegged at $105.09 million, reflecting 16% year-over-year growth.The company is investing heavily on menu innovation, which is likely to have aided its revenues in the to-be-reported quarter as well. In 2017, Zoe’s Kitchen completed the largest menu rollout that featured Lamb Kafta, bowls with cauliflower rice and power grains, revamped pita sandwiches, and four new sauces highlighting Mediterranean ingredients and flavors.However, menu innovation and the increased focus on other operations are also weighing on the company’s margins.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter earnings is pegged at $1.93, lower than $1.95 reported in the year-ago quarter. Of late, the company’s earnings estimates have been stable.

As part of menu innovation, the company introduced crafted coffee in about 350 stores by the end of the fiscal second quarter. The company believes that the platform will complement the strength of its breakfast all day offering, drive check favorability and promote guest perceptions of menu variety.The company is stressing on growth in its off-premise business. It is introducing a catering menu and in-store training of hourly employees to enhance business. Anticipating off-premise sales to be the primary source of full-year sales, the company is investing in marketing efforts like social and digital messaging, geo-targeted consumer emails and in-store collateral.In order to drive traffic, Cracker Barrel relies heavily on seasonal promotions and limited-time offers to boost its top-line performance as these are appealing to both regular users and less-frequent guests. In fiscal 2018, the company aims to meet consumers' needs for convenience via growth in its off-premise business. In fact, the company plans to enhance its off-premise platform by introducing new catering menu offering and in-store training of hourly employees.However, the company’s bottom line is likely to be impacted by an increase in cost of goods sold owing to commodity inflation. Nevertheless, Cracker Barrel has a wide range of cost-cutting mechanisms in place. The company altered its retail sales and service structure in a way that allows it to deploy fewer associates during the outlet’s low-volume hours, thereby reducing in-store hourly labor by 25-30 hours per week.

To drive sales, the company has improved its seating efficiency and lowered guests’ waiting times. Moreover, Red Robin’s remodeling initiatives are expected to boost its potential as a brand and improve guest experience, which in turn, should drive revenues. Among the brand revitalization initiatives, the company is focused on menu innovation, operational improvement and making a better customer service platform.

In the fourth quarter of 2017, the company delivered 8.3% mix in off-premise, up 45% year over year.However, Red Robin’s earnings are expected to decline sharply from the prior-year quarter tally. This reflects the loss of one high volume revenue week as compared with a year ago. In addition, rising costs might hurt the company’s margin in the quarter to be reported. Meanwhile, Red Robin is investing heavily in several sales building initiatives like advertising and technical upgrades, which should result in elevated costs. Remodeling and restaurant maintenance also add to the already rising expenses.Red Robin Gourmet Burgers, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Red Robin Gourmet Burgers, Inc.

Adjusted earnings of 11 cents surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 10 cents by 10%. The bottom line also increased 37.5% year over year, primarily favored by the positive effect of lower tax rate related to share-based payments along with Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. Increased revenues also drove earnings.Quarterly revenues of $380.6 million topped the consensus mark of $380 million by 0.2%. The top line improved 5.4% from the year-ago quarter driven by increased rental revenues related to Franchise Flips completed in 2017. Revenues also gained from positive comps recorded from both company-operated and franchise-operated restaurants. However, comps for North American system were affected by adverse weather conditions, which partially dented the overall top line of the company.Meanwhile, comps at the North America system restaurants were up 1.6% compared with an increase of 1.3% in the last reported quarter and 1.6% in first-quarter 2017.The Wendy's Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  The Wendy's Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | The Wendy's Company QuoteDespite the earnings beat, shares of Wendy’s have declined 3.5% in after-hour trading on May 8.

The 210-basis points (bps) decline was primarily caused by higher commodity and labor costs, partially offset by pricing actions.General and administrative expenses in the first quarter were $50.4 million, down 1.9% from $51.3 million recorded in the prior-year quarter. The decline reflected lower professional fees.First-quarter operating profit amounted to $55.3 million, a 4.3% decline from the year-ago quarter’s figure of $57.7 million. Net income of $20.2 million declined 1.6% year over year.Adjusted EBITDA increased 5.4% from the prior-year quarter primarily from revenue growth, including net rental income, partially offset by a decrease in company-operated restaurant margin.

600,DRI,"On Sep 12, we issued an updated research report on the world's third-largest quick-service hamburger company The Wendy's Company (WEN  -  Free Report).Though the company has solid long-term growth potential but the risks from near-term headwinds might somewhat restrict its growth momentum.Key Growth DriversNotably, the second quarter of 2017 marked the 18th consecutive quarter of positive same-store sales growth for the company, indicating long-term strength and significance of the brand. We expect the company’s solid menu pipeline, limited time offers (LTO), marketing initiatives and increased investments in technology-driven initiatives to maintain the trend, going forward.Wendy’s remains on track to complete the goal of its global restaurant count reaching 7,500 by the year 2020. Its international business is thus poised to drive growth in the future. In fact, the company has growth plans and partnerships, and long-term development agreements with franchisees in various countries. Also, it is exploring growth opportunities in China, Brazil and other key international markets.Furthermore, the company boasts a strong pipeline of projects to deliver its 2017 net new restaurant development growth goals of 1% in North America and 14% internationally (up from 12.5% expected previously).                                                                                                                                                                                      Meanwhile, per the system optimization program, the company has already achieved its goal of reducing company-operated restaurant ownership to approximately 5% of the total system by the end of 2016. Though the reduction in ownership has been weighing on revenues over the past few quarters, we believe franchising a large chunk of its system is expected to lower Wendy’s general and administrative expenses, thereby boost earnings 2017 onwards.Additionally, Wendy’s remain on track to achieve its Image Activation goals for 2020 as part of the brand transformation initiative. Hereby, the company plans to remodel at least 70% of Wendy's North America restaurants. Reimaging of its restaurants is also anticipated to boost traffic and drive higher sales.We believe increased investments in technology should quicken service and thus, result in increased customer count. Continual expansion of delivery service also bodes well.All in all, Wendy’s expects that its balanced marketing approach, new restaurant development and reimaging of restaurants are all key factors that might enable the company to achieve its 2020 target of $12 billion in system-wide sales.RisksHigher labor costs due to the implementation of affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare, continue to have an adverse impact on restaurant operators like Darden Restaurants Inc. (DRI  -  Free Report), Brinker International Inc. (EAT  -  Free Report), Red Robin Gourmet Burgers, Inc. (RRGB  -  Free Report) and many others, including Wendy’s.Moreover, Wendy’s would incur additional capital expenditure in the coming years in a bid to boost the re-imaging program. This, in turn, might lead to lower free cash flow in the near term. Also, the Buy and Flip strategy could result in higher interest and depreciation expenses, driven by the new capital leases involved.The quick-service hamburger company is also experiencing increased commodity costs, primarily for beef and bacon. As a result, the company expects commodity inflation of approximately 3-4% to be an additional headwind for 2017 results. Due to this, Wendy’s has had to move forward with a 1% selective menu price increase in company restaurants. This net effect of higher commodities, offset by the tailwind from pricing, has resulted in a slight decrease in the company’s restaurant margin outlook for the full year.Meanwhile, a challenging sales environment in the U.S restaurant space is likely to keep the top line under pressure.Bottom LineWendy’s shares have gained 10.4% year to date compared with the industry’s growth of 7%. Furthermore, the company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in seven of the last eight quarters, with the trailing four-quarter average earnings surprise coming in at 6.69%.Notwithstanding higher costs and capital sending woes, the company’s refranchising and reimaging initiatives are anticipated to continue driving growth over the long term.Wendy’s currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

601,DRI,"Just as millions across the Texas Gulf Coast and Southwest Louisiana continue to pick up the pieces from the impact of Hurricane Harvey, which pounded the region with immense amounts of rain and is blamed for at least 60 deaths, another storm is gathering strength in the Atlantic.Hurricane Irma, which has intensified into an “extremely dangerous” Category 5 storm, is heading towards the Caribbean and the United States, with Puerto Rico, the U.S. and British Virgin Islands, the Dominican Republic, Haiti, Cuba, the Southeastern Bahamas, and the state of Florida directly in its path.According to The Washington Post, hurricane warnings have been issued for the northern Leeward Islands, Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico, while a hurricane watch is in effect for Hispaniola and the southeastern Bahamas.Irma is now tied for the second-strongest storm ever observed in the Atlantic, with winds up to 185 mph. The Post advises that “all of Florida — especially South Florida and the Keys — should be preparing for a major hurricane landfall on Sunday.”And on Tuesday, local officials have begun urging residents in Florida to evacuate, with Miami Dade County Mayor Carlos A. Gimenez saying at a news briefing “This hurricane is far too powerful, poses far too great a threat for us to delay actions any further.”As Harvey impacted numerous industries here in the U.S., Irma is already doing the same. Shares of cruise line companies, for instance, are already getting slammed, while restaurants that have a large presence in Florida are seeing their stocks plummet as well.Fiesta Restaurant Group (FRGI  -  Free Report), which operates Taco Cabana, closed the day down over 5% on Tuesday, while Ruth’s Hospitality Group (RUTH  -  Free Report) and Outback Steakhouse owner Bloomin’ Brands Inc. (BLMN  -  Free Report) were down less than 1% after regular trading closed.  Canaccord analyst Lynne Collier noted that Fiesta is at the most risk because 37% of its restaurants are located in Florida.Other restaurant stocks that fell today include BJ’s Restaurants Inc.

602,DRI,"After announcing the shutdown of 379 stand-alone Teavana stores last month, Starbucks Corporation (SBUX  -  Free Report) plans to close its online operations on Oct 1.Although there was no announcement from the company, a representative confirmed the same to Business Insider. Starbucks’ website currently offers discounts on various products as part of a liquidation sale till the beginning of October.The online store offers products like glasses, mugs, coffee brewers, and espresso makers along with coffee, tea and beverage syrups. The products are still available through third-party sellers like Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report) and Starbucks’ other grocery partners. Meanwhile, the company will keep its online customers updated on product availability.Notably, Starbucks has been planning on partnerships with digital companies to expand its brand and global retail footprint to reach more customers. The company also plans to further integrate digital and mobile transaction to its business model as mobile payments constitute 30% of Starbucks orders in the United States.Soft consumer spending and growing popularity of online shopping require the company to strengthen its digital capabilities.However, due to the challenging macroeconomic environment in the U.S. restaurant space, Starbucks, along with many of its peers like Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (CMG  -  Free Report) and Darden Restaurants, Inc. (DRI  -  Free Report) has been facing a difficult sales environment.--Over the past few months, the U.S. restaurants are witnessing a shift in consumer demand, which has adversely affected the sales performance of the company. Moreover witnessing its fiscal third quarter as well as the initial fourth quarter, Starbucks now is somewhat bearish for the remainder of fiscal 2017. This has partially resulted in a downward revision of the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s earnings. Over the past 60 days, current quarter and year earnings estimates have declined 6.8% and 2.4%, respectively.Additionally, the company’s shares have massively underperformed the industry year to date.

The company’s earnings beat the consensus mark for the fifth straight quarter. Adjusted earnings of 13 cents per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 7 cents. Also, the bottom line rose 30% year over year, backed by an increase in revenues.Revenues jumped 29.1% year over year to $99.1 million and outpaced the consensus mark of $96 million.

Following the quarterly numbers, shares of the company surged 10.6% during the after-hours trading session, yesterday. In fact, the stock has witnessed a sharp gain of 18.5% in the past three months, outperforming 0.9% growth recorded by the industry. Top Line in DetailShack sales improved 29.6% year over year to $96.1 million, primarily owing to the opening of 24 new domestic company-operated Shacks and rise in same-Shack sales. Shake Shack’s cult following and successful expansion into various cities around the world boosted Shack sales, as well as traffic.Licensing revenues for the quarter under review came in at $3 million, up 16.7% year over year, owing to opening of new licensed Shacks stores, and robust performance of Shacks in South Korea and Japan. The company continues to cash in on the diversification of its licensing business and the opportunity to reach places that it could not, domestically.Same-Shack sales (or comps) rose 1.7% year over year.

However, seven restaurants were closed down during the same time period that somewhat negatively affected the company-operated restaurant revenues. A decline in comps also partially dented the company-operated restaurant revenues.Comps at the company-operated restaurants declined 2% in the quarter, due to 1.7% and 0.3% fall in transactions and average check, respectively.First-quarter franchise revenues decreased 3.4% year over year to $6.1 million, due to a fall in franchise and development agreement fees, but was partially offset by the contribution from 10 new restaurants opened during and subsequent to the first quarter of 2017. A 0.4% fall in franchise comps also negatively affected the franchise revenues.System-wide comps declined 1.1% from the prior-year quarter.Expenses, Adjusted EBITDA and Net IncomeTotal expenses in the first quarter amounted to $101.3 million, up 12.1% from the year-ago quarter.

605,DRI,"Yum! Brands (YUM  -  Free Report) delivered better-than-expected results for first-quarter 2018. Adjusted earnings of 90 cents per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 68 cents. Further, earnings surged 38% year over year. The shift to refranchising substantially bolstered the company’s operating margin and earnings per share.

608,DRI,"On Aug 14, we issued an updated research report on the casual dining restaurant chain, Darden Restaurants, Inc. (DRI  -  Free Report).Cheddar’s Acquisition a Key PositiveIn Apr 2017, Darden completed the acquisition of small restaurant chain, Cheddar's Scratch Kitchen (Cheddar's), in an all-cash deal worth $780 million. Excluding certain expenses, it anticipates the transaction to be accretive to its adjusted per share in fiscal 2018 by roughly 12 cents per share.Darden believes that this addition will allow it to further fortify two of its most vital competitive advantages – considerable scale as well as wide-ranging data and insights – going ahead.In fact, as the company progresses with the integration of Cheddar’s, it gains more confidence in its synergy estimates. Management now expects to realize synergies of $22 million to $27 million by the end of fiscal 2019 (up from previously projected range of $20 million to $25 million).Efforts Taken at Other Brands to Boost SalesIn order to boost the performance of the Olive Garden brand, the company has implemented a set of initiatives under its Brand Renaissance Plan. These include simplifying kitchen systems, improving sales planning and scheduling, operational excellence to improve guest experience, developing new core menu items, allowing customization and making smarter promotional investments.Also, the brand is focusing on remodeling, bar refreshes as well as technology-driven initiatives. These initiatives include the system wide rollout of tablets, launch of mobile ordering, the To Go business as well as catering in the U.S, and are expected to add to its top line.At LongHorn, Darden strives to attract guests by focusing on core menu, culinary innovation and providing regional flavors. It is also working on its marketing strategy to improve execution; customer relationship management and digital advertising as well as a strong promotional pipeline that leverages the segment’s expertise.Cost Saving Endeavors Bode WellThe company is focusing on an aggressive cost management plan, under which it has been able to significantly cut operating costs. This would help it boost profits and gain financial flexibility amid a soft consumer spending environment.In fact, for fiscal 2018, the company expects 10-40 basis points year-over-year margin expansion as a result of cost savings.Moreover, Darden plans to reinvest any incremental savings into pricing and long-term growth drivers for the business, particularly emphasizing on enhancing quality to drive market share gains.Some Headwinds Still PersistOver the last few quarters, the U.S. restaurant space has not been too enticing. Evidently, same-store sales growth has been dull in a difficult sales environment. Traffic too has been weak. In fact, the second quarter of 2017 marked the sixth consecutive quarter of negative comp sales for the restaurant industry as a whole, thereby continuing the somber mood. As a result, the company’s sales have come under pressure.It should also be noted that while several other restaurateurs including Yum! Brands, Inc. (YUM  -  Free Report), McDonald’s Corporation (MCD  -  Free Report) and Domino’s Pizza, Inc. (DPZ  -  Free Report) have opened their outlets in the emerging markets, Darden seems to be slow on this front.In addition, the collapse of the Republican-led bill, which was intended to replace Obamacare, means that the Affordable Care Act is here to stay. This implies that the restaurant operator will have to continue shouldering increased labor costs, which in turn will hurt margins. Further, the non-franchised model makes the company susceptible to increased expenses.Bottom LineDespite the prevalent headwinds, most of Darden’s brands have been witnessing growth for the last few quarters, given various sales initiatives like operational excellence, menu innovation along with technology-driven moves.Moreover, the acquisition of Cheddar's has added an undisputed casual dining value leader to the company’s portfolio of differentiated brands, which might further drive comps and resultantly sales.Zacks' 10-Minute Stock-Picking SecretSince 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year.

613,DRI,"Shares of The Cheesecake Factory Inc. (CAKE  -  Free Report) declined over 6% in afterhours trading on Aug 2, after the company reported mixed second-quarter fiscal 2017 results. Further, a lowered fiscal 2017 outlook due to prevailing challenging restaurant environment led to the slump in the stock price.Earnings and Revenue DiscussionAdjusted earnings of 78 cents per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 76 cents by 2.6%. However, earnings remained flat on a year-over-basis.Sales of $569.9 million fell slightly short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $570.3 million but rose nearly 2% year over year. The Cheesecake Factory Incorporated Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  The Cheesecake Factory Incorporated Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | The Cheesecake Factory Incorporated QuoteInside the HeadlinesIn conjunction to the company’s previously announced guidance, comps at Cheesecake Factory restaurants declined 0.5%, whereas both the year-ago quarter and the preceding quarter marked 0.3% growth in comps. Menu price increase of 2.2% was more than offset by a 2.4% decline in traffic and negative mix of 0.3%.We note that in June, the company revealed that it expects comps decline of roughly 1% at Cheesecake Factory restaurants in second-quarter fiscal 2017, after previously projecting an increase in the band of 1% to 2%.The company witnessed heightened volatility in week to week sales trends in the quarter, indicative of uncertainty in the part of many customers. Particularly, weakness at its U.S. restaurants in the East and Midwest led to the soft sales. Unfavorable weather conditions in these regions also reduced patio usage -- a big draw for the chain. This, in turn, more than offset positive comps experienced in key markets of California, Texas and Florida.Cost of sales ratio decreased 10 basis points (bps) year over year to 22.6%. This was primarily attributable to the favorability across various categories. Meanwhile, labor expense ratio was 33.9%, 70 bps higher year over year owing to elevated hourly wage rates.General and administrative expenses accounted for 6.2% of revenues in the second quarter, 20 bps down from the prior-year quarter level. Notably, pre-opening expenses were roughly $1.3 million, down from $2.3 million in the year-ago quarter.Dividend HikeThe board of directors announced a 21% increase in the quarterly dividend from 24 cents to 29 cents per share, payable on Aug 29, 2017, to shareholders of record as of Aug 16, 2017. This adds up to an annual dividend of $1.16, representing a dividend yield of 2.5%. The dividend increase underscores the stability in the company’s cash flow generation.Third-Quarter Fiscal 2017 OutlookFor the fiscal third quarter, adjusted earnings per share are guided in the range of 60 cents to 64 cents based on an anticipated comps decline of 1% to 2% at Cheesecake Factory restaurants.Fiscal 2017 GuidanceThe company slashed its fiscal 2017 adjusted earnings per share projection and now expects earnings in the range of $2.62 to $2.70, compared with $2.93 to $3.02 guided previously. Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2017 earnings is pegged at $2.83.Moreover, the company now expects comps to decline approximately 1% while the previous guidance called for comps growth in the range of 0.5% to 1.5%.Meanwhile, the company continues to assume a wage rate inflation of roughly 5% in 2017. Capital expenditures for the year are now projected in the range of $125–$135 million (earlier $125–$140 million). The company continues to expect to open eight company-owned restaurants in fiscal 2017.Currently, Cheesecake Factory carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Peer ReleasesDarden Restaurants, Inc.’s (DRI  -  Free Report) fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 adjusted earnings of $1.18 per share outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.15 by 2.6%.

614,DRI,"On Oct 2, we issued an updated research report on one of the largest casual dining restaurant operators worldwide Darden Restaurants Inc. (DRI  -  Free Report).Last week, the company posted better-than-expected first-quarter fiscal 2018 results with both earnings and revenues surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate. In fact, this quarter marked the 12th consecutive earnings beat for Darden.Cheddar’s Acquisition - A Key PositiveIn April 2017, Darden completed the acquisition of small restaurant chain, Cheddar's Scratch Kitchen (Cheddar's), in an all-cash deal worth $780 million. Excluding certain expenses, it anticipates the transaction to be accretive to its adjusted per share in fiscal 2018 by roughly 12 cents per share.Additionally, Darden believes that this buyout will allow it to further fortify two of the company’s most vital competitive advantages — considerable scale as well as wide-ranging data and insights — going ahead.In fact, as the company progresses with the integration of Cheddar’s, it gains more confidence in its synergy estimates. Management now expects to realize synergies of $22 million to $27 million by the end of fiscal 2019 (up from previously projected range of $20 million to $25 million).Efforts Taken to Boost Sales at Other BrandsIn order to boost the performance of the Olive Garden brand, the company has implemented a set of initiatives under its Brand Renaissance Plan. These include simplifying kitchen systems, improving sales planning and scheduling, operational excellence to improve guest experience, developing new core menu items, allowing customization and making smarter promotional investments.Also, the brand is focusing on remodeling, bar refreshes and technology-driven initiatives. The initiatives include the system wide rollout of tablets, launch of mobile ordering, the To Go business as well as catering in the United States, and are expected to add to its top line. Markedly, Olive Garden posted the 12th consecutive quarter of positive comps in fiscal first quarter backed by these initiatives.At LongHorn, Darden strives to attract guests by focusing on core menu, culinary innovation and providing regional flavors. It is also working on its marketing strategy and continues to focus on strengthening its in-restaurant execution in order to augment the guest experience. Owing to these efforts, segment comps have grown for the past 18 consecutive quarters.Meanwhile, the company aims to continue driving sales at the Capital Grille, Yard House, Seasons 52, Bahama Breeze and Eddie V via various strategic initiatives and personalized services, which might also aid long-term growth.ChallengesDarden’s shares have declined 5.8% over the past six months, as against the industry’s growth of 5.9%. Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-quarter and current-year earnings has moved down 5.4% and 0.2% over the past month. This reflects ongoing pessimism in the stock. Furthermore, higher labor costs due to the implementation of Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare, continue to have an adverse impact on margins of restaurant operators like Dave & Buster's Entertainment, Inc. (PLAY  -  Free Report), Brinker International Inc. (EAT  -  Free Report), Red Robin Gourmet Burgers, Inc. (RRGB  -  Free Report) and many others, including Darden that have more company-owned units and laborers. In addition, the non-franchised model makes the company susceptible to increased expenses.Meanwhile, the second quarter of 2017 marked the sixth consecutive quarter of negative comp sales for the restaurant industry as a whole, thus continuing the somber mood. Hence, persistent challenging sales environment in the U.S restaurant space is a cause of concern and may continue to keep the top line under pressure.Bottom LineDespite the prevalent headwinds, most of Darden’s brands have been witnessing growth for the last few quarters, given various sales initiatives like operational excellence, menu innovation along with technology-driven moves.Moreover, the acquisition of Cheddar's has added an undisputed casual dining value leader to the company’s portfolio of differentiated brands that might further drive comps and resultantly sales.Darden carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

615,DRI,"The broader market was pretty eventful in the third quarter. While geopolitical and political concerns were rife, those threats couldn’t weigh on the equity market returns. Upbeat Q2 GDP growth data for the U.S. economy, tax reform proposals and some upbeat economic releases trumped awful hurricanes, tensions with North Korea, Trump’s warnings of a Government shutdown and overvaluation concerns.Against this backdrop, let’s discuss the ETF areas that emerged winners in the third quarter and those that were hit hard.Gainers BiotechBiotech ETFs especially those with a focus on cancer therapy staged a great show in the quarter especially on Gilead’s (GILD) buyout announcement of the clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company Kite pharma (KITE), which is focused on the development and commercialization of cancer immunotherapy products (read: Biotech ETFs Soar on Gilead-Kite Deal).Immune-oncology is expected to rule the next-era biotech trading. If this was not enough, on Aug 30, the US drug regulator approved Novartis’ Kymriah, a CAR-T cell therapy – which targets the body’s own immune system to fight cancer cells. All these led BioShares Biotechnology Clinical Trials (BBC  -  Free Report) and Loncar Cancer Immunotherapy ETF (CNCR  -  Free Report) to add about 21.4% and 17.5%, respectively in the last three months (as of Sep 29).MaterialCopper price jumped to a 32-month high on bullish hedge fund bets. Deficit concerns are rising in copper investments. In early August, research house Jefferies indicated that prices may remain erratic in the near term and rise to $2.75/lb in 2018 and $3/lb in 2019 from the current $2.87/lb. Jefferies even sees the possibility of a $4/lb or above pricing in copper in the next five years.Meanwhile, China's manufacturing activity growth also picked up. Since the country is the world’s biggest consumer of this industrial metal, making up roughly 40% of the global copper demand, the uptick in Chinese manufacturing bodes well for copper demand. All these benefited Global X Copper Miners ETF (COPX  -  Free Report), which was up 18.5% in the quarter (read: 3 Red Hot Base Metal ETFs).TechnologyThe technology sector has been positioned strongly thanks to improving economic and industry fundamentals and Trump’s proposed corporate tax reform. Plus, an outstanding bitcoin rally was instrumental in benefiting semiconductor stocks, since mining of cryptocurrencies needs the usage of semiconductors. ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK  -  Free Report) and PowerShares Dynamic Semiconductors ETF (PSI  -  Free Report) jumped about 18.4% each in the third quarter (read: 5 Sector ETFs for Revenue Growth Play).LosersAgricultureAgricultural ETFs lost ground in the quarter. Most of funds were in the red. Adverse demand-supply dynamics was probably responsible for this lackluster performance. Teucrium Wheat ETF (WEAT  -  Free Report), iPath Bloomberg Grains SubTR ETN  and iPath Bloomberg Livestock SubTR ETN COW (COW) lost about 16%, 10.6% and 9% respectively in thethird quarter (as of Sep 29, 2017).Airlines Airline stocks were hurt by back-to-back hurricanes – Irma and Harvey – in the third quarter. Harvey caused cancelations of more than 13,300 flights across Houston during a 12-day period stretching from Aug 25 through Sep 5, according to flight-tracking service FlightAware. The disturbance increased following Hurricane Irma as airlines cancelled flights in the Caribbean and offered waivers to passengers in Florida.As per the policy, airlines ‘’permitted customers to make one change to their itineraries without paying change fees that can cost $200 or more per passenger.” Naturally, U.S. Global Jets ETF (JETS  -  Free Report) felt the pressure and lost about 6% in the third quarter (as of Sep 29, 2017) (read: Hurricane Irma: ETF Winners & Losers).RestaurantsRestaurant stocks bore the brunt of the hurricanes. Analysts apprehended that restaurants may see considerable sales reduction and destruction due to Irma. A Canaccord analyst noted that some restaurants have considerable exposure to Florida.Among these, Fiesta Restaurant Group Inc. FRGI (37% exposure), Ruth's Hospitality Group Inc. RUTH (21% exposure), Bloomin' Brands BLMN (19% focus), BJ's Restaurants (BJRI  -  Free Report) (12%), Darden Restaurants Inc. (DRI  -  Free Report) (11%), Ruby Tuesday Inc.  (10%) and Brinker International Inc. EAT (10%) have a double-digit focus.Irma disaster happened just one week after Harvey weighed on the comps at restaurants with heavy presence in Texas. Understandably, USCF Restaurant Leaders Fund  was in trouble in the third quarter. The fund lost about 5.6% in the quarter.Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week.

616,DRI,"On Oct 2, we issued an updated research report on Dave & Buster's Entertainment, Inc. (PLAY  -  Free Report).Last month, the company posted better-than-expected second-quarter fiscal 2017 results wherein both the bottom and top line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Notably, shares of Dave & Buster’s have gained 29.4% in the past year, compared with the industry’s growth of 8.5%. Furthermore, the company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last 12 quarters, with the trailing four-quarter average earnings surprise coming in at 34.36%.Although the company is certainly not immune to the macroeconomic environment, we expect it to sustain the momentum going forward backed by a unique business style and various sales-building initiatives.Key Growth DriversDave & Buster’s continues to perform well on the back of the unique customizable experience that it offers across its four platforms namely Eat, Drink, Play and Watch. The company’s distinctive model also generates favorable store economics and strong return.In fact, apart from great food or beverages this Texas-based restaurant chain’s entertainment business has been driving growth. Evidently, amusement and other revenues accounted for 57.7% of the company’s total revenue in the latest reported quarter, which is one of the main reasons of its success. Also, the shift toward increased focus on amusement is driving Dave & Buster’s earnings, given its higher-margin business.Notably, this unique model sets it apart and we expect the company’s entertainment business to carry the growth story forward.Additionally, Dave & Buster’s consistent efforts to build sales and improve margins through various initiatives bode well. Continual focus on menu innovation, advertising, launch of new games and the new Fun American New Gourmet and beverage options is thus expected to boost its top and bottom line in the long run. This restaurant chain is also preparing to test digital initiatives such as pay at the table and handheld ordering technologies that should improve the speed of service, besides overall guest satisfaction.Meanwhile, Dave & Buster's continues to pursue a disciplined new store growth strategy in both new and existing markets, given the broad appeal of its brand. To this end, in fiscal 2017 (ending Feb 4, 2018) the company intends to open a total of 14 new stores across the small and large store formats. In fact, management believes it can grow the concept to over 200 units in North America over time. We expect the company’s continuous expansion plans to add immensely to the top line and boost its overall performance as well.RisksHigher labor costs due to the implementation of Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare, continue to have an adverse impact on margins of restaurant operators like Darden Restaurants Inc. (DRI  -  Free Report), Brinker International Inc. (EAT  -  Free Report), Red Robin Gourmet Burgers, Inc. (RRGB  -  Free Report) and many others, including Dave & Buster's that have more company-owned units and laborers.Furthermore, the non-franchised model makes the company susceptible to increased expenses. Since all the restaurants are owned and operated by Dave & Buster's, instead of signing franchise agreements and putting the burden of costs on the franchisee, the company is solely responsible for the expenses of operating the business.Also, pre-opening costs of outlets given the company’s unit expansion plans, and expenses related to sales initiatives are adding to the costs and are likely to hurt profits.In the meantime, a decelerating comps growth rate given the continued challenging sales environment in the U.S restaurant space is a cause of concern and may keep the top line under pressure.Dave & Buster’s carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

631,DRI,"DineEquity, Inc. (DIN  -  Free Report) reported second-quarter fiscal 2017 earnings of $1.30 per share, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.20 by 8.3%. However, the figure decreased 18.2% from the prior-year quarter earnings of $1.59. The fall was primarily due to lower revenues and decline in gross profits.Total revenue of $155.2 million declined 3.2% year over year due to lower franchise and restaurant, rental as well as financing revenues. Also, the top line missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $156.4 million by 0.8%.Currently, the company operates under the Applebee's Neighborhood Grill & Bar and International House of Pancakes (IHOP) brands.Notably, DineEquity continues to invest in the empowerment of its brands by enhancing overall franchisee financial health, closing underperforming restaurants and improving the supply chain.  Consequently, the company’s shares were up more than 4% in yesterday’s trading session, reflecting investors’ optimism regarding the initiatives undertaken to drive growth at both the brands.DineEquity, Inc Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  DineEquity, Inc Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | DineEquity, Inc QuoteBehind the Headline NumbersIHOP's domestic system-wide comps declined 2.6%.

Notably, Applebee’s casual dining restaurants are facing stiff competition from fast-food and quick service restaurants. Also, consumers are favoring ordering in meals over going to brick-and-mortar retailers.Nonetheless, DineEquity believes that fiscal 2017 will be a transitional year for Applebee's, and steps taken to revitalize the brand via increased focus on food and culinary innovation, consumer satisfaction and marketing are expected to drive comps over the long term, with an improvement likely 2018 onwards.Fiscal 2017 Outlook SlashedFor fiscal 2017, Applebee's domestic system-wide comps are now expected to decrease in the range of 6–8% (a decline of 4% to 8%, expected earlier).IHOP's domestic system-wide comps are expected to be down in the range of 1% to 3% (earlier, flat to up 3%).DineEquity now expects general and administrative expenses to range between $166 million and $172 million ($170–$177 million, expected previously).Meanwhile, the company expects capital expenditure to be roughly $12 million in fiscal 2017, up from $12 million, anticipated earlier.Currently, DineEquity carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

632,DRI,"Shares of Red Robin Gourmet Burgers Inc. (RRGB  -  Free Report) were up over 2% in afterhours trading on Aug 8, after the company reported better-than-expected second-quarter 2017 results.Earnings & Revenue DiscussionRed Robin’s adjusted earnings of 61 cents per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 51 cents by 19.6%. However, the bottom line declined 18.7% year over year, due to lower margins.Revenues of $315.8 million came above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $315 million by 0.3% and increased 3.3% year over year. This improvement was driven by higher restaurant revenues, somewhat offset by lower franchise royalties, fees and other revenues.Behind the Headline NumbersDuring the quarter, Red Robin’s restaurant revenues rose 3.4% year over year to nearly $312.4 million. The uptick was owing to new restaurant openings and higher comps, somewhat offset by loss of revenues from closed restaurants. Franchise royalties and fee revenues of $3.4 million were almost flat year over year.Company-owned restaurants comps inched up 0.5% year over year against the prior-quarter comps decline of 1.2%. The increase was led by a 1% rise in guest counts, partially offset by a 0.5% decline in average guest check. Notably, the decrease in average guest check comprised a 2.2% drop in menu mix, somewhat offset by a 1.7% increase in pricing.Despite lower occupancy costs, restaurant-level operating profit margin decreased 100 basis points (bps) to 19.9%, due to higher cost of sales, elevated labor costs and increase in other restaurant operating expenses.Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, and amortization (EBITDA) decreased 3.6% to $32.3 million from $33.5 million in the year-ago quarter.Red Robin Gourmet Burgers, Inc.

Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 50 cents is pegged much higher than the guided range.Guidance for 2017For full-year 2017, Red Robin anticipates earnings to fall in the lower end of the earlier guided range of $2.80 to $3.10 per share. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 is pegged at $2.89.Red Robin continues to expect total revenue growth in 2017 between 6% and 8%. This includes comparable restaurant revenue growth in the range of 0.5% to 1.5%. Additionally, the growth is expected to be driven by increased operating weeks associated with locations opened in 2016 and 2017, as well as the 53rd week in 2017.Cost of sales, as a percentage of restaurant revenue, is projected to be in the range of down 25 bps to up 25 bps in 2017 compared with 2016, given the impact of higher beef and potato prices in the second half of the year.Restaurant labor costs, as a percentage of restaurant revenue, are expected to be flat to up 50 bps year over year, due to minimum wage increases in more highly penetrated markets, elevated benefit costs and restaurant manager bonuses, to some extent offset by the effect of pricing and improvements in labor productivity.Adjusted EBITDA in 2017 is likely to be in between $145 million and $155 million.Capital expenditures are expected to be roughly between $85 million and $95 million.Meanwhile, the company plans to open roughly 17 and close nine Red Robin locations in 2017.Currently, Red Robin has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Peer ReleasesMcDonald's Corp.

644,DRI,"OVERVIEW
"
645,DRI,"Restaurant stocks sizzle
"
646,DRI,"Casual dining restaurant stocks are sizzling. The Zacks Casual Dining Restaurant Index has surged 218% from its November lows, far outpacing both the Russell 2000 (up 37%) and the S&P 500 index (up 28%). The Russell 2000 and the S&P index both remain roughly 40% off their 52-week highs. And although the Zacks Casual Dining index is 30% from its high, there appears to be more downside risk than upside potential.
"
647,DRI,"Casual dining cooks up positive earnings surprises but offers no sustenance
"
648,DRI,"The chief catalysts in the recent restaurant stock rally were better-than-expected earnings reports by Darden Restaurants (AKS), Brinker International (EAT  -  Free Report), Ruby Tuesday (RT) and California Pizza Kitchen (CPKI). With the exception of Darden, however, the out-performance was driven by strong cost controls, decelerating commodity prices and conservative assumptions.
"
649,DRI,"Darden was the only operator that saw customer traffic improve in January and February -- though two months during milder-than-normal weather does not a trend make -- and that limited same-store sales declines to the low single-digits (down 3.2% in its latest quarter). The remaining three earnings out-performers saw same-store sales fall at a mid-to-high single digit rate in 1Q09, and those results were bolstered by menu price increases, masking steeper drops in customer traffic.
"
650,DRI,"Valuation multiples are not justified by fundamentals
"
651,DRI,"The surge in stock prices has expanded the casual dining group's valuation multiples to about 17.4x 2010 consensus EPS estimates -- while 2010 estimates remain at levels equating to just 10-12% year-over-year growth. To be sure, we think 2010 industry earnings won't exceed 2008 levels.
"
652,DRI,"While there is little visibility to 2010 earnings and ample time for positive estimate revisions, upside surprise is unlikely. There are three potential drivers of net income growth: unit expansion, improved same-store sales and cost cuts.
"
653,DRI,"There seems little chance that upside will come from more aggressive unit expansion, as current development plans remain extremely light and restaurant development takes about 18 months from planning to opening.
"
654,DRI,"The second driver, same-store sales growth, consists of price increases and revitalized customer traffic. Any price increases, other than the most minimal, would likely serve only to drive value-conscious customers elsewhere in this fiercely-competitive environment. Likewise, a brisk resurgence in customer traffic in 2010 is anything but guaranteed, especially in the first half of the year.
"
655,DRI,"The majority of economists expect unemployment to continue rising into the second half of 2010, after reaching levels not seen in decades. Consequently, it is more likely that this time around the consumer's recovery will be slower than in past recessions, because this one was deeper and longer. When employment resumes, consumers will be saddled with debt -- which is currently at record levels. Without the subsidies from rocketing home values that consumers had come to rely on the last decade, a return to thrift may be in vogue.
"
656,DRI,"Finally, some of the cost cuts achieved in the last two quarters will anniversary in 2010. These include labor savings from new scheduling systems and food waste savings from new kitchen technology. Commodities, however, seem set to continue decelerating with the economy, enabling some casual dining chains to lure cash-strapped diners with value menu offerings like the quick service operators have done so well. Brinker International's three concepts -- Chili's, On The Border and Maggiano's -- have each launched their own value menus.
"
657,DRI,"Excess industry capacity looms
"
658,DRI,"When the economy recovers, the casual dining industry will continue to suffer from an oversupply of capacity and lack of differentiation, particularly in the crowded bar and grill segment. To meet investors' expectations for growth, publicly traded restaurant chains expanded faster than demand for years, and in the mid-1990's, began opening units in less-traffic locations when ""A"" sites became scarce.
"
659,DRI,"As the recession eroded sales and tightened credit, most casual dining operators finally began curtailing unit growth and closing those that were under-performing -- for some, this is years after profitability began to sag. Independent restaurants and small franchisers with fewer resources to weather the recession are closing at a rapid clip.
"
660,DRI,"But to date, most large chains have closed relatively small numbers of under-performing units. S&A Restaurant Corp., the parent of Bennigan's and Steak & Ale restaurants, filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy last June, but many of the units remain in operation. Consequently, despite curtailed growth and a growing number of bankruptcies, industry capacity has not meaningfully shrunk the way it did in the quick service segment a few years ago.
"
661,DRI,"WEAKNESSES
"
662,DRI,"Casual dining underweight recommended
"
663,DRI,"Given the sector's recent multiple expansion, coupled with an expected slow recovery, we recommend underweighting the casual dining industry, particularly companies that lack differentiation or suffer from an outsized cost structure. We expect that any earnings disappointments or change in the overall economic outlook would be met with sharp stock price corrections and valuation multiple contractions.
"
664,DRI,"We are maintaining our Sell ratings on casual dining growth chains that continue to grow, despite sub-par profitability. BJ's Restaurants (BJRI  -  Free Report) and Red Robin Gourmet Burgers (RRGB  -  Free Report) are two examples.
"
665,DRI,"OPPORTUNITIES
"
666,DRI,"Buy ""best of breed""
"
667,DRI,"For buying opportunities, we would look for pullbacks in companies with strong brands that offer good value propositions and have a history of superior profitability and shareholder returns. Companies able to contain costs will have the ability to offer a ""value"" menu without squeezing margins, thereby boosting sales without sacrificing profitability.
"
668,DRI,"Darden Restaurants (DRI  -  Free Report) is our best example. We would also be a buyer of Buffalo Wild Wings (BWLD) on a sharp pullback. The company offers investors the strongest growth (25% EPS growth expected in 2009) and same-store sales (+4.5 in 4Q08) in the industry and a history of superior ROE and ROIC. However, the company is highly levered to the price of chicken wings (roughly 21% of sales), which has soared 39% since December, leaving estimates particularly vulnerable and too much risk in the stock at the current valuation of 18x the 2010 consensus EPS estimate.
"
669,DRI,"Scotts Miracle Gro Co. (SMG  -  Free Report) continues to push higher as investors anxiously await the company's second-quarter results, scheduled to be released on May 11. In the meantime, estimates have ticked higher, with the current-year up 23 cents in the last 90 days to $2.28. The next-year estimate is projecting 15% earnings growth. 
"
670,DRI,"Darden Restaurants Inc. (DRI  -  Free Report) has been on a tear for the last 6 months, climbing from a November low just above $13 to a recent new 52-week high just short of $40. Much like Scotts, analysts have been bullish on Darden. The current-year estimate is up 13 cents in the last 90 days to $2.68 per share, while the next-year estimate is up 5 cents in the last month to $2.86, a respectable 7% earnings growth projection.
"
671,DRI,"Darden Restaurants, Inc.'s (DRI  -  Free Report) share price has broken above a short-term level of resistance just above the $36 mark after testing this area numerous times over the last 3 weeks. The move higher is couple with higher earnings estimates. The current-year is up 17 cents in the last 30 days to $2.86 while the next-year estimate is up 14 cents in the same period to $2.86, a 7% growth projection. 
"
672,DRI,"Pharmerica Corp.'s (PMC) share price has also been on the move, building on a steady up trend that began in early March. Estimates have held steady, with the next-year estimate pegged at $1.35 per share, a 17% earnings growth projection. Pharmerica has produced consistent earnings over the past year, having surprised and beat in each of the last four quarters by an average of 6 cents, or 35%.
"
673,DRI,"Darden Restaurants Inc. (DRI  -  Free Report) is pressuring a key level of longer-term resistance between $37 and $38 after recently gapping higher on news of a good quarter. This stock has rallied handily since bottoming out just above $13 in late November with the overall market. Since then shares have advanced to their current level along a fairly aggressive trend line that is still in play. Take a look below. 
"
674,DRI,"Conagra Foods Inc. (CAG  -  Free Report) logged a solid performance in March, rallying with the overall market from a low-point just above $14 to a recent high above $17. Some short-term resistance has developed at this level, but pressure appears to be building as this stock continues to test. The MACD reading is still bullish, with the short-term moving average trending ahead of the long-term moving average. Take a look below. 
"
675,DRI,"Brinker International, Inc. (EAT  -  Free Report) received a brokerage upgrade after announcing preliminary fiscal third-quarter results on Monday. These factors pushed shares higher by more than 4% on Tuesday, making this restaurant company a top-performing Zacks #1 Rank today.  
"
676,DRI,"EAT expects earnings per share, before special items, of 44 cents to 45 cents in the quarter. (On a GAAP basis, the company expects 33 cents to 34 cents.)   
"
677,DRI,"Analysts predict earnings of 28 cents for the quarter, which is a penny higher than a month ago as 5 analysts have boosted their expectations in the past 30 days.  
"
678,DRI,"According to the company that operates Chili's Bar & Grill, earnings before special items were helped by an increase in margins, but partially offset by a greater-than-expected drop in same-store restaurant sales.   
"
679,DRI,"EAT's push to improve margins and drive profits through controlling operating costs should put the company in a good position once sales get back on track.  
"
680,DRI,"Earnings estimates for the fiscal year ending June 2009 moved higher 3.7% over the past month, thanks to 5 analysts raising their expectations. There has also been some improvement in just the past 7 days.   
"
681,DRI,"Expectations for next fiscal year are up 3.4% in a month. Furthermore, analysts currently expect profit to advance almost 9% over this fiscal year.

"
685,DRI,"Analysts are bullish on American Italian Pasta, the manufacturer of dry pasta for food distributors, grocery stores and club stores, in 2009 as more consumers choose to stay at home for dinner. Estimates are up 5.4% in just the last 30 days to $2.53 per share.Darden Restaurants, which operates well known chains such as Olive Garden and Red Lobster, is also an analyst favorite as its casual dining restaurants are holding up well in the recession.

688,DRI,"Casual Dining Too Pricey to Nibble OnRestaurant Stocks SizzleRestaurant stocks continued rocketing back from their November lows, soaring 24% thus far in March and outpacing the Russell 2000 and the S&P 500 indexes, both of which rose nearly 14% this month. Since bottoming in November, the Zacks restaurant index has more than doubled, rising 109%, compared with a gain of 27% for the Russell 2000 and a 23% increase in the S&P 500.Our restaurant indexÕs rebound has been sharper than the broader market, in part because its fall was greater. All 3 indexes remain 43% off their 52-week highs.Investors Prefer Casual DiningWithin the restaurant sector, the stocks of casual dining restaurants have rallied the strongest, rebounding 140% from their November lows, with upscale surging 118% and quick service, which has proven more recession-resistant, rising 80%.Rally Based On BernankeÕs OptimismA chief catalyst in the recent restaurant stock rally Ð and that of the broader market Ð was a series of comments by Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke anticipating a likely end to the recession in late 2009. Cast in that rosy light, casual dining shares surged as Darden RestaurantsÕ (DRI  -  Free Report) reported better-than-expected earnings report on March 18. The best-of-breed casual dining operator, which owns the Olive Garden and Red Lobster chains, said results improved throughout the quarter ended February 22, and it raised its earnings guidance.Two Month ÒTrendÓ of Decelerating Traffic Declines Does Not a Trend MakeWe think itÕs too early to call improved January and February traffic at a few best-in-class casual dining chains a trend, especially since FebruaryÕs weather was far milder than normal in many typically cold spots of the country. To be sure, many restaurant operators stopped giving earnings guidance because sustained meaningful improvement hinges on an overall economic recovery Ð and visibility to that is murky.More relevant, in our view, are the industryÕs 4Q08 same-store sales, which fell an average of 6.5% on easing 4Q07 comparisons. Comps would have been worse, but price hikes that averaged 3.5% partially offset a 10% plunge in customer traffic.Consumer Deleveraging Could Dampen Casual Dining RecoveryTraffic will likely stabilize in 2H09, in our opinion, as the industry laps weaker quarters, but we think the recovery will be slower than after past recessions, as consumers purge themselves from a decade-long binge on debt. Indeed, there is abundant evidence that the consumer may not be as resilient as recent stock price increases suggest.Falling home values, negative personal savings, and diminished retirement portfolios all suggest that consumers may increase savings more than consumption when unemployment eases. As a result, we think customer traffic and average unit volumes will likely remain at depressed levels into 2010.Excess Industry Capacity LoomsThe recession comes at a time when the casual dining industry is suffering from an oversupply of capacity and lack of differentiation, particularly in the crowded bar and grill segment. To meet investorsÕ expectations for growth, publicly traded restaurant chains expanded faster than demand for years, and in the mid-1990Õs, began opening units in less-traffic locations when ÒAÓ sites became scarce.As the recession erodes sales and tightens credit, most casual dining operators have finally begun curtailing unit growth and closing under-performing units Ð for some, this is years after profitability began to sag. Independent restaurants and small franchisers with fewer resources to weather the recession are closing at a rapid clip. On a larger scale, S&A Restaurant Corp., the parent of BenniganÕs and Steak & Ale restaurants, filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy last June and many more bar and grill operators are teetering on insolvency. Despite curtailed growth and a growing number of bankruptcies, industry capacity has not meaningfully shrunk.  Casual Dining Underweight RecommendedWith a slow recovery expected, we recommend underweighting the casual dining industry, particularly companies that lack differentiation, suffer from outsized cost structures, a lack of differentiation, a strong brandGiven the sectorÕs recent multiple expansion (to 14x forward earnings), coupled with an expected slow recovery, we recommend underweighting casual dining stocks. We expect that any earnings disappointments or change in the overall economic outlook would be met with sharp stock price corrections and valuation multiple contractions. OPPORTUNITIESBuy Best of BreedFor buying opportunities, we would look for pullbacks in companies with strong brands that offer good value propositions and have a history of superior profitability and shareholder returns. Companies able to contain costs will have the ability to offer a ÒvalueÓ menu without squeezing margins, thereby boosting sales without sacrificing profitability.Darden Restaurants (DRI  -  Free Report) is our best example. We would also be a buyer of Buffalo Wild Wings (BWLD) on a sharp pullback. The company offers investors the strongest growth (25% EPS growth expected in 2009) and same-store sales (+4.5 in 4Q08) in the industry and a history of superior ROE and ROIC. However, the company is highly levered to the price of chicken wings (roughly 21% of sales), which has soared 39% since December.WEAKNESSESConversely, we are maintaining our Sell ratings on casual dining growth chains that continue to grow, despite sub-par profitability. BJÕs Restaurants (BJRI  -  Free Report) and Red Robin Gourmet Burgers (RRGB  -  Free Report) are two examples.

691,DRI,"The Cheesecake Factory Inc. (CAKE  -  Free Report) has been undertaking prudent strategies to improve sales and margins. In order to counter high costs and soft consumer demand, the company is focusing on improving its speed of service and training servers, so that it renders higher level of service.Cheesecake Factory’s fourth-quarter 2017 earnings met analysts’ expectations, while revenues surpassed the same. The top and bottom line, however, declined 5.2% and 20.9%, respectively, due to a difficult operating environment in the U.S. restaurants space.Also, the company’s shares have declined 20.2% in the past year, comparing unfavorably with the industry’s gain of 16% in the same time period. Moreover, downward earnings estimate revisions raise questions over the stock’s upside potential. Estimates for 2018 have gone down 0.4% over the past month.Rising Costs Keep Profits Under PressureOf late, Cheesecake Factory’s profits have been under pressure owing to a rising wage rates scenario. Moreover, pre-opening cost of outlets, given the company’s unit expansion plans, and expenses related to sales initiatives are adding to the costs and likely to hurt profits.In the fourth quarter of 2017, cost of sales ratio increased 20 basis points (bps) year over year to 23.4%. Meanwhile, labor expense ratio was 34.5%, up 90 bps from the year-ago quarter. General and administrative expenses accounted for 6.1% of revenues in fourth-quarter 2017, up 80 bps from the prior-year quarter.Heading into 2018, the company expects food inflation of more than 3%, particularly across poultry, dairy, bread and seafood. Wage inflation is anticipated to be about 5% in 2018.Cost-Cutting Strategies & Efforts to Return Shareholders’ Value Seem EncouragingCheesecake Factory is evaluating different approaches to limit its costs. It installed a cost management system with substantial capabilities across production, planning and inventory management a few years ago to help analyze usage and waste. Amid the current soft environment, such efforts to control costs should help improve margins.Moreover, the company continuously returns wealth to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases. Management returned $175 million in cash via share buybacks and dividends in 2017. The company currently has a dividend yield of 2.4%, which is higher than the industry’s average of 2%.Sales-Building Initiatives Bring RespiteIn addition to enhanced labor productivity, Cheesecake Factory is majorly focusing on menu innovation and food efficiency. Under its Super Foods program, the company is preparing 50 menus, fresh from scratch in the restaurants, to increase consumer awareness of the brand. To this end, Cheesecake factory is also leveraging its brand power through launch of products in the CPG channel.Also, technology-enabled initiatives are driving incremental sales from the company’s delivery service that continues to roll out nationwide. Presently, about 90% of Cheesecake Factory restaurants offer third-party delivery. The restaurant also continues to improve its to-go business including online ordering capability, which could be in pilot by the end of the year. This is anticipated to be a major contributor to the growth of the company’s strong off-premise sales channels. In 2017, the company’s takeout business increased amounting to 12% of sales.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderCheesecake Factory carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in the same space include BJ’s Restaurants (BJRI  -  Free Report), Darden (DRI  -  Free Report) and Domino’s (DPZ  -  Free Report), each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

692,DRI,"Starbucks (SBUX  -  Free Report) has inked an agreement with SouthRock, a leading multi-brand restaurant operator in Brazil, to fully license Starbucks’ retail operations in the country. This move will enable SouthRock to develop and operate Starbucks stores in Brazil, thereby giving the coffee giant an opportunity to pursue its long-term growth agenda for Brazil.The company has been serving Brazilian customers since December 2006 with a consistent and authentic in-store experience. Starbucks serves customers in 113 stores in 17 cities across the states of São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro with more than 1,450 employees.Starbucks currently serves several Latin America and the Caribbean markets namely Argentina, Aruba and Curacao, Bahamas, Brazil, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Jamaica, Mexico, Panama, Peru, Puerto Rico, Trinidad and Tobago. With the transition of ownership in Brazil, Starbucks’ retail operations across all the 17 markets in Latin America and the Caribbean will become wholly licensed. The company has plans to open stores in Uruguay later this year.Global Expansion on TrackExpansion has been one of the important growth strategies for this coffee giant. Management focuses on increasing its global market share by judiciously opening stores in new and prevailing markets, remodeling existing stores, deploying technology, controlling costs, and aggressive product innovation and brand building.In fiscal 2018, Starbucks expects to expand globally by adding 2,300 net new locations (excluding Teavana closures), marking an increase from roughly 2,250 net new locations in fiscal 2017.Expanding beyond the United States has been one of Starbucks’ key growth strategies. Last December, Starbucks opened its 25th store in San Juan, Puerto Rico. In November 2017, the company opened its first store in Jamaica, marking the 76th market for the company. The company plans to launch 14 more stores over a period of five years. These stores will offer a range of Starbucks’ beverages and food, including its signature handcrafted hot and cold espresso beverages made with 100% arabica coffee.Meanwhile, Starbucks’ shares have gained 8.9% in the last six months, comparing favorably with 5.3% growth of its industry. Also, the trend in earnings estimate revisions is satisfactory as it moved 5.1% up for the current year and 3.7% for fiscal 2019 over the past 60 days. This signals at analysts’ optimism surrounding this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock’s performance in the near term. Stocks to ConsiderA few better-ranked stocks in the same space are Dine Brands Global, Inc.

693,DRI,"Noodles & Company (NDLS  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2017 numbers on Mar 14, after market close.The company has been bearing the brunt of soft consumer demand and declining comps for quite some time now. The challenging restaurant environment in expected to have affected the company’s fourth-quarter traffic and comps as well. Also, this fast-casual restaurant chain’s margins are expected to have been under pressure due to higher costs as well as expenses related to the implementation of strategic initiatives.However, various sales building initiatives such as streamlining of menu and its innovation, introduction of new cooking procedures, effective marketing strategy, increased focus on the off-premise business, along with investments in technology-driven initiatives like digital ordering remain encouraging.Notably, shares of Noodles & Company have rallied 95.8% in the past year outperforming the industry’s gain of 15.1%.Let’s take a look at how the company’s fourth quarter will shape up.Revenues Likely to Remain Under PressureThe grim sales scenario in the U.S. restaurant space is affecting Noodles & Company’s revenues of late. In the first nine months of 2017, the company’s net revenues decreased 4% year over year due to closing down of units and declining comps. The negative trend is expected to have continued in the fourth quarter as well. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter’s net revenues is pegged at $111 million, suggesting a 14.2% year-over-year decline.Decreased demand and subsequent closing down of restaurants have widely affected the company’s comps. In the first nine months of 2017, system-wide comps declined 3%. Keeping with the negative trend in comps, the consensus estimate for fourth quarter system-wide comparable sales suggests a 2.8% fall.Also, the consensus estimate projects company-owned and franchised comps to decline 3% and 1.3%, respectively, in the fourth quarter. Notably, in the first nine months of 2017, company-owned comparable sales fell 3.4% and franchise comps were down 0.3%.Bottom Line Likely to Benefit From the Closure of Underperforming RestaurantsNoodles & Company has been undertaking the task of closing underperforming restaurants that had been consistently hampering its human and financial capital. We believe that the company’s margins are likely to gain from such a move.Subsequently, the consensus estimate predicts the loss of a penny in the fourth quarter, comparing much favorably with a loss of 4 cents incurred in the year-ago quarter.Our Quantitative Model Does Not Predict a BeatNoodles & Company does not have the right combination of two main ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.Zacks ESP: The company has an Earnings ESP of 0.0%.

694,DRI,"Yum! Brands’ (YUM  -  Free Report) robust efforts to enhance digital capabilities, refranchising attempts and transformation strategies continue to be encouraging. However, higher costs continue to hurt the company’s profits. Also, macroeconomic headwinds and unfavorable currency translation might limit the company’s revenue growth.Last month, Yum! Brands reported mixed fourth-quarter 2017 results, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate on earnings but missing the same on revenues.Adjusted earnings of 96 cents per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 80 cents. Further, earnings increased 21.5% year over year. The shift to refranchising substantially boosted the company’s operating margin and earnings per share, and the trend is expected to continue.Notably, the company’s shares have gained 22.2% in the past year, outperforming the industry’s gain of 11.7%.Let’s look into the strengths and risks associated with the company.Digital Initiatives Drive Top-Line GrowthYum! Brands had undertaken a three-year strategic transformation plan to drive growth at KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell brands that involve employing greater focus on the development ofits three iconic global brands. To build traffic through greater consumer satisfaction, the company is continuously developing digital and technological capabilities.Advanced technological implementations to improve guest experience are also proving to be fruitful for the company’s international business. Yum! Brands believes in maximizing consumer satisfaction to drive revenues.To this end,the company is focusing on building a superlative loyalty program with a large and growing database to help drive future sales. We believe that these initiatives will drive traffic and comps in the coming quarters.In fourth-quarter 2017, Yum! Brands announced a partnership with online food-delivery platform Grubhub to enhance online sales and delivery from its restaurants. Additionally, the company implemented various digital features in mobile and online platforms in the fourth quarter across all its brand segments to improve guest experience. To enhance its delivery services, the company announced Pizza Hut’s partnership with Toyota that will facilitate delivery of pizzas via driverless vehicles, showcasing innovation for both the companies.Refranchising Aids EarningsYum! Brands has adopted a de-risking strategy by reducing its ownership of restaurants through refranchising. In fourth-quarter 2017, the company increased its franchise ownership to 97%. It is committed toward becoming at least 98% franchised and to possess less than 1,000 company-owned restaurants by the end of 2018.Refranchising a large portion of the system reduces the company’s capital requirements and facilitates earnings per share growth and higher Return on Equity (ROE). Alongside, free cash flow will continue to grow, facilitating reinvestments to increase brand recognition and shareholder return. Remarkably, this shift to refranchising has substantially benefited the company’s operating margin over the years. High Costs & Unfavorable Currency as Potential HeadwindsDue to continual expansion in international markets, the company is highly exposed to various macroeconomic headwinds. Thus, the company’s earnings remain highly vulnerable to fluctuations in exchange rates.Also, an increase in the cost of employee wages, benefits and insurance, as well as other operating costs such as rent and energy costs have led to a significant pressure on the company’s margins.  A competitive retail environment also puts pressure on the restaurants’ costs.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderYum! Brands carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in the U.S. restaurant space include BJ's Restaurants (BJRI  -  Free Report), Brinker International (EAT  -  Free Report) and Darden Restaurants (DRI  -  Free Report), each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

695,DRI,"Shake Shack Inc. (SHAK  -  Free Report) reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter 2017 results.Adjusted earnings of 10 cents per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 5 cents. Also, the bottom line rose 11.1% year over year given an increase in revenues.Revenues surged 31.2% year over year to $96.1 million and outpaced the consensus mark of $3 million. Rise in Shack sales and licensing revenues drove this top-line improvement.Despite the earnings beat, slow comps growth in the quarter and a comps decline for 2017 probably have made investors apprehensive about Shake Shack’s growth in the near term, resulting in a 4.6% share price fall in after-hours trading.However, in the last six months, Shake Shack stock has rallied 31.8%, significantly outperforming the industry’s 2.8% growth.The Top Line in DetailShack sales improved 31.3% year over year to $93.1million, primarily owing to the opening of 26 new domestic company-operated Shacks. Shake Shack’s cult following and successful expansion into various cities around the world boosted Shack sales as well as traffic.Licensing revenues for the quarter under review came in at $3 million, up 27.9% year over year on the back of unveiling 19 net new licensed Shacks. The company continues to cash in on the diversification of its licensing business and the opportunity to reach places that it could not, domestically.Same-Shack sales (or comps) inched up 0.8% year over year. The figure compared unfavorably with the year-ago quarter’s 1.5% rise. The metric declined 1.6% last quarter. For the reported period, comparable SHAK base that includes restaurants open for 24 full fiscal months or longer, had 43 Shacks compared with 29 in the year-ago quarter.Shake Shack, Inc. Revenue (TTM) Shake Shack, Inc. Revenue (TTM) | Shake Shack, Inc. QuoteOperating Performance Shack-level operating profit (non-GAAP operating income) of $23.5 million was up 30.3% year over year. The metric margins as a percentage of Shack sales decreased 20 bps to 25.2%, primarily due to increased labor and related expenses, certain fixed expenses and a rise in facility costs plus introduction of a broader range of unit volume Shacks.Adjusted EBITDA increased 30.7% to $14.9 million. However, as a percentage of total revenues, adjusted EBITDA margins declined roughly 10 bps to 15.5% on a year-over-year basis.General and administrative expenses were $11.7 million, up from $8.3 million a year ago. As a percentage of total revenues, general and administrative expenses were 12.1%, up 80 basis points from the prior-year quarter. This downside was primarily due to higher payroll expense, technology development costs, initial costs associated with Project Concrete, the Company's operational and financial systems upgrade initiative, and a duplicative non-cash deferred rent associated with the company's new home office.2017 ResultsAdjusted earnings were 57 cents, up from 46 cents a year ago. Total revenues surged 33% to $358.8 million. Same-Shack sales were down 1.2% against 4.2% growth in the previous year.2018 ViewThe company expects total revenues between $444 million and $448 million, lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $459.4 million. It projects Same-Shack sales to be flat and licensing revenues in the band of $12-$ 13 million.Shack-level operating profit margin is guided between 24.5% and 25.5% while general and administrative expenses are anticipated between $49 million and $51 million excluding roughly $4-$6 million of costs associated with Project Concrete.The company expects to launch 32-35 domestic company-operated Shacks and another 16-18 net licensed Shacks in 2018.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderShake Shack has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

696,DRI,"Individuals ramp up purchases of things like candies, chocolates, cologne, greeting cards along with flowers and other such gifts to pamper their loved ones on Valentine’s Day. Demand for dining out also sees an uptick.This Valentine’s Day won’t be any different. The demand for such discretionary items is likely to shoot up, largely facilitated by record wage growth and higher confidence on household income.Given the positive trends, it will be prudent to bet on fundamentally-sound companies that could make the most of Valentine’s Day.Americans to Spend Billions This Valentine’sAs per the recent annual survey by the National Retail Federation and Prosper Insights and Analytics, U.S. consumers are expected to spend a total of $19.6 billion on discretionary items this V-Day, up from $18.2 billion last year. This number will be the second-highest in the survey’s 15-year history, topped only by $19.7 billion witnessed in 2016.On average, consumers will spend $143.56, up from last year’s $136.57, as nearly 55% of the population celebrates the day. In fact, the survey shows that this year, consumers will spend an average $88.98 on spouses ($21.1 billion), $25.29 on children or parents ($3.5 billion), $7.26 on children’s classmates or teachers ($991 million), $7.19 on friends ($982 million), $4.79 on co-workers ($654 million) and $5.50 on pets ($751 million). Largely, consumers who are in the age group of 25 to 34 will be the biggest spenders, averaging $202.76.Nearly $4.7 billion will be spent on jewelry (19%), $1.9 billion on clothing (17%), $1.5 billion on gift cards/gift certificates (15%) and $2 billion on flowers (10%). But, most of the spending will come from eating out, around $3.7 billion (35%), while candy purchases will be up 55% from last year to a total of $1.8 billion. In the meantime, tickets to concerts or sporting events, better known as ‘gifts of experience’, continues to be in demand.And when it comes to shopping venues, much of it remains same as last year. Consumers planning to shop at department stores, discount stores, online, specialty stores, florists and local small business will be around 35%, 32%, 29%, 19%, 17% and 14%, respectively.Consumer Discretionary Spending on the RiseAmericans are set to splurge on discretionary items this Valentine’s Day, courtesy of fatter paychecks. Wages are growing at the quickest pace since the end of the last decade, which plays a significant role in driving consumer discretionary spending.Average hourly wages increased 9 cents, or 0.3%, to $26.74 in January. This helped the average year-on-year hourly earnings to rise to 2.9%, the highest since June 2009. Wages grew on a tighter labor market; tax cut policy and a rise in the minimum wage threshold in several states. Minimum wage has been raised in 18 states in January, which had a positive impact on 4.5 million workers, per the Economic Policy Institute (read more: Wages See Fastest Growth Since 2009: Top 5 Gainers).Moreover, consumer confidence was stronger than expected in January and hovered near a 17-year high, according to the Conference Board. More the confidence households generate, the higher will be the amount they spend.5 Stocks to Gain From Valentine’s DayConsumers are expected to spend near record levels this Valentine’s Day. Thus, investing in stocks that could make the most of the spending spree seems judicious. We have selected four such stocks that flaunt a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).Berkshire Hathaway Inc. BRK-B may be a property and casualty insurance and reinsurance company, but, candies and chocolates are one of its oldest holdings. In fact, the company has a 27% stake in The Kraft Heinz Company (KHC  -  Free Report), which is known for manufacturing Cadbury. Needless to say, Warren Buffet bought the California boxed-candy business way back in 1972, long before Berkshire Hathaway became a household name for serious investors.The stock has a Zacks Rank #2. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings rose 4.4% in the last 90 days. Berkshire Hathaway is expected to give a positive return of 22.9% next quarter. The company has outperformed its industry in the last one-year period (+18.6% vs +14.7%).You may not relate package delivery company, United Parcel Service, Inc. (UPS  -  Free Report) with Valentine’s Day, but UPS will deliver more than 88 million flowers on the day. The company is expected to trim freshly-cut flowers from Latin America to Miami International and then distribute them to major cities across the United States.The stock has a Zacks Rank #2. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings rose 12.5% in the last 90 days.

697,DRI,"Restaurant Brands International, Inc. (QSR  -  Free Report) reported mixed fourth quarter of 2017 results, with earnings surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate but revenues missing the same.Adjusted earnings of 66 cents per share outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 57 cents by 15.8%. The bottom line also improved 50% year over year on higher revenues, partly offset by increased expenses.Revenues of $1.2 billion increased 11.1% year over year primarily owing to the inclusion of Popeye’s Louisiana Kitchen’s results as well as higher system-wide sales at both the Tim Hortons and the Burger King segments. However, the top line missed the consensus mark of $1.3 billion by 2%.Concurrent with the release of quarterly results, Restaurant Brands declared a dividend of 45 cents per share payable on April 2, 2018 to shareholders and unitholders of record at the close of business on March 15, 2018.In a year’s time, the stock has gained 10% compared with the industry’s 12% rally.Let’s delve deeper in to the numbers.Segmental PerformanceRestaurant Brands operates through three segments – Tim Hortons, Burger King and Popeye’s Louisiana Kitchen.Tim Hortons reported revenues of $821.7 million, reflecting a rise of 3.5% (decline of 0.9% on an FX neutral basis) over the prior-year quarter, primarily owing to system-wide sales growth.System-wide sales increased 2.4% on the back of net restaurant growth. The improvement in sales remained unchanged from the year-ago period but the metric was lower than 3% posted last quarter.Comps at this segment increased 0.1% in the quarter versus 0.2% growth in the prior-year quarter and 0.3% increase in the preceding quarter. Comps were primarily driven by 0.8% growth in Canada.Burger King’s revenues were up 8.6% from the prior-year quarter to $344.9 million, mainly on the back of system-wide sales growth.System-wide sales rose 12.3%, higher than 8.5% growth in the year-ago comparable period and 11.2% increase in the preceding quarter. System-wide sales growth can be attributable to net restaurant growth of 6.5% and positive comps growth.Comps grew 4.6% in the quarter under review versus 2.8% growth in the prior-year quarter and 3.6% increase in the preceding quarter. The upside was driven by U.S. comps growth of 5.1%.Popeye’s Louisiana Kitchen revenues in this segment amounted to $67.6 million. System-wide sales rose 6.8% owing to net restaurant growth of 6.1%, partially offset by declining comps. Notably, comps at this division declined 1.3% comparing unfavorably with a 2.8% decline in the year ago quarter and 1.8% in the prior quarter. The decline was due to a 2.5% decrease in U.S. comps.Restaurant Brands International Inc. Revenue (TTM) Restaurant Brands International Inc. Revenue (TTM) | Restaurant Brands International Inc. QuoteOperating Performance Company adjusted EBITDA rose 13.7% (10.8% FX neutral) owing to revenue increase and cost management.

Burger King’s EBITDA was up 13.4% (12.1% on an FX neutral basis) year over year driven primarily by revenue growth and cost control.Cash, Capital and DividendThe company exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalent balance of $1.2 billion, accounts receivable balance of $455.9 million and inventories of $78 million. Long-term debt was $11.8 billion. In 2017, net cash provided by operating activities was $1.4 billion.During the quarter under review, the company completed preferred share redemption and repurchase of 5 million partnership exchangeable units of Restaurant Brands International Limited Partnership.Zacks Rank and Key PicksRestaurant Brands carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Better-ranked stocks in the same space are Darden Restaurants (DRI  -  Free Report), BJ's Restaurants (BJRI  -  Free Report) and Brinker International (EAT  -  Free Report), each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

698,DRI,"Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (CMG  -  Free Report) recently reported mixed fourth-quarter 2017 results, with earnings surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate but revenues lagging the same.Adjusted earnings per share in the quarter were $1.34, surpassing the consensus estimate of $1.32 by 1.5%. Including the 21-cent positive impact from the U.S. tax law, earnings came in at $1.55. Earnings also grew 143.6% year over year on lower costs and higher revenues.Despite the earnings beat, revenue miss, weak 2018 comps guidance and slowdown in planned store openings probably have made investors apprehensive about Chipotle’s sales growth in the near term, resulting in a 5.4% plunge in share price in after-hours trading.Also, the company’s shares have lost 25.2% in the past year, underperforming the industry’s gain of 13.5%.Chipotle has been bearing the brunt of a challenging restaurant operating environment and has been particularly plagued by negative publicity related to food-borne illnesses, which had surfaced toward 2015-end. In order to regain reputation and drive sales, the company has been trying to streamline operations and enhance guest experience.Toward this end, Chipotle is focusing on digital innovation. In fact, in the fourth quarter, the company hit new records as its digital sales mix was 8.6% of sales while two of the company’s regions have digital sales of more than 10% of their overall mix. Chipotle is also reinvesting in existing restaurants and trying to improve their appearances and functions.Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. QuoteRevenues and Comparable Restaurant SalesQuarterly revenues of $1.11 billion lagged the consensus estimate of $1.12 billion by 0.9% but grew 7.3% year over year. The revenue growth is primarily attributable to restaurant openings. The company opened 38 new restaurants in the fourth quarter and relocated an additional four restaurants, reaching the total restaurant count to 2,408.The rise in comps somewhat partially favored revenues. Comps in the quarter increased 0.9% which includes a 0.6% reduction related to deferred revenues recognized during the year-ago quarter due to the Chiptopia Summer Rewards program. Comps were driven by an increase in average check, including a 2.4% impact from menu price increase in select restaurants during the second and fourth quarter of 2017, partially offset by a decline in transactions.Costs, Operating Highlights & Net IncomeFood costs, as a percentage of revenues, decreased 110 basis points (bps) to 34.2% driven by cost savings in paper and packaging usage as well as higher menu prices. Favorable avocado prices during the quarter, when compared with the prior-year quarter, also led to cost reduction.General and administrative expenses comprised 5.2% of total revenues, reflecting a decrease of 110 bps year over year. This can be attributed to lower legal costs and non-cash stock-based compensation expenses.Restaurant level operating margin was 14.9%, up 140 bps from 13.5% in the year-ago quarter. The upside was primarily driven by reduced food, beverage and packaging expenses and lowered promotional activities.Net income inthe quarter was $43.8 million, up from $16.0 million in the prior-year quarter, courtesy of $6.0 million gain from changes in the U.S. tax law.Balance SheetCash and cash equivalents as of Dec 31, 2017, were $184.6 million compared with $87.9 million as of Dec 31, 2016.Inventory totaled $19.9 million as of Dec 31, 2017, up from $15 million as of Dec 31, 2016.

Diluted earnings per share were $6.17, including a benefit of 21 cents per share resulting from changes in U.S. tax law, compared with 77 cents in 2016.Restaurant level operating margin was 16.9%, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 410 bps. Net income in 2017 was $176.3 million, showing an improvement from $22.9 million last year.The company opened 183 new restaurants in the year and relocated 25 more, including 15 ShopHouse Southeast Asian Kitchen Restaurants.2018 OutlookFor 2018, management expects comps increase of low single digits and expects to launch130-150 restaurants.

(DNKN  -  Free Report) reported strong fourth-quarter 2017 results, exceeding the Zacks Consensus Estimate on both counts.Adjusted earnings of 64 cents per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 63 cents.  Earnings, however, stayed flat year over year, as a decline in adjusted net income was offset by decline in shares outstanding.Revenues increased 5.3% year over year to $227.1 million. The top line also surpassed the consensus mark of $223 million. The improvement was on the back of a rise in franchise fees owing to additional renewal income, offset by a decline in gross openings.The increase in revenues was offset by a decline in sales of ice cream and other products, to the company’s licensees in the Middle East, and a decline in royalty income mainly because of an extra week in the prior-year period as well as a reduction in refranchising gains.

The downtrend was mainly due to decline in sales of ice cream products to licensees in the Middle East, partly offset by increases in royalty income and other revenues. Comps improved 3%, better than 0.7% rise in the prior-year quarter.Operating PerformanceAdjusted operating income rose 9.2% from the year-ago quarter to $123.5 million mainly as a result of higher revenues.

700,DRI,"Brinker International, Inc. (EAT  -  Free Report) is currently focusing on franchising and digital initiatives.Recently, the company reported second-quarter fiscal 2018 results, with earnings surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate and increasing 22.5% year over year. The recent tax reform drove earnings.In fact, earnings beat the consensus mark in three of the trailing four quarters, delivering an average positive surprise of 8.65%. Meanwhile, estimates for 2018 have gone up 5.3% over the last 30 days, reflecting analysts’ optimism surrounding the stock.Revenues, missed the consensus mark in the second quarter and declined slightly year over year, mainly due to soft company sales at Chilli’s.However, sales-building efforts like menu innovation and enhancing digital services are expected to drive traffic and comps, both at Chili’s and Maggiano’s.Shares of Brinker have gained 5.1% in the past three months, outpacing 1% loss of the industry.Efforts to Drive Traffic and SalesBrinker remains firm on its goal to revive revenues through a range of initiatives such as streamlining of menu and strengthening value proposition, better food presentation, advertising campaigns, kitchen system optimization and introduction of an improved service platform.In the second quarter, the company simplified Chili’s core menu by improving recipes and strengthening its value proposition with higher-quality ingredients and new cooking techniques. Notably, for the rest of the year, Brinker plans to focus on marketing and operational execution that will drive traffic and help the company gain market share.At Maggiano's, the company is continuing to deliver differentiated dining experience with the rollout of a new menu. The new menu expands dining options to drive incremental visits. In the second quarter, Maggiano’s delivered record sales and the company’s earnings growth was largely attributable to the chain’s holiday season profit.Brinker is also investing heavily in technology-driven initiatives, like online ordering, to augment sales and boost guest count. Having installed a table top technology at all the company-owned restaurants in partnership with Ziosk, the company has now implemented handheld devices in all of California. This is resulting in increased efficiency and speed. Moreover, Brinker effectively uses the social media platforms and email database to drive customer awareness and boost traffic. These initiatives will contribute significantly to Brinker’s business.Meanwhile, the To-Go platform has been the fastest growing segment of the company. In the second quarter, the company delivered positive To-Go sales driven by double-digit increases in online ordering.Moreover, the company launched a digital curbside platform in its company-owned restaurants. Thus, take-out guests can now order, pay, and get their food easily through the Chili's app. With about half of the company’s online guests using it, the service is ensuring simpler, faster, effortless experience to take-out guests, thereby resulting in higher check, this should thus improve sales.Franchising & Expansion to Strengthen BrandTo survive in an industry that largely depends on franchising, Brinker started to pursue expansion through franchisees and partnerships. The company acquired 103 franchised Chili’s Grill and Bar restaurants from Pepper Dining Holding Corp. in 2015. Notably, in fiscal 2017, Brinker’s franchise operated locations increased 40%.Management is gearing up for international expansion as well, especially in the faster growing emerging markets. Though it is faced with a few bottlenecks in the Middle East, the company’s Latin American business has been solid. The company is also on the lookout to expand its brand in existing markets and enter new ones. Brinker intends to open 38 to 43 restaurants globally, including new markets like Panama, Chile and Vietnam, in fiscal 2018.Expansion, both through company-owned restaurants and franchises, is expected to continue to strengthen Brinker’s brand and augment guests’ experience. The franchisee expansion should boost the company’s top and bottom lines.Zacks Rank & Other Stocks to ConsiderBrinker sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).A few other top-ranked stocks in the same space are Domino’s (DPZ  -  Free Report), Darden Restaurants (DRI  -  Free Report) and BJ's Restaurants (BJRI  -  Free Report), all carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

While 64.9% of these companies have beaten estimates on both counts, 80.5% surpassed earnings estimates and 78.1% exceeded top-line expectations.Restaurant Players Have Impressed So FarWe note that performance of restaurant players has been decent so far this earnings season. Among the restaurant stocks that have already reported, McDonald's Corp. (MCD  -  Free Report) and Darden Restaurants (DRI  -  Free Report) posted robust fourth-quarter 2017 and fiscal second-quarter 2018 results, respectively, beating earnings and revenue estimates. Meanwhile, Brinker International, Inc. (EAT  -  Free Report) posted mixed second-quarter fiscal 2018, with earnings surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate but revenues lagging the same.The year 2017 saw the space grappling with rising costs, weak comps, higher restaurant prices, consumer spending uncertainty on dining out, decline in at-home food costs, market saturation and shifting preference of consumers.However, the industry remains steady, thanks to the counter-strategies of some innovative operators. These include various sales building and cost cutting efforts, franchisee-based business models, loyalty programs and most importantly increased usage of technology.The Broader Sector Looks StrongThe restaurant industry belongs to the broader Retail-Wholesale sector, which is expected to deliver strong performance this earnings season. Overall, fourth-quarter earnings for the sector are expected to be up 6.6% year over year, with revenues anticipated to rise 8.8%.Given this backdrop, let’s see what’s in store for three industry players slated to report fourth-quarter 2017 results.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Buffalo Wild Wings’  for earnings and revenues is pegged at $1.56 per share and $543 million, respectively.

The consensus mark for earnings is pegged at 63 cents, reflecting 1.6% declinefrom the year-ago quarter’s actual figure.We expect the company’s top line to benefit from system-wide sales growth backed by franchise fees and royalty income, and strong rental income. License fees related to Dunkin' Donuts K-Cup pods and ready-to-drink bottled iced coffee, along with increased transfer fee income are also expected to strengthen the top line.The bottom line, however, is likely to stay under pressure as the company anticipates roughly $6 million of incremental interest expense from a recent debt deal and a higher effective tax rate resulting from reserve of foreign tax credit carry-forwards in the third quarter. The stock has a Zacks Rank #2.Dunkin' Brands Group, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Dunkin' Brands Group, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Dunkin' Brands Group, Inc.

704,DRI,"Yum! Brands, Inc.’s (YUM  -  Free Report) board of directors recently approved a 20% rise in quarterly cash dividend to 36 cents per share of common stock from 30 cents. It will be distributed on Mar 9, to shareholders of record on the closing of business as on Feb 14.Shares of the company have rallied 31.2% in the past year, outpacing the industry’s gain of 22.3%.Dividend Hike to Lure ShareholdersNotably, Yum! Brands raised its quarterly dividend despite a 33% year-over-year decline in net income in the first nine months of 2017. This underscores management’s plan to lure investors with attractive returns. In fact, over the next three years, the company is committed to returning an additional $6.5 billion to $7 billion to shareholders through stock repurchases and dividends.Refranchising to Enhance Shareholders’ ValueThe company has adopted a de-risking strategy by reducing its ownership of restaurants through refranchising. This reduces capital requirements and facilitates earnings per share growth and ROE expansion. Refranchising also boosts free cash flow, facilitating reinvestments to increase brand recognition and shareholders’ return.In third-quarter 2017, Yum! Brands increased its franchise ownership to 95% and is committed toward becoming at least 98% franchised. In fact, it expects to possess less than 1,000 company-owned restaurants by the end of 2018.Management expects to cut capex to about $100 million by 2019, increase free cash flow conversion to 100% and also reduce General and Administrative (G&A) expenditure by approximately $300 million (or 1.7% of system sales). Resultantly, earnings are expected to be at least $3.75 in 2019.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderYum! Brands carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in the restaurant space include Darden Restaurants (DRI  -  Free Report), McDonald's (MCD  -  Free Report) and Domino's Pizza (DPZ  -  Free Report). While Darden flaunts a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), McDonald’s and Domino's carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

705,DRI,"McDonald's Corp. (MCD  -  Free Report) is set to report its fourth-quarter 2017 numbers on Jan 30, before the bell.Last quarter, the company pulled off a positive earnings surprise of 0.57%. In fact, McDonald's earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters, with an average beat of 5.21%.Notably, shares of the company have returned 41.4% in the past year.McDonald's Corporation Price McDonald's Corporation Price | McDonald's Corporation QuoteWe expect the company’s solid comps growth to drive quarterly results. Meanwhile, though increased focus on refranchising is likely to boost earnings, it may have an adverse impact on revenue growth in the quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter’s earnings is pegged at $1.59, representing a year-over-year increase of 10.4%. The same for revenues is projected to be $5.3 billion, down 12.8% from the prior-year quarter.Comps Growth Does Not Guarantee Revenue GrowthGlobal comps at McDonald’s have been positive for the last nine quarters, a trend that is likely to continue in the fourth quarter as well. This appears to be the result of the company’s strategic efforts to boost sales.In order to boost comps in the United States, McDonald’s has been increasingly focusing on growing guest traffic. In this regard, the company is striving to achieve operational excellence, innovate, offer a value menu and roll out more limited-time offerings.Despite these efforts, a challenging restaurant environment may cause a decline in revenues in the U.S. segment. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the U.S. segment revenues is pegged at $1.96 billion, reflecting a year-over-year decline of 3.7%.Coming to High-Growth Markets, comprehensive focus on new products, alongside growth across the delivery, value and breakfast platforms are yielding results. However, political and economic unrest are likely to somewhat hurt sales.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues in High-Growth Markets is pegged at $975 million, reflecting a year-over-year decline of 35.8%.The international lead segment may appear as an exception. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $1.82 billion, reflecting year-over-year growth of 2.5%.In International Lead Markets, McDonald’s is consistently trying to improve its performance and drive comps via introduction of value meals, reimaging of restaurants, efficient marketing and promotions, improved service and increased convenience via delivery.Also, McDonald’s is likely to witness a decline in sales by company-operated restaurants due to the impact of its strategic refranchising initiative, which, in turn, will lower the company’s revenues in the fourth quarter. Evidently, revenues at company-operated restaurants decreased 23% to $3.06 billion in the last quarter. In fact, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged at $2.54 billion for the quarter under review, representing a year-over-year estimated decline of 30.4%.Our Model Suggests a BeatPlease note that according to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive Earnings ESP. Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell) stocks are best avoided, especially if they have a negative Earnings ESP.

707,DRI,"If you’re looking for a profitable portfolio of stocks that will offer the best of value and growth investing, try the growth at a reasonable price or GARP strategy. It helps an investor gain exposure to stocks that are undervalued and have impressive growth prospects. Unlike a blend strategy, a portfolio that uses GARP investing is expected to include stocks that offer the best of both value and growth investing.GARP Metrics – Mix of Growth & Value MetricsThe GARP approach helps to zero in on stocks that are priced below the market or any reasonable target determined by fundamental analysis. These stocks also have solid prospects in terms of cash flow, revenues, earnings per share (EPS) and so on.Growth MetricsStrong earnings growth history and impressive earnings prospects are the main aspects that GARP investors borrow from the growth investing strategy. However, instead of super-normal growth rates, pursuing stocks with a more stable and reasonable growth rate is also a tactic of GARP investors. Hence, growth rates between 10% and 20% are considered ideal under the GARP strategy.Another growth metric that is considered by both growth and GARP investors is return on equity (ROE). GARP investors look for strong and higher ROE compared to the industry average to identify superior stocks. Moreover, stocks with positive cash flow find precedence under the GARP plan.Value MetricsGARP investing gives priority to one of the popular value metrics – price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. Though this investing style picks stocks with higher P/E ratios compared to value investors, it avoids companies with extremely high P/E ratios. Moreover, the price-to-book value (P/B) ratio is another value metric that is considered.Using the GARP principle, we have run a screen to identify stocks that should offer solid returns in the near term.Screening ParametersAlong with the criteria discussed in the above section, we have considered a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).Last 5-year EPS & projected 3–5 year EPS growth rates between 10% and 20% (Strong EPS growth history and prospects ensure improving business.)ROE (over the past 12 months) greater than the industry average (Higher ROE compared to the industry average indicates superior stocks.)P/E and P/B ratios less than M-industry average (P/E and P/B ratios less than that of the industry indicates that the stocks are undervalued.)These few criteria have narrowed down the universe of over 7,700 stocks to only 11.Here are seven of the 11 stocks that made it through the screen:Tempur Sealy International, Inc.

708,DRI,"Fastenal Company (FAST  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Jan 17, before the opening bell.Increased installation of industrial vending machines is expected to boost sales and profits in the to-be-reported quarter as it is one of the primary growth drivers. Sales through its vending machines continued to grow at or near a double-digit pace in each of the first three quarters of 2017. Fastenal signed 15,089 vending machines during the first nine months of 2017, reflecting an increase of 5.5% from the prior-year quarter.Notably, the average daily sales growth rate of 15.4% in November was higher than the 13.8% increase in October 2017. However, average daily sales growth rate of 13.8% in October was lower than the 15.3% increase in September 2017.Moreover, a continual increase in the number of on-site locations is likely to expand Fastenal’s market share and contribute to the quarterly numbers. The company signed 213 new onsite locations during the first nine months of 2017 and had 555 active sites as on Sep 30, 2017, reflecting an increase of 47.6% year over year. The company aims to achieve 275-300 onsite signings in 2017, compared with 176 signings in 2016.We are also encouraged by Fastenal’s acquisition of certain assets of industrial and fastener supply distributor — Manufacturer's Supply Company (Mansco) — in March 2017. This ensures Fastenal’s presence in markets where it has not meaningfully contributed in the past. Mansco contributed 130 basis points (bps) to total sales growth of 11.8% in the last reported quarter and is expected to contribute in the to-be-reported quarter as well.Based on sustained strength in most of its end markets and strong momentum in vending machines installations and onsite locations, the company is confident about reporting solid top-line growth in the fourth quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $1.08 billion, implying 14.2% year over year growth. The consensus estimate for earnings stands at 45 cents, reflecting a 12.5% year-over-year increase.However, we are apprehensive about Fastenal’s changes in product and customer mix that have been hurting the gross margin for quite some time now. Gross margin of 49.4% in the first nine months of 2017 dropped 10 bps from the prior-year quarter.Also, foreign exchange headwinds may dampen prospects. Unfavorable currency impacted sales by 0.5% in October and 0.4% in November 2017.Quantitative Model PredictionHere is what our quantitative model predicts:Fastenal has the right combination of two main ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Fastenal is +6.08%.

709,DRI,"Papa John's International, Inc. (PZZA  -  Free Report) stock has been losing sheen of late. Further, the company carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Let’s explore some of the reasons that may have resulted in the downside.Shares Down Papa John's shares have lost 29.2% over the last year against the industry’s gain of 21.7%. Downward estimate revisions add to its woes. In the last 60 days, the fourth quarter and 2018 earnings estimates have moved down 6.8% and 6%, respectively. This reflects analysts’ pessimism on the stock, given an uncertain sales environment and rising expenses.Lowered Guidance for the Full YearLike other industry players, Papa John's margins are being hurt by rising labor costs and costs related to various comps and sales boosting initiatives. The company has lowered its full year adjusted EPS growth expectation from a range of 8% to 12% to 3% to 7%.North America system-wide comps growth is estimated to be 1.5%, down from the previous range of 2% to 4% growth. Debt EBITDA ratio is expected in the range of 2.5x to 3.5x, higher than the previously projected range of 1.5x to 2.0x.Papa John's International, Inc. Gross Profit (TTM) Papa John's International, Inc. Gross Profit (TTM) | Papa John's International, Inc. QuoteReduced Spending Hurts Industry PlayersThe restaurant space is not much attractive for investors currently. Consumers increased their spending on dining modestly in the past few quarters. This is because disposable income is being marred by wage growth and inflation is also on the rise. Higher health care costs and tightened credit availability have further worsened the situation.Moreover, increasing demand for high-quality products at lower prices is forcing grocery stores to lower food prices to remain competitive. This is resulting in a bigger gap between food-at-home and food-away-from-home indices.Thus, same-store sales growth has been dull in a difficult sales environment. Traffic too has been weak. As a result, Papa John's sales have come under pressure. In fact, the third quarter of 2017 marked the seventh-consecutive quarter of negative comp sales for the restaurant industry as a whole, thereby continuing the somber mood.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the same space are Darden Restaurants (DRI  -  Free Report), Domino's Pizza (DPZ  -  Free Report) and Dunkin' Brands (DNKN  -  Free Report), each sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

710,DRI,"Retail sector is hogging the limelight and this time for good reasons. The holiday season turned out to be a blissful one as consumers continued to fill their shopping carts on the back of a favorable economic scenario.A buoyant stock market, rising income, low unemployment level and upbeat consumer sentiment together worked in favor of retailers. Consumer spending — one of the pivotal factors driving the economy — remained robust during the season with retail sales rising 0.4% and 0.9% in December and November, respectively, per government data.Analysts pointed that the festive season showcased a stellar performance since the recession of 2008. Per National Retail Federation, sales (excluding autos, gas and restaurant sales) during the November/December period increased 5.5% to $691.9 billion, surpassing its own projection of a 3.6% - 4% rise. Online shopping, which is included in the results, surged 11.5%. Clearly, retailers cashed in on customers, who preferred shopping from the comfort of their homes, online or through their mobile phones.The sector has certainly been facing the brunt of heightened online competition, lower footfall and changing consumer spending patterns but of late the tables are turning in favor of the retailers. With digital transformation in shopping they are fast adopting the omni-channel mantra to provide a seamless shopping experience, whether online or in-stores. The result of their endeavors was quite visible from the holiday sales data.Retailers such as Urban Outfitters (URBN  -  Free Report) and Kohl’s Corp. (KSS  -  Free Report) registered sales growth of 3.6% and 6.9%, respectively, during the November-December period, while both J. C. Penney (JCP  -  Free Report) and Target (TGT  -  Free Report) recorded comparable store sales growth of 3.4%. Macy’s (M  -  Free Report) comparable sales on an owned basis rose 1%, while on an owned plus licensed basis the same increased 1.1% in the combined November/December period.4 Likely Winners for the SeasonCertainly investors are pinning hopes on the retail stocks this earnings season, given the euphoria surrounding the sector. The sector, which occupies the top 13% (2 out of 16) position in the list of 16 Zacks categorized sectors, has advanced roughly 34% in a year and outperformed the S&P 500’s  growth of approximately 23%. Moreover, according to the latest Earnings Trends report, the sector is expected to record top and bottom-line growth of 8.5% and 4.5%, respectively, in this earnings season.Here we have highlighted four stocks with Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and a positive Earnings ESP. The chance of a positive earnings surprise for stocks having such combination is as high as 70%.Dollar Tree, Inc. (DLTR  -  Free Report), which is expected to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Mar 7, is a solid bet with a long-term earnings growth rate of 13.1%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter is pegged at $1.88.

711,DRI,"The unprecedented reversal in the stock market on Jan 16 signals at more choppy trading sessions ahead, thanks to fears of a possible federal government shutdown by the end of the week. The Republican-led Congress is facing numerous obstacles from fellow conservatives and many Democrats.Traders also looked at the recent record-breaking run by major bourses as another sign that the market is getting too pricey and entering the overbought territory. Given such uncertainties, investing in sound stocks that are unfazed by market gyrations seems judicious.Threat of a Government Shutdown LoomsU.S. stocks scaled to record highs last week, mostly on positive earnings results from banking majors Wells Fargo & Company (WFC  -  Free Report) and JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM  -  Free Report). They beat analysts’ estimates for revenues and earnings. However, this week, the broader market failed to sustain the gains as investors apprehend a government shutdown.Republican-led Congress needs to pass a funding bill by Jan 19 to avert a government closure. But there are perils. Conservatives within the party want a hike in defense spending that such a bill will not provide. Meanwhile, Democrats might withhold their support until issues related to immigration policy are sorted out. Talks regarding shielding the Dreamers — immigrants brought into the country illegally as children — from deportation have come to a sudden halt between the parties.President Trump, in the meanwhile, has expressed his displeasure toward the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), an Obama-era immigration policy. He has repeatedly blamed the Democrats for such an executive order. The President argued that such a policy isn’t adequate and demanded a merit-based system of immigration as well as funding for a border wall with neighboring state Mexico.But, if we look into last week, negotiations regarding an immigration policy managed to reach a conclusion with the President promising to sign whatever the congressional negotiators decide on. This was taken as a sign of progress in an already tense situation. Having said that, here, we are again facing the possibility of a government shutdown. This makes us believe that shutdown threats are common to politicians. This is because it helps the governing party and the opposition to win over their supporters. After all, the governing party shows that their opposition doesn’t want them to work smoothly and meet their core targets. The opposition also adopts this as a primary stand on an issue that is of utmost importance to them. Needless to say, party affiliations may change, but political dynamics more or less remain the same.How to Play a Possible Government Shutdown?To avoid an embarrasing shutdown, the Republicans rolled out a plan to fund the government for a short time. But, such a move is only expected to extend the deadline for a shutdown until Feb 16. So, the concern remains, with the markets apprehending a lot of gyration in the near future. Thus, such uncertainty calls for investors to build a strategy on low-risk assets and a combination of parameters that lead to better returns. The best way to go about doing this is by creating a portfolio of ultra-safe stocks.They essentially have a low beta, which makes them less volatile than the markets they trade in. In this case, a low beta ranges from 0 to 1. They also have large market capitalization (a market capitalization value of $10 billion or more), which helps them provide steadily-increasing earnings growth without having much risk of collapsing. We have, thus, zeroed in on five such stocks that also flaunt a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).Union Pacific Corporation (UNP  -  Free Report), through its subsidiary Union Pacific Railroad Company, operates railroads in the United States.

712,DRI,"The Wendy's Company (WEN  -  Free Report) yesterday announced that it has opened its 500th international restaurant in Guatemala City.The outlet was opened through the company’s franchise organization, Alimentos Corporativos Coralsa, which operates 13 restaurants in Guatemala and employs more than 400 Wendy staff.Wendy's president and CEO Todd Penegor stated, ""this is a great achievement that we attribute to the strength of our brand and partnerships with exceptional and dedicated franchisees who are committed to developing Wendy's abroad.""We observe that shares of Wendy's have rallied 28.4% in the past year, outperforming the industry’s gain of 20.1%.Leveraging Opportunities in Less Saturated Emerging MarketsThe move that followed recent openings in Indonesia, Malaysia, Brazil and Chile is part of the company’s consistent efforts to build a strong international presence by expanding in less saturated emerging markets.These markets offer significant opportunities to companies like Wendy’s to expand due to their relatively low per-capita consumption and rising income levels of the middle class that has led to an increase in demand for convenience food and beverages.Wendy’s remains on track to achieve its goal of 7,500 global restaurants by 2020.Boosting Earnings and Cash Flow Through Franchisee Based ModelThe move is just another example of how well Wendy’s is focused on boosting its franchisee related revenues. Franchising a large chunk of its system lowers its general and administrative expenses, thereby boosting earnings.Moreover, over the long term, it will generate higher return on equity by lowering capital requirements. This will also boost free cash flow, thereby enhancing shareholder returns. Besides adding to the top line in the form of royalty and rental income, it will allow the company to penetrate the market more quickly. The company targets to monetize 70% of its owned real estate by 2017 to further enhance earnings. It expects 80% of its earnings to come from royalty and rental income.Wendy's Company (The) Net Income (TTM) Wendy's Company (The) Net Income (TTM) | Wendy's Company (The) QuoteLast Words Wendy's revenues have been declining over the past few quarters due to reduced number of company-operated restaurants.

713,DRI,"Denny's Corporation (DENN  -  Free Report), like most other U.S. full-service restaurant chains, has been bearing the brunt of soft consumer spending and sluggish sales owing to the recent hurricanes. However, the company has undertaken various initiatives to navigate the challenging restaurant industry.Toward this end, Denny’s banks on four strategies which include deliverance of differentiated brands to achieve consistent comps growth, carrying out operations of famous restaurants, fortifying its franchise position by expanding globally and focusing on cost and capital allocation that would drive profitable growth and enhance shareholders’ value.Denny's recently reported its initial domestic comps figures for fourth quarter and fiscal 2017, which ended on Dec 27, 2017. Despite the macro woes plaguing the restaurant space, the company’s reported comps figures make us ever more optimistic about the final results.Shares of Denny's have rallied 18.7% in the past six months, outperforming the industry’s gain of 6.2%.Comps Figures in DetailsDenny’s fourth-quarter domestic system-wide comps grew 2.2%. This included an increase in comps of 2.2% and 2.1% in the company’s domestic franchised restaurants and company restaurants, respectively.

715,DRI,"A wise investment decision involves buying well-performing stocks at the right time, while selling those that are at risk. A rise in share price and strong fundamentals signal a stock’s bullish run.Brinker International, Inc. (EAT  -  Free Report) is a restaurant stock that has performed extremely well in the last three months and has the potential to carry on the momentum in the near term. Therefore, if you haven’t taken advantage of the share price appreciation yet, it’s time you add the stock to your portfolio.What Makes Brinker an Attractive Pick?An Outperformer: The company has outperformed its industry in the last three months. The stock returned 22.4% compared with 7.1% increase recorded by the industry. The price surge seems to be the result of strong investor optimism around Chili’s turnaround that includes a new menu, and marketing and operational focus.In first-quarter fiscal 2018, Brinker implemented its new menu with 40% fewer items than a year ago, supported by an aggressive marketing strategy. A simpler menu, better quality, faster execution and stronger value are expected to aid Chili's turnaround. In fact, the ongoing momentum resulting from the menu launch has been a positive and will help to drive traffic at Chili's in the upcoming quarters.Investors also seem encouraged about Brinker’s digital initiatives — particularly those around Chilli’s. The company is investing heavily in technology-driven initiatives, like online ordering, to augment sales and boost guest services.Having installed a tabletop technology at its company-owned restaurants in partnership with Ziosk, the company has implemented handheld devices at its restaurants in California. This is resulting in increased efficiency and speed. Moreover, Brinker effectively uses the social media platform and email database to drive customer awareness and boost traffic. These initiatives are expected to contribute significantly to Brinker’s business going forward.Meanwhile, the company’s partnership with mobile and online food ordering service, Olo, for its To-Go platform, continues to provide digital services to restaurants and offers Chili's customers with pre-order, group order and pay flexibility. This integration is helping the company garner more members for the loyalty program, and thereby retain customers.Brinker also stands to gain from integrating its My Chili's Reward program with Plenti — a rewards program by American Express that offers leading brands across multiple categories. It gives Chili’s access to Plenti’s huge database of members and is likely to improve sales and profits.Moreover, the company launched a digital curbside platform in its company-owned restaurants. Thus, take-out guests can now order, pay, and get their food conveniently, all through the Chili's app. With about half of the company’s online guests using it, the service is ensuring simpler, faster and effortless experience to take-out guests, thereby resulting in higher check. This should improve sales, going forward.Solid Rank & VGM Score: Brinker carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and has a VGM Score of A. Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2 (Buy), offer the best investment opportunities for investors. Thus, the company appears to be a compelling investment proposition at the moment.Northward Estimate Revisions: Three estimates for fiscal 2018 moved north in the past 60 days versus no southward revisions, reflecting analysts’ confidence in the company. Over the same period, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2018 increased 3.1%. This is encouraging ahead of the earnings season.It appears that analysts are positive about Brinker’s continued expansion and remodeling initiatives. The company is consistently trying to steer its business in to fast-growing emerging markets and targets to open 38 to 43 restaurants globally in fiscal 2018, which will include new markets like Panama, Chile and Vietnam.Further, Brinker’s remodeling efforts have gained momentum leading to sales improvement. Notably, the company continues to invest in refreshing the fleet with its reimage program. In fact, during the first quarter of fiscal 2018, the company witnessed higher-than-expected comps. Brinker’s remodeling initiative is thus expected to continue invigorating its potential as a brand and augment guests’ experience.Brinker is one of the few fast-casual restaurant chains that have been expanding despite a sluggish economic development.Positive Earnings Surprise History: Brinker’ has a decent earnings surprise history. The company outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing four quarters, delivering a positive average earnings surprise of 1.69%.Given Chili’s turnaround adding strength, and solid digital and expansion efforts to boost growth, the stock seems to have decent upside potential.Key PicksSome other top-ranked stocks in the same space include Darden Restaurants (DRI  -  Free Report), Domino’s Pizza (DPZ  -  Free Report) and Famous Dave's of America , all carrying a Zacks Rank of 1. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Darden and Domino’s 2018 earnings are expected to improve 15.9% and 29.2%, respectively.

717,DRI,"Retailers capped a healthy holiday-shopping season last year as Americans continued to spend at stores at a steady clip. Spending increased at both online and bricks-and-mortar stores and restaurants, and was largely fueled by low unemployment level, rise in income and more confident consumers. Such factors will further drive retailers in the upcoming year.In fact, spending can get a kick from the $1.5-trillion package of tax cuts approved by the Republican-controlled U.S. Congress and signed into law by President Trump last month. These massive tax cuts will drive household income and in turn increase the propensity to consume. This calls for investors to cash in on the hottest retailers right away.December Retail Sales RiseHouseholds bought a range of goods in December, helping retail sales increase for four straight months. Retail sales rose 0.4% last month and figures for the prior month were revised higher as per the Commerce Department. Retail sales for last month also rose 5.4% from a year ago. In 2017, such sales advanced 4.2% compared to 3.2% in 2016.The so-called core retail sales went up 0.3% last month following an upwardly revised 1.4% gain in November. Sales were supported by a jump in receipts at gardening and building material stores, and furniture-store. There was an uptick in sales at auto dealerships, restaurants and bars as well. Notably, sales picked up at Internet retailers. Sales at online retailers gained 1.2%. In fact, online players made a significant headway throughout last year, mostly led by Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report).Bulk E-Commerce Sales From AmazonAmazon accounted for 44% of online sales in 2017. But, it only adds up to 4% of total retail sales. Such a crazy number now makes analysts believe that they are in a position to acquire Target Corporation (TGT  -  Free Report) this year.Despite many efforts by traditional brick-and-mortar retailers to get the bigger piece of the action, Amazon continues to dominate. The company’s strength in the e-commerce segment can be attributed to innovation in delivery and logistics, broadening of its product selection, device strategy, international expansion and the Prime membership program.Holiday Retail Sales Rise at Best Pace Since 2011Retailers, in the meanwhile, enjoyed some extra Christmas cheer. According to the National Retail Federation, U.S. year-end holiday retail sales during November and December increased 5.5% compared with the same period last year. NRF President and CEO Matthew Shay added that “whether shoppers shopped in-store, online or on their phones, consumers were in the mood to spend, and retailers were there to offer them good value for their money.”Some of the largest jumps were seen in electronics and appliances. The segment climbed 7.5% and registered the strongest growth in the last 10 years. Home furniture and furnishings grew 5.1% and so did home improvement. Department stores and specialty apparel saw moderate gains, which is quite encouraging given the recent store closings. The jewelry segment also gained 5.9%, primarily driven by last-minute sales.Factors Driving the SurgeStronger employment and higher confidence led consumers to spend more during the holidays. Jobless rate remaining at an ultra-low level of 4.1% lifted consumer confidence to a 17-year high set in November.Workers’ pay has also increased 2.5% from December 2016 to December 2017, up from 2.4% in the prior month. The National Employment Law Project, in fact, showed that minimum wage is poised to increase in 18 states and around 20 cities in the United States. This will reach employee wage closer to $15 an hour, which is known as “living wage.”5 Solid PicksGiven the aforesaid positives, investing in sound retail stocks seems judicious.

719,DRI,"As we enter the Q4 reporting cycle, looking for stocks having unswerving earnings growth is the highest priority for astute investors. And why not? If the company doesn’t make money, it won’t last over the long haul. Consider a company’s revenues over a given period of time, subtract the cost of production and you have earnings.This metric is also considered the most noteworthy variable in influencing the share price. But, expectations of earnings also play a significant role in influencing the price of a stock.Earnings Estimates Determine Share PricesWe have often seen a decline in the stock price despite earnings growth and a rally in the price following an earnings decline. This is largely a result of a company’s earnings failing to meet market expectations.Earnings estimates embody analysts’ opinion on factors such as sales growth, product demand, competitive industry environment, profit margins and cost control. Thus, earnings estimates serve as a valuable tool while making investment decisions. Earnings estimates also help analysts assess the cash flow to determine the fair value of a firm.Investors, thus, should be on the lookout for stocks that are ready to make a big move. Hence, it is important for investors to buy stocks that have historical earnings growth and are also seeing a rise in quarterly and annual earnings estimates.Screening Parameters:In order to shortlist stocks that have striking earnings growth and positive estimate revisions, we added the following parameters:Zacks Rank equal to 1 (Only Zacks' 'Strong Buys' are allowed.

721,DRI,"Domino's Pizza, Inc. (DPZ  -  Free Report) is currently one of the top-performing stocks in the restaurant space and a rise in share price and strong fundamentals signal its bullish run.Therefore, if you haven’t taken advantage of the share price appreciation yet, it’s time you add the stock to your portfolio.Why an Attractive Pick?Price Performance: A glimpse of the company’s price trend reveals that the stock has had an impressive run on the bourse in the last year. Domino's has returned 24.2%, which compares favorably with the industry’s gain of 19.9%.The price surge seems to the result of strong investor optimism around the stock, given Domino’s brand recognition, and it continues to ride on various sales boosting and digital initiatives.Domino’s ranks as the second-largest pizza chain in the world. It is the market leader in the delivery segment in the United States and ranks second in the carry-out segment. Domino’s posted the 26th consecutive quarter of positive same-store sales domestically in the third quarter of 2017. The company has enhanced its brand strength through marketing affiliations with the likes of The Coca-Cola Company and others.Domino’s continues to boost sales through regular limited time offers (LTO), new product launches and remodeling efforts. It is also investing heavily in technology-driven initiatives to drive sales. These initiatives include the company’s digital loyalty program -- Piece of the Pie Rewards, various ordering apps and platforms (Google Home, Facebook Messenger, Apple Watch, Amazon Echo, Twitter) and anywhere ordering platform innovation, to name a few.Domino's Pizza Inc Revenue (TTM) Domino's Pizza Inc Revenue (TTM) | Domino's Pizza Inc QuoteThe company continues to ramp up its worldwide digital participation with 25 markets now utilizing its global online ordering platform and more than 70% of stores outside the United States using its proprietary point-of-sale system – Domino's PULSE. Digital leadership is helping the company expand its brand in the domestic market as well as overseas.Solid Rank & VGM Score: Domino's carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and has a VGM Score of B. Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 offer the best investment opportunities for investors. Thus, the company appears to be a compelling investment proposition at the moment.Northward Estimate Revisions: Four estimates for 2018 moved north over the past 60 days versus no southward revisions, reflecting analysts’ confidence in the company. Over the same period, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 increased 3%. This  is encouraging ahead of the earnings season.We believe that the company’s refranchising strategy will continue to facilitate earnings per share growth by reducing capital requirements. In addition, free cash flow continues to grow, thus allowing reinvestment for increasing brand recognition and shareholder return. Domino’s has a wide franchise network, both domestically and internationally that helps it reduce ownership of restaurants and focus more on re-franchising.Positive Earnings Surprise History: Domino's has an impressive earnings surprise history. The company outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, delivering a positive average earnings surprise of 6.11%.In fact, the company’s earnings have surpassed the consensus estimate in each of the last 13 quarters. Given the various initiatives to boost growth, the stock seems to have  a decent upside potential.Strong Growth Prospects: Arguably, earnings growth is of utmost importance for determining a stock’s potential as surging profit levels often indicate solid prospects (and stock price gains). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 earnings of $7.16 reflects year-over-year growth of 23.9%. The stock has long-term expected earnings per share growth rate of 14.5%.This strong earnings growth prospect is justified given that the company’s international growth continues to be strong and diversified across markets, driven by exceptional unit level economics.Other PicksSome other stocks in the restaurant space worth considering include Darden Restaurants, Inc.

723,DRI,"The restaurant industry has been lacking zing over the past few quarters. Negative comps resulting from sluggish traffic, along with rising costs, continue to take the shine out of restaurant stocks.Nevertheless, some of the big names like McDonald's Corp. (MCD  -  Free Report), Yum! Brands, Inc. (YUM  -  Free Report), Domino's Pizza, Inc. (DPZ  -  Free Report) and Darden Restaurants, Inc. (DRI  -  Free Report) have done well on the back of strong fundamentals and innovative offerings.In fact, McDonald's and Yum! Brands are two companies that have adopted a de-risking strategy, dropping their ownership of restaurants through refranchising. This reduces capital requirements, boosts earnings per share growth and makes them less vulnerable to food inflation.In addition, growing free cash flow allows both the companies to make investments for increasing brand recognition and shareholder returns.With both carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), let’s find out which company is placed better with respect to some key parameters.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Share Price MovementYear to date, McDonald's has had a more impressive run on the bourse with a return of 41.2% while Yum! Brands has gained 30.3% in the last year. Notably, both have outperformed the industry that has rallied 14.4% in the same time frame.Projected Earnings GrowthArguably nothing is more important than earnings growth as surging profit levels is what most investors are after. Earnings growth is definitely necessary and it along with stock price gains is often an indication of a company’s strong prospects.Both McDonald's and Yum! brands have their own initiatives in place to boost earnings. While McDonald's is keen on operational excellence, product innovation, offering a value menu and rolling out more limited-time offerings, Yum! Brands is working on a strategic transformation plan to drive growth at KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell brands. It is also shifting toward a single point-of-sale system in the United States.Yum! Brands is expected to see higher earnings growth than McDonald's in 2018. Its EPS is projected to grow 13.1% while that of McDonald's is expected to increase 6.8%.  So, Yum! Brands has an edge over McDonald's in this respect.Net MarginNet profit margin helps investors evaluate a company’s business model in terms of pricing policy, cost structure and manufacturing efficiency. Hence, a strong net profit margin is preferred by all classes of investors.Both McDonald's and Yum! Brands have outperformed the industry year to date, which has a net margin TTM of 15.8%. However, McDonald's has a lead since its TTM net margin is higher at 22.4%, compared with Yum! Brands 16.1.Valuation The EV/EBITDA ratio offers a clear picture of a company’s valuation and its earnings potential. Typically, the lower the EV/EBITDA ratio, the more appealing it is. This signals that a stock is undervalued.Both McDonald's and Yum! Brands are overvalued relative to their broader industry that has an EV/EBIDA value of 13.8. However, McDonald's holds the edge here with a lower EV/EBITDA value of 16.1, compared to Yum! Brands’ 19.8.Earnings History, ESP and EstimatesBoth McDonald's and Yum! Brands have delivered positive earnings surprises in each of the prior four quarters. While McDonald's has an average earnings surprise of 5.2%, Yum! stands out with an average earnings surprise of 7.8%.However, McDonald's Earnings ESPof +0.54% lends it an edge over Yum! Brands, which has an Earnings ESP of -7.04%.While the Zacks Consensus Estimate for McDonald's full year has increased 0.15% over the last 30 days, it has remained unchanged in case of Yum! Brands over the same time frame.To ConcludeOur comparative analysis reveals that McDonald's has an edge over Yum! Brands in terms of share price movement, net margin, EV/EBITA ratio, Earnings ESP and estimate revisions. Yum! Brands, on the other hand, is better poised than McDonald's in terms of projected EPS and boasts a solid earnings surprise track record.So, with a lead in most of the evaluated metrics, McDonald's, appears to take precedence at the moment.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

724,DRI,"Tuesday, December 19, 2017Ahead of the opening bell this morning, new numbers on November Housing Starts & Permits hit the tape. Results were stronger than expected, although revisions to October’s original headline fell a bit. For last month, Housing Starts rose 3.3% — far exceeding the -3.1% analysts were expecting — on just under 1.3 million seasonally adjusted annualized units.This contrasts a bit, however, with the previous month’s totals, which were revised down from almost 14 million to a little over 8 million seasonally adjusted annualized units. Net-net over the past two months we’re still seeing growth, but perhaps the housing market is not quite as hot as metrics earlier had indicated.The hottest regions for housing starts were where the weather is warmest: the West zoomed up 11.4% in November, where the South rose 8.4%. In southern states like Florida and Texas — the 2 most populous states in the South — these numbers may be carrying some hurricane hangover into last month. We shall see if number in the West continue stronger in the coming months after California — the most populous state in the West — has been ravaged by massive wildfires both to the north and south of the state.Building permits, a forward indicator of future housing starts, fell -1.4% to a hair under 1.3 million in November. For single families, permits were up 1.4%, whereas for multi-family constructions — for a long while the secret sauce to healthy building permit numbers — dropped 6.4% last month.Earnings Island, ContinuedStill more anomalies on the earnings front, separated on either side of the calendar by a lack of earnings activity. These companies are not exactly forcing market indexes in either direction, but on their own may see runs, either positive or negative, based on their very visible results.Darden Restaurants (DRI  -  Free Report), the parent company of Olive Garden and Long Horn Steakhouse, reported 73 cents per share in its fiscal Q2 2018 — 3 cents stronger than the Zacks consensus estimate. Quarterly sales reached $1.88 billion, outperforming the $1.85 billion analysts were expecting. Shares have risen 2.7% in today’s pre-market on the news. For more on DRI’s earnings report, click here.Truck manufacturer Navistar International (NAV  -  Free Report) outperformed on its top and bottom lines for its fiscal quarter, and raised guidance as well. Swinging to a positive $1.36 per share from a -42 cents a year ago, revenue also rose 26% year over year to $2.6 billion. The company’s top-line guidance for fiscal year 2018 went up to a range of $9 - 9.5 billion, surpassing the consensus $9.06 billion on the top end.Mark VickerySenior EditorQuestions or comments about this article and/or its author?

730,DRI,"Ahead of the opening bell this morning, new numbers on November Housing Starts & Permits hit the tape. Results were stronger than expected, although revisions to October’s original headline fell a bit. For last month, Housing Starts rose 3.3% — far exceeding the -3.1% analysts were expecting — on just under 1.3 million seasonally adjusted annualized units.This contrasts a bit, however, with the previous month’s totals, which were revised down from almost 14 million to a little over 8 million seasonally adjusted annualized units. Net-net over the past two months we’re still seeing growth, but perhaps the housing market is not quite as hot as metrics earlier had indicated.The hottest regions for housing starts were where the weather is warmest: the West zoomed up 11.4% in November, where the South rose 8.4%. In southern states like Florida and Texas — the 2 most populous states in the South — these numbers may be carrying some hurricane hangover into last month. We shall see if number in the West continue stronger in the coming months after California — the most populous state in the West — has been ravaged by massive wildfires both to the north and south of the state.Building permits, a forward indicator of future housing starts, fell -1.4% to a hair under 1.3 million in November. For single families, permits were up 1.4%, whereas for multi-family constructions — for a long while the secret sauce to healthy building permit numbers — dropped 6.4% last month.Earnings Island, ContinuedStill more anomalies on the earnings front, separated on either side of the calendar by a lack of earnings activity.
