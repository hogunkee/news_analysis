18,BBY,"Companies from a broad range of industries, including technology, finance and retail, swiftly condemned the Trump administration's decision Tuesday to end a program preventing the deportation of immigrants illegally brought to the U.S. as children — a group known as Dreamers.""It is particularly cruel to offer young people the American Dream, encourage them to come out of the shadows and trust our government, and then punish them for it,"" Facebook (FB) Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg wrote on the social media service.Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced Trump's decision to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program, calling it ""an unconstitutional exercise."" Trump will delay the action for six months so Congress can work on legislation to codify the protections President Barack Obama created in 2012.""Congress, get ready to do your job — DACA!"" Trump tweeted Tuesday morning.Many business leaders argued for keeping the program by underscoring the economic contributions made by immigrants, many of whom are employed by the largest companies in the U.S. Some called on Congress to pass new legislation, while others threatened legal action.""Wells Fargo (WFC) believes young, undocumented immigrants brought to America as children should have the opportunity to stay,"" Jennifer Dunn, a spokeswoman for the bank, wrote in an email. ""DACA is relevant to our team members and the communities we serve.""The tech sector has been particularly outspoken on the issue because it employs many immigrants and their children.""Dreamers are our neighbors, our friends and our co-workers. This is their home. Congress needs to act now to #DefendDACA. #WithDreamers,"" tweeted Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL).Software maker Microsoft (MSFT) called on Congress to upend its planned fall legislative calendar to address the issue and said it may go to court to defend Dreamers within its ranks. ""We need to put the humanitarian needs of these 800,000 people on the legislative calendar before a tax bill,"" Microsoft Chief Legal Officer Brad Smith wrote in a blog post.Microsoft says it has 39 employees impacted, while Apple (AAPL) has 250 working in 28 states. ""We issue an urgent plea for our leaders in Washington to protect the Dreamers so their futures can never be put at risk in this way again,"" Apple CEO Tim Cook wrote in an email to employees that was obtained by Bloomberg.""It's against our values to turn our backs on #DREAMers,"" tweeted Dara Khosrowshahi, an Iranian immigrant who recently became CEO of Uber Technologies.Hundreds of executives had urged Trump not to scrap DACA last week. In an open letter to the president and congressional leaders, the lobbying group FWD.us said 780,000 children of undocumented immigrants are part of DACA and estimated a $460.3 billion hit to the U.S. economy and $24.6 billion in lost Social Security and Medicare tax contributions if these people can't work legally in the country.AT&T (T) said it has more than 500 employees registered under DACA and is telling them to reach out to the company with questions. Among retailers, Best Buy (BBY) CEO Hubert Joly asked Congress to act in support of DACA, while Under Armour (UAA) tweeted that it ""stands with America and the #DREAMers. We are stronger together.""Javier Palomarez, CEO of the United States Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, resigned from Trump's diversity coalition, calling today's decision ""inhumane and economically harmful.""Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase (JPM), said that when people come to the U.S. to ""learn, work hard and give back to their communities, we should allow them to stay.""Finally, digital music subscription service Spotify created a playlist titled ""No Moment for Silence"" that features immigrant and immigrant-supporting artists sharing messages of support.

19,BBY,"The latest ""Star Wars"" movies have no doubt been good at bringing people to the theater, but is the Force strong enough to draw fans back to stores for Lucasfilm merchandise... again?XAhead of the Dec. 15 release of ""The Last Jedi,"" Disney's (DIS) second-ever ""Force Friday"" event, comes complete with midnight store openings and never-before-seen toys and products, much like its predecessor two years ago. Target (TGT) is notably hyping its Rey-related products, which should appeal to the many people who noted in 2015 the lack of toys bearing the likeness of the film's lead character.This time around, though, Disney is taking a page out of the ""Pokemon Go"" book and using augmented reality to get people walking to places they might not have previously gone to — in this case, the mall.A three-day ""Find the Force"" AR ""treasure hunt"" requires users to download an app, then head to one of the 20,000 participating stores to scan a correlating ""Find the Force"" logo and see ""Star Wars"" characters on their screen, layered on top of reality.The idea is that fans will return to stores on each of the event's three days to uncover all 15 characters — and hopefully buy some products in the process.(Plus, Entertainment Weekly said Wednesday to expect augmented reality Star Destroyers and TIE Fighters to appear over Central Park, the Eiffel Tower and other global landmarks.)The Disney Store, Toys R Us and Target will all fling open their doors at 12:01 a.m. Friday, but the list of ""Force Friday"" sequel participants is much longer.Wal-Mart (WMT) is hosting events in certain store parking lots and unveiling a giant Lego Luke Skywalker at one of its Orlando locations. Pottery Barn Kids and PBteen (both owned by Williams-Sonoma (WSM)) are offering ""Star Wars"" bedding, furniture and home decor. Staples says it will have ""Star Wars"" drones.Best Buy (BBY), GameStop (GME), Kohl's (KSS), J.C. Penney (JCP), Build-A-Bear Workshop (BBW) and Bed Bath and Beyond (BBBY) are also taking part in the festivities.At a time when brick-and-mortar stores are struggling to find new ways to ramp up sales and foot traffic, Lucasfilm's movies and merchandise have proved to be big hits, with Macquarie estimating in 2015 that ""The Force Awakens""-related products would likely make Disney $5 billion in revenue.And not that Apple (AAPL) and Amazon (AMZN) need any help driving retail traffic, both companies are touting ""Star Wars"" events and products of their own, with Apple hosting kids' coding and illustrating workshops at Apple Stores, and Amazon boasting new products and discounts through the month of September.Walt Disney shares rose 0.3% to 102.87 on the stock market today.RELATED:Netflix's Success In Brazil Shows It Doesn't Need DisneyNetflix Might Hold On To Disney's 'Star Wars' Movies After AllDespite Comic-Con Hype, Hasbro Unit Selling Disney Toys Had Slow Sales

Rockwell shares were up nearly 2% after coming down from a record high early in today's trading.Nike (NKE), another Dow component, fell 2.5% and is now 11% below its 59.10 buy point from a June 30 breakout. Sporting goods retailer Finish Line (FINL), a main distribution channel for Nike, cut its full-year profit and same-store sales outlook, citing weakening sales and margin trends. Finish Line plunged nearly 20%.The S&P 500 was up a fraction, while the Nasdaq added 0.3% after being down 0.9%.

The Nikkei lost 0.5%; the London FTSE 100 fell 0.9% and the German DAX slid 1.5%.U.S. market volume was tracking higher compared with the same time Monday.Amazon.com (AMNZ) reversed higher but the stock had fallen about 1% early on but bounced to a 0.8% afternoon gain. At session lows, Amazon.com was down 7.9% below its 1,016.60 buy point, which was enough to sell to cut losses short. Investors with conviction about the company have to hope Amazon.com shares will use today's reversal as a bottoming move.The transportation sector climbed, at least partly on continued weakness in oil prices. U.S. crude fell below $46 a barrel to a one-month low. Trucking, ship, logistics and airfreight industry groups were in the top groups today. The Dow transportation average jumped 0.6%.Consumer stocks were weakest. Some retail and apparel industry groups slid more than 1%, including discount chains, clothing stores and electronics retailers, where Best Buy (BBY) was off 11% after its earnings report. Competitor Conn's (CONN) was down 6% as it met resistance at the 50-day line.Catalent (CTLT) broke out of flat base, soaring past the 38.83 buy point in big volume. Catalent, which makes drug delivery technologies, beat expectations with adjusted earnings of 65 cents a share and sales of $616.9 million, an increase of 16%. Shares surged 14% to a record high in six times more volume than usual.Athene Holdings (ATH) was trying to clear the 52.62 buy point of a cup-with-handle base, but the price and volume was soft. The retirement savings company has posted strong earnings per share gains the past five quarters.

All three are big sellers of appliances.""This marks the broadest distribution of Kenmore, America's most trusted home appliance brand, outside of Sears branded stores and related online retail platforms,"" Sears said in a statement. Terms of the deal weren't disclosed.The move follows Sears' deal in January to sell its Craftsman line of tools to Stanley Black & Decker (SWK) and comes amid questions about Sears' future, after warnings earlier this year about its ability to continue as a going concern.Meanwhile, Amazon is expanding its reach in traditional brick-and-mortar retail and agreed to acquire Whole Foods Market (WFM) last month.Sears shares were up 10.6% to 9.60 in the stock market today, near session lows after spiking to 10.76 in the morning. The stock vaulted above its 200-day moving average for the first time in two months.Amazon rose 0.2% to 1,028.70, hitting a fresh record high earlier.Home Depot sank 4.1% on the news, crashing through the bottom of its current consolidation to a three-month low. Lowe's dived 5.6%, plunging through its 200-day line to a six-month low. Home improvement chains had been seen as Amazon-proof, or at least-resistant, but the e-commerce giant's reach continues to expand.Electronics retailer Best Buy lost 3.9% to 53.96.

Nike shares spiked on that news, along with a solid earnings report.As they try to adapt to an increasingly connected form of shopping, retailers like Sears, Macy's (M) and J.C.

The danger posed by the e-commerce giant has escalated as it moves further into fashion and furniture.Value retail chains like TJX (TJX), Burlington Stores (BURL) and Ross Stores (ROST) also threaten the department stores' sales and traffic.Kenmore Smart connected room air conditioners, integrated with Alexa, are now available, with plans to expand the full product line onto Amazon. Kenmore, Sears Home Services and Innovel Solutions will provide delivery, installation, and other extended warranties.The collaboration with Amazon is ""perfectly aligned with our omni-channel strategy,"" said Tom Park, president of the Kenmore, Craftsman and DieHard brands at Sears.""This collaboration is the first of its kind for Kenmore,"" he said in the announcement, ""broadening its accessibility to the next generation of American families outside of Sears branded retail channels.""CFRA analyst Efraim Levy wrote that news of the Amazon-Sears deal could ""slow or even reverse some appliance market share gains"" for Home Depot and Lowe's, as he believes the home-improvement retailers have gained from Sears' loss of customers.But he said he still believed Home Depot and Lowe's were ""Amazon-resistant,"" given their customer assistance and growing focus on professional customers.RELATED:Nike Breaks Out As Analyst Sees Accelerating Growth

35,BBY,"Just as critics were sounding the death knell for Best Buy (BBY), Hubert Joly embraced the opportunity to breathe new life into the consumer electronics retail giant.Joly, who joined Best Buy as CEO in September 2012, knew he would have a lot on his plate when he was recruited for the job by search firm Spencer Stuart.""When I was approached in the spring of 2012, Best Buy was facing an all-you-can-eat menu of challenges,"" Joly told IBD. ""It was facing the threat of online competition.""In addition, it had leadership challenges. Joly's predecessor, Brian J. Dunn, was ousted. And the company's founder and top shareholder, Richard Schulze, was considering taking the company private.But Joly, who has a reputation as a turnaround and transformation expert, was drawn to Best Buy's tough times: ""I love challenges,"" said Joly.A major challenge was competing with the wrath of the mighty Amazon.com (AMZN).""From the outside looking in, there was the existential threat of Best Buy being killed by Amazon and being transformed into a showroom,"" Joly said. ""People would visit Best Buy stores, check out products and prices, and then buy them online. People thought we were dying.""Drawing on leadership principles shaped by his work as a consultant at McKinsey & Co. and by philosophical and spiritual work he did with monks at the Congregation of St. John, Joly has proved the naysayers wrong.Thanks to a transformation strategy called ""Renew Blue,"" Joly introduced in November 2012, Best Buy, the No. 1 consumer electronics retailer, has witnessed a strong financial revival. Joly declared Renew Blue over at the end of fiscal 2017. The company is moving into a new phase titled, ""Best Buy 2020: Building the New Blue.""""As a result of the turnaround we've implemented, we're thriving,"" said Joly, who added the title chairman to his post in 2015. ""If anyone asks who killed 'showrooming' in the U.S., that's us.""During the Renew Blue time period, same-store sales have been stabilized and Best Buy has grown earnings per share each year at an average rate of 9% per year, and it's topped Wall Street expectations for earnings per share in each of the past 17 quarters.""When I joined, we had only two problems — declining revenue and margins,"" said Joly. ""In the last four years, we've improved the top line in the U.S. incrementally and we've improved our profit margin by about 100 basis points. We've improved our return on invested capital by about 900 basis points from roughly 10% to 19%. And we've been one of the best performing shares in the market over the last five years, going from a low of 11 to mid-50s now, really five times since then.""Joly and his team have not only resuscitated Best Buy on the financial front, they've transformed it into a mighty competitor in its space.""Best Buy is the revenue market share leader for consumer electronics, and they are likely to remain in that position for many years to come,"" said Stephen Baker, vice president, industry analysis, at the NPD Group.Joly, 57 (he turns 58 on Aug. 11), grew up in France. He holds degrees from the Ecole des Hautes Etudes Commerciales de Paris and the Institut d'Etudes Politiques de Paris.He began his career at McKinsey, where he was a partner. He worked there from 1983 to 1996. He left McKinsey to become president of one of his clients — the French business of Electronic Data Systems (now part of HP Inc. (HPQ)). There, he staged his first turnaround as a corporate executive, boosting flagging revenue and increasing the profit margin.Joly has a track record of improving struggling companies. That also includes hospitality and travel company Carlson, where he was president and CEO from 2008 to 2012.He says he learned a lot about leadership while he worked as a consultant at McKinsey — also learned a lot from clients.Joly also spent quite a bit of time with a couple of friends who were monks in the Congregation of St. John. He worked together with them and published a couple of articles roughly 20 years ago. One article was in a theology journal and the other was in a philosophy journal about the purpose of work and the purpose of corporate organizations.""I also did the spiritual exercises of Ignatius of Loyola, the Jesuit, to find my purpose in life,"" said Joly. ""There's a deep philosophical and spiritual underpinning to all this.""Such experiences led to what Joly calls the five ""Be's"" of leadership.Here are excerpts on the five Be's from a 2016 speech Joly gave at the French-American Chamber of Commerce Foundation gala:Joly says his philosophy of leadership is ""rooted in the metaphysics"" of work: Why do we work? What is the purpose of a corporation?""The best companies excel simultaneously on the three dimensions of people, business and finance,"" said Joly. ""But from a philosophical standpoint, the purpose is not financial, it's about contributing to the common good and contributing (to) the development of the individuals who work at the company and are touched by the company. And it's about developing positive relationships. It's a human purpose.""Joly takes a disciplined approach to improving companies, drawing on a type of ""manual"" he's developed on principles that underlie a turnaround.""In the context of  turnaround leadership, my leadership philosophy was about working together with management to turn around and transform Best Buy,"" said Joly. ""We worked together to develop a diagnosis of the situation and develop a framework of how to turn around Best Buy.""The purpose of the diagnosis is to uncover the main issues and performance drivers.""The most important thing is to build the right team and to do it very quickly,"" he added. ""Typically in a turnaround you have to change a significant part of the team. And you start at the top.""At Best Buy, Joly removed three leaders, promoted a few from within, and recruited from the outside.In his manual there are four drivers to a turnaround:Joly drew on his principles and philosophy to turn around Best Buy.Thirty days into the job, Joly and his team made a key decision: ""We decided we were going to be price competitive and we implemented a price-matching policy online,"" said Joly. ""People were coming to our stores looking for help (from sales associates). By being price competitive and matching prices and then leveraging our unit assets, there was no reason to leave the store without buying. This was a bold move.""So far, Best Buy has taken out $1.4 billion in costs. Joly says that's allowed Best Buy to make the investments in price competitiveness and improving the customer experience.To enhance the in-store experience, Best Buy has invested in adding many shop-in-shops developed in partnership with some of the world's foremost tech companies. These shops help vendors showcase the use of their technology and innovations.Best Buy has added shop-in-shops for such companies as Samsung, Microsoft (MSFT), Sony (SNE), Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google.Best Buy has also invested in improving the customer shopping experience online. The result: Its online business has grown more than 20% a year, says Joly.Among other things, the team also improved the supply chain by leveraging Best Buy's store base to offer ship-from-store. Joly says Best Buy is shipping as fast as Amazon.Piper Jaffray analyst Peter Keith says Best Buy is winning share in the e-commerce space vs. Amazon.""If you look at the value proposition, it's equal and more likely even better to buy from Best Buy vs. Amazon,"" said Keith. ""You get the same prices and shipping terms — you can pick up (online orders) in stores and return items to stores. And you also get after market support. Their value proposition is arguably better than Amazon's for shopping for consumer electronics, which is allowing Best Buy to take back share.""Joly moved quickly to set Best Buy on the turnaround path and has continued to build momentum as it's taken shape.""If you try to ride a bike while standing still, you fall,"" said Joly. ""But if the bike is moving and not going in the right direction, you can adjust the course. In a turnaround, what's critical is to get things moving and build the momentum, and not worry about being too precise.""Helped turn around Best Buy, the revenue market share leader for consumer electronics.Overcame: The wrath of Amazon and positioned Best Buy to win share in the e-commerce space.Lesson: Follow spiritual and philosophical leadership principles.""There's a deep philosophical and spiritual underpinning to all this.""MORE ABOUT LEADERS & SUCCESS:For Bill Marriott, The Key Is Making Room For Innovation'Shark' Daymond John Wrapped His Brand In Hip-Hop MystiquePhil Knight Cleared Hurdles To Make Nike A Merchandising ChampionSupermodel Kathy Ireland Became A Role Model For Moguls

41,BBY,"Amazon (AMZN) vs. Walmart (WMT): It's a knock-down, drag-out clash of the new retail titans, with no end in sight. Walmart, the venerable emperor of brick-and-mortar discount stores, is dueling Amazon, the nouveau riche king of online shopping, trading punches in an escalating retail war that could determine the future of the industry — and crush smaller players who fall behind.X Hostilities sparked when Walmart and Chief Executive Doug McMillon invaded the e-commerce space, forging a $3.3 billion deal to acquire startup Jet.com in August 2016. Jet became the platform for Walmart's online shopping strategy. Then Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos did some encroaching of his own in June 2017 when his company snapped up Whole Foods Market for $13.7 billion, its boldest entry into the brick-and-mortar retail business.From that point on it was clear: The lines separating traditional from online retail are disappearing — and the two are up against new challenges unlike anything they've seen before. It's been a long time since Walmart shared the stage with a retailer of its caliber, while Amazon faces its biggest fight since it started wooing shoppers with cheaper prices and delivery conveniences more than two decades ago.""There's a real big debate about who will win out between Amazon and Walmart,"" said Tim Barrett, a retailing consultant at Euromonitor. ""It does seem like Amazon has more momentum but it also seems like it would be easier for Walmart to expand its online business than for Amazon to expand its presence in physical stores.""Amazon vs. Walmart has been a topsy-turvy war, and the advantage can change with each passing day.Take last Tuesday. Shares plunged 10% after Walmart reported fourth-quarter earnings that missed expectations and revealed some struggles in its online shopping business. E-commerce sales rose 23% in the quarter from the year-ago period, but growth slowed from 50% in the previous quarter.The slowdown was somewhat expected, as it was the first time e-commerce revenue included Jet.com sales in the year-ago period. But the drop was bigger than Walmart had forecast.""A smaller portion of the slowdown was unexpected, as we experienced some operational challenges that negatively impacted growth,"" Walmart CEO McMillon said in the company's earnings conference call. He cited operational issues ""from an inventory replenishment perspective.""Management expects online shopping sales to rise 40% this year. Last year, Walmart's U.S. e-commerce sales grew 44%, reaching $11.5 billion.As Walmart feels its way into online shopping, Amazon is working to up its game in retailing at the physical store level. After its successful experiment with a cashier-free convenience store in Seattle, reports said this week it was considering opening six more outlets known as Amazon Go.""Both will be going through growing pains,"" said Barrett.This month, Walmart stock was upgraded to a buy from neutral at Goldman Sachs, which added the stock to its ""conviction"" list and said the retailer is ""still very much in control of its own destiny."" But the Goldman Sachs report said the competitive threat from Amazon ""remains significant.""Walmart has one advantage — it's much larger than Amazon by revenue. Walmart's 2017 sales surpassed $500 billion for the first time, making it almost three times bigger than Amazon. That size enables Walmart to put a much bigger price squeeze on suppliers than Amazon in online shopping, Barrett says.But Amazon's embrace of Whole Foods put Walmart on notice that it intends to take a bigger piece of Walmart's retail pie. Walmart gets more than half of its sales from the $700 billion U.S. grocery sector.Amazon has a few tricks up its sleeve as well. Amazon is undergoing a major expansion into apparel, with several of its own private labels. Earlier this month, Amazon announced the launch of two premium, private-label denim brands.On Tuesday, Walmart announced it is launching four private-label apparel brands as it beefs up its clothing offerings. And it will launch its first ever digital-only brand, a line of bedding that will be available on a separate website.Walmart also said its subsidiary Sam's Club has teamed up with Instacart to provide same-day delivery of groceries, initially in Dallas and Austin, Texas, as well as St. Louis. While Amazon is the market leader in grocery delivery, Instacart is the most popular alternative for supermarket orders in the U.S.For Amazon to go all-in with Walmart, says Barrett, it must excel in food and clothing, not just online shopping.""Those are the two big categories,"" he said.Another muscle Amazon will flex is its strength in home delivery. This month Amazon announced that subscribers to its Prime membership program can now get groceries from Whole Foods delivered to their front door in two hours or less, for orders of $35 or more. The service currently is limited to just four cities — in Texas, Ohio and Virginia — but will expand this year.The transformation of the two companies is still in its early stages. Analysts believe the battle for the future of retailing will play out for years. Amazon's Bezos needs to figure out how best to operate and grow beyond the 468 Whole Foods stores it acquired, just as Walmart's McMillon needs to expand online operations while handling 11,500 stores across 28 countries.Outside this battleground, the prospects are getting dimmer, not only for existing retailers trying to compete with these two behemoths, but for those who were hoping to get their foot in the door.""The competitive barriers just continue to get higher and higher,"" said Jared Wiesel, a partner at consulting firm Revenue Analytics. ""Unless you have a really unique, differentiated business model, it will become more and more difficult to justify why someone would not shop at Amazon or Walmart.""The trend pulling Amazon and Walmart closer and closer in combat is a concept called omni-channel retailing. The strategy is shared by all the large players in retailing today. The goal is to allow customers  to easily shop with the same retailer in an integrated manner both offline and online, including mobile. Consumers can buy groceries online and arrange to have them delivered or picked up. Mobile phones can be used as a payment device in the store.Among the most aggressive developers of the omni-channel strategy is China e-commerce leader Alibaba Group (BABA). About two years ago, the company launched the Hema line of supermarkets as part of  Alibaba's ""New Retail"" strategy.Target (TGT) has also made omni-channel retailing a major focus. In December, Target acquired Shipt, an online, same-day delivery platform, for $550 million in cash. With the help of Shipt, same-day delivery, including groceries, will soon be available at half of Target stores. Other retailers pushing in that direction include department store giant Macy's (M) and consumer-electronics retailer Best Buy (BBY).Get IBD's Market Prep And Tech Report Newsletters — For Free!This shift in retailing, mostly from Amazon, has inflicted serious damage on traditional brick-and-mortar retailers that haven't kept pace. Casualties include timeworn department stores J.C. Penney (JCP),  Sears Holdings (SHLD) and Kmart, all of which announced sweeping store closures in 2017. In all, nearly 7,000 store closures were announced last year, according to FRGT. That's three times the number announced the year before.Macy's has posted 11 straight quarters of declining revenue, year over year. Shares of J.C. Penney and Sears have been cascading for years.Walmart is a different story. Unlike so many brick-and-mortar chains, Walmart stock traded at an all-time high with a 12-month gain of more than 60% in late January just before the stock market fell into a correction. Walmart shares' drop on the recent quarterly earnings disappointment, however, trimmed the stock's 12-month gain to below 30%. Shares were down 1.7% in Tuesday trading to close at 91.52.Over the past year, Amazon stock is up more than 70% and have scaled the 1,500 level. On Tuesday, shares were off 0.7% to finish at 1,511.98.For now, investors seem to be placing their bets on Amazon. Though it has much less revenue than Walmart, Amazon has a higher market cap, at $700 billion vs. $310 billion for Walmart. In addition to its double-digit growth, Amazon's competitive advantages include online shopping, its Amazon Prime membership program, its network of fulfillment centers and Amazon Web Services, its highly profitable cloud-computing division. But the biggest fights may lie ahead.The retail battle extends to international markets. Walmart is in talks to buy a 40%-plus  stake in Indian e-commerce leader and Amazon rival Flipkart, according to Reuters. Flipkart is engaged in a head-to-head competition with Amazon in India.""Several years ago, Walmart was on the defense and reacting to Amazon, but now they're playing offense,"" said Brian Yarbrough, an analyst at Edward Jones. ""After buying Jet.com, everything changed and Amazon is now reacting to some of the things Walmart does.""With its Jet.com acquisition, Walmart reorganized its e-commerce business and appointed Jet.com founder Marc Lore to be president of its U.S. e-commerce business. On Wednesday Lore shot down rumors he might be leaving Walmart.Lore has sharply expanded the number of items available at Walmart's online business. Walmart also introduced free two-day shipping on orders of $35 or more, and has plans to double its online grocery pickup locations to about 2,100. It partnered with Google for voice shopping using Google Home. Consumers will be able to buy ""hundreds of thousands of items"" on the Google smart speaker, striking a Walmart blow against Amazon and its voice-commanded Echo device.""I think Walmart is a worthy competitor but at end of day Amazon will be just fine,"" said Josh Olson, an analyst who covers Amazon for Edward Jones. ""We see Walmart as the only true competitor for Amazon, but their brick-and-mortar footprint is enormous and that's a big cost.""Walmart claims there's a Walmart store within five miles of 70% of the U.S. population. That store network could give Walmart an advantage over Amazon with services like grocery pickup, in addition to e-commerce pickup and support services.""It will be good for consumers as price wars are expected to continue,"" said Revenue Analytics' Wiesel. ""I think that price wars will probably continue to play out, because there are not a whole lot of other mechanisms on which to compete.""YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Warren Buffett's Annual Berkshire Letter: Here's What To ExpectWhich Stocks Make This List Of The Fastest-Growing Companies?A Stock Breakout Specialty Tool: The Relative Strength LineAs Walmart Gets Whacked By Amazon, This Retailer May Fashion New BreakoutDollar Stores In Expansion Mode As Amazon Launches 'Under $10' Category

43,BBY,"President Trump is preparing to unveil a plan to hit China with at least $30 billion worth of tariffs, and possibly twice that amount, as soon as Thursday.News reports say the announcement could be delayed and that the tariffs won't take effect immediately, largely because the White House is still settling on its approach.Yet the news leaves little doubt that Trump is preparing to make China the central front in his trade war to punish intellectual-property infringement by Chinese companies, abetted by strong-arm tactics from Beijing.By comparison Trump's steel and aluminum tariffs that sent financial markets into a tizzy last month were relatively minor — amounting to $9 billion a year, even before he  started handing out exemptions to Mexico, Canada and potentially other trading partners.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseAs Trump prepares to direct relatively heavy economic fire toward China, trade groups representing Walmart (WMT), Apple (AAPL), Best Buy (BBY) and other retailers warned that tariffs would raise prices for American consumers, whether or not tariffs prove effective in shrinking the trade deficit. Under Armour (UAA), Nike (NKE) and other shoe companies echoed similar concerns.Trump's economic advisors are reportedly focused on taxing U.S. imports that are key to Beijing's Made in China 2025 initiative aimed at achieving global technology leadership.Yet, in some respects, taking on China in this way makes more sense than via steel and aluminum tariffs. While China is the biggest source of global steel overcapacity, it represents only about 2% of U.S. steel imports.Even though candidate Trump often directed nearly as harsh rhetoric at Mexico, the White House clearly doesn't want to fight a two-front trade war at this juncture. The Trump administration gave Mexico and Canada indefinite exemptions from the steel and aluminum tariffs while the countries renegotiate Nafta, despite halting progress in the talks to date. Mexico and Canada are both big importers of U.S. steel as well amid the fluid North America supply chains. So hitting them with steel tariffs makes little sense.Still, it's looking likely that Trump will be engaging in trade-related skirmishes — and U.S. companies will be at risk of collateral damage — on multiple fronts.On Wednesday, the European Union proposed a 3% tax on digital revenue, hitting U.S. tech giants such as Apple, Facebook (FB), Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) and Amazon (AMZN).The proposal to raise about $6 billion in tax revenue per year will need all 28 EU members for approval but could be adopted on a country-by-country basis. The idea precedes Trump's election and is justified based on the companies' low tax rates in the EU, yet the move could contribute to growing trade tensions between the U.S. and European allies.In preparation for Trump's steel and aluminum tariffs that are set to take effect on Friday if no exemption is granted, the EU has detailed a list of $3.4 billion worth of American products that could face retaliatory tariffs, including Harley-Davidson (HOG) motorcycles, Jack Daniels whiskey and Florida orange juice. European officials plan to challenge Trump's tariffs at the World Trade Organization and up the ante in retaliation if the ruling goes their way.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:'Vigilant' Fed Is About To Shift The Rate-Hike Goal PostsNo. 1-Ranked IPO Stock Breaks Out, Expects Big Q1 Earnings GrowthIs Amazon Just Toying With Idea Of Buying Toys R Us Retail Stores?These 5 Top Stocks Stood Out Monday

44,BBY,"E-commerce leader Amazon (AMZN) has significant momentum heading into 2018 and could beat fourth-quarter revenue estimates if the expectations of a Wall Street analyst prove accurate.X GBH Insights analyst Daniel Ives estimated Amazon received between 45% and 50% of holiday online retail sales this year, up from 38% during the same period last year. The sales gains came despite a strong online performance by Wal-Mart Stores (WMT), and with Target (TGT) and Best Buy (BBY) also holding their own, Ives said in a research note to clients.Wal-Mart has stepped up its game and is on pace to significantly increase its market share online this holiday season, Ives said. But Amazon holds an advantage with its Prime membership program, where customers pay $99 a year and receive free shipping and numerous other perks, turning them into loyal Amazon fans and shoppers. Ives estimates that there are 88 million Prime customers, up about 40% from last year. The average Prime customer spent 22% more this holiday season than the year-ago period, he estimates, ""which speaks to the pure power of the Amazon consumer model,"" Ives wrote.""While Walmart is emerging as Amazon's biggest sole competitor online, we believe customer overlap remains small today as Prime membership growth and Amazon's stronghold on e-commerce remain hard to penetrate as we expect this trend to continue to play out in the near-term heading into 2018,"" Ives wrote.IBD'S TAKE: Amazon is on the exclusive IBD Leaderboard list of top stocks. Amazon shares are currently extended from a 1,083.41 buy point. The latest breakout was from a late-stage base, and the stock broke out in a sudden rush of buying from near the base's lows, both negatives.Amazon on Tuesday touted its biggest holiday sales season ever. Among its success stories, in one week alone more than 4 million people joined its Prime service, either through free trials or paid memberships. Amazon does not reveal total Prime customers.Amazon scored record sales on Cyber Monday and Black Friday as consumers responded to a raft of promotions.""The ring-fence that Amazon has built around its Prime customer base has significantly benefited the company in a fiercely competitive pricing environment with much more competitive prices and inventory from Wal-Mart in particular seen over the last month, (and) with Target and Best Buy also holding their own based on our analysis and retail tracking,"" Ives wrote.He maintained a rating of highly attractive for Amazon, with a price target of 1,350 and calling it a top pick for 2018.Amazon shares rose 0.5% to 1,182.26 on the stock market today. Amazon shares hit a record high of 1,213.41 on Nov. 27.Ives projects Amazon can beat fourth-quarter revenue estimates by 4% to 5% if his holiday sales estimates are accurate.The retail sector has been showing strength recently, from long-ailing department-store titans like Macy's (M) to discount chains like Wal-Mart. Also stepping up its game against Amazon, Target recently announced that it would buy an online delivery company to expand its same-day delivery services to shoppers.In terms of Amazon's next strategic move, wrote Ives, ""We believe pharmacy and health care is the natural logical next step to take in 2018 as the company looks to further expand its consumer stronghold.""Early this month Amazon received two price-target hikes, following a five-day conference on cloud computing that demonstrated its growing strength in artificial intelligence.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Retail And E-Commerce News And Stocks To WatchAmazon's Booming Apparel Business In Position To Pass Macy's, TJXLooking For The Next Big Thing?

For example, the homebuilder group fell 1.6% on growing conviction that President Trump's pro-tariff policies are making lumber more expensive.

Morgan Stanley (MS) reported that trading revenue fell, but less so than rivals. JPMorgan (JPM) and Citigroup (C) have also signaled caution amid slow loan growth and longer-term bond yields, which can indicate flagging confidence over the chances for long-term economic gains.

65,BBY,"Conns (CONN) had its Relative Strength (RS) Rating upgraded from 87 to 91 Tuesday. X When you're researching the best stocks to buy and watch, keep a close on eye on relative price strength. IBD's proprietary rating tracks price action with a 1 (worst) to 99 (best) score. The score shows how a stock's price movement over the last 52 weeks holds up against all the other stocks in our database. Over 100 years of market history reveals that the stocks that go on to make the biggest gains tend to have an 80 or better RS Rating at the beginning of a new run.Looking For Winning Stocks? Try This Simple RoutineConns broke out earlier, but is now trading around 4% below the prior 37.90 entry from a consolidation. If a stock you're tracking climbs above a buy point then retreats 7% or more below the original entry price, it's considered a failed base. It's best to wait for the stock to form a new base and breakout. Also understand that the most recent consolidation is a later-stage base, which makes it riskier to establish a new position or add shares to an existing one. Earnings-per-share growth dropped in the company's latest report from 1,020% to 900%, but revenue rose from -3% to 1%. Conns earns the No. 2 rank among its peers in the Retail-Consumer Electronics industry group.

"
66,BBY,"President Donald Trump made punishing China for trade misdeeds official U.S. policy on Thursday, imposing tariffs of 25% on up to $60 billion of imports, with a focus on high-tech goods. While not as hostile as the $60 billion worth of tariffs floated in recent days, the move signals the beginning of a fractious era for China-U.S. economic relations as the two countries vie for technological supremacy.Trump said Thursday's tariffs were ""the first of many,"" while China's U.S. ambassador said Beijing is ""not afraid"" of a trade war.The tariffs would apply to ""appropriate products,"" said U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, as the U.S. strikes back at China's ""policy of forced technology transfer"" and cybertheft. Those products will reportedly include robots, aerospace, high-speed rail, biotech and other categories.Once the list of some 1,300 products is made official, U.S. companies will have a window to comment and potentially seek relief. Trump, who signed a ""memorandum targeting China's economic aggression,"" according to the White House, characterized the tariffs not as the start of a trade war, but part of ""a very large negotiation"" with Beijing.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseBut Trump said Thursday's action will be the ""first of many"" to tackle the ""out of control""  U.S.-China trade gap.China signaled it was ready for a trade war.""We don't want a trade war with the United States, or with anybody else. But we are not afraid of it. If somebody tries to impose a trade war on us, we will fight,"" Ambassador Cui Tiankai said in a video posted on the Chinese embassy's Facebook page. He said China ""would fight to the end..with all necessary measures.""But he added that China will continue to work to ""manage our possible differences in a constructive way."" He also said allegations that China is abetting intellectual property theft are ""groundless.""The Dow Jones industrial average, the S&P 500 index and the Nasdaq composite initially pared losses somewhat after the announcement, but sold off into the close, with all the major averages closing down at least 2.4%. The Dow tumbled 2.9%.Even as U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum imports start to kick in on Friday, Trump is making China the central front in his trade war, aiming to punish intellectual-property infringement by Chinese companies, abetted by strong-arm tactics from Beijing. That became clearer after Lighthizer said that the European Union, Brazil, South Korea, Argentina and others would get at least temporary exemptions from the steel and aluminum tariffs as negotiations proceed. Exemptions already had been granted to Mexico and Canada.The tariffs aimed against China aren't enough to have a noticeable impact on economic growth, and it's not yet clear how China will respond in the short term. But the stock market fallout on Thursday may reflect an understanding by investors that U.S. has begun confronting China in what will be a long-term conflict with major ramifications for economic relations.""The damage will be real, it will probably be substantial, and it will mount over time,"" wrote Brad McMillan, Chief Investment Officer for Commonwealth Financial Network. ""For companies that sell to China, or indeed any country outside the U.S., the effects are likely to be negative — which is why markets are reacting again.""Boeing (BA), which China has previously said could be targeted for reprisals if Trump starts a trade war, helped lead the Dow Jones lower early Thursday. Caterpillar (CAT), another Dow Jones component that could see exports suffer and also could face collateral damage if China retaliates against U.S. agricultural imports, also traded lower. Boeing was off 5.3% and Caterpillar 5.7% on the stock market today.Ahead of the announcement, Best Buy (BBY) told Reuters on Wednesday that it will stop selling mobile phones from China's Huawei. Apple (AAPL), which contracts out global iPhone production in China and sells a lot of phones in the country, is also potentially vulnerable in a trade war. But Beijing has no incentive to make it harder for tech firms to use China as a manufacturing base. Shares of Apple, yet another Dow Jones component, fell 1.4% after sliding below the 50-day line Wednesday.Stock market reaction will depend on the scale and timing of U.S. trade restrictions, and on China's response. So far, China seems to be emphasizing plans to respond by targeting soybeans and other agricultural imports, and halting progress on greater access to China's financial sector and other markets.While China is expected to strike back, it may do so in a relatively limited fashion as it challenges Trump's actions at the World Trade Organization. That would initially limit the scope of the conflict.That also would mirror the European Union's plan to retaliate if Trump's steel and aluminum tariffs go into effect, as they could as soon as Friday. The EU has detailed a list of $3.4 billion worth of American products that could face retaliatory tariffs, including Harley-Davidson (HOG) motorcycles, Jack Daniels whiskey and Florida orange juice, but it plans to double down if the WTO ultimately finds Trump's tariffs justified on national-security grounds to be illegal.Trump's authority to hit China with tariffs comes from section 301 of the 1974 Trade Act, which has seen little use since the WTO came on the scene. The act gives the president power to impose tariffs or other restrictions when a trading partner ""engages in discriminatory or other acts or policies which are unjustifiable or unreasonable and which burden or restrict United States commerce.""The Trump administration has asked China to propose ways of narrowing the $375 billion U.S. goods deficit with Beijing by $100 billion, but it's not clear that a confrontational approach will yield progress.Hitting China with massive tariffs may be difficult to do without hurting American consumers and American brands produced in China. As Trump prepares to direct relatively heavy economic fire toward China, trade groups representing Walmart (WMT), Apple, Best Buy and other retailers warned that tariffs would raise prices for American consumers, whether or not tariffs prove effective in shrinking the trade deficit. Under Armour (UAA), Nike (NKE) and other shoe companies echoed similar concerns. (Walmart and Nike are both Dow Jones components, with Nike reporting earnings late Thursday.)Trump's economic advisors are focused on taxing U.S. imports that are key to Beijing's Made in China 2025 initiative aimed at achieving global technology leadership. Tariffs are expected to go hand-in-hand with investment restrictions that blunt China's ability to acquire American technology. Among the possibilities would be restricting the ability of Chinese companies to list on U.S. stock indexes.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Stock Futures Fall On New Trump Headlines; 2 Hot Memory Plays Crush ViewsSteel Stocks Dive On Trump Tariff Exemptions As China Trade Is Top PriorityFed Rate Hike Is No Surprise, But Stock Market Weakens On Powell, 2019 OutlookAI Stock And Alibaba IoT Partner With 217% Growth Enters Buy Zone

Oil prices, which had been steadily rising ahead of OPEC's key meeting, tumbled after the cartel extended production cuts. Meanwhile, Best Buy (BBY) and Ulta Beauty (ULTA) were among the few retailers to defy the sector sell-off with strong earnings and share gains. Ford (F) ousted its CEO amid woes for the auto sector.The S&P 500 rose 1.4% and the Nasdaq 2.1%, both hitting record highs. The Dow advanced 1.3% Amazon (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) rose strongly to new highs, with Amazon and Alphabet nearly hitting the 1,000 price level. Oil prices retreated after OPEC extended but didn't deepen production curbs, leaving intact a status quo that encourages shale producers. Best Buy (BBY) and Ulta Beauty (ULTA) soared to record highs as they prove to be Amazon-resilient, while Lowe's (LOW) and Tiffany (TIF) struggled. Red-hot Chinese social media and live-streaming video app Momo (MOMO) cooled off despite crushing views.At its meeting Thursday, OPEC extended production cuts through March 2018 but didn't deepen output curbs as some had speculated, while keeping Libya and Nigeria exempt for the foreseeable future even as their output rises. Oil prices tumbled 4.8% that day, wiping out gains made in the weeks leading up to the meeting. On Wednesday, EIA data showed U.S. oil inventories fell for the seventh consecutive week, while production rebounded from its first dip in three months. After a Friday rebound, U.S. crude futures closed the week down 1.8% to $49.80 a barrel.Ulta Beauty (ULTA) posted a beat-and-raise Q1 that surpassed expectations, sending shares jumping to an all-time high Friday.

The midpoint of full-year profit guidance exceeded current estimates. Burlington's shares rose Thursday but erased those gains Friday.Consumer electronics retailer Best Buy (BBY) and video game vendor GameStop (GME) each reported April quarter results that beat views. But while Best Buy guided Wall Street higher for the current quarter, GameStop gave an in-line outlook.

Investors shrugged off the news that Take-Two is delaying its highly anticipated Wild West shooter game ""Red Dead Redemption 2"" to spring 2018 from this fall. The focus at Take-Two has shifted from big game releases to long-term recurring revenue from major game properties like ""Grand Theft Auto Online"" and ""NBA 2K"" through downloadable content and online services.Ford (F) dumped Mark Fields after the stock and earnings had fallen sharply, lagging peers.

Both topped views. But the telecom installer forecast EPS in a range of $1.35 to $1.50 and revenue in a range of $789 million to $810 million vs. consensus estimates of $1.79 and $849.4 million. Dycom shares plunged more than 22% for the week.Upscale jeweler Tiffany (TIF) reported better-than-expected Q1 earnings Wednesday, but revenue fell short and same-store sales unexpectedly declined. Signet Jewelers (SIG), parent of mall-based Kay Jewelers, Zales, and Jared The Galleria of Jewelry, missed on earnings. Shares of both retailers tumbled.NetApp (NTAP) topped earnings and sales views, but gave weak guidance.

IRobot slipped another 0.2% to close at 68.37 on the stock market today.Bedford, Mass.-based iRobot is running a special this week for $100 off regular prices on four Roomba models compared with two models that saw the same discount last year.A USA Today article on the best Black Friday deals noted that the iRobot Roomba 690 robot vacuum is marked down $100 to $274.99, ""the lowest price we've ever seen.""In a report Friday, Needham analyst James Ricchiuti said he believes the stock decline is being driven by short sellers.IBD'S TAKE: IRobot stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 24 out of 99 and ranks No. 8 in IBD's Household Appliances and Wares industry group. To see which stocks lead the group, visit the IBD Stock Checkup.The holiday deals for iRobot products ""do not appear out of the ordinary,"" Ricchiuti said.

""There appears to be a healthy appetite from retailers to promote the Roomba, including chains like Best Buy (BBY) and Target (TGT), which are featuring Roombas in holiday TV commercials. We do not believe the promotional campaigns signal a demand issue in the market.""While iRobot is facing more competition in the robotic vacuum cleaner market, it appears to be holding its own, he said.

76,BBY,"Tight supplies of Apple's (AAPL) iPhone X as well as fears of reigniting wireless price wars apparently led AT&T (T), Verizon Communications (VZ), Sprint (S) and T-Mobile US (TMUS) to hold back on aggressive promotions for the flagship device on Black Friday.Sprint and T-Mobile recently called off merger talks, leading a Nomura-Instinet analyst to speculate that the two carriers could launch aggressive offers for the iPhone X on Black Friday, the day after Thanksgiving. T-Mobile intensified wireless wars last year by launching a ""free"" iPhone 7 promotion with the trade-in of an older device. Sprint, AT&T and Verizon responded with similar offers.However, the supplies of the iPhone X have been tight amid a delayed manufacturing ramp. Expected delivery dates for the iPhone X when ordered from Apple's website have shrunk to 2-3 weeks from 3-4 weeks recently, Rosenblatt Securities said on Tuesday.Shares in Apple were up a penny to close at 174.97 on the stock market today. Verizon slipped 0.2% to 47.01. AT&T inched down 6 cents to 34.81, Sprint was unchanged at 6.15 and T-Mobile gained 0.5% to close at 61.68.The best deals for Apple's high-end iPhone X were gift card offers from Best Buy (BBY) and Wal-Mart Stores (WMT), according to reports.IBD'S TAKE: Apple stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 91, meaning it has outperformed 91% of stocks in key metrics over the past 12 months. For more analysis on Apple, visit the IBD Stock Checkup.Walmart is offering $300 gift cards to Apple iPhone X buyers if they sign up for certain AT&T or Verizon data plans. Best Buy is offering a $250 gift card for iPhone X purchasers if they trade in an eligible older iPhone.Apple rolled out the iPhone 8 and the higher-priced iPhone X in mid-September. Apple's iPhone X starts at $999 for a 64-gigabyte version.Similar to its offer for the iPhone 8, Sprint says iPhone X buyers can save $350 with a phone trade-in and sign up for a device leasing plan. T-Mobile has a similar offer: $300 off with an iPhone trade in. Most trade-in phones are worth a few hundred dollars so carriers do not stand to lose money with those type of deals.RELATED:Apple iPhone X Supply Catching Up With Demand; Some Balk At PriceApple HomePod Speaker Delayed, Will Miss Holiday Shopping SeasonApple Could Reach $1 Trillion Market Cap In 2018, Analyst Says

The gain sent UnitedHealth to a new high, but the stock remained in buy range above a 172.24 buy point in a flat base.Among FANG stocks, Netflix gapped up 3% to bang out a new high.

Shares tumbled below their 200-day line on Wednesday but regained that key level by the end of the week.New General Electric (GE) CEO John Flannery offered up a plan to turn around the troubled industrial giant, but Wall Street found GE's strategic vision held little that was new or bold.

Investors sent GE shares to a nearly six-year low.Cisco Systems (CSCO) surged to a 17-year high after the computer networking giant said it expects December-quarter revenue to rise 1%-3%, the first year-over-year gain in nearly two years.

Core consumer prices, excluding food and energy, rose 1.8% from a year ago, with an annualized 2.4% gain over the past three months. Rent inflation has been behind the recent strength, but used car prices also bounced in October, likely a temporary effect of demand created when hurricanes Harvey and Irma destroyed hundreds of thousands of vehicles.While all evidence suggests the economy is on something of a roll, retail sales moderated after surging an upwardly revised 1.9% in September. The overall 0.2% gain edged past expectations, but came in on the weak side outside of autos with a 0.1% rise.Emirates announced an order for 40 Boeing (BA) 787-10s, valued at $15.1 billion at list prices, instead of the expected Airbus (EADSY) A380 order.

Alcoa (AA), American Express (AXP) and UnitedHealth (UNH) jumped on their Q1 reports. That offset weak outlooks from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) and chip-gear giants Lam Research (LRCX) and ASML (ASML).

Already pressured by weak ASML (ASML) and Lam Research (LRCX) guidance, chip stocks sold off. Apple (AAPL) also came under heavy pressure Thursday and Friday on iPhone demand concerns.

96,BBY,"Roadie — a startup that gets everyday folks to deliver packages while on their way to wherever they're already driving — has notched a lot of oddball same-day delivery jobs that Amazon (AMZN) doesn't do. A glass aquarium from Fountain Valley to Long Beach, Calif. A set of keys to someone locked out of her house in Georgia at 2 a.m. A box of trial evidence from San Francisco to Napa in time for a panicked lawyer's court date.Around 80%-85% of its shipments are same-day affairs, fueled partly by individuals with curious packages, but mostly by bigger businesses. And Roadie, which provides Kroger (KR) grocery delivery in select areas and brings lost luggage to Delta Air Lines (DAL) customers in about 40 markets, is not alone.Roadie rivals Instacart and Deliv have separately joined forces with Walmart (WMT), Costco (COST), Kroger, Macy's (M) and Best Buy (BBY) on same-day shipping. Target (TGT) even went so far as to acquire Shipt for $550 million. The bull's-eye is ""becoming the first retailer to offer same-day delivery nationwide,"" said Target CEO Brian Cornell last month at retail conference Shoptalk.The driving force behind this latest retail trend, as ever, is Amazon. Its Prime same-day delivery service follows a free-shipping perk that is now a de facto requirement for online shopping. But after scrambling to catch up to Amazon on free shipping, these old brick-and-mortar titans are rushing to stay ahead of the e-commerce giant on same-day delivery. And this next online battleground might actually tilt in their favor, some analysts say.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

But demand continues to mount, which makes it ""absolutely essential"" for retailers in order to compete in this ""instant-gratification economy,"" said Retail Metrics head Ken Perkins, who thinks one-hour delivery might be the next goal. ""People want to see a package on their door when they return from work.""As President Trump continues tweeting his rage at Amazon on a near-daily basis over its use of the U.S. Postal Service, it's the Shipts and Instacarts and Delivs (not to mention the Postmates and DoorDashes in food delivery) that are harvesting this ripe market. And they may not even emerge as the biggest winners. Instead, logistics giants like UPS (UPS) and FedEx (FDX) have the scale and infrastructure to capture at least 80% of the future same-day delivery market, a 2017 McKinsey report noted.To a physical store, looking to a web-based firm to hurry along online orders might seem like hastening one's own demise.But the McKinsey report called same-day a ""$200 billion opportunity for retailers in Europe and North America over the next decade."" And it pinpointed brick-and-mortar stores as potentially recapturing turf from online pure plays.The firm said that only traditional retailers ""have the dense network of physical stores to support same-day order fulfillment and delivery.""Perhaps surprisingly, that dinosaur of retail — shopping malls! — is also poised to benefit from the interest in same-day delivery.Daphne Carmeli, CEO of delivery startup Deliv, had an aha! moment when she realized that this could offer shopping centers a ""line of sight ... into e-commerce revenue"" that they wouldn't otherwise have.If you live in Palo Alto, Calif., and place an order on Macys.com, for example, that purchase is likely to be shipped out from a nonlocal distribution center in, say, Atlanta. In that scenario, only Macy's and UPS make money off that transaction.But if you place that online order through Deliv, and the nearby Stanford Shopping Center fulfills that order (and a few dozen others) from its own in-house Macy's, then the mall owner gets some of that revenue, because of the way that leases are structured.Malls ""make money on real estate and rent,"" said Carmeli, adding, ""the more sales the actual Macy's makes, the more the actual mall operator makes.""Which is why malls are willing to carve out parts of their own budgets to hire runners to fulfill Deliv orders. Deliv has partnered exclusively with — and has strategic investments from — major operators Simon Property Group (SPG), Westfield, General Growth Properties (GGP) and Macerich.Luckily for Deliv and its rivals, the technology to make same-day drop-offs happens to have come a long way since the early dot-com days. Deliv's Carmeli, whose company serves 1,400 cities across 35 U.S. markets, was once told her idea was the ""stupidest idea ever.""""Do you remember Webvan? Do you remember Kozmo? Do you remember all the hundreds of millions, if not billions, of dollars that were deployed to build up these companies that ended up exploding in colossal fashion?"" she recalls being asked.Deliv, like many of its peers, avoids being blown up by using modern-age technology to orchestrate an algorithmic symphony of scheduled pickups and drop-offs from nearly 150 retailers — including Macy's, Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA), Sam's Club and Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google Express — straight to people's homes.Retailers nowadays have a better grip on inventory visibility, says Carmeli. And smartphones make it easy to crowdsource drivers.Her predecessors, like Leonardo da Vinci dreaming up helicopters in the early 1500s, tried to make same-day work on a mass scale before the right equipment existed.Boston Retail Partners analyst Scott Langdoc knows that serious pain. As a former C-suite exec at ""mini-Webvan"" delivery company PDQuick at the start of the new millennium, he says that Google Maps would have made all the difference.""If I had the tools that are available today, starting with Google Maps but fast-forwarding to the (artificial intelligence and machine learning) tools that are available today, it's amazing to think what I could've done at my scale or what Webvan or Kozmo could've done at their scale,"" he said.Like many of its peers of the time, PDQuick didn't survive. It was bought out and went back to its roots as a scaled-down SoCal neighborhood delivery service, Pink Dot.""What we'd intended to do before the 2001 implosion was basically do what Shipt did, which was to generalize the delivery and logistics capability for any retail platform so we could bring in inventory. A retailer brought in drivers and you would be able, based on location, to provide that capability,"" said Langdoc.""Fast forward 15 years, that is what Shipt is; that is what Instacart is.""That doesn't mean that same-day delivery is not without major challenges. It's expensive, for one. And as grocery delivery emerges as the next massive battleground, the stakes are being raised beyond mere speedy delivery of things like T-shirts, to more delicate items like yogurt and tomatoes.Even first movers are encountering issues.""It's not free and you can lose an awful lot of money trying to do it for free,"" said Moody's analyst Charlie O'Shea. ""Amazon will approach $10 billion in absorbed delivery costs this year. There aren't a lot of companies that have the ability to absorb that, either from a financial flexibility perspective or shareholder patience.""That has bestowed upon Amazon a ""fairly significant advantage,"" he said.Still, other companies have advantages too. If any physical retailer could conceivably take on same-day delivery in-house, it's Walmart, say experts.So far, Walmart's grocery-delivery pilot employs its own trucks in just one of six test markets, Denver. It relies on Deliv in San Jose and on Uber in Dallas, Orlando, Phoenix and Tampa.The Bentonville, Ark.-based mega-retailer recently declared that over 40% of American households across more than 100 cities will have access to its online grocery delivery service by year-end. That effort is expected to add thousands more to its already 18,000-strong force of personal shoppers.On Tuesday, Walmart said it enlisted courier Postmates to deliver online grocery orders starting in Charlotte, N.C., before rolling out to other cities.""We know one thing's for sure: that (customers) want a delivery option and so we're committed to that,"" Walmart spokesperson Molly Blakeman told Investor's Business Daily in late January. The company filed to trademark grocery delivery-related ""Wam! by Walmart"" earlier in the year, which Blakeman confirmed is associated with active, ongoing projects.Still, even as analysts agree that same-day shipping, including grocery delivery, has to be an option for shoppers now, some question if the effort is worth it.""In this arms race to provide faster delivery, are you providing too many resources to a very small niche product, or a small niche customer base?"" asked Moody's O'Shea.There are more households in America that make less than $30,000 a year than more than $100,000, he said. So the idea of same-day, for most products, isn't hugely compelling at current price points.""I would not say that the demand is minimal, it just has a definite ceiling — at least as far as the pricing stays where it is,"" echoed Euromonitor analyst Tim Barrett.And if you're wondering whether same-day delivery could ever scale up and reach rural settings, the answer is: ""No way,"" he said, laughing.""Simply put, that's not going to happen,"" said Barrett. ""We have seen traditional grocery stores struggle to sustain enough traffic to justify real estate and actual brick and mortar, let alone expensive delivery, let alone even more expensive same-day delivery.""YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Amazon Vs.

98,BBY,"Donald Trump's presidency has been pretty great for stock investors, but it carries three big risks that all are in focus this week: The Fed, a trade war and the investigation into Russia's role in the 2016 election.XThe Trump wall of worry helped get stocks off to a poor start on Monday, as Facebook (FB) led markets lower over how the social network permitted a third party to access user data that helped the Trump campaign. The Dow Jones industrial average and S&P 500 index fell 1.3% and 1.4%, respectively, on the stock market today. The Nasdaq slid 1.8%, but off intraday lows of more than 2%.All the fiscal stimulation from tax cuts and a big spending increase raises the risk of a more hawkish Fed. Federal Reserve policymakers are virtually certain to announce a 25-basis-point hike in the key overnight lending rate to banks on Wednesday at 2 p.m. ET. The risk this week is that they'll pencil in a tighter path for future policy than markets currently expect.Meanwhile, President Trump's 15-day grace period for trading partners to negotiate their way out of tariffs comes to an end on Friday, when levies of 25% on steel imports and 10% on aluminum imports go into effect.The White House said last week that it's negotiating with a number of countries, but provided no detail. The European Union said last week that it's not negotiating, but making a case that the tariffs are a poor way to treat a security partner, even as it detailed a list of $3.4 billion worth of American products that could face retaliatory tariffs, including Harley-Davidson (HOG) motorcycles, Jack Daniels whiskey and Florida orange juice.The third risk hanging over stocks as the week starts comes from the broadening Russia probe, which has now expanded to cover Trump Organization business deals before the election. Trump amped up his Twitter attacks on Special Counsel Robert Mueller's probe over the weekend, calling it a witch hunt, while his attorney John Dowd called for an end to the investigation that he said was ""manufactured"" by ex-FBI Director James Comey based on ""a fraudulent and corrupt dossier.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseNone of these three risk hanging over stocks will come to a head this week, but all three risks are growing and are likely to occupy investors for months to come.The Mueller investigation ""appears to be on the verge of a major inflection point,"" wrote Greg Valliere, chief global strategist at Horizon Investments. Mueller reportedly has submitted some of the questions he would like Trump to answer under oath. There's speculation that more indictments could be coming soon and major uncertainty over how Congress would react if Trump engineers Mueller's firing as GOP lawmakers have shown a tepid response to proposed legislation that would protect Mueller.At the Fed, inflation concerns haven't gone away, even with some favorable recent data. Despite expectations of faster economic growth this year, the tame consumer price index reading for February makes it an even bet whether Fed policymakers will pencil in a fourth rate hike in 2018, up from three, in their economic projections that are released at the same time as the policy statement.Yet as wage growth accelerates in coming months — and there's every reason to expect it will after wage hikes from Walmart (WMT), Target (TGT), CVS Health (CVS), Starbucks (SBUX), Bank of America (BAC) and dozens of other big employers — a more hawkish Fed is likely.On trade, Trump's indefinite exemptions for Canada and Mexico from tariffs have contained the potential fallout from his duties on steel and aluminum, and the White House may be open to other approaches to reducing global steel overcapacity that comes mainly from China, even though China accounts for just 2% of U.S. steel imports.Still, the risk of a trade war is rising. If steel and aluminum tariffs don't spark one, it may come from a U.S. crackdown on China's intellectual property practices. On Monday, Reuters reported that Walmart, Target, Best Buy (BBY) and other retailers sent a letter to Trump asking him to reconsider an emerging plan to hit Beijing with $60 billion in tariffs on American imports of apparel, electronics and other goods. Boeing (BA) and Apple (AAPL) are seen as likely targets for reprisal by China if a trade war erupts.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Inflation And The Fed Rate-Hike Outlook: What You Need To KnowWhy Steel Stocks May Not Be Big Winners From Trump TariffsThese 5 Stocks Have Dipped Below Buy Points, But Don't Give Up On ThemThese 5 Hot Stocks Are Simmering Just Below Buy Points Nike, Oracle, Micron, Fed Rate Hike, Trump Tariffs: Investing Action Plan

118,BBY,"It's disheartening when you analyze a stock, pass on buying it, then watch it go up without you. Just to torture yourself a little more, you might even calculate how much money you missed out on. But if you are following rules designed to put the odds in your favor, missing out on a stock here and there is going to happen. After all, probabilities are not certainties. Sound swing trading rules stress being right on enough trades over the long term to more than make up for the times where the rules may lead to short-term misses on individual trades. In other words, you can be wrong on an individual trade but right in your trading.Take Best Buy  (BBY), a standout stock at the end of July that was on the watchlist of IBD's SwingTrader. But it never became an active trade even as it made a decent move up. Despite overall weakness in retail, Best Buy and its group mate Aaron's (AAN) in consumer electronics retail both made the elite set of stocks with Composite Ratings above 90. As the market was showing negative action on July 27, Best Buy and Aaron's were up more than 2% (1). The countertrend put both stocks under consideration for SwingTrader.Best Buy won out since Aaron's had an earnings report scheduled the next day.While the price action looked promising for Best Buy, as well as its Relative Strength, volume was lackluster for the day (1). Volume is one of the more critical factors to fuel a big move, and while stocks can go up without it, the chances of success are far less favorable. Continued consolidation on low volume would have been the most desirable scenario, but stocks don't always cooperate with your hopes for them.Best Buy continued higher over the next few days and eventually crossed a 59.70 buy point of a double-bottom consolidation. It happened shortly after the market open (2), but a note was immediately sent to subscribers noting that volume was still unimpressive. Best Buy would remain on the watchlist, rather than becoming an active trade. Though volume improved slightly over the day, the price worsened and ended up below the buy point by the close.The stock continued up another 4% (3), but volume never came in and Best Buy never became an active trade. The combination of a weak market and lack of volume didn't instill confidence in the stock's prospects. Sure, in hindsight that was proved to be false, but that doesn't mean the logic wasn't sound. No need to break rules to let in this one trade when a good market will give you multiple opportunities to profit with better odds.More details on past trades are accessible to subscribers and trialists to SwingTrader. Free trials are available.RELATED:Volume Speaks Volumes About Stock TradesOne Thing Swing Traders Need To Look For Beyond The PriceSwing Trading Strategies And Lessons

Refineries could be shut for several weeks. Gas Buddy said the national gasoline average jumped by over 11 cents per gallon from the prior week with more price hikes on the way. U.S. crude futures fell as fewer refiners were available to convert oil to gasoline and other products. U.S. crude inventories fell by 5.4 million barrels in the latest week with gasoline supplies flat, the Energy Information Administration reported, but that doesn't reflect Harvey's impact. Domestic production was essentially flat at 9.53 million barrels a day, still near the record high of 9.61 million reached in June 2015.Two days after Gilead Sciences (GILD) said it would pay $11.9 billion, or $180 a share, for Kite Pharma (KITE) and pivot to cellular therapies, Novartis (NVS) was the first to grab FDA approval for a CAR-T treatment.

Q2 same-store sales rose 5.4% vs. views for 2.2%. But Best Buy CEO Hubert Joly cautioned them not to expect recent gains to be the ""new normal.""

The forecast followed weak quarterly showings from Foot Locker (FL), Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS) and Hibbett Sports (HIBB).

Futures for the Nasdaq 100 and Dow Jones industrial average advanced 0.35%. U.S. crude oil futures reversed from overnight highs near $52 to fall almost 1% to below $51 a barrel after Saudi Arabia said an expected output cut extension at Thursday's OPEC meeting would not involve deeper production reductions.On Wednesday, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite rose to within 0.1% of all-time intraday highs as the Federal Reserve signaled a go-slow approach for paring its massive balance sheet. The Dow Jones industrial average is within 1% of all-time highs. The S&P 500 actually set a record closing high. The big-cap Nasdaq 100 hit an all-time intraday best, with FANG stocks Amazon (AMZN) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) hitting all-time highs and Facebook (FB) climbing more than 1%.In Asian trading, Japan's Nikkei advanced 0.4%, Hong Kong's Hang Seng rose 0.8% while China's Shanghai composite gained 1.4%.In European trading intraday, the U.K.'s FTSE and Germany's Dax climbed 0.1% while France's CAC-40 rose 0.3%.Recent tech unicorn MuleSoft (MULE) broke out of an initial IPO base on Wednesday, while much-hyped Snap (SNAP) traded near lows.

Shares shot up 46% in its trading debt, hitting its still-intraday peak of 25.92.MuleSoft is a good example of why investors should wait for new IPOs to form and break out of an IPO base or other bullish consolidation before jumping in.Snap is an even better example, because the Snapchat operator has never presented a proper buying opportunity. Snap, which also came public at 17 in March, had a strong debut and second day of trading. But then the stock fell sharply.Heading into earnings, Snap was starting to show some positive signs but was still not close to a buy zone. Then Snap reported a wider loss and slower user growth than expected, as much-larger Facebook successfully clones popular Snapchat features.First Solar leapt 6.7% to 38.90, hitting a six-month high and clearing a bottoming base with a 37.77 buy point.

127,BBY,"One of the biggest winners from the RyanCare debacle may be Wal-Mart (WMT).House Speaker Paul Ryan's other baby, of course, is the 20% border-adjusted tax on imports. Big importers like Wal-Mart and Nike (NKE), both members of the Dow Jones industrial average, along with Best Buy (BBY) and many other retailers have fought hard to defeat it. General Motors (GM) and Toyota (TM) also oppose the tax that auto analysts have said could raise average car prices by $2,000.Even as President Trump is saying that he has no interest in pushing for Ryan's ouster as speaker, White House aides are making it clear that Trump believes Ryan deserves full blame for failure to repeal ObamaCare.Special Report: IBD Best Mutual Fund AwardsThe key point is that this marriage of convenience between Trump and Ryan is over. It now seems impossible to imagine Trump hitching tax cuts to Ryan's very unpopular vehicle for getting them passed.While a stronger dollar could largely counteract or negate the impact of a border tax on imported goods, a number of GOP senators have voiced opposition to Ryan's border tax, and its prospects for ultimate passage look no greater than RyanCare's.Wall Street fretted about a defeat for RyanCare for much of last week, with the Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite all suffering their sharpest one-day losses since fall on Tuesday as the conservative House Freedom Caucus began to close ranks against Ryan's American Health Care Act. Bank of America (BAC), Wells Fargo (WFC), Dow component Goldman Sachs (GS) and many other financials have sliced through their 50-day moving averages this week amid concerns that Trump's agenda of growth-fueling tax cuts and infrastructure spending could be sidelined by a failure to repeal ObamaCare.Yet after striking out with his first big legislative push, Trump is only too eager to shift to tax cuts and infrastructure spending. The real impact of failure on ObamaCare repeal will be to increase the urgency of tax cuts to save the GOP from a 2018 election debacle. Acting quickly could allow the GOP to make some tax cuts retroactive to 2017, meaning the payoff for voters would come before Election Day in 2018.So how would the GOP replace the $1 trillion raised by the border tax to pay for a cut in corporate tax rates? They likely wouldn't, opting instead to go with tax cuts instead of tax reform. With their backs to the wall, there's a strong chance that Republicans would relax their sense of fiscal responsibility to deliver a big, deficit-increasing tax cut.If Trump is able to keep his pledge to cut the corporate tax rate to 20% or less, without depending on a border tax, that could be great news for Wal-Mart and other retailers, which pay above-average tax rates because they don't tend to benefit much from tax credits for domestic manufacturing and R&D. In November, Wal-Mart forecast a companywide 31% to 32% effective tax rate for its current fiscal year, including its international locations. The bottom line is that instead of being one of the potential losers in tax reform, Wal-Mart could become among the big winners. (Wall Street is unsure. Wal-Mart shares fell a fraction for the week, trading just below their 200-day moving average.)While Senate budget reconciliation requiring just a simple majority can only be used to pass legislation that is no worse than deficit neutral beyond the 10th year, the GOP could use President George W. Bush's strategy of letting tax cuts sunset after a decade. Or the GOP could decide to blow up the Senate filibuster and enact permanent tax cuts, rolling the dice that Democrats won't control both the White House and Congress for years to come.Neither of those options is a sure thing. Some Republicans may not be willing to shed their fiscal conscience, and the political left would surely holler about disastrous implications for Social Security and Medicare. It's also unclear how the Federal Reserve and financial markets would respond to a big fiscal stimulus and higher deficits. Higher borrowing costs and uncertainty over the future of tax rates also might reduce the effectiveness of tax cuts to a significant extent.RELATED:The Bull Case For Tax Cuts If ObamaCare Repeal FailsTrump's 3 Little Words That May Sink Ryan's ObamaCare Repeal, Tax ReformIf Border Tax Dies, Trump Corporate Tax Cut May CollapseThe Trump Economy: Jobs, Regulations, Taxes And Trade 
"
128,BBY,"President Trump's recently surfaced idea for a 10% tariff on all imports has been roundly dismissed by economists and his fellow Republicans as a hostile move that could harm the global economy, but it bears closer examination because it might actually pass muster with global trading partners, while the plan currently being debated might not.It's remarkable that the House GOP plan for applying a 20% tax on imports — which has aroused the fierce opposition of Wal-Mart (WMT), Best Buy (BBY) and other retailers — is treated as a serious idea because it would be done within the bounds of ""tax reform,"" while Trump's idea for a tariff half that size is seen as ridiculous or dangerous.Big exporters like Boeing (BA) and General Electric (GE) are backing the House plan that purports to end the made-in-America tax, which would be replaced with a made-outside-America tax and very likely run afoul of World Trade Organization rules. On the other hand, it's possible that Trump's 10% tariff could be designed in a way that complies with WTO rules.""Here's something I've always said: 10% tariff or tax to do business in the United States. For everybody. China. Everybody. Straight across the board, 10%,"" Trump said in a secretly recorded December phone conversation with Wilbur Ross, who was just confirmed as commerce secretary, according to a new Gizmodo.com report.In a misguided claim, Trump went on to assert that such a tax would erase the trade deficit in a year. Actually, if the dollar appreciated vs. other currencies, the tariff might not alter trade flows at all.IBD'S TAKE: Backers of a 20% border tax say that the dollar would rise about 25%, effectively negating the higher tax bill faced by importers. Yet if that were to happen, the stronger dollar would hurt the U.S. tourism industry — including Trump hotels.The essential problem with the 20% border tax is that it would be discriminatory, applying to the full value of imports, including the compensation of the foreign workers who produce the goods. Meanwhile, assuming the rest of the House GOP's tax overhaul becomes reality, businesses producing goods domestically to sell in the U.S. would face a 20% tax only on their profits (down from 35%), with labor compensation excluded from the tax base.One argument in defense of the House border-tax plan is that the dollar could rise 25% vs. foreign currencies, negating any trade advantage. Yet the WTO is unlikely to buy that argument, and Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen cast doubt on whether currencies would fully adjust.So why might a 10% tax on imports be OK, but not a 20% tax? The key is that the U.S. already taxes labor compensation via payroll taxes, and Trump's idea could actually be a step toward leveling the playing field.Here's how: While the combined nominal rate for Social Security and Medicare payroll taxes is 15.3%, the effective tax rate on labor compensation for profit-making companies on average would come out to 10.6% — after accounting for income that's exempt from Social Security taxes, the ability of companies to write off payroll taxes, and assuming the tax on corporate profit is cut to 20%.Thus, Trump's 10% tax on imports could result in making businesses outside the U.S. pay taxes on labor compensation that's nearly on par with what U.S. companies already pay.Despite these rates coming closer to evening out, a 10% tariff would likely still be seen as a violation of trade rules. So Trump's tariff may then have to be turned into a 10% value-added tax, which the WTO views more favorably, to be applied across the board on imports and domestic income.Then, the full portion owed by U.S. companies would immediately be rebated to offset what they are already paying in payroll taxes and corporate taxes, effectively limiting the VAT to just imports in practice.But any connection to a VAT would surely set off alarm bells within the GOP because VATs are relied upon to fund broad social-benefits programs by many governments around the world and are seen as easier to increase than payroll taxes.Meanwhile, economists say that reducing the corporate income tax by adding a VAT could be a regressive shift, as it would be in this case if currency adjustments don't fully offset the tax.RELATED:

129,BBY,"The biggest battle in corporate America right now, over House Speaker Paul Ryan's border-adjusted tax, pits Boeing (BA), General Electric (GE), United Technologies (UTX) and other big exporters against major importers like Wal-Mart (WMT), Nike (NKE) and Best Buy (BBY).So far, the importers appear to be winning and they may have an ace up their sleeve: Ryan, the biggest proponent of a 20% tax on imports, is on the other side of the debate. At the moment, his policy agenda and political sway are in serious jeopardy.RyanCare, gravely wounded by the slings and arrows of both moderate and conservative Republicans, may have been buried by three words from President Trump in a televised interview on Wednesday night: ""I know that.""When Tucker Carlson of Fox News brought up an analysis showing that ""counties that voted for you, middle-class and working-class counties, would do far less well under the bill than counties that voted for Hillary,"" Trump could only agree.Trump acknowledged that ""a lot of things are inconsistent"" with his campaign pledge to replace ObamaCare with something terrific. ""These are going to be negotiated,"" Trump said, declaring, ""We will take care of our people or I'm not signing it.""In other words, RyanCare likely will only exist long enough to clear the House — if it even clears the House. As of Friday morning, the conservative House Freedom Caucus was still signaling its opposition, more than enough to defeat House Speaker Paul Ryan's repeal and replace of ObamaCare. That may be why Medicaid-focused insurers Molina Healthcare (MOH) and Centene (CNC) were rallying on the stock market. Molina rose 1.4% and Centene 0.3% Friday afternoon, turning slightly positive for the week.The House is penciling in a vote for next Thursday. If it passes, it will be up to the Senate to dramatically change a bill that the Congressional Budget Office says would result in 24 million more uninsured Americans while delivering a $600 billion tax cut.The take-away is that the process for drawing up ObamaCare repeal and replace will basically have to start nearly back at square one in the Senate, with hearings likely, along with in-depth negotiations about the size and form of tax credits, Medicaid cuts and incentives to keep people from going uninsured until they get sick. The CBO will, of course, weigh in, and the process may take months, likely delaying a tax reform push until late 2017 or even 2018.IBD'S TAKE: For now, financial markets are happy with just the idea of President Trump's big tax cuts and infrastructure spending. With all that fiscal fuel in the slow lane, the Federal Reserve can take its sweet time raising interest rates.
"
130,BBY,"""The complexity of the problems clearly suggests that taxpayer relief will not come before 2018 at the earliest, and neither will any of the planned increases in spending,"" wrote Mizuho Chief U.S. Economist Steven Ricchiuto.The bigger problem for Republicans — though not necessarily for companies opposing Ryan's border tax — is that there is a high chance of failure. The Senate is likely to find that the changes desired by moderates, including much bigger insurance subsidies for low-income and older Americans and retention of the Medicaid expansion, quickly start to resemble ObamaCare, more and more, both in policy and in cost.Sen. John Thune, R-S.D., has suggested providing bigger subsidies for lower earners, then applying the House bill's smaller subsidies above 250% of the poverty level. Depending on how high those low-income subsidies get, that's either a recipe for huge disincentives to earn more than 250% of the poverty level and a much more expensive bill, or else insurance would continue to be too expensive for lower earners to afford. These are the same kinds of issues ObamaCare wrestled with, often not very effectively.If House conservatives are unhappy that RyanCare is too far to the left, it's hard to see how they will stomach whatever might emerge from the Senate, which may have to scrap much of the $600 billion tax cut.One school of thought is that failure to repeal and replace ObamaCare could torpedo the rest of Trump's agenda. That's possible, but the only certainty is that failure will torpedo Ryan's agenda. Having been burned by taking on the thankless challenge of largely stripping away the ObamaCare health insurance entitlement, Republicans would be far too dispirited and fearful about their 2018 prospects to risk a contentious fight over a tax on imports that is ripe for populist attacks.That would be bad news for tax reform, since the border tax would raise $1 trillion to help pay for lower tax rates. Yet it's still possible that Republicans, with their backs to the wall, would relax their sense of fiscal responsibility to deliver a big, deficit-increasing tax cut.While Senate budget reconciliation requiring only a simple majority can only be used to pass legislation that is no worse than budget neutral beyond the 10th year, the GOP could use President George W. Bush's strategy of letting tax cuts sunset after a decade. Or the GOP could decide to blow up the Senate filibuster and enact permanent tax cuts, rolling the dice that Democrats won't control both the White House and Congress for years to come.Neither of those options is a sure thing. Some Republicans may not be willing to shed their fiscal conscience and the political left would surely holler about disastrous implications for Social Security and Medicare.Without a border tax, ""Republicans in Congress will have to choose between either accepting a modest version of corporate tax cuts with the standard rate falling only to the mid-high 20s (from 35% now) or allowing the deficit to increase materially,"" wrote Evercore ISI senior political strategist Terry Haines. ""Our big call is that in the end game — not necessarily now — what will give on tax cuts is fiscal discipline, so we maintain an above-market probability that deep corporate tax rate cuts will be achieved with a base case that the new rate does indeed end up down at 20%.""Haines adds: ""Stay long companies with above-average tax rates.""RELATED:CBO Reveals RyanCare Trick To 'Save' $600 Billion If Border Tax Dies, Trump Corporate Tax Cut May CollapseTrump's Big Speech Leaves Investors With Hope, Not Much Else Social Security Benefit Cuts In 2017 May Curb Trump's Plans How To Replace ObamaCare And Save Social Security The Trump Economy: Jobs, Regulations, Taxes And Trade

E-commerce sales over the holiday rose 17.7% to $5.3 billion from 2015.Total online sales rose 16.4% to $9.36 billion, according to Adobe Digital Insights. Amazon (AMZN) said Thursday-Friday sales would top a year earlier.

The flagship iPhone 8 handset will feature an organic light-emitting diode (OLED) display measuring 5.1 or 5.2 inches, he said. Apple also will sell two LCD-screen models that are the same sizes as the current iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, which have displays measuring 4.7 and 5.5 inches, respectively. Those new LCD handsets could be called the iPhone 7S and iPhone 7S Plus, he said.The 4.7-inch iPhone 7S could become a new midrange or even low-end model for Apple, Kuo said, according to AppleInsider.Apple's current low-end smartphone is its iPhone SE, which starts at $399. The next cheapest iPhone is the iPhone 6S, which starts at $549. Apple introduced the iPhone SE in March and is expected to skip its traditional annual hardware upgrade for the product.IBD'S TAKE: Apple stock has a below-average IBD Composite Rating of 43, meaning it has been outperformed by 57% of stocks in key metrics over the past 12 months. Apple stock has formed a flat base with a possible buy point of 118.79.The iPhone SE is Apple's bid to attract more price-sensitive consumers, especially in emerging markets like China.The iPhone 8 is expected to be a major redesign, featuring a bezel-free, edge-to-edge OLED display. OLED screens reduce power consumption and extend battery life. They also have faster refresh rates, better contrast, sharper color and a wider viewing angle. Plus, they can be used in curved and wraparound displays.The iPhone 8 also might feature wireless charging or superfast charging, analysts say. It also will get a speedier processor and improved camera. The iPhone 8 is due out in fall 2017.Apple and third-party retailers were offering Black Friday deals on iPhones, iPads and other Apple products for post-Thanksgiving sales.Apple on Friday was offering free Apple gift cards worth up to $150 to shoppers who buy select Apple products at full price. But better deals for Apple products could be found at retailers like Best Buy (BBY) and Target (TGT).For instance, Target was selling the Apple Watch Series 1 smartwatch for $198 on Black Friday, a $71 discount off its regular price of $269. Meanwhile, Apple was giving customers a $25 Apple gift card if they bought a full-price Apple Watch.Apple wasn't discounting its iPhone 7 series phones for Black Friday. But Target was giving customers a $250 Target gift card if they bought and activated an iPhone 7 handset. And Best Buy was offering gift cards of $100 to $250 depending on the model of iPhone 7 purchased.Drexel Hamilton analyst Brian White on Friday reiterated his buy rating on Apple with a price target of 185. Apple stock rose 0.49% to 111.77 in the shortened session on the stock market today.

While Apple did take part in Black Friday directly this year, Best Buy (BBY) and Target (TGT) were generally seen as having better online deals.IBD'S TAKE: Looking for stocks that are at or near proper buy points? Apple, Amazon, Best Buy, Ulta Beauty are stocks to watch.The continuing shift to online should be good news for Amazon, which has dominated e-commerce growth in recent years. Amazon said Thursday-Friday sales would top a year earlier, but that's not really a surprise. Eight of the 10 retailers that had the fastest e-commerce growth were brick-and-mortar locations.Target was bullish about Thursday-Friday sales generally.With deals more widely available throughout November and December, Thanksgiving weekend may be less important. That could explain why the average consumer said they reduced spending this year.Just 9% of consumers have finished holiday shopping, down from 11% a year ago, NRF said. And 23% have yet to do any gift buying, up from 19%.""With mid-season shopping behind us, it's not too late for retailers to tweak their online and in-store strategies to help increase traffic and see a big payoff during the last few weeks of the holiday season,"" Shay said.Next up is Cyber Monday. But with online deals so omnipresent already, how much buzz can retailers generate for this traditional online shopping day? Wal-Mart (WMT) launched its ""Cyber Monday"" deals at the crack of midnight on Friday.

146,BBY,"Here's a look at four stocks that could make notable moves as the holiday shopping season officially kicks off.Ulta Beauty (ULTA), which reports earnings on Thursday, closed Friday at 263.62, in sight of a double-bottom-base buy point at 268.88. Shares were able to find support at the 200-day line on Nov. 7 and have risen in 13 of the last 14 sessions. The beauty segment is expected to be a hot performer again this holiday season, which should benefit Ulta and potentially its stock.Best Buy (BBY) and Amazon are competing for your consumer electronics spending for the remainder of the year. Best Buy gave bullish holiday guidance earlier this month. Shares surged 14% on earnings to become quickly extended from a 40.31 buy point. The stock closed Friday at 46.58, nearly 16% above the entry. When a stock is 20% to 25% above a buy point, that's a good time to take at least partial profits.Amazon (AMZN) has been a highflying stock this year, but shares recently corrected as much as 16% in the wake of the e-commerce giant's latest earnings report. But the stock has now started to climb higher, and is nearing its 50-day line. At 780.37, it's 8% below an 847.31 buy point. Stellar Black Friday weekend stats could boost Amazon.Apple (AAPL) is also expected to benefit from its new product releases — the iPhone 7, Apple Watch Series 2 and MacBook Pro — this holiday quarter. Like Amazon, Apple has fallen off its peak and is still below the 50-day line. But it has retaken its 110.33 buy point, initially cleared Sept. 14, closing Friday at 111.79. Apple also is building a new base with a potential buy point at 118.79.And if you're still looking for stocking stuffers for your portfolio, Patrick Industries (PATK) and Cantel Medical (CMN) are both staging breakouts from bases. Chipmakers Cirrus Logic (CRUS) and Broadcom (AVGO) are nearing buy points as well, while Semtech (SMTC) closed right at a 23.30 buy point ahead of its earnings report on Wednesday.IBD'S TAKE: Want to be able to learn how to spot bases and buy points for yourself?

147,BBY,"Never accuse the country's biggest retailer of resting on its laurels. After disrupting and transforming one retail segment after another, Amazon (AMZN) has the checkout line in its sights. And investors are returning to ETFs that have big stakes in the stock.Amazon Go, unveiled Monday, promises a new kind of brick-and-mortar store. Its marquee feature is checkout-free ""grab and go"" shopping. So no more dealing with long lines at cash registers or scrambling for a debit card, although details of Amazon's plans are scarce.Convenience is highly valued by consumers, and the Amazon Go news should help exchange traded funds tied to consumers' disposable income, said David Haviland, a managing partner at Beaumont Capital Management.""This appears like a positive announcement in a very exciting technology,"" he added. ""If it works as described, it seems like it could be applied to all retail.""A positive development tied to Amazon matters in the ETF investing world, where roughly 100 funds hold the stock. It matters especially to investors who make tactical and strategic bets on equity sectors to tap growth, diversify portfolios and manage risk.Amazon's stock was down 9.70, or 1.26%, at 758.95 Monday. Amazon accounts for 13% of the consumer discretionary sector of the S&P 500, more than any other company.That makes Amazon the top stock in the $11.11 billion Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR (XLY). Amazon also is the No. 1 holding with a 10% to 16% portfolio weighting in cap-weighted ETFs such as Vanguard Consumer Discretionary (VCR), iShares U.S. Consumer Services (IYC), Fidelity MSCI Consumer Discretionary (FDIS) and VanEck Vectors Retail (RTH).Of them, the Fidelity ETF has the lowest expense ratio at 0.8%.IBD'S TAKE: New products or services represent the N in IBD's CAN SLIM investing system. Strong earnings growth (the C and A in CAN SLIM, for Current earnings and Annual earnings) is the No. 1 factor to look for in a stock, but new products or services often generate stellar profitability.Haviland, whose Massachusetts-based firm has $2.7 billion in assets under management, is cautiously optimistic about the consumer discretionary sector for two reasons.""We think the sector will do relatively well as the Trump administration is focusing on tax cuts and government spending, and this will put more money into the economy,"" he told IBD via email. ""Also, the proposed infrastructure spending may be inflationary, which may help Americans by reducing their debt burdens in real terms.""Consumer discretionary funds have had a hard slog of late, but are starting to perk up.Apart from the Trump factor, the seasonal factor is in play. Holiday shopping often delivers a boost to retailers in the run-up to the ""Santa Claus rally"" that stocks tend to see in the final week of the year.In the month ended Dec. 8, XLY leapt 6.7%, outpacing the S&P 500, and it pegged a 52-week high of 84.34 on Thursday.Year to date, XLY is up 8.9% vs. 12.2% for SPDR S&P 500 (SPY). Consumer discretionary has outperformed virtually all S&P 500 sectors over the past five years and longer periods of time.Investors have piled back in as the sector regains its footing. XLY saw $1.1 billion in net inflow in the month ended Dec. 7, according to FactSet data. That contrasts with a $1.1 billion in net outflow since the start of this year.XLY and most of its peers had bled money earlier in the year amid a multitude of woes: falling foot traffic in brick-and-mortar stores; disappointing reports across the retail landscape; and an uncertain economic outlook that made consumers reluctant to spend.Sheraz Mian, research director at Zacks Investment Research, finds it worrisome that all major industries in retail came out with weaker-than-expected results in the third quarter.""We saw that with the online vendors, the restaurants and even the big-box retailers,"" Mian said. One big exception was Best Buy (BBY).Department stores such as Macy's (M), Nordstrom (JWN) and Kohl's (KSS) did relatively better, ""but that was largely as a result of tight inventory controls,"" Mian added.Haviland of Beaumont Capital, despite his increased optimism about the sector, notes a big risk in rising interest rates.""If Americans have to spend incrementally more of their incomes servicing debt burdens, then they'll have less to spend on discretionary items,"" he said.Consumer discretionary ETFs that skew toward small caps and value stocks have beaten their cap-weighted peers on the stock market so far this year.PowerShares S&P SmallCap Consumer Discretionary (PSCD) is up 21.5% through Dec. 8, while Guggenheim S&P 500 Equal Weight Consumer Discretionary (RCD), SPDR S&P Retail (XRT) and First Trust Consumer Discretionary Alpha (FXD) are up between 11% and 13%.Small-cap and value stocks are also favored by some strategists in the changing landscape under President-elect Donald Trump.RELATED:Small-Cap Value ETFs Show Again Why They Are Darlings Of The MarketHow To Play Small-Cap ETFs In Strong Equity Markets With Rising Rates 
"
148,BBY,"President Trump said Thursday that he supports ""some sort of border tax"" on imports, his strongest signal yet that he's on board with a House GOP corporate tax reform plan. But many experts say other countries would challenge such a tax system as violating World Trade Organization rulesSupporters of the Republican plan for a 20% border tax, including big exporters like Boeing (BA) and General Electric (GE), argue that it would end the made-in-America tax. Trump told Reuters that a border tax would spur companies to build factories and create  jobs in the U.S.But what border tax supporters  don't admit is that their plan would create a made-outside-America tax, very likely running afoul of the WTO.In a Thursday op-ed, Phil Gramm, the former GOP Texas senator, became the latest among a multitude of tax and trade experts to question the legality of the border-tax plan. ""This policy is protectionism pure and simple, and the WTO would surely say so, opening America up to retaliation and possibly triggering a trade war.""Even if Republicans are able to surmount the opposition of retailers like Wal-Mart (WMT) and Best Buy (BBY), which is looking less likely by the day, concerns that it could spark a trade war will be hard for skeptical lawmakers to ignore.However, a smaller border tax that essentially taxes imports at the effective U.S. payroll tax rate might pass muster, though that would create its own issues.The essential problem is that the 20% border tax would apply to the full value of imports, including the compensation of the foreign workers who produced the goods, while businesses producing goods domestically to sell in the U.S. would face a 20% tax only on their profits, with labor compensation excluded from the tax base.One argument in defense of this discriminatory border tax is that the dollar would rise 25% vs. foreign currencies, negating any trade advantage. Yet the WTO is unlikely to buy that argument when even Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen cast doubt on whether currencies would fully adjust.IBD'S TAKE: A 25% rise in the dollar would neutralize a 20% border tax for importers like Wal-Mart, but the tourism industry could still take it on the chin. Even Trump hotels would lose. Another potential argument is that the U.S. already taxes labor via payroll taxes for Social Security and Medicare. Together, the 12.4% Social Security tax and 2.9% Medicare tax (including both employer and employee portions) add up to 15.3% of wages.In fact, some analysts have said that one possible fix for the border tax would be to lower it from 20% to 15% (about level with the U.S. payroll tax rate), but even that is very unlikely to satisfy the WTO. There are two reasons why:Reducing the border tax to 10.6% would put made-outside-America on an equal footing in terms of payroll taxes. At that rate, the border tax would work like a nondiscriminatory VAT in other countries, with payroll taxes paid in lieu of applying the VAT to the labor compensation of U.S. workers. (While it's not 100% clear that the WTO would buy this approach, international trading partners would be much less trigger-happy.)Still, that's no silver bullet for Republicans, because it would raise barely half of the $1 trillion that analysts have said could be raised by a 20% border tax, making a 20% corporate tax rate look like a distant possibility.RELATED:These Six Dow Components Back Border Tax, But Shallow Support Shows Why It's In TroubleIf Border Tax Dies, Trump Corporate Tax Cut May CollapseThe Trump EconomyDonald Trump News & Tweets: ObamaCare, Immigration, Trade, Economy

Snap (SNAP) shot up 44% to 24.48 in its first day of trade, then climbed 10.7% to 29.09 on Friday.Some analysts were immediately skeptical on Snap's prospects, with Pivotal Research saying Snap was a sell and worth 10 a share.

151,BBY,"CEOs of Best Buy (BBY), Target (TGT), Gap (GPS), Autozone (AZO) and others will reportedly meet Wednesday with members of Congress to argue against a potential tax on the imports they rely on to keep costs down.The executives will meet with Kevin Brady, the House Ways and Means Committee chairman and senators, according to Reuters, which added it was unclear if the executives would also meet with President Trump.Brady and House Speaker Paul Ryan have been at work on a plan that would slash corporate income taxes to 20%, impose a new 20% tax on imports, but spare export revenue from being taxed, Reuters said.Shares of Best Buy closed 3% higher at 45.29 on the stock market today. Target rose 1.3% to 65.65, and Gap climbed 2.4% to 24.20.IBD'S TAKE: Along with a border tax, the retail landscape has dried up as more customers shop online and a younger generation values more meaningful experiences over things. Here's what malls are doing to stay alive. The meeting comes ahead of a potential announcement Trump said he would make in the next to or three weeks that would be ""phenomenal in terms of tax.""Higher import taxes against nations like Mexico and China could hurt a variety of retailers and force them to pass more costs onto consumers.""Border adjustments create uncertainty for multi-national brands from a tax and FX perspective while consumers face significant cost inflation,"" Cowen & Co. said in a research note last month.Nike (NKE) was among the most insulated from a border adjustment tax ""due to significant international segment mix,"" Cowen said. Hanesbrands (HBI) and G-III Apparel (GIII) were among the most vulnerable.""In a 20% border adjustment scenario,"" the firm added, ""multi-national apparel and footwear brands must immediately raise prices, on average, by a high-teens rate and hope for fairly inelastic demand but could still see profitability lowered by 70% to 20%, depending on mix of business, deductions, and FX movements even with corp. tax rates lowered to 20%.""RELATED:Retailers Face 2017 'Reckoning,' More 'Sad Malls' As Amazon Keeps BoomingPresident Trump Attacks Nordstrom To Defend Daughter's BusinessSears Dumps Some Trump-Branded Goods But Aims To 'Leave The Politics To Others'

153,BBY,"President Trump on Monday called the effort to repeal and replace ObamaCare ""unbelievably complex"" and said that his tax cut plans will have to wait in line.But Trump sounded all fired up to begin making good on his campaign plans for a massive infrastructure spending boost. That may be the easiest lift because of the bipartisan appeal of creating more construction jobs while making investments in highways, bridges and other productivity-enhancing projects.Trump's comments on Monday lit a fire under infrastructure stocks. Caterpillar (CAT) rose about 2%, U.S. Steel (X) 3.2%, Fluor (FLR) 1.9% and Vulcan Materials (VMC) 2.4%. Those stocks got hammered last week when reports emerged that the White House was thinking of pushing an infrastructure bill to 2018.Yet there still might not be a green light for Trump's infrastructure plans. With the repeal-and-replace plan for President Obama's signature program running into trouble on multiple fronts, it's looking increasingly possible that Republicans will have to signal a retreat before the rest of their economic agenda can advance.According to Trump, everything is under control. He said on Monday that the White House has arrived at a ""really, really good"" solution to ObamaCare that he will discuss Tuesday night before a joint session of Congress.""I think you'll like what you hear,"" he told insurers at the White House on Monday, including UnitedHealth (UNH), Aetna (AET) and Anthem (ANTM).Investor confidence in President Trump may be riding on his Tuesday speech. High hopes for tax cuts, a surge in infrastructure spending and regulatory reform have helped fuel an explosive postelection stock market rally, but doubts have been creeping in about his ability to deliver.Still, the Dow Jones industrial average has rallied for 11 straight sessions as of Friday, the longest winning streak in decades.Trump's vow to cut the corporate tax rate to 15% or 20% may hinge on the House GOP proposal for a 20% border tax that faces serious opposition in the Senate because it pits big importers like Wal-Mart (WMT) and Best Buy (BBY) against exporters like Boeing (BA) and General Electric (GE).No hint of a Plan B has emerged, and Trump signaled that he won't provide any details that might help investors gauge the prospects for tax reform advancing while ObamaCare is dominating the agenda. Trump's explanation was that tax reform would have to take into account the budget effect of repeal and replace.While there's good reason to expect regulatory reform to ease compliance costs across a wide array of industries, big banks like JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Bank of America (BAC) also have been lifted by hopes for a lower corporate tax rate and a steeper yield curve, which boosts net interest margins. Yet diminished confidence that a Trump economic package will do much for growth over the next year have led Treasury yields to sag in recent weeks.IBD'S TAKE: Backers of a 20% border tax say that the dollar would rise about 25%, effectively negating the higher tax bill faced by importers. Yet, if that were to happen, the stronger dollar would hurt the U.S. tourism industry — including Trump hotels.The White House seems to have gone back and forth on whether it will support a border tax, which would raise more than $1 trillion over a decade and offset the cost of a lower corporate tax rate. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told Fox News that he has only just begun to study the border tax proposal. Last week, Mnuchin said the goal was to pass tax reform by August but acknowledged that the timetable could slip.Trump has made clear that figuring out what to do about ObamaCare is the top priority in the short term, but dissension among Republicans about how to replace the law raises the risk of a drawn-out effort, at best, with some risk of a quagmire. A preliminary Congressional Budget Office score of the House's approach to repeal and replace much of ObamaCare reportedly showed a big increase in the ranks of the uninsured, which runs counter to White House promises.Republicans are considering holding a vote to repeal big parts of ObamaCare, even if a victory is uncertain. That may be the best outcome for investors. Win or lose, ObamaCare would fall off the top of the agenda, clearing the way for more growth-oriented policies.RELATED:Lockheed, Northrop, Raytheon Rally As Trump Seeks Defense Budget BoostInfrastructure Stocks Jump As President Trump Vows To Spend 'Big'Steel, Materials, Mining Stocks Dive As Trump Mulls Infrastructure Delay To 2018Will Heavy Construction's Rebound Receive A Trump Infrastructure Boost?If Border Tax Dies, Trump Corporate Tax Cut May Collapse

Or will they buy game software as digital downloads?How consumers respond will impact the top and bottom lines for game publishers and retailers.The biggest game publishers such as Activision Blizzard (ATVI), Electronic Arts (EA) and Take-Two Interactive Software (TTWO) lately have been benefiting from the move to digital downloads, which carry fatter profit margins.IBD'S TAKE: IBD Swing Trader uses CAN SLIM technical and fundamental research to find potential hits, not home runs. The goal is 10% profit within five to 10 days, with losses cut at 3%. Take-Two has been a Swing Trader stock of late.Retailers like GameStop (GME) and Best Buy (BBY) have been hurt by the shift to digital game distribution. But they might be able to compensate for that this holiday season thanks to the availability of new midcycle game consoles and the launch of virtual-reality headsets.""Nothing is better under the Christmas tree than a box to open that has an actual gift,"" NPD analyst Mat Piscatella told IBD.Piscatella said he's seen no data yet to indicate that digital game download rates will be higher this holiday season. Video-game publishers have said top titles can sell 30% of units as digital downloads now. But what percentage is gifted is not known, Piscatella said.Many of those downloads probably are purchased by adult gamers who just want to play a new game right away, without having to get a physical game disc, he said.But game downloads have some disadvantages, such as having to wait for a huge digital file to download and install.""You get it on Christmas Day and hopefully you're playing by New Year's,"" joked DFC Intelligence analyst David Cole.Publishers are offering special editions of games with collectibles and other extras to entice gamers to buy physical copies.At the same time, publishers are incentivizing gamers to get digital downloads by bundling in online season passes and pre-release game play.GameStop has been a canary in the coal mine for changes in the industry. On Tuesday, it reported disappointing fiscal third-quarter sales due in part to the increase in game software downloads.GameStop said new game titles sold below expectations for its fiscal Q3 ended Oct. 29. Analysts say Activision's ""Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare"" was among the games that came up short in physical game sales at GameStop last quarter.On the plus side, GameStop said the Nov. 18 release of Nintendo's (NTDOY) ""Pokemon Sun and Moon"" was the retailer's biggest game launch of the year. Nintendo games tend to have a lower digital download rate than those from other publishers. Nintendo customers tend to be younger.Other major game releases this fall include ""Battlefield 1"" and ""Titanfall 2"" from Electronic Arts and ""Mafia 3"" from Take-Two Interactive Software.Annual sports titles are likely to be big sellers this holiday season, including EA's ""Madden NFL 17"" and ""FIFA 17"" and Take-Two's ""NBA 2K17"" and ""WWE 2K17.""Other games looking to rack up big sales this Christmas include ""Watch Dogs 2"" from Ubisoft, ""Dishonored 2"" from Bethesda Softworks, and ""Final Fantasy 15"" from Square Enix.Publishers are cashing in on the sweet spot of the current game console cycle, where there's a large installed base of consoles in which to sell big game titles.Sony (SNE) is expected to have an installed base of 50 million PlayStation 4 consoles worldwide by year's end, DFC Intelligence said. Rival Microsoft (MSFT) is seen having 28 million Xbox One consoles in use by the end of 2016, DFC said.Game hardware revenue has been in decline this year because of market saturation and lower prices for consoles. Sony and Microsoft are hoping to change that with the recent launch of redesigned and souped-up versions of current consoles. Microsoft has the Xbox One S and Sony has the PlayStation 4 Pro and PS4 Slim. Plus, Nintendo has a retro console in its NES Classic Edition, which comes preinstalled with 30 games.Next year will bring two next-generation consoles: the Nintendo Switch and Microsoft Scorpio.This is the first Christmas season for virtual-reality headsets, including the games-focused Sony PlayStation VR. Other VR headsets include Facebook's (FB) Oculus Rift and HTC's Vive. Plus, there are low-cost VR headsets that use smartphone screens as their display, such as the Samsung Gear VR.Among the big VR games already out are ""Batman: Arkham VR"" from Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment, a unit of Time Warner (TWX), and ""NBA 2KVR Experience"" from Take-Two. Electronic Arts is releasing its ""Star Wars Battlefront Rogue One: X-Wing VR Mission"" on Dec. 6.""PS VR launch bundles being sold out pretty much everywhere is a positive sign"" for adoption of virtual reality, Piscatella said. ""There's a lot of excitement around (gaming) hardware and accessories this holiday.""But this could be just a get-to-know-you period for VR. Best Buy, GameStop and others are offering demonstrations of VR systems in their stores to acquaint shoppers with the technology.""Consumers haven't really been introduced to it yet,"" Cole told IBD. ""2017 is the year that VR really gets started.""Best Buy rolled out virtual-reality products to all of its stores during its fiscal third quarter ended Oct. 29, and it has dedicated virtual-reality departments in more than 700 stores, CEO Hubert Joly told analysts on a conference call Nov. 17.Best Buy has given more than 300,000 virtual-reality demonstrations to customers so far, Joly said.And GameStop Chief Operating Officer Tony Bartel said the new gaming hardware products are ""bright spots"" for GameStop.""We're seeing strong demand for new consoles, the PS4 Pro is off to a strong start and VR is generally on the shelves for less than 10 days,"" he said on a conference call with analysts. ""We're also seeing solid consumer interest for the upcoming launch of Switch from Nintendo.""The Switch uses physical media and Nintendo products have historically had a low digital download rate, so we expect this to be a console that drives strong sales of physical product along with the console.""Activision stock fell a fraction to 37.22 in the stock market today, a half-day session that ended at 1 p.m. ET. Shares touched an all-time high of 45.55 on Oct. 25, but also hit a four-month low of 36.32 on Wednesday.EA stock also fell a fraction Friday, to 79.17. It's forming a flat base with a possible buy point of 86.17. Take-Two stock rose 0.68% to 48.81, in buy range after hitting a 46.88 buy point on Nov. 3 out of a flat base, and touching a record high of 50.19 on Nov. 7.GameStop shares fell nearly 1% Friday, while Best Buy stock fell 0.8% to 46.58.

158,BBY,"Consumer electronics retailer Best Buy (BBY) on Thursday handily beat Wall Street's expectations for its fiscal third quarter and guided to higher earnings in the holiday quarter, sending its shares heading north.Best Best earned 62 cents a share excluding items, up 51% year over year, on sales of $8.95 billion, up 1.5%, in its fiscal Q3 ended Oct. 29. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected the Richfield, Minn.-based company to earn 47 cents a share on sales of $8.85 billion.Best Buy benefited from strong sales of televisions and related home theater products, mobile phones, wearables and connected home devices in Q3.

Apple (AAPL) stock fell 4 cents to 109.95; Fitbit (FIT) tumbled 6.7% to 8.82; and GoPro edged up 0.81% to 9.98.Best Buy said TV sales were boosted by new technologies such as 4K ultrahigh definition video with high dynamic range (HDR). Mobile phone sales were aided by the launch of Apple's iPhone 7.Best Buy's domestic same-store sales rose 1.8%, while its online sales jumped 24.1%.""In home theater, we continue to grow sales and market share,"" Joly said. ""We believe we have built a market-leading customer experience around home theater and large-screen TVs based on our assortment, our merchandising, our online experience, the expertise of our in-store sales associates, and our ability to help customers in the home.""Declining average sales prices and new technologies have been driving growth in TV sales, he said.Joly said he's excited about new product categories including virtual-reality headsets and connected home products such as home automation and security.RELATED:Wireless Headphones, 4K TVs, Drones Top Christmas Wish Lists

162,BBY,"Here's the reality facing President Trump's plan to slash corporate tax rates, one of the drivers of the postelection stock market rally that's pushed the Dow Jones industrial average above 20,000 and the Nasdaq Composite Index to record highs.The fate of this key Trump agenda item, meant to eliminate the tax disincentive for producing in the U.S. instead of overseas, likely rests on adoption of a 20% tax on imports — which retailers like Wal-Mart (WMT) and Best Buy (BBY) are dead-set on stopping and which likely would violate World Trade Organization rules.In other words, although Dow manufacturing components Boeing (BA), General Electric (GE) and other big exporters back tax reform that includes a border tax, it will surely face a bruising battle and, if it survives Congress, could spark a trade war.So the key question is this: As difficult and risky as this scenario sounds, why are House Republicans led by Speaker Paul Ryan so adamant about making a border tax central to tax reform? While they're surely sold on the merits of their approach, they also apparently realize that the most likely alternative to a border tax may be a brick wall for their dream of corporate tax reform.Start with the clearest manifestation that the U.S. corporate tax code is a mess: $2.5 trillion in profits and about $1.3 trillion in cash held overseas by U.S. companies — led by Dow techs Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT) as well Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) — to avoid being taxed at the 35% federal tax rate (after a credit for foreign taxes paid). Tech giants account for a huge share held overseas by U.S. corporations, even as huge money spinners such as Apple and Alphabet minimize their effective tax rate by shifting intellectual property and other official profits to lower-tax jurisdictions.As it stands, the high U.S. corporate tax rate (39.1% when average state taxes are included) provides an incentive for companies to produce their products and earn their profits overseas, partly by using a variety of tax-avoidance strategies to magnify domestic costs and minimize domestic profits.Trump's campaign plan to cut the corporate tax rate all the way to 15% would have largely negated worries about American companies offshoring or engaging in tax-avoidance strategies because of relatively high U.S. tax rates. Yet his approach, which would add $1.4 trillion to the deficit over a decade, according to the conservative Tax Foundation, is a nonstarter in the Senate, where the GOP will need to come up with a plan that eventually pays for itself to pass via reconciliation.The House GOP would solve the budget problem by cutting the corporate tax rate only to 20% and by imposing a 20% tax on imports that the Tax Foundation says would raise $1.1 trillion over 10 years.The House approach would tax income where it is earned, so exports produced in the U.S. would be tax-free and profits earned overseas would face no U.S. tax. The upside of this approach is that it would eliminate any incentive for companies to shift income or production overseas for tax-avoidance purposes.IBD'S TAKE: Supporters of the border tax plan say that the dollar would rise by 20% vs. other currencies, meaning that it wouldn't harm either corporate profits or consumers. But it does pose a risk to U.S. investors holding shares of companies like Alibaba or international ETFs.Under the House approach, known as a territorial system, U.S. companies would no longer be at a disadvantage in selling abroad since they'll face the same local tax rate as their competitors.Yet it's easy to see how all of these positives would disappear without the $1.1 trillion raised by the import tax. All of a sudden, Republicans might be hard-pressed to cut the federal corporate tax rate even to 28%. At that point, it would be politically dicey to adopt a territorial tax system because it could arguably facilitate offshoring: Goods produced in the U.S. would still face a tax rate north of 30% (including state taxes) vs. 15% or lower in many other parts of the world.There's another problem. The House proposal is like a quarterback's long pass downfield to within the 20-yard-line of the opposing team. While some complex issues involving particular industries and phase-in periods would still have to be worked out, the main structure is fairly straightforward: Businesses would face a 20% tax on cash flow, defined as revenue minus cost of sales and capital expenses. Export sales would be eliminated from the top line, while import purchases would be eliminated from the cost of goods.Without a long ""chunk yardage"" play made possible by an export tax, getting the ball downfield would be a grind. Consider that among the biggest business tax breaks are credits for domestic manufacturing — probably the last thing Trump would want to eliminate; research and development; accelerated depreciation of capital investments; and the deduction of interest on corporate debt.While interest deductibility would go away in the House plan, raising the after-tax cost of investment, that's more than offset by other features of the plan that would cut the tax rate to 20%. Yet even if companies are allowed to immediately write off investments, Goldman Sachs economists have concluded that eliminating the interest deduction could slightly curtail investment ""if the statutory rate does not decline sufficiently,"" which would defeat the point of tax reform.If Republicans can't go long with their border tax approach, then they'll have to claw their way downfield going inch by inch of the tax code. On the chance they could reach a consensus on small-ball tax reform that GOP lawmakers and the business community could support, there's a good chance that time would run out as the clock ticked down to the 2018 midterm elections.There are other approaches to major corporate tax reform that could work without the House's border-adjusted tax. But the alternatives, such as dramatically raising taxes on capital gains and dividends, are unlikely to unify Republicans and have gotten minimal attention. Republicans seem to have all their chips on the border tax.""While complicated, border adjustment simplifies the rest of tax reform by avoiding dozens of fights over other offsets and deductions in the tax code,"" wrote Keefe, Bruyette & Woods Washington analyst Brian Gardner. ""It is the linchpin for the GOP plan, and without it, the tax reform effort could collapse.""Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs analysts see just a 20% chance of adoption for the border tax, which they believe ""would ultimately be found to be WTO-noncompliant.""Yet Goldman still sees a path to a 25% corporate rate, assuming congressional scorekeepers alter budget baselines to lower the bar to revenue neutrality, which would defy precedent and is probably wishful thinking. On top of a friendly baseline, the tax cut might be credited with bringing in several hundred billion in revenue via dynamic scoring. That might get the GOP almost into field-goal position, making it necessary to only grind out a manageable amount of additional savings to put some points on the board.RELATED:Trump's Bully Pulpit Isn't Stopping U.S. Firms From Shifting Jobs, Plants To MexicoWhy Tax Reform Could End In Tears For Trump And GOPTreasury Might Write Checks To Boeing Under GOP Tax ReformInvestors Would Pay For Corporate Tax Cut In New GOP Plan

164,BBY,"The fight over the border tax has been focused entirely on the impact a 20% tax would have on big importers. Supporters insist that retailers like Wal-Mart (WMT) and Best Buy (BBY) wouldn't really be hurt, because currencies would adjust to neutralize the tax.Yet, while the predicted 25% rise in the dollar isn't certain — it could rise by somewhat less or even more — it's curious that there's been almost no attention paid to the potential impact on the one industry that's likely to bear the brunt of a currency adjustment: U.S. tourism.Tourism Economics estimates that each 10% rise in the dollar causes a 2% decrease in international visitors. On top of that, visitors may shorten their average stay and otherwise limit their spending.International travelers could find that visiting a Disney (DIS) theme park, gambling at an MGM Resorts (MGM) casino, staying at a Marriott (MAR) hotel or shopping at Tiffany (TIF) would be much more expensive.Staying at a Trump International Hotel would be more expensive too, which might influence President Trump's view that the dollar is already ""too strong"" and is ""killing us."" Just how much more expensive would depend on the extent to which reduced travel leads tourism-related industries to lower prices.Another hit would come from increased overseas travel by Americans, who would find that their dollars go much further in London, Paris, Rome and other destination spots around the world and opt against a U.S. vacation.International carriers like United Airlines (UAL) and American Airlines (AAL) may not suffer as much, since more outbound American travelers could ease the pain of fewer U.S.-bound tourists. Similarly, global hotel chains like Marriott may also see additional bookings by Americans abroad. But more domestic-focused businesses won't have such offsets.A major, unilateral increase in the U.S. currency could come at a pretty significant price. International travel added $247 billion to the U.S. economy last year and generated an $88 billion surplus, relative to what Americans spent abroad, according to the U.S. Travel Association's analysis of Commerce Department data. That's down from a $98 billion travel surplus in 2015. It's not clear how much of the narrower surplus was related to a stronger dollar, but there is generally a lag before shifts in currencies affect travel, given advance bookings.The figures include educational tourism — foreign students attending U.S. colleges and universities and generally paying much more than local residents to do so. With a 25% rise in the dollar, the U.S. might not look like quite as an attractive place to study. In 2015, education-related tourism totaled $35.8 billion.""Regular exporters would, under border adjustment, receive a subsidy that would offset the exchange rate impact; but hotel owners presumably wouldn't,"" wrote American Enterprise Institute resident scholar Stan Veuger. ""Or would U.S. taxpayers start subsidizing the vacations of Chinese tourists?""That seems as unlikely as federal government subsidies to let foreign students attend the University of California at Berkeley, he adds.While the impact on tourism has been almost entirely absent from the debate, it could play a bigger role as GOP senators decide whether they can back the House plan. Georgia Sen. David Perdue, former CEO of Dollar General (DG), has already signaled his fierce opposition, meaning just two more GOP defections could kill it.Expect Sen. Dean Heller of Nevada and Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, who both represent top-five states for foreign travel, to come under heavy lobbying pressure from the tourism industry. Border states Texas and Arizona also are big tourism destinations, with Mexican travelers spending $19.7 billion in the U.S. in 2015.IBD'S TAKE: If the dollar appreciates 20% to 25% against foreign currencies, U.S. investors holding ADRs of foreign equities like Alibaba or international ETFs would take a hit.The projected rise in the dollar would come from already lofty levels. The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of advanced-economy currencies, surged 26% from July 2014 to March 2015, hitting the highest level since 2003.On earnings calls in the fall of 2015, Starwood Hotels and Resorts Worldwide noted ""lower volumes of inbound international travelers due to the strong dollar,"" while Tiffany said it ""continued to experience a negative effect on foreign tourists spending in the U.S.""While the dollar eased off of those levels for most of 2016, it has strengthened again on expectations for a stronger U.S. economy under Trump.AEI's Veuger also points out that real estate is another ""quasi-exporting"" industry that might feel an impact from the border tax, since foreigners purchase some $100 billion worth of residential properties in a year, about half paid for in cash.RELATED:If Border Tax Dies, Trump Corporate Tax Cut May CollapseTreasury Might Write Checks To Boeing Under GOP Tax Reform

165,BBY,"President Trump assured CEOs of Tesla Motors (TSLA), Ford (F) and U.S. Steel (X) on Monday that he'll definitely cut the corporate income-tax rate to 15% or 20%, yet Wall Street is closely watching to see if he can deliver.Doubts have crept in since Trump's dismissal last week of the leading House GOP corporate tax reform plan as ""too complicated"" and bound to boost the dollar that's already ""too strong."" Meanwhile, the House plan's 20% tax on imports has set off a fierce lobbying campaign from retailers like Wal-Mart (WMT), Target (TGT) and Best Buy (BBY), which fear that their tax bills would soar. Big tech importers like Apple (AAPL) would have to pay the 20% border tax and could also take a hit to foreign earnings as the dollar appreciates.But the newest Republican plan to sidestep a contentious debate over a border tax may drive home the reality that there aren't any politically easy ways of delivering a massive corporate tax cut, which might soften some of the criticism the House GOP is facing. The border tax would raise $1.1 trillion over a decade to help pay for the tax cut. The alternative proposed by Sen. Mike Lee of Utah would slash corporate taxes and pay for it by increasing tax rates on capital gains and dividends to offset much of the revenue loss.""Taken together, these two changes would transfer the workers' share of the corporate tax onto American investors, who, again, are the natural and disproportionate beneficiaries of globalization relative to American workers,"" Lee wrote at The Federalist conservative blog.In other words, Lee's plan would deliver a big, beautiful cake to U.S. investors but wouldn't let them dig in.IBD'S TAKE: The House GOP tax reform that Trump is considering would likely help foreigners holding U.S. stocks and hit U.S. investors in foreign investments, such as Alibaba's ADRs or overseas ETFs.Economists figure that workers bear part of the burden of America's relatively high corporate income tax in lower wages, because it chases some investment to lower-tax locales. Lee, who hasn't put out a full-fledged plan, based his idea on a 2014 proposal from Alan Viard of the right-of-center American Enterprise Institute and Eric Toder of the left-leaning Tax Policy Center. Lee cites the 2014 version of their plan that cut the corporate income tax rate to zero and raised the tax rate on capital gains and dividends to the ordinary income rate of 42.4% (including a 3.8% ObamaCare tax on investments).Yet those authors revised their approach last year. To overcome the criticism that foreigners who owned shares of U.S. companies would escape any taxation, Viard and Toder decided to retain a corporate income-tax rate of 15%. Further, to avoid giving investors reason to hold onto their shares indefinitely to delay any tax payment, they would apply capital gains taxes based on the annual change in the market value of investors' equity holdings.Like the House GOP's border tax, the intent of their approach is to remove the tax code's incentive to produce overseas vs. in the U.S., or to shift profits to overseas subsidiaries through a variety of other strategies. Yet the lack of any colleagues on board may be a sign that there's even less support for taxing Americans' investments than foreign imports.RELATED:Wal-Mart, Best Buy, Apple Rally After Trump Pans GOP Border Adjustment Tax

167,BBY,"After a solid month of bad news, Wal-Mart (WMT), Best Buy (BBY), Dollar Tree (DLTR) and other retail stocks were among the biggest winners on Tuesday as doubts emerged over President-elect Donald Trump's plan to slash corporate taxes.Apple (AAPL) also may be seeing a benefit from a disagreement between Trump and House Speaker Paul Ryan over how to make a big corporate tax cut fiscally viable.Even as doubts about tax reform helped drag down broad stock market indexes on Tuesday, retailers bucked the trend. Wal-Mart rose 1.9% to 68.42 on the stock market today. Best Buy climbed 2.4% to 44.88 and Dollar Tree jumped 3.1% to 79.51. Gap (GPS) rose 2.1% to 24.15.Meanwhile, Apple edged up 0.8% to 120, extending its breakout past a 118.12 buy point to a 14-month high.A plan backed by Ryan and other House GOP leaders would raise more than $1 trillion by imposing a 20% tax on imports, while making exports tax-free and lowering the federal corporate tax rate to 20%.Trump, in an interview with the Wall Street Journal published Monday, took issue with Ryan's approach. Trump criticized the border-adjusted tax as ""too complicated"" and said it could result in ""a bad deal.""While prospects for corporate tax reform have been one of the key drivers of the Trump stock market rally, financial markets and Wall Street analysts see Ryan's border-adjusted tax as bad news for big importers, with retailers especially hard hit. RBC Capital Markets analyst Scott Ciccarelli found that a 20% import tax could wipe out profits at Best Buy and raise Wal-Mart's tax bill by close to $10 billion.While Apple stands to be the biggest beneficiary of a reduced tax rate on profits held overseas, UBS analyst Steve Milunovich has estimated that the company could actually see an earnings drop under the full House GOP approach. Not only would the company face a tax on the value of iPhones it imports to sell in the U.S., but the value of foreign earnings could shrink in dollar terms.IBD'S TAKE: The House GOP tax reform that Trump is considering would likely help foreigners holding U.S. stocks and hit U.S. investors in foreign investments, such as Alibaba's ADRs or overseas ETFs.Trump's chief problem with Ryan's plan appears to be the consensus that a 20% tax on all imports would lead to a significant appreciation of the dollar vs. other currencies. In weekend comments, he specifically called out China and its weakening currency.""Our companies can't compete with them now because our currency is too strong. And it's killing us,"" Trump said.Trump's comments sent the U.S. dollar index skidding 1.2%, while gold rose 1.6%. The 10-year Treasury yield fell to 2.33%, the lowest since late November, and closed below its 50-day moving average for the first time since late September.Trump has vowed to level the playing field for U.S.-based producers by imposing tariffs, threatening a 35% border tax on automakers producing in Mexico for the U.S. market.But he's skeptical of Ryan's approach because economists expect the 20% tax on imports to lead the U.S. dollar to appreciate vs. foreign currencies, neutralizing any competitive advantage from imposing an import tax.Trump's disagreement with Ryan raises a number of questions. If he doesn't back the border-adjusted tax plan, how will the GOP offset the cost of tax reform? Offsets are needed because legislation passed on a partisan basis in the Senate via reconciliation must be budget neutral after the 10th year.Further, does Trump's dismissal of Ryan's plan mean that he's more likely to make good on his threat to hit imports from Mexico and China with 35% to 45% tariffs? Such a fallback could pose even greater risks to retailers and Apple than the border adjustment tax.RELATED:Trump Trade, Tax Talk Hits Dollar As Mexico Warns On TariffsBank Stock Losses Intensify After Trump Rips GOP Tax Plan

168,BBY,"The retail stock swoon picked up on Friday after getting started late in the session on Thursday, when the White House appeared to offer the clearest sign yet that President Trump may embrace the House GOP border-tax plan that could sock retailers' earnings.Shares of Target (TGT) fell 0.7% to 63.70 on the stock market today, retreating intraday to their lowest since November 2014. Wal-Mart (WMT) slid 1.6% to 65.66, hitting an eight-month low. Other retailers that have bucked the sector's recent woes also got caught in the downdraft. Costco (COST) slipped 1.2%, while Best Buy (BBY) sank 3.9%, falling below its 50-day line.Department stores were among the hardest hit. JCPenney (JCP) tumbled 4.7% to a 1-year low while Macy's (M) lost 2.7% for its worst close since late 2011.Shares of Amazon (AMZN) were relatively unscathed, easing 0.3% to 836.30, just below a buy point. The online shopping giant is seen as less exposed to a border tax, partly because of its fast-growing web services business and partly because import taxes would be borne by Amazon sellers responsible for shipping goods to the company's fulfillment centers.According to the initial news reports on Thursday afternoon, White House press secretary Sean Spicer seemed to offer confirmation that Trump would adopt the House proposal for a 20% tax on imports. Spicer said that the wall Trump wants to build on the border with Mexico could be paid for with a 20% tax on imports from Mexico as part of the broad corporate tax reform package being developed.While the White House later clarified that the border tax was only one option being considered, that apparently did little to assuage investors' concerns. Despite unexpectedly slow annualized fourth-quarter GDP growth of 1.9% reported on Friday, major stock indexes were essentially flat in afternoon trading, suggesting that politics were behind the retail walloping.IBD'S TAKE: Big exporters like Boeing could have a negative tax rate under the GOP tax reform plan.Wal-Mart and Target officials pleaded their case in Capitol Hill meetings this week. The National Retail Federation is lobbying aggressively to block the tax, which it says could lead to an outright decline in consumer spending.Economists generally suggest that such fears are way overblown because appreciation of the dollar vs. other currencies should offset the 20% tax. Nevertheless, retailers that were hoping for a big boost to after-tax profits from tax reform are now giving off a sense of panic about how they may fare under the GOP plan.House Republicans have said they see the border-adjusted tax, which applies to imports but not exports, as a critical part of tax reform because it would raise more than $1 trillion to help pay for a reduction in the corporate rate to 20%.RELATED:Trump Backs 20% Import Tax To Pay For Border Wall — Or NotU.S. Economic Malaise Hits 11 Years: GDP Growth 1.6% In 2016Why Tax Reform Could End In Tears For Trump And GOPWhy Trump Tax Reform Could Hurt Alibaba, Other ADRs

169,BBY,"The Nasdaq composite led a broad advance in stocks on Thursday despite a big drop by former tech leader Cisco Systems (CSCO). Volume was mixed.Meanwhile, Apple (AAPL) showed resilience, giving back less than 0.2% after surging more than 2% on Wednesday. At 109.94, the biggest company by market value on either major U.S. exchange is still an arm's length away from potentially staging a re-breakout past a 110.33 cup with handle in a long bottoming base.Also positive for equities: recent breakouts are holding firm.The Nasdaq, which soared 3.8% last week, rose more than 0.7%, benefiting from strength not only in the tech sector but also airline, gaming, banking, financial, generic drug and hospital stocks.The S&P 500 gained 0.5% while the Dow Jones industrials lagged with a 0.2% lift. Volume rose on the Nasdaq and fell on the NYSE, according to preliminary data.The Russell 2000 rose nearly 0.6%.Nvidia (NVDA) continued its market-leading ways, but it cooled off a bit after rising to a new high of 94.79. The fabless designer of sophisticated chips to handle video graphics, machine learning and other data-intensive activity finished up 0.7% to 92.28.The IBD 50 and IBD Big Cap 20 name has gained more than 177% since breaking out past a 33.16 cup with handle buy point in heavy volume on March 18. Nvidia qualifies a large cap with a market value of $49 billion. In comparison, industry peer Intel (INTC) weighs in at $166 billion.Apple is up around 2% year to date, thus lagging the major indexes by a few percentage points. But for current shareholders, the iPhone giant and incredible winner from 2004 to 2012 has not triggered any sell signals lately. The stock's recent new uptrend remains intact.The bigger questions an investor should ask are:1) Will the stock stay trapped between its 50- and 200-day moving averages? (The 50-day line is painted in red in IBD charts, the 200-day in black.)2) Will its Accumulation/Distribution Rating, currently a poor D+ as seen in IBD Stock Checkup, improve over the next few weeks?And finally, 3) Does the company stand a good chance of beating Q1 profit views and reverse its three-quarter slide in earnings?Perhaps the excellent gain by Best Buy (BBY) is a good omen, since Apple sells a ton of iPads, Macbooks, and iPhones at the leading consumer electronics retail chain. Best Buy soared more than 14% to 46.34 in nearly five times normal volume following a 51% leap in fiscal third-quarter earnings to 62 cents a share, pounding views by more than 30%.Revenue rose 1% to $8.95 billion, ending a four-quarter streak of year-over-year declines or flat sales. Net margin rose 60 basis points to 2.2%.Best Buy is now sharply extended past a 40.68 base on base buy point. The RS Rating jumped to 94 from 87 in a single day thanks to Thursday's buying rush, and it indicates Best Buy has the potential to emerge as a new market leader.Elsewhere in the stock market today, Argan (AGX) continued to act right after a recent breakout past a 60.19 flat base buy point. The specialist in engineering, construction and telecom infrastructure rose 3% to 62.70 and is thus still in buy range.The 5% chase zone extends up to 63.19. Argan's initial breakout came on June 8 when shares blasted past a 35.50 early entry within a long saucer-type pattern.Notice how in the weekly chart of Argan (a daily chart is shown here), the two most recent down weeks in price came in light volume, a sign that eagerness to sell among institutional investors has waned.The Street sees FY 2017 profit jumping 50% to $3.62 a share, which would be an annual record.In the IBD 50, Applied Materials (AMAT) slipped 1% in after-hours trading following robust October-ended fiscal Q4 results that missed the Street's top-line forecast. The chipmaking gear titan reported accelerating revenue growth of 39% to $3.3 billion, just shy of the $3.31 billion consensus view.Earnings per share rose 128% to 66 cents a share, beating the 20-analyst consensus estimate of 65 cents by a penny. The results marked a third quarter in a row of accelerating growth, a typical sign of a stock market leader. Earnings per share dropped 4% in the quarter ended January 2016, then revved up 17% and 52% the next two quarters as revenue went from a 4% dip to flat sales, then 13% growth.Thursday's action in Applied Materials was bullish; the stock rose more than 2% to 30.73, just shy of a potential eight-week flat-base breakout at 31.17.As of Thursday, Applied ranked No. 45 in the IBD 50.Elsewhere, gym operator Planet Fitness (PLNT)dropped hard on a share offering announcement late Wednesday. The stock sank 4.6% to 23.01, but held up above a 22.25 cup-with-handle pivot point.Planet Fitness gained as much as 13% following last week's breakout. When a stock rises 10% or more from a proper buy point, it's key to defend the gain and not let it turn into a loss. One can always buy the stock back again when demand returns.Planet Fitness plans to sell 15 million common shares. That would narrow the gap between its current float of 31 million shares and 98 million total shares outstanding.RELATED:Did Trump's Election Victory Set The Stage For A  New Secular Bull Market?When Did Planet Fitness Break Out?A Big Earnings Jump For Applied Materials; So, What's Next?

173,BBY,"Boeing (BA) is going to bat for the BAT — the border adjustment tax that is a central part of the GOP plan to cut the corporate tax rate.The controversial Republican tax-reform plan, which would slap a 20% tax on imports but make exports tax-free, has gotten off to a rough start in the court of public opinion. The National Retail Federation has warned that it would raise prices and cause consumer spending to decline, while analysts have said that big importers like Wal-Mart (WMT), Target (TGT) and Best Buy (BBY) could suffer major hits to profitability.House Republicans, with the help of economists, have countered that an anticipated 20% appreciation of the dollar would neutralize those negative effects, while removing what they call a ""Made in America"" tax.Now big exporters including Boeing and General Electric (GE) are reportedly gearing up to help House Speaker Paul Ryan make that case, and it's not hard to understand why.Consider Boeing: The company paid an effective federal tax rate of 27.7% in 2015, when it had a current tax bill of $2.1 billion, but would have had negative tax liability under the House plan.In 2015, 59% of company revenue came from non-U.S. customers. Given that Boeing does almost all of its manufacturing and sourcing within the U.S., it has limited exposure to the 20% import tax. Meanwhile, the House GOP tax plan exempts exports from any tax. Companies would be taxed on their cash flow, basically the total cost of (non-imported) goods, labor and capital outlays minus U.S. revenue.In effect, Boeing's U.S. cash flow, as far as the GOP tax plan is concerned, would have been dramatically negative once its $56.7 billion in non-U.S. revenue was excluded.IBD'S TAKE: The House GOP tax reform that Trump is considering would likely help foreigners holding U.S. stocks and hit U.S. investors in foreign investments, such as Alibaba's ADRs or overseas ETFs.Morgan Stanley analysts wrote in December that some big exporters ""may pay little or no federal taxes — and may even accrue tax benefits in the form of net operating losses.""Yet some tax experts say the only way to make the House plan work as intended would be for the federal government to write a check to exporters with negative liability.The border adjustment tax would effectively become a trade barrier, doing more to keep out imports than to facilitate exports ""unless cash refunds were provided,"" wrote American Enterprise Institute scholar Alan Viard.William Gale, co-director of the Tax Policy Center, wrote that while it may create a ""serious optics problem"" for Treasury to write checks to big corporations, the issue is just one of perception. Because of the exchange-rate adjustment, the House plan shouldn't affect the after-tax profitability of either exporters or importers, he wrote.President Trump initially sounded wary of Ryan's tax reform approach, calling it ""too complicated"" and the wrong medicine for a dollar that is already ""too strong."" But he may have put those concerns aside: White House spokesman Sean Spicer said Thursday that Trump would pay to build a wall on the Mexican border with funds generated by a 20% border tax as part of tax reform. But White House chief of staff Reince Priebus later said a 20% tax is just one option.The outcome of this rhetorical and political battle may be critical in deciding whether Trump can deliver on his plan to cut the corporate tax rate to a range of 15% to 20% from a statutory rate of 35%, among the world's highest. Without the $1.1 trillion in revenue that would come from the border-adjusted tax, analysts say a tax rate of 25% may be the best Trump can do.Boeing shares fell fractionally to close at 167.70 Friday on the stock market today. But they're up nearly 6% for the week, hitting new highs after the aerospace giant topped earnings views.RELATED:President Trump Backs 20% Import Tax To Pay For Border Wall, Aide SaysWal-Mart, Best Buy, Apple Rally After Trump Pans GOP Border Adjustment Tax

174,BBY,"After vowing a border tax, then calling it ""too complicated,"" then saying it was still being considered, President Trump told a group of CEOs Monday that the U.S. will incentivize domestic production and impose a ""very major"" tax on goods that American companies produce overseas.During a meeting with a manufacturing advisory group, Trump also reiterated pledges to slash regulations and income taxes.Afterward, Ford (F) CEO Mark Fields told reporters the meeting was positive. The carmaker had earlier canceled plans to build a new plant in Mexico. While Trump criticized Ford during the campaign for making cars there, the company said canceling the plant was due to lack of demand for small cars.Others at the meeting included CEOs of Tesla Motors (TSLA), Under Armour (UA), Lockheed Martin (LMT), Arconic (ARNC), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and U.S. Steel (X). The advisory panel is led by Dow Chemical's (DOW) CEO.Shares of Ford closed down 0.4% on the stock market today. General Motors (GM) and Fiat Chrysler (FCAU), which also have Mexico operations but recently pledged major U.S. investments, fell 1% and rose 2.7%, respectively. The CEOs of the three carmakers will also meet with Trump Tuesday at the White House. Tesla relies on a U.S.-based factory for final production and rallied 1.7%.Retail giant Wal-Mart (WMT), which relies heavily on imports, finished 0.8% lower, and Target (TGT) lost 0.4%.IBD'S TAKE: The House GOP tax reform that Trump is considering would likely help foreigners holding U.S. stocks and hit U.S. investors in foreign investments, such as Alibaba's ADRs or overseas ETFs.In an interview published last Monday, Trump told the Wall Street Journal the border-adjusted tax plan was ""too complicated"" and could result in ""a bad deal,"" sending shares of Wal-Mart, Best Buy (BBY) and Macy's (M) higher.The next day, Trump told Axios the border tax, which is a key element in the congressional GOP's tax strategy, is ""certainly something that's going to be discussed.""RELATED:Wal-Mart, Best Buy, Apple Rally After Trump Pans GOP Border Adjustment TaxTrump Trade, Tax Talk Hits Dollar As Mexico Warns On Tariffs Wal-Mart, Target, Macy's Drop Amid Tariff Talk: Investing Action Plan

175,BBY,"Online shoppers are swarming to Amazon.com (AMZN) this holiday season and the e-commerce giant has gained share vs. Best Buy (BBY), Wal-Mart (WMT) and Apple (AAPL), says market research firm Slice Intelligence.But Amazon and the other FANG stocks — Facebook (FB), Netflix (NFLX) and Alphabet (GOOGL), the parent company of Google — mostly fell in the stock market today, while Apple rose a small fraction.Slice late Thursday said some 45.5% of consumer online spending went to Amazon in the week ended Dec. 17, up from 42.3% the previous week.Best Buy had 2.9% of online spending, with Wal-Mart and Apple both at 2.6%, says the market tracker.Slice Intelligence says electronics, as usual, are the top product category, followed by apparel. Apple orders had the highest average price tag at $350.IBD'S TAKE: Apple and most of the FANG stocks are showing weak relative strength vs. the broader market. True market leaders show rising RS lines. To find stocks with RS lines hitting new highs, take a free MarketSmith trial.Amazon may be getting a boost from improved logistics, with the average package for all online sellers arriving in just three days, compared to five days in 2015.Morgan Stanley, in a research report, says Amazon's fast-growing Prime membership will also likely drive a strong holiday season.Apple and the FANG stocks have largely sat out the stock market rally since Republican Donald Trump's surprise election as president. Investors have poured money into other sectors expected to benefit from infrastructure spending, lighter regulation and tax cuts.A strong holiday season could help Amazon stock, which touched a low of 719 on Nov. 14.

Amazon stock has been consolidating and trades near its 50-day moving average with a buy point of 847.31.Apple stock has formed a cup pattern and is nearing a buy point of 118.79. Apple stock edged up 0.2% Friday to 116.52.Netflix remains on the IBD Leaderboard of top-performing stocks.

176,BBY,"The holidays were happy ones for Amazon.com (AMZN), which says that its very own hardware products, led by the Echo Dot, were its best-selling products.Following the Echo Dot, Amazon said the best-selling products over the holiday season overall were the Fire TV Stick, the Fire Tablet and the Amazon Echo.Amazon says it has sold ""millions"" of the Echo Dot since its introduction. The Echo Dot, which costs $49.99, is the low-end version of the Amazon Echo, which sells for $179.99. The Echo, including Dot, is a voice activated, Wi-Fi-connected smart speaker linked to the cloud. With the voice of the artificially intelligent Alexa, Echo serves up music, news, traffic and weather, plays games, answers questions and does much more.Amazon stock was up 1.5% near 772 in afternoon trading in the stock market today, just below its 50-day moving average.The Amazon Echo, a similar device by the Google unit of Alphabet (GOOGL) and another being developed by Microsoft (MSFT) are expected to play a key role in the smart home. Alphabet recently followed Amazon with the introduction of Google Home, which sells for $129. Google Home is a voice-activated speaker powered by Google Allo, its artificially intelligent assistant.IBD'S TAKE: The battle to provide the best digital butler for homes is one that Amazon and other tech leaders will be fighting for years. These in-home devices with artificial intelligence and language processing skills could evolve into the next major disruption in computing and put the smart home on a fast track.Microsoft has yet to introduce a similar device for the home, but it has deep roots in artificial intelligence with its Cortana platform, available on mobile devices and PCs. This is also true of Apple with its Siri platform and Facebook (FB) with its Messenger platform.Microsoft last week gave a sneak peak at a new hardware device that looks similar to Echo. The device has the Harman (HAR) label but is voice-controlled through Cortana.Among other top-selling products on Amazon over the holiday sales period were memory cards from Western Digital (WDC)-owned SanDisk, wearable technology from Garmin (GRMN), Samsung TVs, Levi's and Spalding basketballs.Online shoppers swarmed to Amazon this holiday season. The the e-commerce leader has gained share vs. Best Buy (BBY), Wal-Mart (WMT) and Apple (AAPL).Amazon said more than 72% of Amazon customers worldwide shopped using a mobile device this holiday.RELATED:Amazon Introduces 'Amazon Go' Retail Stores, No Checkout, No LinesAmazon Set To Disrupt Retailers In Apparel, Groceries, ServicesApple, Microsoft, Alphabet Are Kings Of Cash As Tech Sector Rules

177,BBY,"The U.S. economy expanded at a 3.2% annual rate in the third quarter, the Commerce Department said Tuesday. That's the strongest growth since the second quarter of 2014 and revised up slightly from the initial reading of a 2.9% gain.Economists had expected a 3.1% revised reading.Consumer spending rose at a 2.8% pace, faster than the initial reading of 2.1%. .Separately, the Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index shot up 8.5 points in November to 107.1, the highest since July 2007 and much better than views for a rise to 101. The reading, which reflects post-election sentiment, showed consumers are more upbeat about current and future conditions for business and jobs.Together with the GDP data, the report bodes well for consumers' willingness to spend this holiday season.Initial readings on holiday spending have been mixed. In-store sales over the Thanksgiving weekend fell particularly sharply, though that partly reflects a shift to online shopping and retailers offering deals throughout November and December.Online holiday sales are booming, growing even stronger than expected. That should be good news for Amazon (AMZN), which has outstripped e-commerce growth in recent years. But Target (TGT), Best Buy (BBY), Wal-Mart (WMT) and other retailers are putting more effort than ever on online sales.IBD'S TAKE: Stock markets have rallied on hopes for Trump's tax and spending plans, but here's why economists are wary of Trumpnomics.Apple (AAPL) products have been big sellers, with Target and Best Buy offering deep discounts on Apple iPads. Samsung 4K TVs have also been hot.Business investment on structures was revised up sharply, though spending on equipment and software was revised down. Net exports boomed in Q3, though largely on soybean exports. Residential investment was revised to a smaller 4.4% decline.Meanwhile, the S&P/Case-Schiller 20-city home price index for September rose 0.4% vs. August, matching economists' expectations. Home values ros 5.1% vs. a year earlier, just below forecasts for 5.2%.The Case-Schiller index is considered one of the most comprehensive for home prices, but it is backward looking. Even's September's data will reflect a three-month moving average.Meanwhile, mortgage rates rose along with Treasury yields in recent months, especially after the presidential election. Investors are betting on Federal Reserve rate hikes and perhaps higher inflation.Apple shares fell 0.1% on the stock market today, still trading modestly below their 50-day moving average. Amazon slid 0.55%, also finding resistance at the 50-day line. Target, Best Buy and Wal-Mart rose less than 1%.On Thursday, the Institute for Supply Management will release its November manufacturing index, while automakers will release U.S. sales figures.

179,BBY,"Will it be a blue Christmas for consumer electronics vendors?Recent downbeat guidance from Fitbit (FIT) and GoPro (GPRO) points to a crummy holiday season for those gadget makers. The big question is whether other consumer electronics vendors will end up with coal in their stockings this quarter.Consumer electronics is a top sales category for the holidays. And it could be that Fitbit wearable activity trackers and GoPro action cameras have simply fallen out of favor with shoppers.As retailers and device makers prepare for the traditional kickoff of the holiday selling season on Black Friday, analysts are placing their bets on what the big gadgets will be this Christmas.Consumer electronics retailer Best Buy (BBY) likely will provide some commentary on what it sees as big sellers in the December quarter, when it releases fiscal third-quarter earnings on Thursday before the market open.IBD'S TAKE: Institutional money was rotating into new sectors after a wacky few days for stock markets following Donald Trump's surprise presidential win, but one thing remained constant: Facebook continued to be an IBD Leaderboard stock. This is the place to go to find leading stocks, which includes the social network leader even though a 5.6% drop on Nov. 3 triggered a sell signal for some investors. But it's more complex than that, as Leaderboard can explain.This past Thursday, Best Buy revealed its Thanksgiving weekend door-buster specials designed to entice consumers to come to its stores. It's offering steep discounts on 4K ultrahigh-definition televisions from the likes of LG, Samsung and Sony (SNE); ultraportable notebook PCs from Microsoft (MSFT), HP (HPQ) and others; and video game consoles bundled with software.The Consumer Technology Association predicts that U.S. holiday spending — covering all of November and December — on tech products will rise 3.1% this year to $36.05 billion, after rising just 1.4% last year.CTA Chief Economist Shawn DuBravac told IBD that retailers and consumer electronics makers waited until after the presidential election to begin advertising for the holiday season.The most popular tech item on holiday shopping lists this year is headphones, driven by the shift to wireless audio devices, DuBravac said. Other desired tech gifts include laptops, TVs, smartphones, tablets and video game consoles.Some 40% of shoppers plan to buy headphones as gifts this holiday season, according to a CTA survey.Apple (AAPL) has helped fuel the move to wireless headsets with its bold decision not to include an analog audio port on its iPhone 7 smartphones. It is selling Beats brand wireless headphones and will soon debut its AirPods wireless earbuds.Several vendors are looking to take on Bose this holiday in the subcategory of noise-canceling wireless headphones, Marjorie Costello, editor and publisher of Consumer Electronics Online News, told IBD.Bose released its QuietComfort 35 headphones for $349 in June. Sony followed in September with its MDR 1000X headphones for $399. And Plantronics (PLT) released its BackBeat Pro 2 headphones for $199 in October.""Those are not inexpensive gifts, but they're really good gifts to give anyone who travels,"" Costello said. Headphones are a no-brainer gift ""because everyone has ears,"" she said.Emerging product categories likely to see a boost in sales this year are drones, virtual reality headsets and smart home devices, DuBravac said.The CTA predicts about 1.2 million drones will be sold this holiday season, up 112% over 2015. That's despite the fact that GoPro issued a product recall and stopped sales of its just-released Karma drone. Market leader DJI is likely to benefit from consumer demand for flying-camera drones, such as its Mavic Pro quadcopter.The trade group forecasts sales of 700,000 VR headsets this holiday season. Those include premium VR headsets from Sony and Facebook's (FB) Oculus unit, as well as lower-cost smartphone-based headsets from Samsung and Alphabet (GOOGL)-owned Google.But NPD analyst Stephen Baker expects VR headset sales will be ""lukewarm"" this holiday season. ""VR will elicit a tepid response from consumers,"" he said in a report.The CTA also is looking for higher sales of smart-home devices this season, including voice-activated digital assistants such as Amazon.com's (AMZN) Echo and Google Home.Voice-enabled smart speakers that can play music on command, answer spoken questions and perform other tasks will be in high demand this holiday, NPD's Baker said.Ultra HD, or 4K, televisions will dominate Black Friday and Thanksgiving weekend sales, Baker said. Such TVs, led by sales of sets with screen sizes of 55 inches and larger, will account for 60% of TV dollars spent this holiday, he said.Holiday shipments of 4K TVs in the U.S. are expected to reach 4.5 million units, the CTA said. The trade group predicts full-year sales of 4K TVs will rise 40% over 2015 to hit 10 million units.PC sales, meanwhile, will be the best in at least four years this holiday as consumers upgrade to sleek new models, Baker said.Among product categories likely to disappoint this holiday is wearables, Baker said.""While prices for wearables may begin to decrease (especially in the fitness segment where competition is growing), expect a slight slowdown in sales as consumer interest fades,"" Baker said. That would be bad news for market leader Fitbit, which provided weak Q4 guidance.Another category facing a slowdown is action cameras, a market dominated by GoPro with its Hero cameras. The market for wearable sports cameras has matured and sales overall are poised to decline, DuBravac said.Other new products hoping to make a splash this holiday season are Snapchat's Spectacles, $130 sunglasses with a built-in camera; Apple's second-generation Apple Watch with new fitness features; and upgraded versions of existing game consoles, including Microsoft's Xbox One S and Sony's PlayStation 4 Pro and PS4 Slim.RELATED:Google Home To Overtake Amazon's Smart Echo By 2020: IHSSony PlayStation VR Aims To Make Virtual Reality MainstreamTeens Stoked About iPhone 7, But GoPro Is So Yesterday

There also is interest in smartwatches (3%), VR headsets (2%), home robotic vacuums (2%) and portable GPS (2%), CTA said.Best Buy (BBY) signaled strong holiday tech sales when it reported better-than-expected fiscal third-quarter results last week. The consumer-electronics retailer was helped in Q3 by the launch of Apple's iPhone 7 and robust sales of 4K TVs and home theater systems.Discount retailer Target (TGT) also pointed to a merry holiday season ahead with its third-quarter report last week.On a conference call with analysts, Target CEO Brian Cornell said the retailer saw ""a meaningful improvement in sales of Apple products, driven by their introduction of several new product innovations"" last quarter.Mark Tritton, Target's chief merchandising officer, sees the Apple momentum continuing this quarter.""In electronics this quarter, we're planning for strong demand for Apple's new products,"" he said on the call. ""We're also expecting a lot of guest interest in virtual reality, along with connected home devices like Google Home.""Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google Home is a smart speaker that answers spoken questions and plays music on command. It competes with Amazon.com's (AMZN) market-leading Echo devices.Consumer Intelligence Research Partners on Monday estimated that Amazon has sold 5.1 million Echo devices in the U.S. since the product debuted in late 2014.

188,BBY,"The overall 0.6% bounceback in retail sales last month comes with a caveat: Total spending looked healthy, but much of the gain came in categories that may not drive growth going forward.A core measure of goods spending that strips out restaurants, cars and gas, as well as building materials, rose just 0.1% in September. That was well below the 0.4% gain expected by economists and came after a 0.1% decline in this broad ""control group"" category of retail spending.Sales at electronics and appliance stores like Best Buy (BBY) remained a sore spot. Despite the midmonth launch of the Apple (AAPL) iPhone 7, seasonally adjusted sales fell 0.9% from August and 3.8% from a year ago. Best Buy shares fell 1.3% on the stock market today but are still near 52-week highs. Apple is near 2016 highs amid strong initial iPhone 7 demand and rival Samsung's overheating problems with its Note 7, which finally prompted the company to end sales and production of the smartphone.Slumping demand for PCs and printers led Hewlett-Packard (HP) on Thursday to announce a gradual reduction of 3,000 to 4,000 jobs. Electronics retailers also are being squeezed by the likes of Amazon (AMZN). Nonstore retailers saw September sales rise 0.3% from August after a 0.1% dip the prior month. Though online sales momentum has cooled a bit in the past few months, nonstore retailers still are posting double-digit year-over-year gains — 10.6% in September.Department store sales slid 0.7% from August and 6.4% from a year ago. Some of the slide reflects store closures. Still, analysts at Sterne Agee downgraded shares of Macy's (M) to neutral from buy on Friday, noting a slowdown in same-store sales growth. JPMorgan cut price targets and Q3 estimates on Macy's, JCPenney (JCP), Kohl's (KSS), Nordstrom (JWN) and Dillard's (DDS).Macy's, Kohl's shares fell about 3% Friday while Dillard's skidded 4.6%. Kohl's and Nordstom fell fractionally.Everything to do with the housing market shined in September. Sales at building materials and garden equipment stores like Home Depot (HD) surged 1.4% from August, more than reversing a 0.8% decline the prior month. Meanwhile, furniture store sales rose 1.0% from August and 2.7% from a year ago.Home Depot shares rose 0.1%.One of the surprises in the retail report was the strong gain in spending at food service and drinking places, up 0.8% from August, when sales rose 0.7%. Sales have moderated on a year-over-year basis to 6.1% from the 8%-plus pace that prevailed for most of 2015. Still, the gains over the past two months are a pleasant surprise given that McDonald's (MCD), Wendy's (WEN), Jack in the Box (JACK) and others have cited pressure from the growing cost gap between eating in and eating out.McDonald's stock fell 1.1%, while Wendy's and Jack in the Box rose fractionally.IBD'S TAKE: The Retail-Restaurants industry group is ranked in the lower tier by IBD, No. 113 out of 197 based on share performance. Investors will generally have more success buying leaders in top-tier groups, when the market trend is favorable. Sill, Papa Johns and Dunkin' Brands, are close to buy points and worth watching. Go to IBD Stock Checkup to find out why they're the two top stocks in the group.September restaurant sales data out Thursday from TDn2K covering 25,000 locations shed further light on industry trends. Overall, same-store sales fell 1.1% from a year ago in September, while customer traffic slumped 3.5%. The sector is on pace for its worst performance since 2009.Still, overall sales are performing better than same-store sales because of continued industry expansion, and the quick-service industry is doing a whole lot better than the rest, growing same-store sales 2.2% from a year ago in the third quarter, Nation's Restaurant News reported.On Friday, Bank of America analysts upgraded Domino's Pizza (DPZ) to buy from underperform, noting that the research firm expects 10.4% U.S. same-store sales growth in the third quarter. Domino's reports on Tuesday before the open. Domino's rose 0.5%.Auto sales jumped 1.1% in September, as U.S. vehicle sales rose to a 17.76 million annual rate from 17 million the prior month. Sales of higher-margin pickups and SUVs outperformed at Ford (F), General Motors (GM) and Fiat Chrysler (FCAU), helping offset their unit sales declines vs. a year ago.""The decline in gasoline prices relative to a year ago is likely to continue to support SUV sales,"" wrote Jefferies economists Ward McCarthy and Thomas Simons. ""Nonetheless, overall vehicle sales are at a level that may be close to a ceiling.""Ford shares closed unchanged. GM rallied 1.1% and Fiat Chrysler shares 2.3%.Gas station sales helped pump up the overall retail sales gain, rising 2.4% from August. McCarthy and Simons noted that the big rise was based on seasonal adjustments: Gas prices fell in 0.8% in September, but they usually fall 2.8% during the month after the peak summer driving season.RELATED:Off The Charts: Fast Food Inflation Vs.

189,BBY,"Retail sales rose 0.6% in September, despite not much help from launch of the Apple (AAPL) iPhone 7, the Commerce Department reported Friday.Sales hit the consensus forecast of a 0.6% rise overall and a 0.5% gain outside the auto sector.Last month's report, which showed that nonauto sales fell 0.1% in August, was revised to a 0.2% decline.After consumer spending slowed over the summer, a healthy recovery isn't expected to affect the Federal Reserve's timetable for rate hikes — one in December and two next year.The retail sales report reflected and shed light on evolving industry dynamics.Auto sales hit the gas in September, rising to a 17.76 million annual rate from 17 million the prior month. While unit sales dropped from a year ago at Ford (F), General Motors (GM) and Fiat Chrysler (FCAU), sales of higher-margin pickups and SUVs performed relatively well.Sales from nonstore retailers led by Amazon (AMZN) rose 0.3% from August and 10.6% from a year ago following a rare 0.1% drop the prior month that was possibly an aftereffect of Amazon Prime Day in July.IBD'S TAKE: Health and personal care retailers have seen 7.8% year-over-year sales growth, strongest outside of nonstore retailers. Ulta Beauty, an IBD 50 stock, boosted sales and earnings forecasts on Thursday and saw its shares surge above a seven-week consolidation zone.Sales at electronics and appliance stores such as Best Buy (BBY) fell 0.9% despite the iPhone launch in mid-September. Best Buy shares are trading near 52-week highs. Apple is near 2016 highs after strong initial iPhone 7 demand and again this month as Samsung faced repeated overheating problems with its Note 7, finally deciding to end sales and production of the smartphone.Sales at food service and drinking places had been decelerating, as fast-food chains like McDonald's (MCD) cite pressure from the growing cost gap between eating in and eating out.

Interactive Entertainment, ""DriveClub VR"" and ""RIGS Mechanized Combat League"" from SIE Worldwide Studios, and ""Rez Infinite"" from Monstars & Enhance Games. Sony expects to have about 50 VR games available by year-end.Sony's VR system is cheaper than PC-connected headsets offered by Facebook's (FB) Oculus and HTC. Sony's headset costs $400 compared with $600 for Oculus Rift and $800 for HTC Vive.Sony has a leg up on its rivals because the PS VR is compatible with the more than 40 million PS4 systems already in consumers' homes. The Oculus and HTC systems require high-end personal computers, which aren't as prevalent.""We believe PS VR has the power to make VR gaming a reality for the mainstream, and the impact that PS VR will have on the future of both games and entertainment will be transformative,"" Shawn Layden, president of Sony Interactive Entertainment America and chairman of SIE Worldwide Studios, said in a statement.Virtual reality systems are designed to make players feel like they are inside the world of a video game by using surround video and audio.Sony's U.S. shares finished 1.7% higher at 33.27 on the stock market today.Upcoming games for the Sony PS VR include ""Resident Evil 7: Biohazard"" from Capcom, ""Star Wars Battlefront: Rogue One X-wing VR Mission"" from Electronic Arts (EA), and ""Star Trek: Bridge Crew"" from Ubisoft.Last week, research firm IHS Markit predicted that Sony will sell 1.4 million PlayStation VR headsets this year, but will be supply constrained.Video game market research firm SuperData Research forecasts that Sony will sell 2.6 million PS VR units by year-end.RELATED:Virtual-Reality Headset Sales To Soar With Sony PlayStation VR Launch

191,BBY,"The launch next week of Sony's (SNE) PlayStation VR system is going to give the fledgling virtual-reality headset market a shot of adrenaline.Research firm IHS Technology predicted Thursday that PlayStation VR will outsell HTC Vive and Facebook's (FB) Oculus Rift combined in 2016, but also will be supply-constrained as the company plays it safe on stock inventory.PlayStation VR works with Sony's market-leading PlayStation 4 video game console, so it has an established market to sell into. By contrast, HTC Vive and Oculus Rift require users to own a high-end PC.Sony will begin selling PlayStation VR on Oct. 13. The headset costs $400. A bundle with the headset, two PlayStation Move motion controllers, a PlayStation camera and PlayStation VR Worlds game disc costs $500.IBD'S TAKE: Sony could use another hit product. Sony stock has a middling IBD Composite Rating of 45. It ranks No. 7 out of 10 companies in IBD's Consumer Products-Electronic industry group. To see which company leads the group, visit the IBD Stock Checkup.Consumer electronics retailer Best Buy (BBY) is holding launch events at about 350 stores nationwide. Stores will sell PlayStation VR starting at 12:01 a.m. ET next Thursday, 9:01 p.m. Wednesday PT.The installed base of PS4 consoles is expected to reach 53 million by year-end, compared with 16 million VR-ready consumer PCs, IHS said. PlayStation VR also is cheaper than Oculus Rift, which costs $600 for the headset alone.IHS forecasts that Sony will sell 1.4 million PlayStation VR headsets this year and will generate $134 million in spending on VR entertainment content. IHS predicts that PC-based headsets will generate $69 million in spending on VR entertainment this year.""Sony is well-positioned to build an early lead in the high-end VR headset race because of its large addressable market of 53 million PS4s by the end of 2016, its lower total cost of ownership compared to the PC VR companies and its ability to get big franchises into VR,"" IHS analyst Piers Harding-Rolls said in a statement. ""With VR content and users strongly aligned with the games market, Sony already has in place many of the components necessary to deliver to this new VR entertainment segment at the expense of its competitors.""U.S.-traded shares of Sony fell a fraction to 32.72 on the stock market today. On Sept. 22, Sony stock touched its highest price since March 2011, at 34.17.Meanwhile, low-end VR headsets that use smartphones for their displays will be major unit-volume drivers in the VR market.Aggressive promotional activity from smartphone vendors and new smartphone VR systems, such as Google's Daydream View, will push the total installed base of VR headsets from 4 million units last year to 81 million in 2020, IHS said.Consumer spending on VR headsets will be $1.6 billion in 2016, bolstered heavily by the launch of high-end headsets from Oculus, HTC and Sony. In 2020, consumer spending on VR headsets will reach $7.9 billion, IHS predicted.Spending on VR games and videos is seen rising from $310 million in 2016 to $3.3 billion in 2020, IHS said. High-end VR systems will sell the most content, the firm said.""There will be a polarization of the VR market between lower-volume premium VR headsets, which will have strong paid-content conversion rates, and higher-volume cheaper smartphone VR headsets, which will monetize content at a lower rate,"" Harding-Rolls said.Smartphone VR headsets will make up 87% of the VR installed base by year's end, the research firm said.Samsung's Gear VR is the biggest product in the smartphone-based VR market today. Alphabet (GOOGL) expects to make a splash with its Daydream View, which will be available for preorder on Oct. 20 for $79. The Daydream was among the hardware products Alphabet unveiled Tuesday.IHS forecasts Samsung's Gear VR to have the largest installed base out of all the major branded headsets in 2016 with 5.4 million units. Google's Daydream View, however, will slowly disrupt Samsung's dominant position in the smartphone-VR market, it said.RELATED:Review: Sony delivers worthy virtual-reality experienceBatman, 'Battlezone' and brainteasers lead Sony VR lineupFacebook, Sony Lead Virtual Reality Stock Picks In Nomura Report

192,BBY,"U.S. stock indexes suffered routine losses Friday afternoon as the market neared its final hour of trade.The Nasdaq slouched 0.2%, while the S&P 500 matched that loss. The blue chip Dow Jones industrial average was flat, but the small cap Russell 2000 dropped 0.7%. Volume in the stock market today was running slightly higher on the NYSE and slightly lower on the Nasdaq.The Dow Jones utility average delivered one of the day's better gains, up 0.6%. A weaker than expected payrolls report might have helped the dividend-paying utilities, but the utilities were also due for some kind of rebound.Consolidated Edison (ED) had dropped 10 sessions in a row, making Friday's gain a trivial triumph. Southern Co. (SO) fell nine sessions in a row, and it too rose Friday. The two utilities rose about 2% and 1% respectively but then reversed to nominal gains.Among IBD's 197 industry groups, five of the day's nine top gainers were from retail or the related apparel makers groups.Gap (GPS), the owner of the namesake and Old Navy chains, thrust 15% as it retook its 200-day and 50-day lines in huge volume. September sales were a bit more than expected. Francesca's (FRAN), another retailer in the same apparel/shoes group, popped 2%. The stock cleared a 16.30 buy point in an awkward pattern. Volume was below average.Other retailers doing well included department store Nordstrom (JWN), which added to Thursday's breakout; Best Buy (BBY), which climbed closer to an entry in a flat base; apparel maker PVH Corp. (PVH), which padded a recent breakout; and big box retailer PriceSmart (PSMT), which advanced 3% as it tries to build the right side of a pattern.On the downside, the day's worst performer was Food-Meat Products. Allegations that the poultry industry conspired since 2007 to fix prices rattled the group. Tyson Foods (TSN) dropped 9%; Sanderson Farms (SAFM), 6%; and Pilgrim's Pride (PPC), 5%.RELATEDU.S. Added Just 156,000 Jobs In September; Won't Change FedOil Rig Count Rises, But Texas Plays See Dips

195,BBY,"Action-camera maker GoPro (GPRO) is set to unveil its Karma drone on Monday, but many observers are wondering if the company will price itself out of the fast-growing market.Karma is expected to cost more than $500 without a camera, bringing the price of a GoPro flying-camera system to $900 to $1,000, Dougherty analyst Charles Anderson said in a research report Tuesday. Karma will debut at a time when the growth driver for the market is expected to be drones with 4K cameras costing $500 or less, he said.IBD'S TAKE: GoPro stock carries a poor IBD Composite Rating of 12, meaning it has been outperformed by 88% of stocks in key metrics over the past 12 months. It ranks No. 10 out of 11 companies in IBD's Computer Products-Electronic industry group. To see which company leads the group, check out the IBD Stock Checkup.At last week's InterDrone trade show in Las Vegas, industry officials were mixed on GoPro's prospects in the drone market, Anderson said.""Some in the industry felt as though GoPro would not be competitive with the likes of the Yuneec Breeze and the DJI Mavic given an expectation that the Karma will be $500-plus without an attached camera,"" Anderson said in the report. ""Others felt as though GoPro's brand, distribution and installed base of drone-ready cameras would be enough to give it a strong initial ramp.""A major trend at InterDrone 2016 was the emergence of the sub-$500 consumer drone with 4K video, Anderson said.Yuneec showed off its $499 Breeze drone, which is controlled by a smartphone app as opposed to an expensive joystick common in the industry.""The Breeze struck us as the most consumer-friendly drone we've ever seen and includes multiple semiautonomous modes including 'follow me' and 'selfie mode' — whereby users set a certain height and distance from the themselves and the drone levitates on its own,"" Anderson said.Market leader DJI is expected to debut its low-cost Mavic drone this month.Yuneec is going to get as much as 10 feet of shelf space for its products at Best Buy (BBY) this holiday and the drone category will get nearly 30 feet total at Best Buy stores, Anderson said.Also at the InterDrone show, video processor maker Ambarella (AMBA) continued to be the industry standard on 4K drones, with Qualcomm (QCOM) lagging far behind, Anderson said.Dougherty rates GoPro and Ambarella stocks as neutral. GoPro stock rose 2.1%, to 13.07, in the stock market today. Shares hit a seven-month high of 16.25 on Aug. 15. Ambarella stock was up 2.4% to 67.43. Shares touched a nearly one-year high just shy of 73 on Aug. 31.GoPro may use its Karma unveiling to also launch its Hero 5 action camera and possibly a handheld gimbal accessory, Oppenheimer analyst Andrew Uerkwitz said in a report Tuesday.He rates GoPro stock as perform and expects the company's products to face a lot of competition for consumer spending this holiday season. GoPro's cameras and drones will compete not only with similar products, but also with virtual-reality headsets, wearables, video game consoles and new smartphones.RELATED:Why The Next Apple Could Come From A Drone WildcatterWhat It's Like To Quit Your Job To Be A Competitive Drone RacerWhat's Next For Drones?

That's up from its previous range of 11 to 13, suggesting strong interest from big investors.That translates to a market valuation of about $1.7 billion, which is below the $2 billion valuation placed on the company from a 2014 funding round that gave it unicorn status. Unicorn is a term used for privately held companies with a valuation of at least $1 billion.The biggest unicorns, such as Uber and Snapchat, get the most buzz, but Nutanix also has received a fair amount of attention. The company pioneered a field called hyperconvergence infrastructure, a market that research firm IDC estimates could reach $5 billion in 2019, up from $2 billion this year.Nutanix provides an enterprise cloud platform that converges traditional silos of servers, virtualization software and storage into one integrated solution.

197,BBY,"Federal Reserve chief Janet Yellen said the case for a rate hike is stronger now, but investors weren't sure what to make of that. Pfizer (PFE) paid $14 billion for a one-drug biotech, but shares of drugs and pharma supply chain companies sold off as Mylan's (MYL) EpiPen price hikes drew outrage. Best Buy (BBY) earnings surprised investors, while dollar stores came under pressure.For the week, the Nasdaq fell 0.4%, the S&P 500 0.7% and the Dow 0.8%. The major averages are still in sideways action. Drug stocks were big movers on Pfizer's Medivation (MDVN) deal and Mylan's EpiPen furor. Dollar stores suffered heavy losses as competition from Wal-Mart (WMT) was heating up.Fed Chair Janet Yellen said at Friday's long-awaited speech that the case for an interest rate hike has ""strengthened in recent months."" That followed other modestly hawkish statements from fellow Fed policymakers. However, Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer said Yellen's comments were consistent with a September rate increase. He saw the possibility of two rate hikes this year. Markets had already priced a Fed move, perhaps in December, but they don't expect any quick follow-upNew-home sales soared to a 654,000 annual rate in July, by far the highest since October 2007, the Commerce Department reported. The 12% rise from June surprised economists looking for a slight dip to 580,000. Luxury homebuilder Toll Bros. (TOL) confirmed that the high end of the market is prospering, reporting a 69% jump in third-quarter earnings per share, a 23.5% rise in revenue and a strong backlog of orders. Existing-home sales fell more than expected in July, though that was from June's cycle high. But applications for loans to buy a home fell to a six-month low. Toll shares soared to a seven-month high, moving above their 200-day moving average.The generic drugmaker Mylan sold off 11.55% for the week as members of the Senate and other politicians started inquiring into its price increases on its emergency allergy drug/device EpiPen. That fueled selling in drug and biotech stocks. Mylan CEO Heather Bresch, daughter of Sen. Joe Machin, D-W.V., said only a fraction of the $608 list price makes it back to Mylan, due to all the middlemen, leading shares of Express Scripts (ESRX), CVS Health (CVS) and AmerisourceBergen (ABC) to fall as well.Big pharma Pfizer agreed to buy Medivation for $14 billion in cash, snatching the cancer-drug specialist from Sanofi (SNY), which had been trying for months to acquire Medivation. Biotechs rallied Monday on the news, with BioMarin Pharmaceutical (BMRN) jumping on rumors that it was Sanofi's second choice of target. On Wednesday, Pfizer agreed to buy the antibiotics business of AstraZeneca (AZN) for $725 million plus possible future milestone and sales payments and royalties that could amount to $850 million.Oil prices may be settling into a trading range in the mid to high $40 range. OPEC members gave conflicting signals over whether they might support a production freeze, while Goldman Sachs said such a move would not ""be sufficient to support prices much further.""

214,BBY,"Best Buy (BBY) rose as much as 16% in early trading after posting second-quarter results that topped analysts' estimates, boosting confidence that Chief Executive Hubert Joly can return the largest U.S. electronics retailer to consistent growth.Profit was 57 cents a share, excluding some items, the Richfield, Minn.-based company said Tuesday in a statement. Analysts projected 43 cents, on average. The stock climbed as high as $38.06 before the start of regular trading in New York.The results signal that Joly may finally be turning around the chain after years of sluggish growth. Though online competition and a weakening electronics industry have made it tough to boost revenue, Joly has kept Best Buy profitable by selling foreign divisions and cutting costs.The company even managed to eke out a sales gain last quarter, helped by rising demand for wearable technology, appliances and home-theater gear.

Best Buy's online sales growth of 24% was also ""impressive,"" O'Shea said.Best Buy's second-quarter performance ""is evidence that a well-managed brick-and-mortar retailer with a well-thought-out strategy that successfully utilizes its physical assets can thrive as it transitions to a true multi-channel retailer,"" he said.

Nintendo (NTDOY) is a shareholder in both of the two companies and also owns the trademarks to Pokemon and the Pokemon character names.""Pokemon Go,"" a free-to-play, location-based augmented reality game, has been the No. 1 most-downloaded game on the Apple (AAPL) App Store and Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google Play store since its July 6 launch.While the game is free to play, it sells in-game items that enhance the experience and help players advance.

But the stock is still down 46% this year, and it has a lowest-possible IBD Relative Strength Rating of 1, meaning it's in the bottom 1% of stocks for performance in the past 12 months.The partnership includes content production, distribution, cross-promotion and product innovation, the companies said in a press release. As part of the deal, privately held Red Bull will receive equity in GoPro, and GoPro will become Red Bull’s exclusive provider of point-of-view imaging technology for capturing video during Red Bull sporting events and media productions.“This partnership is very strategic for GoPro,” GoPro founder and CEO Nick Woodman said in a statement. “While we’ve worked closely for many years, as official partners we’ll be able to more effectively help one another execute our shared vision and scale our respective businesses.”GoPro went public at a price of 24 in June 2014 and reached as high as 98.47 in October 2014. But shares have fallen on declining sales and concerns about market saturation and lower-cost competition in the action camera market.Red Bull will receive less than 1% equity in GoPro, or about 1 million shares, Piper Jaffray analyst Erinn Murphy said in a research report.“While this extends the consumer impressions of the brand globally, we believe GoPro still is battling some challenges with reinvigorating unit sales of its capture devices,” Murphy said. “On the heels of the delayed drone launch, tepid consumer demand for action camera products over the last few quarters and a soft Q2 guide from Best Buy (BBY) this morning (14% of GoPro sales), we are maintaining our underweight rating” on GoPro.GoPro’s partnership with Red Bull will run for 3-1/2 years.

The company has said it would update its guidance after the market close Thursday for its fiscal fourth quarter ending July 1.Ackerman says while he expects the SanDisk acquisition to dilute earnings through 2017, “We think the stock should start to work higher from here, as Western Digital’s updated guidance should act as a positive catalyst and help eliminate uncertainty.""Western Digital stock finished trading up 4.5% to 42.28 in the stock market today.

That’s largely due to lower disk drive sales in the slumping PC market and the migration of disk storage to chip-based storage in many products. Seagate's revenue has fallen for five straight quarters.“Now that SanDisk is subsumed into Western Digital’s operations, Western Digital now morphs from an enterprise highly exposed to the cannibalization of next-generation storage into a media agnostic, vertically integrated data storage provider capable of generating mid-single-digit revenue growth and low-double-digit EPS growth,” Ackerman wrote.He said the top 10 customers shared between Western Digital and SanDisk include Best Buy (BBY), Apple (AAPL), Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) and HP Inc. (HPQ)“With SanDisk, Western Digital can now more effectively service both enterprise and hyper-scale customers and capitalize on the explosion of data creation that should double every two to three years by 2020,"" Ackerman wrote.

At a luxury products conference in Versailles, France, on Tuesday, HP introduced its Spectre notebook, which it billed as the world’s thinnest laptop.Spectre’s aluminum chassis is as thin as a AAA-battery at just 10.4 millimeters. That compares with 13.1 mm for Apple’s MacBook.Spectre has a full HD 13.3-inch diagonal edge-to-edge display and Bang & Olufsen sound. It is powered by Intel (INTC) Core i5 or i7 processors, depending on the model.It will be available for preorder online on April 25 starting at $1,169.99. It is expected to be in Best Buy (BBY) stores on May 22 starting at $1,249.99.HP also announced limited edition versions of its Spectre notebooks from designers Tord Boontje and Jess Hannah.“The HP Spectre is the thinnest notebook in the world, and unlike the majority of other super thin PCs on the market, this laptop doesn't compromise power or features,” said Kevin Frost, HP vice president and general manager for consumer personal systems, in a statement.The Spectre notebook weighs 2.45 pounds and has high-gloss copper accents that give it a jewel-like finish. It boasts up to 9.5 hours of battery life per charge.Also Tuesday, HP refreshed its Envy line of notebooks with screen sizes of 15.6 and 17.3 inches. The 15.6-inch Envy starts at $679.99.

233,BBY,"Retail sales unexpectedly fell 0.3% in March to the lowest level since September, according to Commerce Department data released Wednesday, providing further evidence that the U.S. economy stagnated in the first quarter.Separately, the Federal Reserve's Beige Book cited ""modest to moderate"" economic growth across the country in recent weeks, but did see rising wages and signs of life in the battered oil sector.The Atlanta Fed's GDP tracker now predicts a mere 0.3% annualized gain for Q1, though that’s up slightly from last week. But weaker economic growth suggests the Fed will stay on hold.Stocks boomed to 2016 highs on Wednesday, buoyed by hopes for a steady Fed along with JPMorgan Chase (JPM) earnings and strong Chinese exports.Economists had expected retail sales to show a 0.1% gain last month. Auto sales were a big culprit, with sales sinking 2.1% vs. February.Americans weren't that eager to boost other spending. Sales rose 0.2% excluding autos and 0.1% excluding autos and gasoline. But those measures also missed Wall Street forecasts.February retail sales were revised up, with the total now seen as flat vs. the initial 0.1% drop, while the ex autos and gas gain was doubled to 0.6%. January retail sales sank 0.4%.General Motors (GM), Ford Motor (F) and Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) previously reported weaker-than-expected U.S. sales for March, reinforcing concerns that auto demand was starting to ease off record levels set late last year.Auto sales rose just 1.4% vs. a year earlier, Commerce said, the weakest since August 2010.On the upside, building materials and furniture stores posted solid gains as the housing market continues to advance. Gas station sales rose for the first time since last June as gasoline prices stabilized.Electronics and appliance store sales rose 0.1% vs. February but fell 2.1% vs. a year earlier. Apple (AAPL) is expected to post its first sales decline in years, with the Apple iPhone down worldwide. That's hurt electronics stores such as Best Buy (BBY).Nonstore sales, which includes Amazon.com (AMZN) and other e-commerce firms, dipped 0.1% last month.Apparel stores reported a 0.9% decline. Department stores sank 0.6% vs. February and 6.1% vs. a year earlier. Macy's (M) has closed stores this year as sales continue to fall.Gas station sales rose 0.9% in March, the first monthly gain since last June, as gasoline prices stabilized along with crude oil.In other economic news, business inventories fell 0.1% in February, while January stockpiles were revised down to a 0.1% decline. That also suggests weaker economic activity in Q1.GM shares rose 3.6% and Fiat Chrysler 4.1% on the stock market today, while Ford climbed 1.9%. Apple rose 1.4% retaking its 200-day moving average.

234,BBY,"Virtual reality will get its close-up on Monday when Facebook (FB) starts shipping its hot Oculus Rift headsets.Facebook sees Oculus Rift as a big game changer that starts with games and later moves to virtual front-row seats at sports games, as users slap on the Rift goggles for deep-seated immersion.Preorders for the $599 Oculus Rift headsets began in January. Facebook has not said how many Rift orders it received but did say they span 20 countries. When it ships, 30 games will be available, with more than 100 games expected by the end of this year. Game prices range from $9.99 to $59.99.High-performance PCs will be needed to power the Rift system. Oculus-ready PCs and Rift bundles are available from Dell, Dell's Alienware unit, and Asus, which start at around $1,499. They’re available through Amazon (AMZN), Best Buy (BBY) and the Microsoft (MSFT) Store.Research firm CCS Insight estimates that virtual reality devices, including the related augmented reality field, will exceed $4 billion in sales in three years. It projects 2.5 million virtual reality and augmented reality devices will sell this year, growing to 12 million devices next year, and more than 24 million in 2018.Later this year, Facebook will also ship its Oculus Touch controllers that allow people to interact more naturally in VR through hand movements and gestures. Facebook says it’s working with thousands of developers on entirely new VR experiences.Facebook acquired Oculus for $1.9 billion two years ago. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced the Oculus acquisition with a Facebook post, saying the technology goes far beyond being a system for gaming.“After games, we're going to make Oculus a platform for many other experiences. Imagine enjoying a court-side seat at a game, studying in a classroom of students and teachers all over the world or consulting with a doctor face-to-face, just by putting on goggles in your home,” he wrote in the post.In a conference call when Facebook announced fourth-quarter earnings on Jan. 27, he said: “This Oculus launch is shaping up to be a big moment for the gaming community. Over the long-term, VR has the potential to change the way that we live, work and communicate as well.”As to the revenue contribution Oculus will make to Facebook’s bottom line, the company is downplaying that for now.“With Rift, it's early in the evolution of VR,” Facebook CFO David Wehner said on the conference call. “It's early to be talking about large volumes. So, at this point, I don't think we're giving a lot of color around supply chain and that sort of thing. It's not going to be material to our financials this year.""The arrival of Rift could have a big benefit for chipmaker and computer game-card maker Nvidia (NVDA), as the demand for virtual reality accelerates. Nvidia provides the graphic processors needed in computers for Oculus Rift performance and that of other VR systems.The virtual reality field is expected to be intensely competitive, with a host of companies jumping into the game. Samsung has already shipped its Gear VR. Sony (SNE) is releasing a PlayStation VR system later this year, which will have a $400 price tag. Sony VR will have the benefit of leveraging its installed base of 30 million PlayStation 4 users.Also coming is the Vive VR system from Taiwan-based HTC, in joint development with U.S. game developer Valve. The HTC VR headset will begin shipping on April 5. Likewise, Microsoft is working on its “HoloLens” technology.

235,BBY,"With Alphabet (GOOGL)-owned Google Cloud Platform snaring more major customers, there's a three-company race between it, Amazon (AMZN) Web Services and Microsoft (MSFT) Azure that will only intensify.Cowen & Co. analyst John Blackledge wrote in a report on Thursday, after the first day of the Google Cloud Platform Next Conference in San Francisco, that ""our sense from talking to potential customers at the event is that they are giving Google Cloud Platform another look.""Blackledge said press reports have highlighted ""recent wins"" for Google's cloud business, including Spotify, Coca-Cola Enterprises (CCE) and Snapchat, which ""were featured prominently in customer use-case discussions. Other customers include Home Depot (HD), Electronic Arts (EA), Zulily, Sony (SNE) Music, HTC, Best Buy (BBY), TiVo (TIVO), Wix (WIX), Philips (PHG), Volkswagen's (VLKAY) Audi, (and Tata Group's) Jaguar and Range Rover,"" Blackledge said.Public clouds ""are likely to be a highly competitive market where customer stickiness will be challenged by new technologies that make it easier to move workloads between public cloud vendors,"" Macquarie Research analyst Ben Schachter wrote in industry research note on Wednesday. ""It clearly has become a major focus area for Google and one in which it intends to compete directly against Amazon and Microsoft.""Competition between the three groups will rise ""particularly as enterprises become increasingly comfortable migrating select workloads to public cloud environments,"" according to Cloud Computing Today.Cloud services is ""a $25 billion jump ball"" that will likely be captured by the big three competitors: Alphabet's Google Cloud Platform, Amazon's AWS and Microsoft's Azure, Pacific Crest Securities analyst Evan Wilson said in a Wednesday industry research note. ""With it being early in this opportunity, we think there will be wins and losses along the way, but we believe (Google) will be a significant competitor in the years to come, and it could help drive growth.”Apple recently signed a contract worth between $400 million and $600 million to use Google’s Cloud Platform, according to CRN. Apple now uses cloud services from Amazon and Microsoft, but it intends to end its reliance on all its rivals in the next few years as it builds its own data centers, according to Re/Code.In February, music service Spotify, a high-profile customer of Amazon's Amazon Web Services, said it would use Google's cloud for some computing infrastructure.Google's cloud business generated about $500 million in revenues last year, according to analysts at Goldman Sachs, as cited by Reuters. That compares with $74.5 billion overall for parent company Alphabet, but the cloud business is one of its fastest-growing business areas.Overall, Reuters said Google ranks as the No. 4 player in the cloud infrastructure industry, with 4% of the market last year, according to Synergy Research. Amazon's Amazon Web Services had a 31% share, Microsoft's Azure had a 9% share, and IBM (IBM) had 7%, according to the group.Google is also building up its data centers across the world, launching two new regional centers in Japan and Oregon to bring the number of regions it serves to five.Cloud computing is an increasingly popular way for companies to run their IT operations, and the $20-billion-a-year business is forecast to grow 35% over the next year, according to Gartner Inc.Alphabet and Apple stock both slipped 0.4% in the stock market today as Microsoft lifted that much. Amazon stock advanced 2.3%.
"
236,BBY,"Upon close examination, February’s 242,000 payroll gain looks a whole lot like fool’s gold.Far from putting the Federal Reserve on track to hike rates again in June, the best lousy jobs report ever -- by one key metric -- confirms that the slow-growth economy came uncomfortably close to stalling.If the details of the payroll report are to be believed, aggregate weekly earnings of private employees fell 0.5% in February on a seasonally adjusted basis. That combines a 0.4% drop in total hours worked and a 0.1% decline in average hourly pay.The Bureau of Labor Statistics has only tracked this metric since 2006, but it's never before fallen so much in a month when the economy wasn't bleeding jobs. In contrast to February's reported 230,000 gain in private payrolls, the last time there was an equally lousy reading for aggregate weekly earnings was June 2009, when private employers cut 429,000 jobs.It's clear that employers didn't lay off workers en masse last month, so Wall Street economists mostly discounted the drop in hours and wages as statistical noise. But that's a mistake, because there's solid evidence that the job market seriously weakened in the first two months of the year.That proof comes, first and foremost, from the broadest and most timely reading on the health of the job market: federal income and employment tax withholdings.For most of 2015, tax withholdings rose at a rate of 5% or more on a yearly basis, a combination of solid job growth and gains in wages, commissions and other incentive pay.But revenue inflows to the Treasury Department steadily slowed through the fall, bringing the annual growth rate down to just below 4% by the start of 2016. That's when growth in tax receipts began to collapse -- to 2.4% from a year ago -- in the four weeks through Feb. 5. Over the latest four weeks through March 4, receipt growth dipped further to 2.1%.The official Treasury tax-receipt data signal that the financial market turmoil over the first six weeks of 2016 may have had a much more pronounced impact on the job market than commonly believed.Companies that were already facing a tough earnings environment, thanks to a stronger dollar and lackluster global growth, seemingly pushed the pause button on hiring as they waited for a clearer view of the economic outlook. But the market recovery since mid-February, assuming it continues, could encourage employers to get off the fence.Smaller bonuses and weak corporate profits are weighing on tax receipts. Goldman Sachs (GS) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) have said they paid out smaller bonuses as trading revenue deteriorated.Still, the drop in tax revenues has been going on long enough to suggest that the labor market weakness goes deeper. Less hiring, letting open positions go unfilled, and fewer hours of work also offer possible explanations for why the job market weakness has gone largely unnoticed amid no noticeable rise in new claims for jobless benefits.Yet there are other indications that the job market has gotten softer. The Institute for Supply Management's report on nonmanufacturing industries found that service-sector employment turned slightly negative in February for the first time in two years, as six of 13 industries reported employment declines for the month.One of the job cutters was retail, with top chains like Wal-Mart (WMT), Macy’s (M), Sears (SHLD) and Sports Authority closing stores. Best Buy (BBY) also trimmed employment at its headquarters after reporting disappointing holiday results amid brutal competition from Amazon (AMZN) and disappointing demand for the Apple (AAPL) iPhone 6S.Labor Department data by contrast show that retailers have added 123,600 jobs over the past three months, not far off the fastest pace of job gains in the Internet era.Other data pointing to a weaker job market include the Conference Board's consumer confidence and online labor demand indexes. In February, fewer people said jobs were ""plentiful"" and more said jobs were ""hard to get."" Meanwhile, the Conference Board said in late February that the ""very weak start of 2016"" in online advertising of job vacancies ""suggests a possible temporary weakening in employer demand for labor.""The Fed's own Labor Market Conditions Index, which brings together 19 different job-related indicators, fell 2.4 points in February, the worst drop since June 2009.A number of economists downplayed the lousy aspects of the February payroll survey in part because the household survey, which is used to determine the jobless rate, looked so strong.But a closer look explains why that strength can't be trusted. Consider that the household survey showed a net 127,000 job losses in June and September, while the payroll survey showed that the economy added 377,000 jobs.The bottom line is that the household survey is far from reliable over short time periods, and may appear to show rapid employment growth now only after seriously understating gains earlier in 2015.

237,BBY,"Google-owner Alphabet (GOOGL) has snared iPhone maker Apple (AAPL) as a customer for its Google Cloud Platform, a deal that could help Google's service catch up with industry leader Amazon.com (AMZN), says an industry note from Pacific Crest Securities on Thursday.Amazon unit Amazon Web Services (AWS) is now the biggest provider of infrastructure as a service (IaaS), where customers rent computer servers and data storage systems via the Internet. Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet's Google rank next.Apple signed a contract worth between $400 million and $600 million to use Google's Cloud Platform, according to CRN. Apple now uses cloud services from Amazon and Microsoft, but intends to end its reliance on all its rivals in the next few years, as it builds its own data centers, according to Re/Code.While Apple has reportedly used AWS historically for iCloud, ""the more surprising shift is from Apple to Google, which are odd bedfellows given the two companies' mudslinging and competition in other areas,"" wrote Pacific Crest Securities analyst Evan Wilson. ""Did Google throw in free cloud as a way to renegotiate the search contract? Definitely adds to the perception of Google's momentum,"" Wilson added.The deal has not been confirmed by Google or Apple, but Apple did disclose its reliance on AWS and on Microsoft's Azure in a 2014 white paper.The alleged Apple-Google accord would help ""Google Cloud Platform catch up to Amazon and Microsoft -- at least in terms of perception -- as a real third player in the space instead of a distant third. Google has done similar deals with Snapchat, PricewaterhouseCoopers, General Mills (GIS) Coca-Cola (KO), HTC and Best Buy (BBY),"" said Wilson.In total, the cloud opportunity is big enough for all three Internet powerhouses, said Wilson, who estimated ""a potential $25 billion windfall opportunity in cloud services for Amazon, Microsoft and Google, collectively.""While AWS has been the biggest IaaS price-cutter of the last decade, Google Cloud Platform (GCP) has been aggressive since moving into the market. Google slashed prices in March 2014, October 2014 and May-June 2015, Goldman analyst Heather Bellini said in an industry report last month.Goldman Sachs says that the top three service providers are gaining share as Verizon Communications (VZ),  Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) and others exit the public IaaS market and focus on private clouds.Goldman Sachs estimates that AWS' revenue will hit $12.5 billion in 2016, up from $7.88 billion last year.Apple stock was down a fraction in midday trading in the stock market today, near 106.

238,BBY,"Special Report: CES 2016 Tech Show NewsA burgeoning class of consumer electronics devices at CES 2016 features sensors that can analyze your breath for odors and sniff the air around you for pollutants.Let's call this new group of gadgets ""smell tech"" for lack of a better term.Portable BreathalyzersOne of the pioneers in the field is BACtrack, which has been selling portable breathalyzers for measuring blood alcohol content (BAC) for 12 years. The company's current device is the $99 BACtrack Mobile, which connects wirelessly with a smartphone app.It's as accurate as the professional devices police use, said Keith Nothacker, founder and CEO of San Francisco-based BACtrack. The product is sold online and through major retailers like Best Buy ([STOCK[BBY]]), Costco ([STOCK[COST]]) and Target ([STOCK[TGT]]).BACtrack has about 65% market share in the category, Nothacker said. One reason for this is because rival products aren't very good, he said.""It's hard to make an accurate alcohol test,"" he said.BACtrack sees two main types of customers: serious buyers and curious buyers. The serious buyers include people who drink alcohol and want to make sure they're OK to drive. This includes sales people who drink socially while on the job, Nothacker said.Curious buyers include people who just want to find out how many drinks it takes for them to be over the legal limit, he said.Checking For Bad BreathBurlingame, Calif.-based Breathometer got its start making devices to test for alcohol but has since expanded its mission.In the second quarter, Breathometer plans to release the Mint wireless oral health monitor. Sensors in the device measure biomarkers that come with bad breath.But Breathometer is broadly interested in oral health care because certain compounds in breath correlate to disease, such as gum disease, says Royal Wang, senior R&D engineer for Breathometer.The Mint device will cost $99. A Philips branded version of the product will be available in the third quarter bundled with other oral health care products, Wang said.Sniffing Out Fat BurnSeattle-based Medamonitor used CES to introduce a device called Levl that can tell how much fat you're burning by measuring the acetone in your breath.""What Levl is trying to do is change the conversation about weight loss from the scale to metabolism,"" said Joe Anderson, a breath science expert for Levl.Bathroom scales can't tell you what's going on in your body. They can't distinguish between weight associated with water, muscle or fat.Levl uses breath pods that are inserted into a base station for analysis. The device pairs with a smartphone app for presenting results about fat-burning metabolism.The Levl device is expected to go on sale later this year. Pricing is still to be decided.Air Pollution MonitorsA number of companies at CES 2016 were showing off devices that measure indoor and outdoor air quality. They include Luxembourg-based Foobot and Shenzhen, China-based Quality Air [PAGE[Technology]].The Foobot is packed with sensors for measuring indoor air pollutants that can adversely impact your health. They include chemicals like formaldehyde and benzene, dust, carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide. The Foobot indoor air quality monitor costs $199.Quality Air sells a wearable air quality detector and a wearable air purifier.

240,BBY,"After six months, Apple Watch users are showing much less enthusiasm for the device, according to a focus group assembled by branding company MBLM.MBLM gave Apple (AAPL) smartwatches to 11 people, ages 13 to 65, and conducted in-depth interviews with them after one week, one month and six months to gauge their response to the device. In its third report, MBLM wonders if the thrill is gone, noting that users have gone from loving the Apple Watch to liking it.""Overall, our panel members continue to like the watch,"" MBLM said. ""A few are happy with it; a few are indifferent; many have lost that loving feeling. Most view it as a watch that does some cool tricks. Expectations have become more realistic, and although some panel members are underwhelmed, few are completely disappointed.""Apple Watch users say the device is one of several that they use in their daily lives. But compared with other devices, the watch is ""nonessential,"" the report said.A major limitation to the Apple Watch is that it has to be wirelessly linked to an iPhone to be fully functional, users said.And Apple Watch owners aren't using it for much beyond telling time.""The watch appears to have an increasingly narrow cast for our panel members,"" MBLM said. ""Most use it mainly for one specific function — notifications, the activity monitor, or answering texts and calls.""Apple Watch users say Siri, the speech-enabled personal assistant app, isn't very useful, so they don't use it much.""For a device that relies on voice recognition for many of its functions, Siri appears to have quite a bit of trouble recognizing names and following simple commands,"" MBLM said. ""Siri is the biggest of many issues around responsiveness that frustrate users and create unnecessary friction.""For the next-generation Apple Watch, expected in March, current users are hoping for a phone-free mode and better voice recognition. They'd also like to see faster processing, waterproofing and a built-in camera.MBLM plans to interview the focus group for another report at the one-year mark.Consumer electronics retailer Best Buy ( (BBY)) recently cut prices for all Apple Watches by $100 through Christmas. That drops the entry-level model to $249.The fact that Apple allowed the steep discount could be a sign that it wants to clear inventory ahead of a new model early next year, Forbes speculated.

252,BBY,"Consumer electronics retailer Best Buy (BBY) reported better-than-expected fiscal fourth-quarter results early Thursday, but it continues to face declining sales overall and in key categories, and its guidance missed Wall Street estimates.Best Buy stock was up 2%, above 32, in afternoon trading on the stock market today, as investors cheered the announcement of a special cash dividend and higher quarterly dividend.Best Buy said it will pay a special dividend of 45 cents a share, or about $145 million, related to the net after-tax proceeds of certain legal settlements and asset disposals. The retailer also boosted its regular quarterly dividend by 22% to 28 cents a share.Plus, Best Buy announced a new $1 billion share-repurchase plan expected to be completed over the next two years.Best Buy CEO Hubert Joly said the company aims to be a “premium dividend payer,” with a non-GAAP dividend payout ratio between 35% to 45%.In its fourth quarter ended Jan. 30, the Richfield, Minn.-based company earned $1.53 a share excluding items on sales of $13.62 billion. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected Best Buy to earn $1.39 a share on sales of $13.61 billion. On a year-over-year basis, EPS rose 3% and sales fell 4%.Under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), Best Buy's earnings per share fell 5% to $1.39.Best Buy's same-store sales slipped 1.8% in Q4. But the company's e-commerce sales jumped nearly 14% to $1.95 billion, accounting for 15.6% of total U.S. revenue. In its online sales segment, Best Buy competes with industry powerhouse Amazon.com (AMZN).

253,BBY,"Growth in health and wearables, home theater and major appliances was more than offset by “significant declines” in mobile phones, tablets and digital cameras, Best Buy said in a press release.For the current quarter, Best Buy expects to earn 31 to 35 cents a share, vs. 37 cents a year earlier. The midpoint of 33 cents a share would represent a year-over-year decline of 11%. It sees sales falling 3% to $8.3 billion based on the midpoint of guidance.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters were modeling for Best Buy to earn 38 cents a share on sales of $8.4 billion.Best Buy Chief Financial Officer Sharon McCollam said the retailer expects to see sales decline in the first half of the fiscal year, followed by growth in the back half. Best Buy is targeting flat domestic revenue for the full year. Appliances, home theater and connected home products are likely to be the top growth categories, she said.Best Buy said it will counter soft overall-sales growth in consumer electronics by focusing on market share gains and by making operational improvements to boost profits.On a conference call with analysts, Joly spoke about the product categories that will drive Best Buy sales. Household appliances, connected home products and large-screen ultra HD or 4K televisions are bright spots, he said.Virtual reality headsets are a new category that Best Buy is “very excited about,” Joly said.“This is an interesting category,” he said. “It will be small this year. It may help in the computing category with (sales of) higher-end computers because you’re going to need that computing power. But from a financial perspective, it’s going to be limited.”Three VR platforms are coming to market this year: Facebook’s (FB) Oculus Rift, HTC Vive and Sony’s (SNE) PlayStation VR.

255,BBY,"Smartwatches surpassed Swiss watches in unit shipments for the first time in the fourth quarter, according to research firm Strategy Analytics.Global smartwatch shipments reached 8.1 million units in the December quarter, compared with 7.9 million Swiss watch shipments, Strategy Analytics reported Thursday.Shipments of smartwatches, led by the Apple (AAPL) Watch, surged 316% from 1.9 million in Q4 2014. Meanwhile shipments of Swiss watches fell 5% from 8.3 million in Q4 2014, the research firm said.“Global demand for Swiss watches is slowing down, and major players like Swatch (SWGAY) are struggling to find growth,” Strategy Analytics analyst Steven Waltzer said in a statement.Strategy Analytics Executive Director Neil Mawston concurred.“The Swiss watch industry has been very slow to react to the development of smartwatches,” Mawston said in a statement. “The Swiss watch industry has been sticking its head in the sand and hoping smartwatches will go away. Swiss brands, like Tag Heuer, accounted for a tiny 1% of all smartwatches shipped globally during Q4 2015, and they are long way behind Apple, Samsung and other leaders in the high-growth smartwatch category.”Smartwatches are growing rapidly in North America, Western Europe and Asia, the research firm said.Apple Watch captured 63% of the global smartwatch market in the fourth quarter, followed by Samsung with 16%.“Apple and Samsung together account for a commanding eight in 10 of all smartwatches shipped worldwide,” Strategy Analytics analyst Cliff Raskind said in a press release.Wall Street analysts estimate that Apple sold 4.9 million units of Apple Watch in the December quarter. Strategy Analytics estimates that Apple shipped 5.1 million units of Apple Watch in Q4.Apple is expected to unveil new Apple Watch software and wristbands at a media event next month. At the same event, Apple is likely to unveil a new 4-inch iPhone 5SE and iPad Air 3, according to 9to5Mac.It's unknown when Apple will release a second-generation Apple Watch. But some are speculating that it could be soon because retailers are discounting many current Apple Watch models, presumably to clear out older inventory. The Apple Watch is being discounted by $100 at Best Buy (BBY), Target (TGT) and other stores. The entry-level Apple Watch Sport model is selling for $249, 29% off the regular price of $349.Image provided by Shutterstock.

259,BBY,"For the third straight quarter since the launch of the Apple Watch, Apple (AAPL) declined to reveal unit sales for its smartwatch.That left Wall Street analysts to guess how many Apple Watches the company sold in the holiday quarter by analyzing Apple’s “other products” line item.Apple includes the Apple Watch in the “other products” category -- along with the Apple TV, iPod, Beats headphones and accessories.Late Tuesday, Apple reported $4.35 billion in “other products” sales in its fiscal first quarter ended Dec. 26, up 62% year over year and up 43% from the September quarter.Analysts were modeling Apple to sell 5.1 million Apple Watches in fiscal Q1.At least 14 analysts estimated Apple Watch sales for Q1 based on Apple’s report. They ranged from a low of 4.35 million units by FBN Securities to a high of 6.25 million units by Drexel Hamilton.The average was 4.9 million. Based on that analysis, Apple missed consensus views on Apple Watch sales last quarter.But on a conference call with analysts Tuesday, Apple CEO Tim Cook sounded pleased with the quarter's Apple Watch results.“We expanded distribution of Apple Watch to almost 12,000 locations in 48 countries during the quarter,” he said. “As we expected, we set a new quarterly record for Apple Watch sales, with especially strong sales in the month of December.”Several analysts lowered their Apple Watch forecasts as a result of the fiscal Q1 report. Apple stock fell 6.6% Wednesday.Pacific Crest Securities analyst Andy Hargreaves cut his Apple Watch sales forecast for fiscal 2016, which ends in September, to 13.8 million units from 16.3 million. For fiscal 2017, he lowered his target to 14.5 million units from 18.2 million.UBS analyst Steven Milunovich cut his estimate for Apple Watch sales in the March quarter to 2.8 million units from 4 million. For the fiscal year, he reduced his target to 17.265 million units from 19 million.However, Drexel Hamilton analyst Brian White says Apple Watch had a “strong holiday.”“We believe Apple Watch was a big hit this holiday season with a starting price of just $349 and discounted to $249 at certain retailers such as Best Buy (BBY),” he said in a research report Wednesday. RELATED:Study Indicates Apple Watch Holiday Sales ‘Tepid’.

"
278,BBY,"Job growth slowed much more than expected in January as the economy added just 151,000 jobs, but the report was seemingly strong in all the ways that might keep the Federal Reserve itching to raise interest rates again.Average hourly wages rose 0.5%, the second-biggest monthly gain going all the way back to 2008. Meanwhile, the jobless rate fell to 4.9%, the lowest since February 2008, and the labor force participation rate rose for a third straight month, to 62.7%.A tighter labor market begets higher wage growth and puts upward pressure on inflation. This is what Fed policymakers expect to happen, it's why they raised rates in December, and it's why investors are apparently beginning to fear they could do so again as soon as March -- despite the sharp decline in job gains.That may be one reason why stocks sold off sharply Friday, with the S&P 500 down 1.85% at the closing bell, while the dollar rose against other currencies. The Nasdaq tumbled 3.25%, as grim forecasts from LinkedIn (LNKD) and Tableau (DATA) triggered widespread concern about business spending on software generally.But a closer look at the details of the jobs report suggests more reason to be worried about the economy weakening than to fear another Fed hike. Not only were overall job gains lackluster and lower for a third straight month, but a large portion of those gains are more than a bit puzzling and probably not something to count on going forward.Manufacturers added a surprising 29,000 jobs -- tied for the best gain since early 2012. Yet that reading stands in stark contrast to the Institute for Supply Management manufacturing survey earlier in the week showing factories shedding jobs at the fastest pace since 2009. While not as dismal, ADP reported that factory payrolls were unchanged in January.Meanwhile, the trade deficit widened in December as exports fell for a third straight month, rising 6.9% vs. a year earlier, the Commerce Department said Friday. U.S. manufacturers are struggling as a higher dollar makes it even harder to compete in a sluggish global economy.Then there's the retail sector, which added 57,700 jobs, or 38% of the total gain. The best month of retail hiring in more than three years came even as Wal-Mart (WMT) said it would lay off 10,000 workers and close 154 U.S. stores (though the closings came after the payroll survey week) and as Macy's (M) closed 40 stores and announced 2,500 layoffs.Most of the retail job gains appear to be a statistical quirk related to seasonal adjustment.""Department stores, an industry having a difficult time by any measure, increased payrolls by 13,200 -- primarily because they didn't hire as many in the fall to lay off a lot in January,"" said Steve Blitz, chief economist at ITG Investment Research.Electronics and appliance retailers like Best Buy (BBY) added 8,600 jobs on a seasonally adjusted basis, the best gain in nine years. That doesn't seem to square with reality, as the sector faces brutal competition from Amazon (AMZN). Nor does it square with the picture Best Buy painted when it reported disappointing holiday sales amid weak demand and price cuts for the Apple (AAPL) iPhone 6S and iPad.Seasonally unadjusted data show that electronics retailers added 9,200 fewer workers in November and December compared to a year earlier, then trimmed payrolls by 6,000 fewer in January 2016 vs. January 2015.On the other hand, IHS Global Insight chief economist Nariman Behravesh notes that temp hiring swung from a 25,100 gain in December to a 25,200 drop in January. That's not likely to be repeated either.ITG Investment's Blitz concludes: ""Given all this noise and that it is way too soon for current market turmoil to impact real economic activity . . . (we'll have to) wait for February data to begin to get a sense of whether trending demand for labor is shifting.""There also is reason — actually 14 of them — to wonder if the 0.5% jump in hourly wages last month really represents a shift in the trend. That's because 14 states raised their minimum wages on January 1, directly affecting 2.8 million workers, according to the liberal Economic Policy Institute. California's $1 hike to $10 an hour was the most consequential.The think tank estimated that the minimum wage hike would lead employers to raise wages for another 1.9 million workers earning close to the new minimum to avoid paying more senior workers the same as less senior ones at the cost of morale.It remains to be seen if the higher minimum wages depress job growth to any extent. Low-wage hiring does appear to have slowed last year in the six cites which implemented big minimum wage hikes to $10 an hour or more last year.Even the strong household survey, which showed that the number of people with jobs surged by 615,000 last month (or 409,000 excluding a population adjustment), probably isn't giving a reliable signal. That's not to say the jobless rate is higher than 4.9%, but only that it can't be counted on to give a reliable estimate of employment gains in any given month. For example, in the third quarter of 2015, the payroll survey showed an increase of 192,000 jobs a month, while the household survey showed a gain of 73,000.A slower pace of hiring was expected after gains averaged 279,000 in the fourth quarter but economic growth slowed to just 0.7%. Economists had expected a gain of about 188,000 jobs in January.The workweek rose 0.1 hour to 34.6 hours, meaning that the increase in work was better than the headline 151,000 job gain. Still, the payroll report offered one more not-so-great sign for the strength of hiring going forward: Outside of manufacturing, 57.6% of industries added jobs last month, down from 65.3% the prior two months.Image provided by Shutterstock.

280,BBY,"Best Buy (BBY) stock fell to a 19-month low Thursday after the consumer electronics retailer reported disappointing holiday sales. The Richfield, Minn.-based company said its U.S. sales for the nine-week period ended Jan. 2 fell 0.8% year over year to $10.05 billion. During the same period a year earlier, domestic sales rose 4.1%.Same-store sales fell 1.2% year over year during the holiday season. A year earlier, comparable store sales rose 3.4%, Best Buy said.""The domestic decline was primarily driven by the mobile phone category, which was softer than both our expectations and the prior year,"" Best Buy CEO Hubert Joly said in a statement. ""Excluding mobile phones, domestic revenue increased year over year due to our strong performance in health and wearables, home theater and appliances.""While Best Buy's sales disappointed, its profit margins were better than expected. Its non-GAAP operating income in Q4 declined 10 to 15 basis points, vs. its expectation for a decline of 20 to 35 basis points.Best Buy sells most of the major smartphones, including Apple (AAPL) iPhones and Samsung Galaxy phones. Wall Street analysts have been busy lowering their sales estimates for iPhones over the past month or so, seeing weaker-than-expected demand for the newest iPhone, the 6S, released in fall 2015. It has not been received with nearly as much gusto as the iPhone 6, released in fall 2014. Apple is slated to release its December-quarter earnings on Jan. 26, after the market close.Based on the holiday sales figures, Best Buy revised its fourth-quarter outlook. It now expects domestic sales to decline 1.5% vs. its prior expectation for flat sales.Best Buy stock fell 9.7% to 26.43 on the stock market today. Earlier in the session, Best Buy shares sunk as low as 25.61.During the holiday season, sales growth in health/wearables, home theater and major appliances was more than offset by significant declines in mobile phones, tablets and digital imaging products, Best Buy said.Late Wednesday, action camera maker GoPro (GPRO) reported lousy holiday sales for its Hero action cameras. Its shares fell 15% Thursday to 12.48, earlier hitting an all-time low of 11.26.

That's far worse than December's -4.59 reading and still worse than the -4.0 economists forecast. The contraction first began back in August. New orders contracted to -23.54, the eighth consecutive monthly decline and also the sharpest fall since March 2009. Unfilled orders fell to -11.0, while employment, at -13.0, fell for the sixth straight month. Shipments fell to -14,39 from December's 4.62 reading. The six-month outlook, normally positive, fell to 9.51 from December's 35.7. That's the least optimistic reading since March 2009.

Excluding automobiles, retail sales still fell 0.1% vs. the 0.3% gain expected. Apparel sales fell 0.9%, while general merchandise fell 1%, and sales of electronics and appliances also contracted. For the year, total sales rose 2.1%, the smallest gain since 2009 and well below 2014's 3.9% gain. Excluding automobiles, sales rose 0.9%, lower than 2014's 3.1% gain. Customers did choose to spend their money at restaurants, which showed a gain of 0.8%, and on home furnishings and furniture, which gained 0.9%. Nonstore retailers, including e-commerce firms like Amazon.com (AMZN), rose 0.3% vs. November and 7.1% vs. a year earlier, the best since October 2014.

Food prices fell 1.3% for the month and 5.2% year over year. Export prices fell 0.1% in December and 3.4% from a year earlier.

340,BBY,"Expect to see lots of flying camera drones this holiday season, which Dougherty & Co. predicts will be the ""Christmas of the drone."" This year, Yuneec will join Parrot and DJI in offering aerial drones at Best Buy (BBY) stores, Dougherty analyst Charles Anderson said in a report Tuesday.Also, market leader DJI might offer its lowest-end drone, the Phantom 2, at Wal-Mart (WMT) and Sam's Club stores, he said. The Phantom 2 costs about $700, but could be discounted for the holidays, Anderson said.Anderson also expects to see a large presence at retail this holiday season from 3D Robotics, aka 3DR.To date, the market for personal drones and quadcopters has been largely commercial. Companies and professionals are using drones for aerial cinematography, mapping, search and rescue, security and monitoring, and other applications.The Federal Aviation Administration is currently drafting regulations for commercial drone use in U.S. airspace. Those rules are expected to be completed this year, but could push into 2016, Anderson said. In the meantime, the FAA is granting exemptions to companies for commercial drone use.""As of July, 70% of the exemptions have been to companies using DJI drones,"" he said. ""So even though DJI may be perceived as a consumer drone company, it has wide commercial use.""Action camera maker GoPro (GPRO) is looking to play in the emerging consumer drone market, Anderson said. It is expected to come out with a drone, possibly called Karma, in the first half of 2016.Many drone makers outfit their aircraft with attachments for GoPro cameras, but increasingly are using their own cameras.""GoPro has the opportunity to dominate the consumer drone market because 1) no one seems as focused on the consumer as they are, 2) they have strong branding and 3) there is demand from their action camera customers for an accompanying drone,"" Anderson said.A chief beneficiary of the growing drone market has been Ambarella (AMBA), a maker of video processing chips used by GoPro and other camera manufacturers. But Qualcomm (QCOM) has just jumped into the market with a competing chip aimed at the drone market.Qualcomm's chip, Snapdragon Flight, currently is targeted at the low end of the drone market, where Ambarella doesn't really play, Anderson said.Qualcomm announced last week that Chinese drone maker Yuneec will come out with a drone powered by Snapdragon Flight in early 2016. This comes after Ambarella announced its first win with Yuneec for its Typhoon Q500 drone, Anderson said.Yuneec is pursuing multiple product classes of drones (good-better-best) and the Qualcomm chip will likely end up in an entry-level device costing about $500, he said.Drone makers like Yuneec seem to be opting for Ambarella chips for drones costing above $500 because of their superior video and power consumption features, Anderson said.The drone market might end up mimicking the Internet protocol security camera market where companies like HiSilicon dominate the low end of the market, while Ambarella dominates the high end and has midrange customers as well, Anderson said.""There is a void to be filled on the lower-end of consumer drones (let's say, $500 and below) to have a low cost system-on-a-chip (SoC) that speeds time to market (video, flight control and connectivity all integrated),"" he said. ""This is the niche for Qualcomm to fill. The opportunity for Ambarella to render Qualcomm irrelevant would be to add computer vision processing to its chip that allows a drone to sense and avoid objects (trees, power lines, etc.). We believe the company is hard at work incorporating those features into its road-map and management is confident they can do so in a way that is more power efficient than Snapdragon Flight.""RELATED:Google, Amazon Wrestle With Drone-Traffic Challenges.Flying cameras to lift GoPro stock, Citi says.Commercial Drone Sales Set To Soar.

AT&T will also be in 250 stores, and in most cases those will be the same locations as Verizon, says a ReCode report.AT&T's Best Buy outlets will showcase smartphones, tablets, wearables, connected car plug-ins as well as its ""Digital Life"" security and smart home products.Sprint (S) expanded its retail reach earlier this year through a ""store-within-a-store"" agreement with struggling Radio Shack .

""We have created an expansive assortment of amazing technology products, especially in 4K TVs, health and wearables, connected or smart devices, drones and many other giftable items. These products will be offered at very attractive prices to our customers throughout the holiday shopping season.""In the October quarter, sales growth in computers, major appliances, wearables and large-screen TVs was partially offset by declines in tablets, mobile phones and digital cameras, Best Buy said.RELATED:Best Buy Faces 'Deteriorating Sales Trends,' Gets Downgrade.Drones Ready For Takeoff This Holiday Season.

397,BBY," No. 1 online retailer Amazon.com (AMZN) drew more than a third of Americans' Black Friday and Cyber Monday e-commerce spending by one estimate, while a Wednesday tally called Cyber Monday the heaviest U.S. online spending day in history.Amazon, however, actually appears to have lost a little Cyber Monday market share.Official numbers aren't in from Amazon yet on holiday sales, but by analytics firm Slice Intelligence's tally, Amazon accounted for 35.7% of e-commerce spending on Black Friday, Nov. 27, followed by Best Buy (BBY) with 8.2%, Macy's (M) with 3.4%, and Wal-Mart (WMT) at 3.3%.Amazon's Black Friday share was way up from 31.5% last year in the tally, and Slice estimated that Amazon Black Friday sales rose 23.2% from a year ago.Slice spokeswoman Jaimee Minney told IBD that Cyber Monday ""was bigger than Black Friday and bigger than Cyber Monday last year.""The Black Friday estimate comes primarily from an analysis of about 876,000 email receipts provided by Slice's panel of 3 million shoppers.Amazon garnered a 36.1% share of U.S. e-commerce sales on Cyber Monday by Slice's estimate, down 2.7 percentage points from a year earlier.Also by its estimate, ""the retailer's sales were down 1.3% vs. the same day last year,"" Minney said in an email.Wal-Mart was the only store in the top five to gain share on Cyber Monday by that tally — up half a percentage point, to 3.8%.Cyber Monday SoarsWednesday, online tracker comScore said Cyber Monday reached $3.12 billion in online spending, up 21% from last year's Cyber Monday.ComScore's mobile figures aren't final, but it said desktop online spending set a record, at $2.28 billion.ComScore said that for the first 30 days of the holiday season, $27.9 billion has been spent online by desktops, up 6% from a year ago.""The weekend after Thanksgiving also reached a major milestone as it saw its first ever billion-dollar online shopping day on Sunday,"" it said in a report Wednesday, ""while Saturday sales reached the $1 billion mark for a second year in a row.""Overall, Cyber Monday online sales set a record with $3.07 billion in spending across the U.S., up 16% from last year, according to Adobe Systems' (ADBE) Adobe Index, as Amazon leveraged its e-commerce dominance. But Thanksgiving weekend sales looked weak at brick-and-mortar retailers.Apple (AAPL) iPad and iPhone doorbusters were hits for Target (TGT) and others, while Wal-Mart announced booming mobile sales.Retail analytics provider ShopperTrak, however, estimates that U.S. physical stores took in 10.4% less than a year earlier over Thanksgiving, Black Friday and the weekend — an estimated $20.4 billion that does not include Cyber Monday.Amazon's Black Friday showing wouldn't be out of line with the IBD Leaderboard company's heft in online shopping — the company ""makes up about 69% of total U.S. retail traffic,"" Canaccord Genuity analyst Michael Graham said in a research report this week. Minney said Amazon's Black Friday crowd ""doesn't surprise us.""Amazon said that it had a record Thanksgiving weekend for selling Amazon devices, triple last year's result. Its top-selling products across all those available on Amazon.com on Black Friday were Amazon devices, the company said — No. 1 was Fire (its tablet line), and No. 2 was the Fire TV stick for streaming video online.Where People Shop OnlineIn October, the latest month tallied, Amazon drew over 160 million online visitors, up 19% from a year ago according to comScore (SCOR) and Canaccord estimates. Next-up eBay (EBAY) drew about 88 million (up 12%), Wal-Mart 84 million (up 32%) and Target almost 69 million (up 15%).Amazon's rise was ""meaningfully fast,"" Canaccord analyst Graham said in a research note Tuesday.Graham noted that Amazon stock is the best-performing name in his coverage area and has more than doubled this year.Follow Donna Howell on Twitter @IBD_DHowell.RELATED VIDEO:Shopping Surges Online: What's Hot, What Flopped?

398,BBY,"Fitbit (FIT) stock went on a post-Thanksgiving turkey trot on Monday after getting an analyst upgrade. Barclays analyst Matthew McClintock on Monday upgraded Fitbit stock to overweight from equal weight with a price target of 49. Fitbit was up more than 2.5%, near 28.50, in afternoon trading on the stock market today.Fitbit, the top maker of activity trackers and fitness bands, went public on June 18 at 20. It climbed as high as 51.90 on Aug. 5 before investors got vertigo. Its shares tumbled on concerns about increased competition and profit erosion.Fitbit's recent stock decline is unwarranted, McClintock said in a research report. The company has ""meaningful catalysts"" ahead including holiday season sales, the CES trade show, new product launches and corporate wellness deals, he said.""Considering that Fitbit is the fastest-growing meaningful consumer company in the world at 140%+ revenue year over year in 2015 (in a world lacking true growth stories), we believe the current valuation levels are just too compelling to ignore,"" he said.Wearables appear to be one of the winning product categories this holiday and Fitbit is the brand of choice, according to retail channel checks, he said. Plus, Fitbit was less discounted than its peers over the Black Friday weekend, McClintock said.Retailers Best Buy (BBY), Target (TGT) and Kohl's (KSS) cited strong wearable device sales in recent reports.""We estimate that Fitbit can grow annual revenue by at least 40% over the next several years, which could ultimately prove conservative (our upside case is for Fitbit to grow revenue almost 70% over the next several years),"" McClintock said. ""Our estimates for revenue growth are entirely driven by overall category growth/consumer adoption as well as geographic expansion (Fitbit's global operations currently represent less than 25% of sales).""Pacific Crest Securities analyst Brad Erickson said his retail channel checks on Black Friday indicated soft in-store fitness tracker sales. However, online sales may have offset weaker brick-and-mortar sales.Fitbit saw ""slightly disappointing in-store demand,"" Erickson said in a report Sunday.""Our checks indicate that wearable devices overall, and Fitbit specifically, underperformed store expectations on Black Friday, driven by strong Apple Watch sales and a likely channel shift toward online,"" he said. ""Historically, Fitbit has done as much as 40% of its sales through online channels, and we think this holiday could index above those levels. So while we're noting the in-store feedback as a modest negative, we're not ruling out that the fitness category's likely higher proclivity toward online channels may have provided Fitbit some offset to this softness.""Erickson rates Fitbit stock as overweight with a price target of 47.Fitbit likely didn't see any meaningful market share loss to rival activity trackers from Garmin (GRMN) and others over Black Friday weekend, he said. But Apple 's (AAPL) Apple Watch smartwatch, which was discounted by some retailers, could have impacted wearables demand, he said.RELATED:Fitbit, Apple Watch demand up ahead of holidaysFitbit takes ill as secondary stock offer cuts value.

401,BBY,"When it comes to holiday wish lists, gift cards remain a top choice among consumers this season. That's music to the ears of prepaid card and payments company Blackhawk Network (HAWK).""Blackhawk is one of the big providers of gift cards and related services,"" Wedbush Securities analyst Gil Luria told Investor's Business Daily. ""It helps content providers like retailers that want to sell outside their premises on grocery store shelves.""Blackhawk uses proprietary technology to offer a broad range of prepaid gift, telecom and debit cards, in physical and electronic forms, as well as related prepaid products and payment services. The company supports the management and distribution of these products in a number of different retail, digital and incentive channels.It sells to consumers through its retail distribution network, whether in stores or on websites. Blackhawk also provides services, software and prepaid products to business clients for loyalty, incentive and reward programs, using its own sales force, as well as third-party resellers.23 CountriesBlackhawk's retail distribution partners showcase gift cards on displays that Blackhawk manages. Outside the U.S., Blackhawk distributes to its non-U.S. partners in 23 countries via grocery stores and other retail channels.The company seems to be in the right place at the right time. Gift cards remained the most requested holiday gift by consumers in a November National Retail Federation survey. And a recent poll by Deloitte found redeemable cards are the No. 2 gift that shoppers plan to buy this holiday.Consumers showed just how popular gift cards are over the Thanksgiving/Black Friday weekend. Stored Value Solutions reports sales of gift cards in the U.S. were up 4% year over year for the four days of the Thanksgiving holiday weekend, double 2014's year-over-year gain of 2%.Blackhawk distributes merchant-branded prepaid, or ""closed-loop,"" cards for companies such as Amazon (AMZN), Apple's (AAPL) iTunes, Macy's (M), Starbucks (SBUX)and Best Buy (BBY), in addition to other prepaid products like telecom cards, open-loop gift cards that can be redeemed anywhere, and reloadable prepaid debit cards.The company isn't content with that, however. Blackhawk has bulked up with a steady flow of acquisitions, new businesses and expanded distribution. That's helped it gain traction in its traditional space and in the ""incentive"" gift card arena, where customers are rewarded for loyalty.New DivisionMany of the buyouts are part of a new division, Blackhawk Engagement Solutions, that was formed this year.""Our strategy since inception has been to connect great brands to consumers through a productive global network,"" Teri Llach, Blackhawk's chief marketing officer, told IBD. ""Motivating employees via a prepaid card or gift card is a logical expansion going from a retail presence, where we're connecting brands to consumers, to corporate incentives, where we're connecting employers to employees.""The incentives and rewards business has proven to be the fastest-growing segment for Blackhawk and is driving its rapid expansion, says Wedbush's Luria.""Their biggest business, which is closed-loop gift cards, has slowed down to maybe single-digit growth,"" Luria said. ""To generate growth, they've been making acquisitions of these corporate incentives and rewards companies.""Showing In NumbersIt's showing up in the numbers. In the third quarter, Blackhawk's adjusted earnings grew 52% to 35 cents a share. Adjusted revenue jumped 54% to $193.4 million.Its incentives and rewards segment's adjusted operating revenues soared 392% from a year earlier, primarily due to the acquisition of Parago and the purchase of Achievers, Chief Executive Bill Tauscher said in a recent press release. Meanwhile, its U.S. retail segment grew adjusted operating revenue 21% in the third quarter. The international retail segment posted adjusted operating revenue growth of 27%.Luria says the corporate incentives and rewards business is more of a year-round concern, while the company's core gift card segment is seasonal, with all of its business generated in the fourth quarter around the holidays. Luria expects the company to continue to make acquisitions since its core business is slowing down.Latest PurchaseBlackhawk's latest buy came last month with the purchase of Didix Gifting & Promotions.Based in the Netherlands, Didix issues and markets leisure-themed gifts and promotions using a prepaid card that can be redeemed for services at multiple leisure outlets, including regional retailers, restaurants, cinemas and spas. It develops gifting and promotional products and brands across the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Germany and Belgium.Blackhawk's Llach says all of the company's acquisitions have been a ""significant driver of Blackhawk's earnings growth.""""We are in 23 countries, and we are looking at smart ways to expand where we see a market (opportunity),"" Llach said.Safeway SpinoffBlackhawk was spun off from privately held grocery giant Safeway in 2014. Safeway and other grocers such as Kroger (KR) are distribution partners.Other partners include Home Depot (HD), Lowe's (LOW) and Staples (SPLS) as well as online giants Amazon and eBay (EBAY).Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect Blackhawk's full-year 2015 earnings to rise 31% to $2.31 a share. They see a 14% gain in 2016 and an 11% increase in 2017.""As long as they continue to make acquisitions, they will grow (at a rapid) rate,"" said Luria. ""At some point it will be harder to do. If they run out of balance-sheet ability (because of too much debt), it will be harder for them to borrow more money to make acquisitions.""Blackhawk is part of IBD's Finance-Credit Card/Payment Processors industry group. It leads the group with a 99 IBD Composite Rating out of a possible 99.

417,BBY,"Stocks closed mixed to lower on Friday — on what was the slowest trading day of the year…but did you really expect anything different?  With the US mkts only open for 3 ½ hrs and no real catalyst to push it higher - it would have been hard for it to do anything other than what it did.All the hype over Black Friday, Small Business Saturday, and Cyber Monday continue to cause a bit of concern as investors/traders began to wonder aloud — what it all means. Will the news on Saturday morning suggest that Black Friday was a dud?  Have all the ‘pre-Black Friday sales’ taken the luster off?  Are retailers sending the signal that they are nervous and if they are, then how will that translate to traders/investors on Monday morning? Well — in a bit of 'forewarning' consumer discretionary and retailers led the way lower on Friday.  Wal-Mart  (WMT), Amazon (AMZN), Tiffany's (TIF), GAP (GPS), JC Penny  (JCP), Macy's (M),Best Buy  (BBY) etc…..all putting in weak performances ahead of the big shopping weekend as traders placed their bets.On Saturday morning — the papers announced the news — No, not the fights to get into the stores, or the lines of people who camped out just to be first in line,  but rather :  'Black Friday — Not so Black', 'Black Friday Sales Slip from Year Prior', 'Black Friday Store Sales Fall as Americans Buy More Online' and 'Black Friday Was a Bust!' SunTrust Robinson Humphrey summed it up by saying:  ""We believe that Thanksgiving shopping was a bust""…. but is that really what happened?  Is it just that the shopping moved from physical to virtual?  Consumers no longer feeling the need to get up and go out.....but rather sit home in their 'skivvies', open up their computers and shop online...spending some $4.4 bil online over the weekend.......in fact this morning's WSJ lays it out clearly: ""Online Shopping Surges on Black Friday Weekend - online shopping, especially via mobile phones, surges, showing how buying habits have changed"" What a contrast to years past? I mean who remembers the look of terrorized sales clerks as throngs of crazed, almost hysterical,  shoppers pushed their way into the stores at midnight? So what’s the consensus? Seems to me that it was a lot of wasted time and talk about Black Friday..... and since all of these 'sales' were happening 'online' as well as in the store in the week's prior to Black Friday and will surely happen in the weeks following Black Friday — why then should anyone rush out and shop on Black Friday?  What is the advantage?  Apparently Zero! The question then becomes - What happens to the margins?  Yes - we are told that sales rose 14%  y/y but at what cost?   Will retailers crush margins in order to entice the consumer to part with their dollars?  And then what does that really mean for the investment thesis?  Is that Bullish?  What is important to remember though — is that the shopping season is not made up of any one day…..it is the culmination of shopping that takes place from early  October — right thru Christmas and then it is the shopping that takes place on Christmas day thru year end when retailers slash the prices of anything that remains to get it 'off the shelf'.  So before anyone goes and makes an investment decision based on Black Friday — remember — Black Friday was a day created by the industry to create hype and excitement — in the end — the results will be what they are…..I am just not sure it will be what the retailers want them to be - but we shall see.OK — back to the mkts…on Friday we saw China get slammed (again) — down some +5% as concern over the slide in industrial profits once again takes center stage causing some analysts to ring the alarm about a deteriorating Chinese economy.  Add in the newly announced probe into some of China's largest brokerages and you had the perfect backdrop for investors to hit the SELL button.   This morning we saw a repeat of that story.... Asian mkts continued to come under pressure overnight as this story builds....   At one point China was off another 3.5% in early trading only to recoup those losses and end the day marginally higher.  The volatility in the Chinese mkts illustrates the difficulty that Chinese officials face as they try to transform their economy and allow the mkts to price in real risk as the gov't attempts to withdraw support.    Japan -0.69%,  Hong Kong -0.33%,  China +0.26%  and ASX -0.69%.In Europe this morning we are seeing those mkts flat to slightly higher as investors there discount the negative moves out of Asia and begin the week anticipating more stimulus to be announced by the ECB on Thursday. The  Eurostoxx index - an index of 50 blue chip stocks that represent the 'super sector' leaders from 12  Eurozone countries -  is up 2% this month and it is up 17%  off  the September lows as optimism builds over the strength of the Eurozone economy as well as the potential for more Kool Aid offered up by the ECB.  ECB Pres Draghi is expected to announce even more stimulus by pushing the cost of parking money at the ECB even higher ( rates to go further into NEGATIVE territory) as he tries to force the banks to lend vs. hoard. FTSE -0.04%, CAC 40 +0.67%, DAX  +0.97%, Eurostoxx  +0.76%, Spain +0.98% and Italy +0.62%.  Now US futures have been all over the place, down nearly 9 pts in early pre-mkt trading and have now swung back to positive territory - currently up  3 pts at 2093 -  as traders/investors return from the long holiday weekend. Get ready for 'macro data overload' as US investors/traders get hit with a slew of data.In addition  we will hear from Fed Chair Yellen as she addresses the Economic Club of Washington on Wednesday and the Congressional Joint Economic Committee on Thursday -  Expect traders to listen intently to what she has to say. What does that mean for rates? By now — everyone should realize that it is NOT about the December 16/17th meeting any longer — it is now about what happens next year.Will she indicate that further rate hikes are in store in quick succession in the new year? Is she setting up to be more aggressive in the months ahead?   In addition - watch for the  'FED Bus Tour' featuring a range of FED officials as they pontificate over the state of the economy and monetary policy.Tomorrow we will get Chicago's Evans, and Fed Gov Brainard . Wednesday gives us Atlanta's Lockhart and San Fran's Williams.

418,BBY,"Two new entrants in the wearable device market are giving leader Fitbit (FIT) a run for its money: Apple (AAPL) and Xiaomi. Fitbit, a maker of fitness bands and activity trackers, was No. 1 in the wearables market in the second quarter, with 24.3% market share, research firm IDC said Thursday. It shipped 4.4 million units in Q2, up 159% year over year.Apple, which launched its Apple Watch smartwatch on April 24, grabbed the No. 2 spot among wearables makers after just one full quarter on the market.Apple shipped 3.6 million smartwatches in Q2, taking 19.9% market share, IDC said.China's Xiaomi was close behind in third place with 17.1% market share. It shipped 3.1 million fitness bands in Q2. Xiaomi didn't have a wearable device on the market a year ago.Garmin (GRMN) came in fourth with 3.9% market share in Q2, followed by Samsung (3.3%). Garmin sells fitness bands and sports watches for ""citizen athletes"" such as runners, cyclists and swimmers. Samsung sells fitness bands and smartwatches.Overall shipments of wearable devices rose 223% year over year to 18.1 million in the second quarter, IDC reported.More wearables coming from Apple?""Anytime Apple enters a new market, not only does it draw attention to itself, but to the market as a whole,"" IDC analyst Ramon Llamas said in a statement. ""Fairly or not, Apple will become the stick against which other wearables are measured, and competing vendors need to stay current or ahead of Apple. Now that Apple is officially a part of the wearables market, everyone will be watching to see what other wearable devices it decides to launch, such as smart glasses or hearables.""Apple currently plays in the smart wearables category, or those devices capable of running third-party applications.""About two of every three smart wearables shipped this quarter was an Apple Watch,"" IDC analyst Jitesh Ubrani said in a statement. ""Apple has clearly garnered an impressive lead in this space and its dominance is expected to continue. And, although Fitbit outshipped Apple, it's worth noting that Fitbit only sells basic wearables — a category that is expected to lose share over the next few years, leaving Apple poised to become the next market leader for all wearables.""Apple Watch sales are poised to grow as Apple enters new geographic markets and retail channels. The Apple Watch is for sale in just 16 countries today. Best Buy (BBY) announced Tuesday that it is expanding Apple Watch availability to all 1,050 of its U.S. big-box stores by the end of September.Apple Watch numbers varyApple has been mum about Apple Watch shipments and sales.Last month, research firm Canalys estimated Apple shipped 4.2 million smartwatches in Q2. Canalys said Apple was the top wearable device vendor ahead of Fitbit for the period.Meanwhile, Strategy Analytics estimates that Apple shipped 4 million Apple Watch units in the second quarter. Shipments measure products delivered to the sales channel, including those not yet sold.Apple did not reveal how many Apple Watches it sold in the June quarter, but analysts estimate it sold about 2 million to 2.5 million units.Research firm Tractica predicts that smartwatches will surpass fitness trackers this year to become the top type of wearable device. Last year, fitness trackers accounted for 21.6 million units, or 61% of the wearables market, which also includes wearable cameras, body sensors, smart clothing and smart glasses.This year, Tractica estimates that smartwatches will account for 24.4 million units, or 41.3% of the wearables market by shipments. By comparison, fitness trackers will account for 23.4 million units, or 39.6% of the market, Tractica said.Fitbit went public in June and IBD gives Fitbit stock a strong 92 Composite Rating out of a possible 99, while Apple holds a 69 and Garmin a low 15. With the stock market in correction, however, few stocks are apt to be flashing any buy signals.RELATED:Apple No. 1 smartwatch vendor, but sales estimates vary.Apple Watch seen holding majority share through 2020.

482,BBY,"Black Friday is nearly upon us, and the National Retail Federation says that 136 million Americans plan to shop on Thanksgiving weekend.According to Cowen & Co., there will be deeper promotions this year amid elevated cold-weather apparel inventory and pricing investments by retailers.Cowen says most early promos are online as retailers try to gain ""mindshare"" earlier versus their peers and compete against Amazon (AMZN), Target (TGT), Kohl's (KSS) and Best Buy (BBY) are among big-box stores who've been running early promos.As consumers become more savvy and sophisticated, there's less need for standing in line waiting for in-store deals. Cowen says these Black Friday ""doorbusters"" are losing their appeal.Even still, retailers from Wal-Mart (WMT) to Macy's (M) to JCPenney (JCP) are opening their doors on Thanksgiving Day in anticipation of the traditional holiday shopping rush.Amazon shares rose 0.6% on the stock market today, close to Monday's record high.

""Specifically, government sales data for CE/appliances has continued to weaken on both a one- and two-year basis, and the last time we saw multiple months of negative CE retail sales growth (before this current streak) was late 2013/early 2014, when Best Buy missed its holiday sales plan.""Even Costco (COST) couldn't buck the recent trend as its October consumer electronics sales turned negative, Ciccarelli said. He also noted that major retailers Macy's (M) and Nordstrom (JWN) had missed top-line projections recently.""When combined with Best Buy's historical volatility around the holidays (since Q4 accounts for 50%-60% of earnings) and our view that the company needs to post sustained comp improvement for the stock to re-rate higher, we believe a more cautious stance is prudent,"" Ciccarelli said.On the plus side, Best Buy has vastly improved its competitive positioning through price-matching Amazon.com (AMZN) and others, and forming in-store vendor partnerships with technology leaders such as Apple (AAPL), Samsung, Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOGL)-owned Google, he said. These moves have helped Best Buy gain market share in consumer electronics retail.Best Buy is scheduled to report fiscal third quarter earnings before the market open on Thursday.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect the company to earn 35 cents a share, up 3% year over year, on sales of $8.83 billion, down 2%, in the October quarter.For the holiday sales quarter, analysts are modeling for Best Buy to earn $1.45 a share, down 2%, on sales of $13.90 billion, down 2%.Ultrahigh-definition, or 4K, television sets are likely to drive sales in the holiday season and through 2016, Ciccarelli said. But recent fast-growth categories such as fitness wearables, led by Fitbit (FIT), and action cameras, led by GoPro (GPRO), are showing signs of maturity, he said.Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter on Monday maintained his neutral rating and price target of 37 on Best Buy stock.He expects the company to post robust Q3 results thanks to strong management execution and growth in appliance sales.RELATED:GameStop weakness exposed by retail sales report.Ultra HD TVs going mainstream this holiday season.

While Watch unit sales have been roughly 6 million since launch, based on our analysis and improving consumer interest heading into the holiday season, we believe Watch sales in the December quarter should be close to the 5-million/6-million-unit mark.""Ives' Watch sales estimates are roughly in line with some others.Target stock was up a fraction in late trading in the stock market today, while Best Buy was down 1.5%.Asked if he'd left himself enough time for shopping after his Apple Watch checking Friday, Ives told IBD:""After 15 stores and counting I am ready for the weekend!

509,BBY,"Apple's (AAPL) iPad sales could surprise a few folks this holiday shopping season if a recent poll by retailer Best Buy (BBY) proves accurate.A nationwide survey of 2,000 adults by Best Buy found that the iPad was both the No. 1 tech gift people want to receive this holiday season and the No. 1 tech product they are interested in buying for themselves.Best Buy conducted its survey Sept. 21 to 27, which was about two weeks after Apple refreshed its tablet lineup. On Sept. 9, Apple announced its jumbo-screen 12.9-inch iPad Pro and its redesigned 7.9-inch iPad Mini 4. The iPad Pro starts at $799 and is expected to be available in November. The iPad Mini 4 starts at $399 and is available now.Apple is selling a total of five iPad models, each with a choice of data storage and wireless options. In addition to the iPad Pro and iPad Mini 4, it has the iPad Mini 2, which starts at $269, and two versions of the 9.7-inch iPad Air, starting at $399.The Best Buy survey revealed that 21% of respondents are interested in receiving an iPad as a gift, and 19% are interested in buying one for themselves this holiday season.Coming in second among most-wanted gifts to receive was the Bose QuietComfort 25 noise-cancelling headphones (18%), Best Buy said in a press release Thursday.Tied for third place at 15% each were Apple MacBook, Samsung 48-inch smart 4K Ultra HD TV and Sharp 43-inch smart HDTV with Roku.Other tech products in the top 15 included the Microsoft (MSFT) Surface tablet-notebook, Fitbit (FIT) Charge HR heart-rate and activity tracker, Apple Watch, iRobot (IRBT) Roomba vacuum and GoPro (GPRO) Hero 4 action camera.A survey by the Consumer Electronics Association found that TVs were the category most people desired as a holiday gift this year, followed by tablets.Among tech gadgets that consumers plan to give as gifts this holiday season, headphones and earbuds ranked first, followed by tablets, the CEA said earlier this month.Apple's iPad unit sales have fallen on a year-over-year basis for six straight quarters through June.Wall Street analysts expect iPad unit sales to fall again in the September quarter. Consensus estimates predict Apple will sell 10.5 million iPads in the just-finished quarter. That would be down 15% from the 12.3 million units sold in the September quarter last year. Apple is scheduled to report results for the September quarter on Tuesday.RELATED:Apple Watch holiday sales outlook underappreciated.Teens cool with Apple, but with GoPro they can't even.Teen demand for PS4, Xbox One game consoles strong.

595,BBY,"Retail sales disappoint in SeptemberRetail sales rose just 0.1% last month after an unchanged August. Auto sales were strong, but outside of the sector, sales slid 0.3%, the worst showing since January. Sales were unchanged excluding both autos and gas stations. Cheaper gas prices are hitting gas station revenue, but should be bolstering discretionary income for other spending. Nonstore sales — mostly ecommerce — fell 0.2%. So did electronics and appliance store sales.Several retailers' stocks fell sharply intraday as Wal-Mart Stores (WMT) announced that earnings in the next fiscal year will fall 6%-12% due to its heavy tech spending, wage increases and weak sales. Wal-Mart shares fell 9.3% to a 3-1/2-year low. Target (TGT) lost 3.7% and Dollar General (DG) 2.9%. But concerns about consumer spending spread further, with Best Buy (BBY) down 5% and Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) 4.4%.Producer prices fall sharplySeptember's producer price index slid 0.5%, the biggest fall in 8 months and more than the 0.2% drop expected. Wholesale energy prices fell 5.9% after August's 3.3% tumble. But core PPI, which excludes food and energy costs, still retreated 0.3% vs. views for a 0.1% increase. Year over year, wholesale prices fell 1.1%, with core wholesale inflation up 0.8%.Business inventories flat againBusiness stockpiles were flat in August after an unchanged July, revised down from a 0.1% gain. Retail inventories excluding autos, which are part of the GDP calculation, advanced 0.4% after July's 0.3% gain. Sales at all business levels fell 0.6% after July's 0.1% uptick. At the current sales pace, it would take 1.37 months for businesses to clear shelves.EU industrial production fallsExcluding construction, the European Union's industrial production fell 0.5% in August vs. July, matching views. Monthly output has expanded only once in the past five months. Year over year, growth slowed to a 0.9% gain in August from July's 1.7% gain. That's a four-month low. Analysts expected a gain of 1.8%. The U.K. jobless rate hit a 7-year low of 5.4% in the three months to August, the Office for National Statistics said. Workers' total earnings rose 3% from a year earlier, slightly less than expected. The Bank of England is considering rising pay as a factor in when it will raise the U.K.'s interest rates.

676,BBY,"Apple (AAPL) stock jumped to a record high Tuesday, a day after the company reported March-quarter earnings that pulverized Wall Street expectations. But shares soon dipped into the red on growth concerns for the company's core iPhone business.The Cupertino, Calif.-based company late Monday said it earned $2.33 a share in its fiscal second quarter ended March 28, up 40% year over year and 17 cents better than what Wall Street was targeting. Apple posted sales of $58.01 billion, up 27% and beating the consensus analyst forecast for $56.08 billion.Apple's gross profit margin was 40.8% in Q2, compared with 39.9% in the December quarter and 39.3% in the March quarter last year.For the June quarter, Apple forecast sales of $47 billion at the midpoint of guidance, in line with Wall Street. It also expects a gross profit margin of 38.5% to 39.5%.Apple also increased its cash return program by more than 50%. Under the expanded program, Apple plans to spend $200 billion in cash for stock buybacks and dividends by the end of March 2017. Apple increased its share repurchase authorization to $140 billion from the $90 billion level announced last year and boosted its quarterly dividend by 11%.Apple stock rose 1.4% to a new high of 134.54 in early trading on the stock market today. But shares soon retreated and were fractionally lower in early afternoon trading.1. iPhone drives Apple's businessApple sold 61.2 million iPhones in the March quarter, beating even the most optimistic forecasts. Wall Street was counting on sales of 58 million units.IPhone unit sales were up 40% year over year. By comparison, the total smartphone market saw unit sales rise 16% last quarter.""We're seeing fantastic results for iPhone, with revenue growth of 55% year on year,"" Apple CEO Tim Cook said on a conference call with analysts. ""And we're seeing a higher rate of switchers than we've seen in previous iPhone cycles.""Apple's iPhone is attracting customers who previously used Google (GOOGL) Android-based smartphones.The iPhone is doing especially well in emerging markets where unit sales rose 63% year on year, Cook said. IPhone revenue in China soared 70%.The iPhone accounted for 69% of Apple's revenue in Q2, same as in Q1.Apple estimates that about 20% of iPhone users have upgraded to iPhone 6 series handsets, so there's more room for growth.But several Wall Street analysts raised caution flags.Sales could lose steam as the pent-up demand for bigger-screen smartphones is served, some say.""We think iPhone sales are likely to decelerate meaningfully over the next few quarters creating headwinds for the stock,"" Mizuho Securities analyst Abhey Lamba said in a research report. ""There is a good chance that iPhone unit sales and total revenues could post year-over-year declines in the December 2015 quarter.""That would mark the first ever year-over-year drop in iPhone sales, he said. Lamba rates Apple stock as neutral, with a price target of 125.Pacific Crest Securities analyst Andy Hargreaves agrees.""The current level of upgrade activity and the current pace of share gains are likely to wane as the (iPhone) 6 cycle progresses and are not likely to be repeated in the next iPhone cycle,"" he said in a note. ""This seems very likely to lead to a decline in fiscal 2016 iPhone unit sales and revenue.""Hargreaves rates Apple stock as sector weight with a 12-month fair value of 133.2. iPad sales keep on shrinkingApple's iPad business had another rough quarter.It sold 12.6 million tablets, down 23%. IPad revenue sank 29% to $5.4 billion, or 9% of total sales.IPad sales are being cannibalized by the large-screen iPhone 6 handsets. But the company's enterprise partnership with IBM (IBM) should help reinvigorate sales as more business apps are developed for the tablet, FBR Capital Markets analyst Daniel Ives said in a report Tuesday.3. Mac sales defy overall PC market declineWhile the overall personal computer business is struggling, Apple's Mac continues to sell well.Apple sold nearly 4.6 million Macs in the quarter, up 10%. Meanwhile, the overall PC market saw unit shipments fall 6.7% last quarter, research firm IDC reported. PCs running Microsoft 's (MSFT) Windows operating system are dropping as customers wait for Windows 10, due out this summer.4. Apple Pay is gaining steamApple's mobile payment service, Apple Pay, continues to expand its reach.""We're seeing great momentum with Apple Pay,"" Cook said.Discover Card plans to support Apple Pay for contactless payments this fall. Meanwhile, the number of retailers accepting Apple Pay is climbing rapidly. Best Buy (BBY) will accept Apple Pay in all of its U.S. stores later this year.Locations that accept Apple Pay now stand at 700,000, up from 200,000 in October.""And merchants aren't the only ones jumping onboard,"" Cook said. ""Earlier this month, a leading health care payment network announced acceptance of Apple Pay for its clients. So over 50 major hospitals across the country, including Stanford Healthcare and Aspen Valley, will accept Apple Pay this year for co-pays and bill payments at registration and check in.""5. 'Other products' category decliningThe outperformance of iPhone is offsetting declines in the iPad and other products at Apple.Apple's iPhone, Mac and services business (iTunes, App Store, Apple Pay) are growing revenue, but the company's iPad and ""other products"" business are seeing year-over-year declines.""Other products"" includes iPod, Apple TV, Beats Electronics and Apple-branded and third-party accessories. The category saw sales fall 10% to $1.69 billion in Q2, missing the Street's estimate of $1.91 billion, FBR's Ives said.

678,BBY,"Wal-Mart Stores plans to cut prices to better compete with rival discounters in key markets, and it's relying on suppliers to help it achieve that goal.Greg Foran, CEO of Wal-Mart's (WMT) U.S. operations, said Wednesday that the world's largest retailer is looking closely at product sourcing as one avenue to cut costs and lower prices.In an address to investors and analysts, Foran noted that there has been a long recent slide in commodity prices, including in metals and petroleum.Wal-Mart plans to leverage that shift to lower its prices in some market segments. But he doesn't plan to slash prices across the board.""We're not in the game of looking at (price) rollbacks for the sake of rollbacks. It has to be measured,"" he said.Price reductions could be challenging to Wal-Mart's bottom line after it recently announced broad wage increases.Wal-Mart CEO Doug McMillon on Feb. 19 announced an immediate raise in the entry wage to at least $9 an hour in April. By February 2016, all employees will earn at least $10 an hour.""We're also strengthening our department manager roles and will raise the starting wage for some of these positions to at least $13 an hour this summer and at least $15 an hour early next year,"" he said.Wal-Mart will spend $1 billion to raise wages of half a million store employees.Wal-Mart is also putting pressure on suppliers to reduce joint marketing and use the savings to cut prices instead, the Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday.Foran said in his talk Wednesday that Wal-Mart is studying other ways to increase customer traffic amid weak profit and sales growth.He added that the company will focus on merchandising practices in weaker departments such as consumer electronics, where it struggles to compete with rivals such as Best Buy (BBY), Target (TGT) and Costco (COST).""Assortment is key to operating our business. You can run the cleanest, nicest, tidiest store you've ever seen, but if you don't have the right merchandise"" it doesn't matter, he said.Wal-Mart launched Project Reboot last year to improve merchandising, just before Foran was named U.S. CEO in July.He gave the program a mixed review: ""We made some adjustments to increase (merchandise) in this area and not in some others. I don't think we went far enough.""Foran indicated that Wal-Mart will emphasize department managers with merchandising and store-layout skills.Wal-Mart stock fell 1.9% to 80.71. It hit a record 90.97 on Jan. 13.

691,BBY,"Costco Wholesale (COST) will show investors how it capped the challenging holiday period when the warehouse club powerhouse reports second-quarter fiscal 2014 results Thursday morning.Costco will step up the pace of both sales and profit growth from Q1, if Wall Street is right,Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect a 6% rise in Q2 earnings to $1.17 a share. That would follow a 1% rise in Q1, but also would be the third straight quarter of single-digit profit gains. Revenue is seen rising 7.2% to $26.67 billion. That would be a faster pace than the prior quarter's 5% increase.Nomura analyst Robert Drbul initiated coverage on Costco with a buy rating in a Feb. 12 report. But he noted some challenges: ""While we are positive on the name, we note that head winds from FX have had a material impact on company results and anticipate this to continue throughout 2014,"" he wrote.On a positive note, he said: ""We admire the business model, membership fee renewal rates, consistent traffic gains, global square footage opportunity, and prospects for higher penetration of margin accretive private label products. We believe a premium valuation is warranted. We are also drawn to the warehouse club industry's membership fee structure, as it provides high visibility and predictability into the company's earnings.""Drbul is ""optimistic"" about the company's expansion opportunity. Costco aims to add 5% in total square footage this year, or around 30 new warehouses both domestically and overseas, he says. He expects a run rate of 30 to 35 new stores through 2016, with roughly half opening internationally.""We view international expansion as a great opportunity for both top-line growth and margin expansion as international stores are more profitable,"" he said.He pegs Costco's Q2 earnings at $1.18 a share.Retailers have faced some tough sledding this holiday-quarter earnings season with disappointing results the past week or so from many top chains, including giant discounters Wal-Mart Stores (WMT)andTarget (TGT)and upscale department store operator Nordstrom (JWN).Overall, Q4 retail earnings are expected to fall 6.1% from a year earlier, according to Ken Perkins, president of Retail Metrics. That's actually a little better than prior estimates, thanks to better-than-expected results from Best Buy (BBY) and Sears Holdings (SHLD). That would compare with forecasts for S&P 500 earnings growth of 8.5%.

"
694,BBY,"Best Buy (BBY), BlackBerry (BBRY), Cars.com and E-Trade Financial (ETFC) opted out after running ads last year. CareerBuilder.com, Hulu and TaxAct, which advertised two years ago, are sitting out a second straight big game.
"
695,BBY,"The event, though, continues to be the single most-watched TV show of the year. Last year's Super Bowl had a U.S. TV audience of 108.4 million, making it the No. 3 most-viewed program in TV history. It trailed two earlier Super Bowls, 111.3 million viewers in 2011 and 111 million in 2010.

"
731,BBY,"""The Super Bowl has always taken place the first peak filing weekend of the tax season,"" she said. ""That's especially true this year, given that the IRS officially opens the start of tax season on Jan. 31.""Tech companies are taking a pass on this year's Super Bowl.At this point, we could find only two tech companies, GoDaddy and Intuit (INTU), set to run ads for Super Bowl XLVIII on Feb. 2.Best Buy (BBY), BlackBerry (BBRY), Cars.com and E-Trade Financial (ETFC) opted out after running ads last year. CareerBuilder.com, Hulu and TaxAct, which advertised two years ago, are sitting out a second straight big game.The event, though, continues to be the single most-watched TV show of the year. Last year's Super Bowl had a U.S. TV audience of 108.4 million, making it the No. 3 most-viewed program in TV history. It trailed two earlier Super Bowls, 111.3 million viewers in 2011 and 111 million in 2010.Companies, though, have 4 million reasons to stay on the bench. The average price of a 30-second ad is $4 million, up from $3.7 million to $3.8 million last year.The thinning field of tech participants doesn't surprise Jeri Smith, chief executive of Communicus. The ad research company says its own study found just one in five ads from last year's game truly helped advertisers sell products.""A lot of these guys don't have money to waste,"" Smith said. ""If you're Coke or Pepsi, you don't really care because it's only $4 million. But smaller-budget advertisers really have to take a hard look.""Apple, Google Rarely In GameThe tech firms with the most dough, for the most part, have skipped the big game. Apple's (AAPL) famed ""1984"" commercial — with the scrappy young Apple taking on the gray, old, Big Brotherish IBM stand-in — is among the most successful ads ever, but the company has refrained ever since. Google (GOOG), too, has run just one Super Bowl commercial. Spokespersons for both companies didn't return emails, but so far no signs have surfaced of any ad for the big game this year.Best Buy, facing plenty of other problems, is bowing out after sponsoring the game the last three years. It wants to be more flexible with its ad dollars, company spokesman Jon Sandler told IBD via email.""We look at all advertising opportunities, including the Super Bowl, on a case-by-case basis, and this year we made a deliberate decision to allocate our advertising dollars on a broader assortment of programming in order to connect with consumers,"" Sandler said.Online investment firm E-Trade and its ""talking baby"" commercials are on the sidelines after backing the game for six straight years.It wants to spread its ad dollars more evenly, Rich Muhlstock, E-Trade senior vice president of branding and acquisition, said in a company statement.Sports remains an important pillar for the company, he said, but ""we are broadening our mix to include other lifestyle environments that are also important to our audience."" Cars.com also is ending six straight years of Super Bowl ads.Last year, Cars.com, which helps consumers hook up with car dealers online, used the Super Bowl to launch its ""All Drive, No Drama"" marketing campaign.The company received ""fantastic results"" last year and sees no need for a repeat, Linda Bartman, Cars.com's chief marketing officer, told IBD via email.""Given this is the second year of the campaign, we don't feel that we need the Super Bowl as a platform to launch new creative and are instead going to increase our overall media weight throughout the entire year,"" she said.But Smith of Communicus says many advertisers simply fail to score.

743,BBY,"Microsoft (MSFT) on Wednesday launched a campaign to win back consumers with the release of Windows 10, a PC operating system that brings back the familiar Start menu while adding a bunch of new features.Microsoft alienated many consumers with its last operating system, Windows 8, released in October 2012. Windows 8 featured a revamped user interface designed for touchscreens when few PCs had them. It was clunky to use with a keyboard and mouse and hard to navigate because it lacked the traditional Start menu to find programs and files.As a mea culpa to consumers, Microsoft is offering Windows 10 as a free upgrade to owners of Windows 7 and 8 PCs for the next year. The software was available for download and installation starting Wednesday in 190 countries.PC makers including Lenovo, Hewlett-Packard (HPQ), Dell and Acer are selling new laptop and desktop computers with Windows 10 pre-installed. Retailers such as Best Buy (BBY) and Staples (SPLS) started selling Win 10 machines Wednesday.Microsoft has set a goal of getting Windows 10 on 1 billion devices within two to three years.Business and enterprise customers flatly rejected Windows 8, sticking with Windows 7 for their PCs. But they've shown a big interest in Windows 10.Nearly 75% of information technology professionals surveyed by Spiceworks plan to deploy Windows 10 within two years. And 40% of respondents plan to roll out Windows 10 within the first year.""For Microsoft, the principal aim of Windows 10 is to a) remain relevant in the enterprise space and b) re-gain mindshare in the consumer space,"" Juniper Research analyst Steffen Sorrell said in a blog post.Enterprises 'Perceive Value'Microsoft's Windows 10 misstep helped Apple's (AAPL) Macintosh computers and iPad tablets gain ground and provided a foothold for Google (GOOGL) Chrome PCs in the market.While Microsoft is offering free upgrades to Windows 10 for consumer PCs, it is charging for upgrades to enterprise PCs.""On the commercial side (of the Windows business), they're in pretty good shape,"" Roger Kay, an analyst with Endpoint Technologies Associates, told IBD. ""There they can charge (for Windows) because those customers really perceive the value.""Initial reviews for Windows 10 have been solidly positive.The most enticing feature of Windows 10 is the return of the traditional Start menu. New features with Windows 10 include the Cortana personal digital assistant, the Edge Web browser, as well as enhanced security to help safeguard against viruses, malware and phishing.""Early reviews have been very encouraging,"" Pacific Crest Securities analyst Brendan Barnicle said in a research report Tuesday. ""Reviewers cite a variety of compelling features.""Some reviews prefer the speed and efficiency over Windows 7 because of faster boot times, pooled storage, improved networking and an enhanced Task Manager. Others report that the voice-activated Cortana digital assistant is very helpful for a variety of tasks, including adjusting system functions. Finally, reports are favorable on Microsoft's new Web browser, Edge.""The potential impact of Windows 10 on Microsoft's bottom line has been largely ignored by investors, Barnicle said. But it could be a source of upside to current expectations, he said.About 250 million PCs worldwide are still running Windows XP, the 14-year-old operating system that Microsoft stopped supporting last year, Barnicle said. Those machines are ""prime candidates"" for being replaced with new Windows 10 PCs, he said.A big question is whether Windows 10 can boost flagging PC sales.Quarters that include a Windows operating system launch historically generate stronger-than-average seasonal demand for PCs, Morgan Stanley analyst Katy Huberty said in a research report.The Windows 10 release is timed with the back-to-school PC buying season and ahead of the holiday shopping season. PC vendors are hoping for a boost in PC sales to make up for lax demand in the first half of 2015.While Windows 10 can run on PCs that are a few years old, some of its newest features will need new hardware, Technalysis Research analyst Bob O'Donnell said in a blog post .For instance, to take full advantage of Cortana, Microsoft's answer to Apple's Siri, you'll need a PC with array microphones so the software can understand your spoken questions and commands.Windows 10 has a biometric log-in feature that points to a password-less future, O'Donnell said. To use it, you'll need a fingerprint reader or an integrated 3-D camera for facial recognition, he said.RELATED:How Microsoft's Windows 10 is like Coca-Cola Classic.

S&P Capital IQ analyst Angelo Zino initiated coverage of Fitbit stock on Wednesday with a hold rating and 12-month price target of 50. Fitbit's growth prospects are already reflected in the rich valuation of its stock, he said.Fitbit leapt to a record high of 48.98 in morning trading in the stock market today. In afternoon trading, Fitbit shares were up 4%, near 47.50. Fitbit went public at 20 on June 18.""From a top-line growth perspective, we see (Fitbit) revenue increasing 90% this year and an additional 29% in 2016,"" Zino said in a report. ""We are optimistic about the prospects of the overall wearables space, as we see the potential for the entire market to more than double this year, as consumer interest increases and manufacturers develop new innovative devices.""Key growth areas are international markets as well as a greater focus on health and fitness by individuals and employers.""Fitbit is well-positioned to take advantage of the opportunities within the health and fitness category, given its market share lead position and competitive product offerings,"" Zino said.Competition Heating UpZino's biggest concern is the valuation of Fitbit stock, which has more than doubled since its IPO just four weeks ago.Competitive threats are another concern, Zino said. Fitbit competes with Garmin (GRMN), Jawbone and other fitness band makers. And it is likely to see increasing competition from smartphone makers like Apple (AAPL), Samsung and Xiaomi, he said. Apple debuted the Apple Watch in April.On Monday, a bunch of Wall Street analysts initiated coverage of Fitbit.Investment banks Deutsche Bank, Piper Jaffray, Stifel and SunTrust Robinson Humphrey gave the stock a buy rating or the equivalent.But Morgan Stanley rated Fitbit as equal weight, while Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Raymond James rated it neutral and market perform, respectively.Meanwhile, Deutsche Bank analyst Mike Baker said Wednesday that Fitbit will give retailer Best Buy (BBY) a slight boost this year.Fitbit products could boost Best Buy same-store sales by 0.2% this year, he said. ""While this may seem paltry, when we consider that Best Buy's domestic comp was just 1% last year and up just 0.6% in Q1 2015, even a 20 basis point impact should be helpful.""In 2014, Best Buy accounted for 12% of Fitbit's total sales. Zino assumes this will drop to 10% in 2015 and 8% in 2016 as Fitbit expands its distribution.

747,BBY,"In 2007, Taser International reached a pivotal moment in its history. The company had developed a hot product, an electrical stun gun, but its future was cloudy.""At the time, it was overly founder-driven,"" said Rick Smith, who co-founded Taser (TASR) with his brother, Tom, in 1993. ""My brother and I were feeling overwhelmed.""Smith admits that he became ""a chronic micromanager"" even as the company hit $100 million in sales. He prided himself on solving every problem, but doing so stymied his ability to lead effectively.To address his shortcomings, Smith recruited a handful of senior managers from large corporations such as Intel (INTC) and Best Buy (BBY). But they proved a poor fit for the smaller firm.Overhauling his hiring strategy, Smith shifted gears. Instead of pursuing seasoned corporate managers, he launched a leadership development program to attract recent college graduates.Starting in 2009, Taser recruited at Harvard, Stanford and other top schools. The firm, based in Scottsdale, Ariz., rotated the newcomers through five or six business units.""That way, we could see what they were good at, and they could see what they liked the most,"" Smith said. ""They became free agents within the company to take on projects that came up.""Taser has put about 30 people through the program, Smith says. Some of its early participants have emerged as top managers at the 500-employee company.Up For DebateSmith, 45, credits a rigorous interview process as crucial to the program's success. He asks candidates to spar over a hot-button societal issue of their choice such as abortion or gay marriage. About 10 senior executives, including Smith, observe the proceedings.""We say to them, 'Pick something you're passionate about and debate each other,'"" he explained. ""We tell them we won't hire based on personal beliefs. We're looking for how respectful they are of opposing views, to what extent they go into full combat mode and how they articulate their beliefs and express their passion when under pressure.""A few years before Smith unveiled Taser's leadership development program, he decided to shift the company from what he calls ""a one-hit wonder"" with its electrical weapons to a developer of technology including wearable cameras and cloud-based software. The company had survived near-disaster in 2005 when it faced a flood of lawsuits tied to police use of Tasers.""I thought, 'There has to be an opportunity here,'"" Smith recalled. ""I tend to view crises as opportunity yelling at you.""Smith and his team asked, ""What other problems can we solve for our customers?"" Knowing that police departments faced public distrust and litigation, the Taser brain trust focused on wearable cameras and cloud-based software to store images from the cameras.Getting The Bugs Out""We had to build our own software, and it was a complicated system to build,"" Smith said. ""We needed two years to debug the system and get it to work the way we wanted. By late 2012, we finally got some traction, and (sales) started to take off.""Sales have stayed strong since a series of police shootings of civilians in 2014 and this year. The resulting public outcry has led police departments to order nonlethal weapons such as Taser's stun guns and video recorders such as Taser's Axon body cameras, which can download video into Taser's Evidence.com data management system.

761,BBY,"Stocks stumbled to fresh session lows Thursday afternoon amid weak earnings from big banks, mixed economic data and a shock in the currency markets.The Nasdaq tumbled 1.3% and the S&P 500 dropped 0.8%. They fell below technical levels of 4600 and 2000, respectively. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones industrial average gave up 0.7%.

The homebuilder delivered Q4 earnings above views and sales in line with views before the open. But like rival KB Home (KBH), it also warned of lower margins. Lennar shares were up more than 2% and down as much as 7% intraday. KB Home shares slumped 6%.Elsewhere, Best Buy (BBY) shaved a 17% loss to 13%. Earlier, the electronics retailer reported higher holiday sales, but warned of a challenging environment ahead.On the upside, NetEase (NTES) rose 2% to an all-time high in fast trade. It cleared a 107.56 buy point from a flat base. The Chinese online gaming firm has delivered three straight quarters of accelerating earnings growth. It's expected to have extended that streak with its Q4 earnings.Citigroup (C) reported earnings that missed the Street's estimate by a third. The stock sank almost 4% in heavy volume.Economic data were mixed. The Empire State manufacturing gauge for January was stronger than expected, but the Philadelphia Fed's manufacturing gauge was weaker than expected. Meanwhile, first-time jobless claims were higher than the Street's consensus estimate.Outside the U.S., Switzerland and India supplied some surprises. The Swiss National Bank decided to end support for the euro vs. the franc, triggering panic among currency traders. In India, the central bank cut interest rates, a move allowed because of lower inflation.

764,BBY,"Samsung took the wraps off its new mobile payment system at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, while eBay's (EBAY) PayPal said it would acquire startup Paydiant, whose digital wallet technology is being used by major retailers.PayPal, which eBay plans to spin off, will reportedly pay about $280 million for Wellesley, Mass.-based Paydiant.Mobile payments is a crowded space, with Apple (AAPL), PayPal and Google (GOOGL) among those aiming to win.Google last month said the biggest U.S. wireless carriers — AT&T (T), T-Mobile US (TMUS) and Verizon Communications (VZ) will pre-install the Google Wallet mobile payments app on Android phones later this year.As part of that deal, Google is acquiring technology and intellectual property from Softcard, a joint venture of wireless firms.Merchant Customer Exchange (MCX) — a retail consortium with powerful backers including Wal-Mart (WMT), Best Buy (BBY) and more than 60 others — is expected to launch its payment system later in 2015. MCX last year agreed to use Paydiant's payment processing technology.Samsung announced its payment system as part of the rollout of the Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge smartphones.Samsung Pay will first be available in Q3 in the U.S. and in South Korea, before being expanded to other markets. Samsung has lined up support from MasterCard (MA) and Visa (V) as well as American Express (AXP), Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup (C)and JPMorgan Chase (JPM).Security is a key selling point, as with Apple Pay, says Ashwin Shirvaikar, an analyst at Citigroup, said in a research report. Apple introduced Apple Pay in September as part of its iPhone 6 launch.With both systems, users authenticate transactions with their fingerprint. Samsung also employs ""tokenization"" security technology, which generates a single-use, random digital code during transactions, instead of transmitting 16-digit credit-card numbers.Apple Pay uses near-field communications, a short-range wireless technology, to send data to payment readers. Analysts say just 15% of U.S. retail locations have NFC-equipped sales terminals.Samsung Pay supports NFC but also magnetic stripe transmission technology. Samsung recently acquired LoopPay, which developed MST technology for mobile wallets. When launched, the Samsung mobile wallet will be usable at 90% of merchants, says Shirvaikar.Some retailers have opted not to partner with Apple, so Samsung could have an edge, he says.""(MST) capability is difficult for a merchant to block — recall merchants have successfully blocked Apple Pay. MasterCard and Visa credit, debit and prepaid cardholders should be able to use the new Galaxy S6 to pay in store for purchases,"" Shirvaikar wrote.Goldman Sachs analyst Marcus Shin, in a report, said Samsung ""could embed the LoopPay mobile wallet solution into its phones and eventually into wearables, allowing the company to penetrate into the mobile payments landscape ... . While Apple Pay penetration is partly constrained by NFC adoption, this is unlikely to be a key constraint over the long term.""

""We'll start to see some more progress, but there are some roadblocks in the way for housing that won't allow it to explode to the upside.""The rebound in residential real estate has been stop-and-go as small wage gains and lingering concerns about taking on more debt offset the benefits of historically low mortgage rates. In order to strengthen, the economy needs more pronounced momentum from housing as manufacturing remains sluggish.A series of factory reports Thursday indicated the industry remains tepid this month against a backdrop of weaker global growth and a strong dollar. The Markit Economics preliminary May manufacturing index dropped to the lowest level since January 2014. The Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City's gauge showed a third month of contraction and is the weakest since April 2009, a product of the slowdown in U.S. oil exploration.Factory HeadwindsThe effects of the labor dispute at West Coast ports earlier this year ""should continue to wane, but the stronger dollar may prove to be a headwind to the sector for quite some time,"" Wells Fargo Securities economists Tim Quinlan and Erik Nelson wrote in a note to clients.The news Thursday wasn't all bad. The average number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits over the past four weeks dropped to a 15-year low, while the Conference Board's index of leading economic indicators climbed in April by the most in nine months.Stocks rose, with the Standard & Poor's 500 Index topping its record, amid better-than-forecast results from Salesforce.com (CRM) and Best Buy (BBY), while gauges of the strength of the economy were mixed.The median forecast in a Bloomberg survey for existing-home sales in April called for a rise to 5.23 million after a previously reported 5.19 million a month earlier.Existing-home sales, tabulated when a purchase contract closes, account for more than 90% of the residential market. New-home purchases, which make up about 8% and are tabulated when contracts are signed, are considered a timelier barometer. The Commerce Department will issue those data on May 26. The median sales price of an existing home climbed 8.9% from a year earlier, the biggest 12-month gain since January 2014, to $219,400, the NAR report showed.

837,BBY,"The Super Bowl is becoming a game of soaring costs and more conservative game plans for tech companies.As usual, few tech companies are playing the ad game for the show that consistently is the most viewed of the year. That viewership carries a price: The cost of a 30-second ad in this year's game telecast is $4.4 million to $4.5 million, up from $4 million last year.Longtime players GoDaddy and Intuit (INTU) are in, but are cutting back. Regular big-game advertisers BlackBerry (BBRY) and Cars.com are staying on the sidelines for a second straight year. (Past advertisers E-Trade (ETFC), Hulu and Best Buy (BBY) declined to say if they would, or wouldn't, run ads this time.)But the Feb. 1 telecast is attracting some tech rookies. Recent IPO Wix.com (WIX) and privately held Mophie are making their Super Bowl ad debuts. Privately held Squarespace is suiting up for a second consecutive appearance.Last year's game, won handily by the Seattle Seahawks over the Denver Broncos, scored a record audience of 111.48 million viewers, edging the previous record of 111.34 million who tuned in to watch Super Bowl XLVI in 2012, says market tracker Nielsen.GoDaddy has been one of the Super Bowl's most consistent tech advertisers. The Web domain and services company has paid for two 30-second ads in most years since it began backing the game 11 years ago, but will run just a single 30-second spot this time.GoDaddy Focuses ElsewhereThe company still believes in the Super Bowl, but for now it's focused on directing more of its marketing budget to expand its business offshore, says Barb Rechterman, GoDaddy's chief marketing officer.""We have expanded our international footprint, with Q4 2014 and Q1 2015 marketing spends in Latin America and Europe, as well as India,"" she told IBD. ""As we grow globally, we're more focused on sharing the marketing dollars.""Intuit also is scaling back for an event well-timed for the company, as it comes near the start of the tax season.The business and tax software maker will have just one 60-second spot this year vs. one 60-second and one 30-second ad last year.Intuit's single ad will focus on its TurboTax tax preparation software, Intuit spokeswoman Colleen Gatlin said via email. ""Last year was a strong year where TurboTax units grew 14% year-over-year, as the do-it-yourself category grew 6% over the prior year, making tax software the fastest-growing tax preparation choice for U.S. taxpayers,"" she wrote.Cars.com dropped out last year after running ads the previous six games, and it's idle again this year.Closing the door on the Super Bowl opens opportunities elsewhere, Linda Bartman, Cars.com's chief marketing officer, said in an email.""By shifting our spending away from the Super Bowl, it allowed (us) to be on air, in front of even more car shoppers more frequently throughout the entire year,"" she wrote. ""We saw very positive results from our efforts and want to exceed those in 2015.""The Super Bowl, though, continues to attract some new tech players.Squarespace, a Web services company, is returning with one 30-second ad after backing the game for the first time last year, according to Advertising Age magazine.The two known rookie tech advertisers, Mophie and Wix.com, each plan to run one 30-second ad.Mophie sells battery cases and related accessories for mobile devices, while Wix helps its customers develop websites and Web services.Like other advertisers, Mophie is counting on the Super Bowl providing immediate consumer awareness for its products, says Kevin Malinowski, Mophie's marketing manager, in an email.""Most mobile users today are unaware these products even exist,"" he said. ""Broadcast advertising is one avenue we haven't taken in the past, but it's certainly one that amplifies the loudest. As a brand, Mophie is bold. So when discussions began around broadcast advertising, we naturally honed in on the biggest, boldest spot available.""Wix has no misgivings about the Super Bowl's costly entry fee, says Eric Mason, Wix's director of strategic marketing and communications.""We didn't set the price,"" Mason told IBD. ""We wanted to tell our story and find the biggest stage in which to do it, and this is the logical place to be.""Targets Only Helena, Mont.The Verge, the technology news website owned by privately held digital publisher Vox Media, is also running a Super Bowl ad, but just in one small market, Helena, Mont., population 28,000. It will pay $700 for the ad. Vox confirms the ad but isn't saying much about what could be sort of a test. The ad is already up on The Verge's YouTube channel. The commercial shows The Verge as part of ""the future.""Comcast's (CMCSA) NBC is televising this year's game and is making it a free streaming event for all, with hopes the move will promote the cable giant's ""TV Anywhere"" initiative. And the game will be played at the University of Phoenix Stadium in Glendale, Ariz., near Phoenix. The home of the Arizona Cardinals NFL team is operated by ... another unit of Comcast. It doesn't appear Comcast is running any ads during the game, though.Do tech companies get much of a return from Super Bowl ads?The number of unique visitors to GoDaddys's website fell 5.6% last February vs. January despite its commercial that aired during the Feb. 2, 2014, Super Bowl between Seattle and Denver, but traffic jumped 90.5% in March vs. February, according to market tracker ComScore.Squarespace.com's traffic, similarly, fell 11.3% last February vs. January but soared 143% in March vs. February.The traffic spikes in March for both sites aren't necessarily Super Bowl-related, ComScore analyst Adam Lella said via email.""It might be difficult to attribute that (March gain) to the Super Bowl ads,"" he wrote.Traffic to Intuit's websites rose 39% in February vs. January but then fell 26% in March vs. February. Traffic remained steady from March through April, during income-tax season.Web traffic to Wix.com last year remained steady at more than 6 million unique visitors a month from January through April.The company has 58 million users worldwide who use its website design software and services for free, and another 1.4 million users who pay for the company's advanced services.The Super Bowl ad, says Mason, could boost those numbers.""For us, it's about brand building and letting people know who we are as a company,"" he said. ""We are probably one of the larger big companies that nobody has heard about.""

It also mandates that Ultra HD players are capable of playing back current Blu-ray Discs.The UHD specification should fuel sales of UHD televisions and set-top boxes, benefiting consumer electronics vendors like Samsung and Sony (SNE) and retailers like Best Buy (BBY).Consumer electronics manufacturers and retailers hope to have Ultra HD Blu-ray products in time for the holiday shopping season.The 4K display market is expected to reach $52 billion in 2020, up from $9.2 billion last year, research firm IHS reported last month.""Since its market introduction in 2013, TV brands have recognized that 4K is a great way to enhance value, so they have strongly promoted 4K models,"" David Hsieh, senior director of display research for IHS, said in a statement. ""4K content and broadcasting availability is also on the rise, which is helping more TV buyers recognize the value of this feature.""

1033,BBY,"Richard Crone, head of Crone Consulting, says HCE and Paydiant's system are part of a broader trend toward cloud-based and ""tokenized"" mobile wallets aimed at improving security.
"
1034,BBY,"The concept works like this: When consumers register for a digital wallet, they initially provide a 16-digit credit card account number. The wallet then generates a substitute identifier, such as temporary random numbers, called a payment token.
"
1035,BBY,"""When the transaction is tokenized, that's game-changing,"" Crone said.Wireless phone companies have yet to gain traction in mobile wallets, and the new HCE software technology, which stores payment information in the Internet cloud, will make it even tougher for them.The fast-emerging HCE, or host card emulation, stores users' payment information in the cloud rather than in a mobile phone's hardware. It's typically stored within the SIM (subscriber identity module) card in handsets that authenticate subscribers and, with a so-called ""secure element,"" a payer's digital ID.Wireless phone companies aim to make money by charging fees to banks and payment service providers for managing their apps on secure SIM cards.Banks Don't Need TelecomsWith cloud-based HCE, ""banks can retain control of their customers without needing to partner with mobile network operators,"" said Windsor Holden, analyst at U.K.-based Juniper Research. ""The removal of the secure element from the equation significantly weakens the grip of the mobile operators on the value chain.""That would be a problem for Isis, the mobile payment service joint venture of AT&T (T), T-Mobile US (TMUS) and Verizon Wireless (VZ). They launched Isis in November.Another problem for Isis is that Apple's (AAPL) popular iPhones lack near-field communication chips. NFC is a short-range wireless communications technology that connects smartphones with payment readers.Isis, formed in 2010, was one of the mobile payment initiatives to support NFC. Apple, which doesn't yet offer a mobile wallet of its own but is widely expected to soon do so, has been looking at other technologies.Morgan Stanley estimates that only 15% of some 125 million postpaid wireless subscribers at the three wireless firms had mobile phones with built-in NFC chips as of mid-2013.Google (GOOG) has struggled in mobile payments because of its early support for NFC technology, analysts say. Sprint (S), the only big four wireless firm not in Isis, uses Google Wallet.The irony is that while NFC-based platforms are expected to get a lift from HCE, Isis might not.Visa (V) and MasterCard (MA) in February endorsed HCE-based platforms. Google supported HCE software with the release of Android 4.4 software for mobile phones in late 2013.HCE enables the Google Wallet app to spread beyond Sprint.

1045,BBY,"Cyber cash registers rang less loudly on Christmas Day, as traffic slowed after a flood of early season discounts prodded more people to avoid being procrastinators.U.S. online sales rose 8.3% on Thursday vs. Dec. 25, 2013, just half the 16.5% year-over-year jump last Christmas, says IBM's (IBM) Smarter Commerce, which tracks sales from 800 websites in the U.S.Online sales growth also tumbled on Thanksgiving Day, Black Friday and Cyber Monday.But ChannelAdvisor, which helps third-party retailers sell on big e-tail sites, tracked 14.% year-over-year growth from Thanksgiving through Dec. 21, on pace with projections from various research firms. ComScore tracked 15% year-over-year U.S. online sales growth Nov. 1 through Dec. 23, just below its projections for 16% growth for the last two months of the year.Much of the decline in growth on Christmas and those other big days is because sellers such as Amazon.com (AMZN) and Best Buy (BBY) offered deep discounts in early November, says Jay Henderson, director of IBM Smarter Commerce.""The holiday season started earlier and lasted a little bit longer, and that meant that people didn't do as much shopping on the key days,"" Henderson told IBD, ""but the overall shopping period should turn out pretty good.""Henderson says consumers have reasons to shop on Christmas Day.""People were probably looking for items on their wish list that no one got for them,"" he said, while others ""got gifts and forgot to get one for the giver in return.""Online sales on Dec. 25 for retailers were hit and miss. Sales were flat at Overstock.com (OSTK), with one big exception. The number of electronic gift cards bought and sent via e-mail to recipients jumped 54% vs. the last year. The monetary value assigned to those cards doubled. That spike indicates one thing, Overstock President Stormy Simon told IBD: ""Last-minute shoppers.""Sales at For the Fit, an online men's clothier, jumped 44% on Christmas Day, outpacing its 30% increase from Nov. 1 through Dec. 23. The site specializes in hard-to-find sizes. Christmas Day sales involved ""people buying more of what they had already purchased, or gift recipients who liked what they got and said 'I need more,'"" company CEO Consuelo Bova told IBD.Sales at PickleballCentral.com, a seller of gear for playing pickleball, a game that combines elements of racketball and tennis, fell 4% on Christmas Day vs. that day last year. But its sales skyrocketed 162% on Christmas Eve, and it says sales are up 58% in December.Sales on Christmas Day at eBags, a retailer of luggage and handbags, were flat vs. Dec. 25, 2013.That was disappointing after the company reported strong sales on other key shopping days, says Rob Cassidy, eBags' interim CEO.""We set records on Cyber Monday, Black Friday, Green Monday — we had record sales on all of those days, so I expected Christmas to be a little stronger than it was,"" he told IBD.Christmas Day shoppers did buy more than last year. Henderson says the average order size on Christmas Day rose 6.2% to $100.33 vs. the same day last year.""It's reasonably strong, so that is another good sign that online shopping is healthy this holiday season,"" he said.

1047,BBY,"Steep early promotions led to a disappointing Thanksgiving weekend. Meanwhile, Amazon (AMZN) and other online rivals continue to take a bigger slice of a limited retail pie.Still, retailers are on track to deliver the best holiday season in three years.Michael Niemira, principal of The Retail Economist, is sticking to his forecast for combined November-December sales growth of 2.9% after a Scrooge-like 0.9% increase last year. That's based on Census Bureau's GAFO (general merchandise, apparel, furniture and other, including electronics and sporting goods), and would be the best gain since 2011.""The key difference this holiday vs. last year and the last few years is the stronger economy, which is the underpinning for holiday spending,"" Niemira said.Mobile Still ActiveTop gift items were consumer electronics, especially mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets, says Marshal Cohen, NPD Group's chief industry analyst. Home decor products, small appliances and activewear were also big winners, he says.Bill Martin, founder of ShopperTrak sees retailers on track to show a 3.8% gain in GAFO sales for November and December.""That's a pretty good number,"" he told IBD.November retail sales rose 5.4%, fueled by an ""early push"" that helped offset an underperforming Thanksgiving weekend, says Martin. It took until the week before Christmas for consumers to get ""ramped up again, which is going on right now.""Sales on the last pre-Christmas Saturday likely rose 0.5% above last year to about $9.16 billion, according to Martin's preliminary tally. That would just top Black Friday's sales of roughly $9.1 billion, making Super Saturday the No. 1 shopping day for the first time in 10 years.Thomson Reuters analysts see December same-store sales rising 4%, up from 2013's 3.5%.""That suggests shoppers hit the malls this month,"" said Jharonne Martis, director of consumer research, via email.Ken Perkins, president of Retail Metrics, says it was a ""decent holiday, fueled by a good jobs picture and significantly lower gas prices.""But apparel was ""soft"" due to a lack of fashion and as consumers focused spending on other areas, such as home furnishings, electronics and accessories.Best Buy (BBY), Williams-Sonoma (WSM), Lowe's (LOW) and Home Depot (HD) were among retailers with good holiday sales, he says.Thomson Reuters analysts forecast the home improvement segment will be the big winner in the November-to-January quarter with a 5.3% same-store sales rise, followed by footwear at 4.6% and jewelry at 4.1%.""The season shows that the consumer is alive and kicking a lot harder than you would think,"" adds Brian Sozzi, CEO of Belus Capital Advisors. ""You really got a good feel of what 5% GDP (growth) meant for retailers during this holiday.""Consumers were buying the priciest items at stores such as Best Buy, J.C. Penney (JCP) and Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS), Sozzi said. At Best Buy they snapped up GoPro (GPRO) action cameras and the Apple (AAPL) iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus.Expensive lightweight jackets and hoodies from Nike (NKE) and Under Armour (UA) were also hot, says Sozzi.Cohen says the season turned out OK. ""Retailers had an early start, a lull (later) that was expected, and a strong finish through Christmas (Eve),"" he said. ""Now they have the gift cards, the returns and exchanges. There's still more revenue to come for retailers.""Retailers Didn't 'Panic'Retailers did a ""very good job"" all year managing inventory, including doorbusters, Cohen said. Except for mall-based apparel chains, they mostly stuck to their planned holiday promotions, a good sign for profit margins.""They weren't in a panic mode,"" Cohen said.Perkins estimates holiday online sales — from pure play e-tailers to brick-and-mortar stores — rose 15%, with traditional chains' online business up 10% to 15%.He says traditional stores such as Macy's (M) and Nordstrom (JWN) are getting a ""handle on"" ecommerce with features like ordering online and in-store pickup.""They're doing a better job of capturing online sales and not just feeding them to Amazon.""

But PriceGrabber found that 33% of survey takers believe the best deals will be after Thanksgiving, and 24% think December brings lower prices.Goldstein tells merchants to dangle special offers throughout the season: ""Retailers need to be significantly more nimble on this front.""To entice weekday browsers in December, Minnesota's Mall of America is promoting its Holiday Happy Hour. Those turning up Mondays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays receive free valet parking and other perks from 1 p.m. to 7 p.m.• Home for the holidays. Shopping two ways — online and in stores — ""gives the consumer the maximum amount of flexibility,"" Goldstein said. Persnickety cyberbuyers expect e-commerce perks. ""You see a lot of free shipping offers this year vs. last year.""• Silent night. ""We really feel our store experience is important every day of the year,"" said Jon Abt, co-president of electronics firm Abt. Except Thanksgiving, when his 100,000-square-foot Chicago-area electronics and appliance showroom is closed. Abt says the 77-year-old firm doesn't feel pressure to open before Black Friday.""We're more tuned into continuing a trend all weekend,"" Abt said.The company also promoted pre-Black Friday deals.• Melt frosty types. Warming customer hearts requires amiable and adept service, plus abundant product on hand. Abt tells the store's 1,200 employees: ""The answer is yes to any reasonable request. We want every customer to walk in excited and walk out extremely happy.""• Keep 'em jolly. An edge for Abt is its longtime presence on the Internet; the store launched its website in 1998. ""Online as a whole is important,"" the boss said. ""Customers are doing their research before they walk in the door.""And using it to get better deals.Abt's store policy is to try to beat competitors' bottom dollars.According to Experian Marketing Services, more retailers will roll out price-matching offers this holiday season.Wal-Mart (WMT) surprised the competition by matching select Target (TGT) and Best Buy (BBY) Black Friday deals a full week before Thanksgiving.• Let it snow. Consumers will hold greater sway over how firms operate year-round, according to the IBM (IBM) Institute for Business Value. Face-to-face conversations with 4,000 CEOs and other executives in 70 countries revealed that 90% of senior leaders expect extensive collaboration with customers within the next five years.""Today, CEOs recognize they can't do it all alone,"" said Bridget van Kralingen, IBM global business services senior vice president. ""They're opening up their organizations, breaking down barriers and actively engaging customers — providing customers a seat at the table to help shape their business model and strategy.""

1089,BBY,"Power centers, now a big part of the American shopping experience, are showing an unexpected durability.
"
1090,BBY,"These open-air retail behemoths — perhaps anchored by a big-box store, supermarket or office supply chain — have weathered the recession and intensifying e-commerce rivalry, though that combo proved lethal to some tenants.
"
1091,BBY,"By reconfiguring buildings and landing expansion-minded national discounters, specialty grocers and other chains, landlords have pared the average vacancy to 6.3% nationwide from a peak of 10.2% in the first quarter of 2009, according to Garrick Brown, research director for commercial real estate brokerage Cassidy Turley.
"
1092,BBY,"That's better than the overall retail property sector — including malls, grocery-anchored neighborhood centers and lifestyle shopping centers — which has an average vacancy of around 8.7%, says Brown.
"
1093,BBY,"In the midst of the recession, most retail prognosticators couldn't have imagined such a dramatic occupancy rebound in power centers, a concept that emerged in the late 20th century to accommodate big-box or ""category killer"" retailers that sell a group of related goods such as electronics or office supplies in copious amounts of space.
"
1094,BBY,"Some major power center tenants including Borders Group, Circuit City and Linens & Things died off. Meanwhile, survivors such as Office Depot (ODP), Barnes & Noble (BKS) and Best Buy (BBY) are generally looking to reduce the number of stores or the size of some stores, or both, as online competitors continue to pressure the formats.
"
1095,BBY,"New Things In Store
"
1096,BBY,"While that would seem to spell trouble for the hulking power center properties, which range from roughly 250,000 square feet to nearly 1 million, so far it hasn't.
"
1097,BBY,"""Looking at the big picture trends, the power center is the product type where you would expect to see the most damage — basically we're in the twilight of the big box,"" Brown said. ""But really what we're seeing is power centers completely adapt.""
"
1098,BBY,"Among their other adjustments, power center landlords have shifted their attention to retailers less susceptible to online poaching and more agreeable to occupying a space that may fall short of their preferred specifications, he adds. Landlords are signing TJX Cos.' (TJX) T.J. Maxx, Ross Stores' (ROST) Ross Dress for Less, Five Below (FIVE), Nordstrom (JWN) Rack, and other discount or off-price clothing and soft goods retailers.
"
1099,BBY,"Power center owners also are adding more grocers, which like the traffic that national retailers in the centers generate, said Joseph Tichar, senior vice president of corporate operations for Cleveland-based DDR (DDR), a real estate investment trust that owns 117 million square feet of primarily power center space in the U.S., Puerto Rico and Brazil.
"
1100,BBY,"Traditional power center anchor tenants Wal-mart (WMT) and Target (TGT) have been expanding their grocery offerings into more stores, he said, while specialty grocers like Whole Foods (WFM), Sprouts Farmers Market (SFM) and Trader Joe's continue to proliferate.
"
1101,BBY,"Both groups are taking market share from traditional grocery stores, according to a DDR investor presentation that cited U.S. Census Bureau data.
"
1102,BBY,"""The grocery business has been evolving rapidly and competition in that space is fierce,"" DDR's Tichar said. ""Consumers are telling us that they don't need to shop in a traditional neighborhood center to buy groceries.""
"
1103,BBY,"Regardless of what type of tenant they're hunting, power center owners are paying particular attention to identifying retailers with strong balance sheets, cash flow and credit — traits that the defunct big boxes too often lacked. To a large extent, those requirements have put the focus on national chains in favor of either local or regional operators, Tichar says.
"
1104,BBY,"Power center landlords also are rearranging space to accommodate new tenants or to reduce the footprint of anchor tenants. In Chicago, for example, DDR spent $11.6 million to consolidate several small shops and construct more space in its Brookside Marketplace power center to make room for T.J. Maxx, Ross Dress for Less, Pier 1 Imports (PIR) and Panera Bread (PNRA).
"
1105,BBY,"Properties Under Pressure
"
1106,BBY,"Despite the rebounding optimism around power centers, the properties still face challenges, notes Suzanne Mulvee, director of retail research for Property Portfolio Research, a subsidiary of commercial real estate information provider CoStar Group (CSGP).
"
1107,BBY,"To cut down on overhead, discount retailers generally want rent to represent about 6% of revenues versus the 10% to 12% that more traditional retailers have historically aimed for, she says. Plus, certain power center tenants such as bookstores and electronics sellers still face a rather daunting e-commerce threat.
"
1108,BBY,"""I think there's a lot of pressure on the sector,"" she said. ""These tenants are being forced to compete with Amazon (AMZN), and as Amazon increases its speed of delivery to customers, it has the potential to erode market share materially.""
"
1109,BBY,"Tichar acknowledges that the changing retailing landscape had pressured power center rents. Typically the REIT aims for tenants to pay a rental rate that reflects about 10% of revenues, on average, across its properties. It's now at about 8%, he says.
"
1110,BBY,"Future Of Shopping
"
1111,BBY,"Yet a host of retailers and grocery concepts are still in expansion mode and virtually no new power center construction is taking place, he says. So as tenants see their year-over-year sales and market share grow, DDR will have more opportunities to achieve its 10% goal.
"
1112,BBY,"Additionally, hundreds of leases at below-market rental rates with weaker retailers are set to expire over the next few years, he adds, and the company is proactively marketing the space to line up better tenants at higher rents. In one example, the company suggests that it could increase rents in 11 Barnes & Noble locations by 25% to 75% when the retailer's leases end in 2016, according to an investor presentation.

Investors have gone loco for El Pollo Loco (LOCO), which rose 0.2% to 36.84 on the stock market today, up 146% from its July IPO price…
"
1115,BBY,"Let the gobbling begin. Turkey Day signals tasty sales, and service with a smile sticks to shoppers' ribs.• Wine and dine.  Capturing consumer interest isn't enough. Businesses must offer a great experience to keep them coming back.That's one takeaway from a recent survey by Tenet Partners, a brand innovation and marketing consultancy. ""More than half of consumers surveyed said they stopped using a brand because of poor service,"" Tenet CEO Hampton Bridwell told IBD.• Be gracious. The study looked at brand performance for Apple (AAPL) Best Buy (BBY), J.C. Penney (JCP), McDonald's (MCD), Starbucks (SBUX), Target (TGT), Verizon (VZ) and Wendy's (WEN).It takes time, money and effort to build a good name, ""but it's all wasted whenever a customer encounters bad service,"" Bridwell said.Being helpful, knowledgeable and caring increases a brand's value to consumers. ""This is especially important to keep in mind during the holiday season, as employees and customers are stressed and impatient,"" Bridwell said.• Serve it up. There's no more harried day than Black Friday.""Many shoppers set up their day as a mission,"" said Kevin Leifer, vice president with customer service consultancy ICC/Decision Services. Make it easier by putting deals front and center, instead of burying them in the store's back.• Fill the table. More retailers are slashing prices beyond Black Friday. Those planning door-buster specials are wise to offer alternatives for items in short supply. Some big boxes like Wal-Mart (WMT) guarantee product availability during specific sale times, and offer to ship the product for free when on-site supplies run out. Not every retailer can follow through like that, but ""let's have a prepared list of options,"" Leifer said.• Manage expectations. If quantities are limited, say so in ads.You might make a few customers happy with a rare deal, but ""you're disappointing far more than you're satisfying,"" Leifer said.• Make it clear. Be precise about pricing. Customers get annoyed trying to guess what the deal is — or finding out the numbers are different at the register. ""You want to be completely transparent for your customers,"" Leifer said.• Mind manners. Teach employees — especially newbies helping out at holidays time — how to treat shoppers. ""You can't forget the basics of customer interaction,"" Leifer said. ""Every one of those touch points, that is the brand.""• Keep good company.  Smart retailers employ the cream of the crop. ""You're hiring for attitude, not skills. If an applicant doesn't smile during the job interview, don't hire him."" So advised John Tschohl, customer service expert and author of ""Moving Up.""• Chat them up. ""This is your chance to make a hell of a first impression,"" said Tschohl.Teach workers to introduce themselves and address customers by name. Doing so makes the experience more personable.""You cannot own the customer only on price. There are too many options out there,"" he said. ""People buy relationships.""• Solve sticky situations. Give frontline workers tools to keep cool when tempers flare. ""Most employees have never been trained to handle irate customers,"" Tschohl said. Empower staff to make decisions in the moment.Then back them up.""The number one reason people will not use empowerment is because they know in their hearts they will lose their jobs,"" Tschohl said.• End with gratitude. ""It does not take extra time,"" said Tschohl, ""to smile and say: 'Thank you for coming.'""

1132,BBY,"OpenStack could soon be the software that runs the non-Amazon cloud.Open-source software available for free, OpenStack helps corporate IT departments manage data centers packed with computer servers.OpenStack has also gained popularity as a tool to connect data centers to public clouds, where computing resources are shared via the Internet.But Amazon.com's (AMZN) Amazon Web Services (AWS) is by far the biggest provider of infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS). And it uses its own software, not OpenStack.Still, OpenStack has gained popularity among enterprises that want to use multiple cloud platforms.For investors, the question is: which companies will gain the most from OpenStack's rise as a cloud operating system?""There's a big roster of household name IT vendors that are backing OpenStack — Intel (INTC), IBM (IBM), Cisco Systems (CSCO), Dell and HP (HPQ) — a lot of companies have placed a bet,"" said Al Sadowski, an analyst at 451 Research.Worries over whether OpenStack could handle large business workloads have eased. So OpenStack seems primed for wide adoption, though there are open-source rivals such as Citrix Systems' (CTXS) CloudStack, points out James Staten, a Forrester Research analyst.""The concerns now are less about the platform itself and who is influencing its development,"" Staten told IBD. ""The concerns instead are about who takes OpenStack successfully to market and begins to lead through market power. That's a key theme worth watching in 2015.""Rackspace, NASA DevelopedRackspace Hosting (RAX) and government space agency NASA co-developed OpenStack in 2010, aiming to make the software a cloud computing standard. Rackspace's main business has been hosting websites. Rackspace stepped up investments in OpenStack in 2012 and 2013, but its revenue growth slowed as companies lingered in testing OpenStack's capabilities.Rackspace now supports multiple cloud platforms and has become less dependent on OpenStack near term.""While Rackspace continues to develop solutions on the OpenStack platform, management is providing managed cloud solutions across multiple technologies,"" wrote James Breen, a William Blair analyst, in a research report last month.The OpenStack ecosystem is growing, says 451 Research. The market research firm says that OpenStack-related revenue will rise to $3.49 billion in 2018 from $890 million in 2014.""All OpenStack needs to do is get to the same reliability and resiliency as the computing platforms it's replacing,"" Sadowski said. ""It's clear, though, that OpenStack is gaining mindshare and marketing power.""Early backers hoped that OpenStack would slow the march of AWS. Oppenheimer analyst Tim Horan estimates that AWS revenue will jump 40% to roughly $5 billion in 2015. Even so, ""OpenStack is starting to mature as enterprises shift legacy IT workloads to cloud environments,"" Horan said.Expedia (EXPE), Walt Disney (DIS), Time Warner Cable (TWC), Wells Fargo (WFC) and BMW are among recent OpenStack adopters, says 451 Research. Earlier users included eBay's (EBAY) PayPal, Best Buy (BBY) and Fidelity Investments.To attract corporate customers, OpenStack supporters positioned the open-source software as an alternative to VMware 's (VMW) software, widely used in data centers to make servers more efficient.Red Hat (RHT), the leading provider of Linux open-source server software and a VMware rival, has lined up behind OpenStack.But pushing its own cloud platform is still VMware's top priority, analysts say. With partners such as the privately held Mirantis, VMware sells software that helps its customers use OpenStack for building so-called ""private"" cloud data centers that are accessible by branch offices, clients and others.Analysts say that most enterprises are interested in a public-private hybrid cloud model — running the most important business apps on their own servers behind a private corporate firewall and accessing public IaaS providers as needed.Many tech vendors are focused on providing tools for hybrid clouds. Rackspace aims to provide managed services in the hybrid cloud market rather than struggle vs. much bigger IaaS firms AWS, Microsoft (MSFT) and Google (GOOGL).Positioned As Cloud Concierge""Rackspace continues to remain technology agnostic even as the company's OpenStack is increasingly attractive as a platform for public cloud,"" said Barclays analyst Sandeep Gupta in a report. ""As AWS, Microsoft and Google continue to put pressure on pricing, we wouldn't be surprised if Rackspace positions itself as a cloud concierge to a hybrid cloud environment.""Many tech suppliers aim to use OpenStack to bridge private and public clouds.""The strong leaders in OpenStack today are a mix. Hewlett-Packard and Red Hat are clearly strong voices in the community, as is SuSE, Mirantis, Internap (INAP) and arguably Cisco Systems due to their recent moves,"" said Forrester's Staten. ""Rackspace still has a strong voice, IBM to a lesser degree, as they are really only focusing on it for their private cloud initiatives.""IBM last year acquired cloud-service firm SoftLayer for $2 billion. HP has said that it'll spend $1 billion over the next two years on products and services around OpenStack.451 Research says that Europe-based OVH and startup Blue Box have gained traction with OpenStack customers. Some companies are using acquisitions to gain a foothold in cloud computing services and OpenStack. EMC (EMC), another cloud company, acquired Cloudscaling in October, Cisco bought Metacloud in September and Red Hat purchased eNovance in June.Lydia Leong, an analyst with research firm Gartner, agrees that OpenStack has gained momentum. The OpenStack Foundation, with more than 430 members, has regularly rolled out improved versions of the software.""OpenStack is gaining more traction than it had before as the product starts to become more useable,"" Leong told IBD. ""The primary beneficiaries are those that sell (software) distributions, such as Red Hat, HP and Mirantis.""

1164,BBY,"W. Howard Lester had reached the height of business success, having started and sold profitable firms.Newly retired at 34, he was young and wealthy enough to spend his days enjoying his newfound love, golfing daily with friends and business acquaintances.Yet it wasn't long before Lester tired of retirement and the links.He was looking for something ""to make me excited about getting out of the bed in the morning,"" he said.Lester (1935-2010) found a reason to rise and shine in a small business with a big idea: a French cookware store in Sonoma, Calif., near San Francisco.In 1978, Lester and a partner purchased the outlet, Williams-Sonoma (WSM) — named for its founder, Chuck Williams — but neither knew what to do with it.On Top Of ItThe business, which had been running since 1956, was shaky, with $4 million in annual revenue and $700,000 in debt. Lester's partner moved on, and Lester spent weeks checking out his new property and talking to every employee.He knew about systems and inventory but not about selling kitchenware. His only retail experience was as a shopper.To make up for his gap in knowledge, Lester joined Williams, who was still with the firm as chairman, on buying trips to Europe and traveled America visiting kitchen stores that he found were run more like a hobby than a business.The education paid off.Lester built Williams-Sonoma into a multibillion-dollar mail-order and retail empire that set a standard for customer service and helped fuel a revolution in American cooking and entertaining.Lester often conceded that he was not an expert in the kitchen, just a ""weekend cook,"" but his skill as a businessman and ""frustrated consumer"" helped guide the firm toward booming growth.Williams-Sonoma saw $4.5 billion in 2013 revenue, reflected in a stock that has rocketed over 1,400% since 2008.Raised, as he often noted, ""on the wrong side of the tracks"" in Oklahoma, Lester found the fast track by constantly experimenting with business concepts.His career began with selling typewriters and other office equipment for IBM (IBM) in 1958.In the next two decades, he launched several companies, including Coley/Lester Employment Agency and computer-service and software businesses.One of those high-tech firms was Centurex, which became a leading supplier of software systems to the banking industry.After selling the company in 1976, Lester seemed to retire.Yet in two years, he was introduced to Williams, owner and founder of the small, French-inspired kitchen store with four retail locations. All of it was for sale.Intrigued, Lester and his partner, James McMahan, a golfing buddy and head of a national furniture-store chain, bought the kitchen firm for $100,000 and handshakes all around.McMahan never took an operating role. The Lester-Williams partnership lasted 30 years.Neither buyer had big plans for the retail chain — now headquartered in San Francisco — until Lester, as CEO, began opening stores around the country based on Williams' concept of the affluent kitchen.Only now, Lester wanted the new outlets to supply every room in the house through in-store and catalog sales — all the while nurturing the firm's image as a retailer of the finest in supplies and furnishings.Lester's vision was to build a company that would ""enhance people's lives at home."" Williams called him ""a shopkeeper at heart.""Lester already had seven principles, which he called Howard's Rules:• A need for vision.• A disdain for arrogance.• Be self-critical.• Celebrate the accomplishment of associates.• Judge yourself by how your customers judge you, ""because without them, nothing else matters.""• Integrity and honesty set the standard for everything.• Remain focused on what can be rather than what is.Originally intended as reminders for his own behavior, the rules still guide Williams-Sonoma.Plugged InJoan Storms, an analyst with Wedbush Securities who has followed Williams-Sonoma for 15 years, lauds Lester, in combination with Patrick Connolly — the current executive vice president and chief marketing officer — for innovations in e-commerce. ""Lester tried to retire several times, but once he decided the company primarily had to be a merchant-led organization, he brought really good people around him,"" she told IBD.Lester's foundation was Rule 1: ""Without vision, it is very difficult, if not impossible, to provide leadership to a company of any size. Dreams are important. Never stop having them.""Lester ""absolutely"" was a visionary ""who had a knack for cultivating talent,"" said Brad Thomas, an analyst with investment firm KeyBanc Capital Markets. ""There's a long list of strong executives who have worked at Williams-Sonoma,"" among them Gary Friedman, CEO of Restoration Hardware (RH), and Sharon McCollam, chief financial officer at Best Buy (BBY).Then there's Laura Alber, the former senior buyer in Williams-Sonoma's Pottery Barn catalog division. She was groomed for the top job by Lester and followed him as CEO.Alber is upbeat: ""Our e-commerce business, which represented 44% of our net revenue in fiscal 2013, is growing rapidly, allowing us to capture an even greater market share as more consumers transition to online shopping categories.""The company has seven e-commerce sites and distributes eight catalogs. Direct-to-customer net revenue last fiscal year rose to $2.12 billion, up from the prior year's $1.87 billion.BoostThe growth was primarily led by the Pottery Barn, West Elm, Pottery Barn Kids and PB Teens brands. Direct-to-customer net revenue generated 48% of total company net volume in fiscal 2013 vs. 46% the previous fiscal year.Retail net revenue increased to $2.27 billion, compared with $2.17 billion in fiscal 2012. The was gain driven mostly by Pottery Barn, West Elm and Williams-Sonoma's international franchises, primarily in the Middle East and Asia.Lester worked at Williams-Sonoma for 32 years. During his time as chief executive and later as chairman, succeeding Williams, he took the company public and expanded it to 600 stores — there now are 585 — and$3.4 billion in annual sales.He retired, this time for good, in May 2010, six months before he died at age 75. Williams, director emeritus at 98, credits the company's growth mainly to Lester and his entrepreneurial stewardship.Lester was born in Durant, Okla., and after high school served in an Army intelligence outfit in Germany in the 1950s.Returning to civilian life, he attended the University of Oklahoma, where he met his first wife, Wanda Eshelman. He spent the first 20 years of his career with tech outfits such as Centurex.Lester had three children, and he and his second wife, Mary, were active philanthropists, supporting medical research and the arts. In 1991 he founded the Lester Center for Entrepreneurship at the University of California, Berkeley.

1165,BBY,"The term creative destruction is thrown around a lot, but Amazon truly ushered in a new industry while disrupting several others. It wrote the book on e-commerce, spreading from its bookselling roots into a behemoth that brought down brick-and-mortar rivals with superior service and execution, to linking new and unlikely businesses in novel ways. 
"
1166,BBY,"Amazon (AMZN), founded in 1994 by CEO Jeff Bezos in his garage, started as an online bookseller and sold its first book in July 1995. Customers could get rare books they couldn't find anywhere else and current titles more cheaply than from rivals.
"
1167,BBY,"The e-commerce firm expanded into electronics, toys, music and home improvement products and went public in 1997.
"
1168,BBY,"Amazon sales exploded from well under $1 million in 1995 to $2.76 billion in 2000 and $74.5 billion last year.
"
1169,BBY,"Shares leapt 8,526% from their 1997 low to their initial December 1999 peak.
"
1170,BBY,"Building The Brand
"
1171,BBY,"Amazon wasn't making money — but that was the plan. Bezos realized from the start that building the brand, infrastructure and market share was crucial, so his strategy was to forgo profits for years.
"
1172,BBY,"""There's nothing about our model that can't be copied over time,"" Bezos told Inc. magazine in 1997. ""But you know, McDonald's got copied. And it still built a huge, multibillion-dollar company. A lot of it comes down to the brand name. Brand names are more important online than they are in the physical world.""
"
1173,BBY,"While Bezos is hailed as a visionary now, nobody wanted to hear about money-losing Internet companies after the dot-com bust. Losses continued to mount while sales growth slowed to 13% in 2011.
"
1174,BBY,"Shares crashed 95% from December 1999 to October 2001.
"
1175,BBY,"In 2000, Ronald Unkefer, CEO of West Coast electronics retailer Good Guys, told IBD that he wasn't worried about Amazon, saying that Amazon and consumer electronics don't mix.
"
1176,BBY,"But Amazon sales growth ramped back up and the company soon became profitable.
"
1177,BBY,"Within a few years, Good Guys was out of business, followed by Circuit City and bookseller Borders. Barnes & Noble (BKS) and Best Buy (BBY) are often derided as de facto Amazon showrooms and are still trying to adapt. In February, Best Buy's CEO said his company was an ""online first"" retailer.
"
1178,BBY,"Amazon shares rose 7,306% from their 2001 low to their March 2014 peak — or 31,050% for their entire run.
"
1179,BBY,"The key to Amazon's success was in creating a no-hassle, no-worry experience, building trust with customers in the new realm of online shopping.
"
1180,BBY,"""Amazon looks like a highly efficient company today,"" Mark Mahaney, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, told IBD. ""But they slogged through years and years building up customer base and product offerings.""
"
1181,BBY,"The company offers no-hassle returns, one-click ordering and a customer call center with a minimal wait time.
"
1182,BBY,"""Customers want to go somewhere they trust,"" Raymond James analyst Aaron Kessler said. ""There aren't many companies you would save your credit card information at. But you would at Amazon. It's frictionless to shop there.""
"
1183,BBY,"Recent data breaches at retailers like Target (TGT) and Neiman Marcus highlighted the risk. But Amazon so far hasn't had any major security problems despite its high volume of customer traffic.
"
1184,BBY,"Craig Berman, VP of Global Communications, said in an email that Amazon takes ""protection of data very seriously"" and said it works every day to keep promises to customers to keep their trust.
"
1185,BBY,"Amazon's online reviews gave users the chance to rate and describe products that gave other potential customers the sense they were feeling out the product before buying it.
"
1186,BBY,"Low prices also kept customers coming back. Until recently, Amazon didn't collect sales tax, a sizable advantage over brick-and-mortar stores. Amazon also doesn't have the expense of running a physical store with limited options and quantities.
"
1187,BBY,"But building up warehouses and distribution networks isn't cheap and can't be done quickly, instead it is an ongoing process. Amazon's massive infrastructure spending — still ongoing — is a key reason why profitability took a long time and has continued to remain spotty.
"
1188,BBY,"Getting products from Amazon warehouses to its customers also has been an enormous lift to UPS (UPS) and FedEx (FDX). Both have seen their delivery businesses explode with Amazon and e-commerce.
"
1189,BBY,"Amazon also added third-party sellers to its site, giving smaller retailers the opportunity to reach a large audience for a fee, while allowing customers to find nearly everything imaginable under one website.
"
1190,BBY,"""Customers can add a Kindle book, headphones, a cocktail dress and diapers into a single shopping cart,"" Berman said. ""Avoiding long checkout lines or the fight for a parking space are a couple of reasons Amazon customers love the convenience of shopping online.""
"
1191,BBY,"Free Shipping
"
1192,BBY,"Amazon offers free shipping for orders over $35. That hits margins but in return gives Amazon a revenue boost.
"
1193,BBY,"Amazon launched its Prime service in 2005, offering customers free 2-day shipping and lower prices on one-day shipping for a flat yearly rate, encouraging the consumers to buy even more products from the company.
"
1194,BBY,"Amazon has had an uncanny ability to see new opportunities.
"
1195,BBY,"In the early aughts, Amazon ran into computer capacity problems. When it began to standardize its retail computing online, the company realized it could offer virtual servers as a service.
"
1196,BBY,"Bezos explained the decision to Wired in 2011:
"
1197,BBY,"""The common question that gets asked in business is, why? That's a good question, but an equally valid question is, why not? This is a good idea, we have a lot of skills and assets to do this well, we're already going to do it for ourselves — why not sell it, too?""
"
1198,BBY,"Amazon Web Services became part of the vanguard of the cloud-computing movement. Its clients include startups like Airbnb, Pinterest and Spotify that could start small and scale up as needed. AWS also serves established companies like General Electric (GE), Netflix (NFLX) and Unilever (UN).
"
1199,BBY,"""AWS allows customers to move away from managing technology infrastructure so they can focus on investing and innovating for their own customers,"" Berman said.
"
1200,BBY,"Amazon doesn't break out revenue from Amazon Web Services, but analysts estimate it topped $1.5 billion in 2012. The contribution to the bottom line may be even more important.
"
1201,BBY,"""Profit is something to worry about but Amazon at its core is a retailer,"" Mahaney said. ""With Amazon you should expect single-digit operating margins, but when they get into other segments like ad revenue and Amazon Web Services then you see higher margins.""
"
1202,BBY,"Making Lemonade
"
1203,BBY,"Amazon has largely given up trying to avoid collecting state and local sales taxes. But once again, it's turning lemons into lemonade. No longer minimizing physical presences to avoid tax issues, Amazon is building more distribution centers, close to big cities, as it pushes toward next-day and same-day delivery. The move still puts pressure on brick-and-mortar retailers to adapt.
"
1204,BBY,"The company is also branching out into online grocery with its AmazonFresh service, available in Southern California, San Francisco and Seattle.
"
1205,BBY,"Mahaney doesn't see a new online rival to Amazon in the next five to 10 years.
"
1206,BBY,"""Amazon is extremely hard to replicate. It would be extremely expensive to set up distribution centers and master logistics,"" he said.
"
1207,BBY,"Amazon introduced the Kindle e-reader in 2007, followed by full-fledged tablets.
"
1208,BBY,"Amazon hopes consumers fill up the devices with e-books, videos and other media from its site. And if users are buying media from Amazon, they are more likely to also buy other goods such as diapers or clothing.
"
1209,BBY,"""Amazon has an extremely competent management team that have been able to see around the corner,"" Mahaney said. ""For example the digital reading Kindle, that was far seeing on their part.""
"
1210,BBY,"In March, Amazon announced it would raise the annual membership fee of its Prime service to $99 from $79, but customers are still signing up for the service to take advantage of shipping and other perks, like online video streaming.
"
1211,BBY,"Lumping Amazon Instant Video, a service similar to Hulu and Netflix, and free shipping into the same deal doesn't seem to make a lot of sense up front.
"
1212,BBY,"But Amazon has the ability to see what a wide range of customers might want and then deliver.
"
1213,BBY,"On April 2, it unveiled its Amazon Fire TV, a $99 streaming video set-top box. Recent reports say Amazon will launch a smartphone this summer.
"

In February, Best Buy's CEO said his company was an ""online first"" retailer.Amazon shares rose 7,306% from their 2001 low to their March 2014 peak — or 31,050% for their entire run.The key to Amazon's success was in creating a no-hassle, no-worry experience, building trust with customers in the new realm of online shopping.""Amazon looks like a highly efficient company today,"" Mark Mahaney, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, told IBD. ""But they slogged through years and years building up customer base and product offerings.""The company offers no-hassle returns, one-click ordering and a customer call center with a minimal wait time.""Customers want to go somewhere they trust,"" Raymond James analyst Aaron Kessler said. ""There aren't many companies you would save your credit card information at. But you would at Amazon. It's frictionless to shop there.""Recent data breaches at retailers like Target (TGT) and Neiman Marcus highlighted the risk. But Amazon so far hasn't had any major security problems despite its high volume of customer traffic.Craig Berman, VP of Global Communications, said in an email that Amazon takes ""protection of data very seriously"" and said it works every day to keep promises to customers to keep their trust.Amazon's online reviews gave users the chance to rate and describe products that gave other potential customers the sense they were feeling out the product before buying it.Low prices also kept customers coming back. Until recently, Amazon didn't collect sales tax, a sizable advantage over brick-and-mortar stores. Amazon also doesn't have the expense of running a physical store with limited options and quantities.But building up warehouses and distribution networks isn't cheap and can't be done quickly, instead it is an ongoing process. Amazon's massive infrastructure spending — still ongoing — is a key reason why profitability took a long time and has continued to remain spotty.Getting products from Amazon warehouses to its customers also has been an enormous lift to UPS (UPS) and FedEx (FDX). Both have seen their delivery businesses explode with Amazon and e-commerce.Amazon also added third-party sellers to its site, giving smaller retailers the opportunity to reach a large audience for a fee, while allowing customers to find nearly everything imaginable under one website.""Customers can add a Kindle book, headphones, a cocktail dress and diapers into a single shopping cart,"" Berman said. ""Avoiding long checkout lines or the fight for a parking space are a couple of reasons Amazon customers love the convenience of shopping online.""Free ShippingAmazon offers free shipping for orders over $35. That hits margins but in return gives Amazon a revenue boost.Amazon launched its Prime service in 2005, offering customers free 2-day shipping and lower prices on one-day shipping for a flat yearly rate, encouraging the consumers to buy even more products from the company.Amazon has had an uncanny ability to see new opportunities.In the early aughts, Amazon ran into computer capacity problems. When it began to standardize its retail computing online, the company realized it could offer virtual servers as a service.Bezos explained the decision to Wired in 2011:""The common question that gets asked in business is, why? That's a good question, but an equally valid question is, why not? This is a good idea, we have a lot of skills and assets to do this well, we're already going to do it for ourselves — why not sell it, too?""Amazon Web Services became part of the vanguard of the cloud-computing movement. Its clients include startups like Airbnb, Pinterest and Spotify that could start small and scale up as needed. AWS also serves established companies like General Electric (GE), Netflix (NFLX) and Unilever (UN).""AWS allows customers to move away from managing technology infrastructure so they can focus on investing and innovating for their own customers,"" Berman said.Amazon doesn't break out revenue from Amazon Web Services, but analysts estimate it topped $1.5 billion in 2012. The contribution to the bottom line may be even more important.""Profit is something to worry about but Amazon at its core is a retailer,"" Mahaney said. ""With Amazon you should expect single-digit operating margins, but when they get into other segments like ad revenue and Amazon Web Services then you see higher margins.""Making LemonadeAmazon has largely given up trying to avoid collecting state and local sales taxes. But once again, it's turning lemons into lemonade. No longer minimizing physical presences to avoid tax issues, Amazon is building more distribution centers, close to big cities, as it pushes toward next-day and same-day delivery. The move still puts pressure on brick-and-mortar retailers to adapt.The company is also branching out into online grocery with its AmazonFresh service, available in Southern California, San Francisco and Seattle.Mahaney doesn't see a new online rival to Amazon in the next five to 10 years.""Amazon is extremely hard to replicate. It would be extremely expensive to set up distribution centers and master logistics,"" he said.Amazon introduced the Kindle e-reader in 2007, followed by full-fledged tablets.Amazon hopes consumers fill up the devices with e-books, videos and other media from its site. And if users are buying media from Amazon, they are more likely to also buy other goods such as diapers or clothing.""Amazon has an extremely competent management team that have been able to see around the corner,"" Mahaney said. ""For example the digital reading Kindle, that was far seeing on their part.""In March, Amazon announced it would raise the annual membership fee of its Prime service to $99 from $79, but customers are still signing up for the service to take advantage of shipping and other perks, like online video streaming.Lumping Amazon Instant Video, a service similar to Hulu and Netflix, and free shipping into the same deal doesn't seem to make a lot of sense up front.But Amazon has the ability to see what a wide range of customers might want and then deliver.On April 2, it unveiled its Amazon Fire TV, a $99 streaming video set-top box. Recent reports say Amazon will launch a smartphone this summer.But despite its continued long-term focus, Amazon delivered strong profit growth in 2013. And analysts expect triple-digit EPS gains over the next three years.

But Apple's digital wallet will likely re-energize the iOS ecosystem's cool factor, amid rising smartphone competition. That, of course, depends on how many iPhone users tap-to-pay, instead of pulling out cash or swiping credit cards in retail stores.
"
1290,BBY,"Apple didn't disclose terms with credit-card companies that will support the payment system. JPMorgan speculates Apple may collect a small transaction fee, perhaps pennies, each time iPhone users wave their device to pay at check-out terminals.

1368,BBY,"MINNEAPOLIS — To hear Don Ball tell it, Minneapolis is amid a tech startup boom.
"
1369,BBY,"From the start of this decade, around the time Ball co-founded CoCo, a shared work space for entrepreneurs housed in the Minneapolis Grain Exchange building, tech outfits have increasingly peppered the city and its twin across the Mississippi River, St. Paul.
"
1370,BBY,"CoCo, the first of its kind in the Twin Cities, started from scratch three years ago and now has 700 members, mostly tech startups.
"
1371,BBY,"""We jumped up quickly,"" Ball said. Along the way, CoCo opened a second location in St. Paul and plans to open a third in October in Minneapolis' Uptown neighborhood.
"
1372,BBY,"CoCo stands for coworking and collaboration. The workplace organization regularly hosts meet-up events, where tech enthusiasts gather to share ideas and show off their latest endeavors to one another, potential customers and, importantly, investors. More than 4,000 people have attended its meet-ups this year, Ball says.
"
1373,BBY,"But CoCo isn't alone. Minnestar, a nonprofit, is another group devoted to galvanizing the Twin Cities tech scene. It also hosts events for startups to demo their products. Attendance at its MinneDemo events has swelled more than 40% since the start of the decade.
"
1374,BBY,"""There is definitely momentum building here,"" said Adrienne Peirce, a Minnestar board member.
"
1375,BBY,"Jeff Pesek, co-founder of tech.mn., a Minneapolis website that tracks local tech startups, estimates there are 150 to 200 of them in Minnesota, the vast majority in the Twin Cities.
"
1376,BBY,"Pesek says at least 87 Minnesota tech startups raised some $145 million in 2012, up from 63 ventures that drummed up $126 million the year before and 42 that raised about $60 million in 2010.
"
1377,BBY,"In the second quarter of this year alone, 61 local tech ventures collectively raised more than $65 million, he says. Both figures are quarterly highs, according to tech.mn.

"
1380,BBY,"The Twin Cities area counts among its strengths a long-established and large talent pool. Ball says that with 19 Fortune 500 companies with headquarters or major operations, including 3M (MMM) and Best Buy (BBY), the area has more such companies per-capita than any region. Up-and-comers such as 3D printer maker Stratasys (SSYS) also call the area home.
"
1381,BBY,"Engineers, programmers and others from big firms often branch out to start their own ventures, he points out. The Twin Cities also regularly ranks among the nation's most literate metro areas by percentage of population with post-high school degrees, he says, thanks in large part to a heavy concentration of colleges, including the University of Minnesota.
"
1382,BBY,"Minneapolis-St. Paul also is affordable, says Peirce, with office rents and housing costs lower than in the major markets on both coasts.
"
1383,BBY,"She says the workforce is considered especially reliable. She says that in Silicon Valley people often jump from one job to another, but in Minnesota people tend to commit for several years.
"
1384,BBY,"Startups percolating at CoCo include Spark Devices. Its Spark Core, a tiny Wi-Fi-enabled circuit board used to build Internet-connected hardware products, is slated for release in October. Spark Devices recently raised nearly $600,000 via the Kickstarter crowd-sourced funding platform.

1385,BBY,"SmartThings, a startup that provides a platform to manage various devices connected to the Internet, also calls CoCo home. A year ago, it used Kickstarter to raise more than $1.2 million from nearly 5,700 backers.
"
1386,BBY,"Angel Funding Big Factor
"
1387,BBY,"Many Twin Cities startups take the same path as Spark and SmartThings, gathering funding from various sources by Internet outreach or via seed and angel funding, as opposed to building their business plans around the hope of attracting venture capital funding.
"
1388,BBY,"PricewaterhouseCoopers' MoneyTree report, an oft-cited measure of venture capital investments, ranks the Northcentral region — Minnesota and five neighboring states — far below not only Silicon Valley but many other areas too. Of some $6.7 billion invested by VCs nationwide in Q2, the Northcentral received only 1%, said PwC. Silicon Valley accounted for nearly 40%, followed by New England at 12% and New York City at 10.5%. Texas, where Austin is a hotspot, and Colorado, where Boulder houses a thriving tech startup scene, each attracted more than the entire Northcentral region.
"
1389,BBY,"But Pesek says the MoneyTree report picks up on less than half of all activity in the Twin Cities because it focuses only on venture capital, not angel investors, seed capital and other sources.

1392,BBY,"""I feel we're getting there,"" Spreng said, of establishing a reputation for being a tech hub.

1411,BBY,"Mobile advertising is a growing business, and nobody knows that better than online search king Google (GOOG).
"
1412,BBY,"During its last earnings call in October, Google CEO Larry Page said the company's revenue from mobile ads is on an annual run rate of $2.5 billion. That's up from $1 billion a year earlier.
"
1413,BBY,"Google is working on several mobile search initiatives. The goal is to better connect advertisers to consumers, no matter where the consumers happen to be. Google shares rose 4.5% on Monday after Citigroup analyst Mark Mahaney upgraded the stock to buy from hold, citing less search competition from Facebook than many observers expected.
"
1414,BBY,"Less search from Facebook is good for Google's mobile business. Still, as more consumers jump on the mobile bandwagon, many companies haven't converted or optimized their websites for mobile devices.
"
1415,BBY,"So said Surojit Chatterjee, Google's leader of product management for search and location-based mobile ads, in a recent interview with IBD:
"
1416,BBY,"IBD: How critical are mobile ads to Google's growth?
"
1417,BBY,"Chatterjee: The numbers speak for themselves. We have seen a fivefold increase worldwide, in just about two years. In many emerging countries, the mobile phone will be the way people get on the Internet for the first time.
"
1418,BBY,"IBD: Google sells display and text-based search ads for mobile devices. What's the difference?
"
1419,BBY,"Chatterjee: They are slightly different. For search ads, we try to find the best answer for (a user's search query) and the best advertising is just (in providing the) answers.
"
1420,BBY,"On the display side, you are serendipitously trying to capture people's attention based on contextual signals and other things. If you are building a new brand, you would do display ads. If you have a product or a service that you want to sell, you would do search.
"
1421,BBY,"IBD: Who is buying mobile search ads?
"
1422,BBY,"Chatterjee: It's every business. (Consumers) check the Internet before they go to a shop. The same is true on the mobile Internet as well. We are seeing that an increasingly large percentage of queries for every possible (subject) are coming from mobile (devices).
"
1423,BBY,"IBD: Why should companies buy mobile search ads?
"
1424,BBY,"Chatterjee: When users search for things on mobile, they tend to take action immediately or within a short time. They may actually click and buy (an item) on the phone. They may walk to the store, or (they might) click on the ad and start navigating.
"
1425,BBY,"IBD: Google sells different types of mobile ads, including click-to-call ads. What are those?
"
1426,BBY,"Chatterjee: It looks like a regular text ad except there is another line with a phone number, which is hyperlinked. Users have a choice to click on the headline of the ad and go to the advertiser's website or to click on the phone number. If they click on the phone number, it will connect the user to the business.
"
1427,BBY,"We launched click-to-call a little more than a year and a half ago, and we have seen tremendous user and advertiser adoption. We have seen users click on ads (at a rate that's) 6% to 8% higher compared to other ads without phone numbers. More than 500,000 advertisers use the click-to-call ad format.
"
1428,BBY,"IBD: Analysts say most companies haven't converted or optimized their websites for easy use with mobile devices. What is Google seeing?
"
1429,BBY,"Chatterjee: 79% of Google's largest U.S. advertisers have not converted their sites to mobile. This is something that we are really urging advertisers to do.
"
1430,BBY,"IBD: What happens if a mobile advertiser hasn't converted its site for wireless devices?
"
1431,BBY,"Chatterjee: On high-end mobile phones, the site still renders OK. But it's not the ideal experience. Data from (research firm) Gomez shows more than 60% of users are unlikely to return to a mobile site if they had trouble accessing the site from their phones. And 40% said they would visit a completely different mobile site if an advertiser doesn't have a mobile website. And 63% of those said they are less likely to buy from the same company if the company doesn't have a mobile website.
"
1432,BBY,"IBD: Google also sells hyperlocal ads, which helps consumers find local businesses on mobile phones. How do those work?
"
1433,BBY,"Chatterjee: Users opt in to share their locations. We use that to create hyperlocal ads, where we show businesses close to the user and show how far the user is from the business. We also allow them to click directly to see directions, so they can start navigating to the business. It's a great example of creating something that is specific to mobile users.
"
1434,BBY,"IBD: What are Google's mobile circular ads?
"
1435,BBY,"Chatterjee: We are in a beta (test) with a few customers. We are taking feeds from the businesses about their weekly circulars. One example is Best Buy (BBY). Every week they have products in a booklet that (they mail to customers). So why make (customers) carry one additional thing? If they can find the circular on their mobile phone, there's nothing better.
"
1436,BBY,"IBD: Are Google's mobile advertisers also PC-based advertisers or are they new, mobile-centric advertisers?

1455,BBY,"Best Buy Co., Inc.’s (BBY  -  Free Report) extensive investments to upgrade operations, with special focus on developing omni-channel capabilities, supply chain and cost-reduction opportunities, along with strengthening partnership with vendors bode well.

In the first quarter of fiscal 2019, the same rose 6.3%. Management hinted that higher investments in supply chain and increased transportation costs will likely weigh upon gross profit of the Domestic business by approximately 25 bps in the second quarter.Nevertheless, Best Buy’s upbeat first-quarter fiscal 2019 performance and second-quarter guidance infuses optimism.

1457,BBY,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put Best Buy Co., Inc. (BBY  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Best Buy Co. has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 15.8, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 compares in at about 20.5. If we focus on the stock’s long-term PE trend, the current level puts Best Buy Co.’s current PE ratio slightly above its midpoint (which is 13.9) over the past five years.Further, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with the sector’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 31.4. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that Best Buy Co. has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 14.9, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for Best Buy Co.’s stock in the near term too.P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, Best Buy Co. has a P/S ratio of about 0.5. This is significantly lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.4 right now. Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is slightly below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.If anything, this suggests some level of undervalued trading—at least compared to historical norms.   Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Best Buy Co. currently has a Value Style Score of B, putting it into the top 40% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes BBY a solid choice for value investors.What About the Stock Overall?Though Best Buy Co. might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of D and a Momentum score of B. This gives BBY a VGM score—or its overarching fundamental grade—of B. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best. The current quarter has seen five estimates go higher in the past sixty days and three lower, while the full year estimate has seen seven upward and two downward revisions in the same time period.This has had a noticeable impact on the consensus estimate, as the current quarter consensus estimate did not witness any earnings movement in the past two months, while the full year estimate has inched up 0.4%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:Best Buy Co., Inc. Price and Consensus  Best Buy Co., Inc. Price and Consensus | Best Buy Co., Inc. QuoteThis somewhat mixed trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and why we are looking for in-line performance from the company in the near term.Bottom LineBest Buy Co. is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. Moreover, a decent industry rank (top 42% out of more than 250 industries) further supports the growth potential of the stock. However, with a Zacks Rank #3, it is hard to get too excited about this company overall. Nonetheless, over the past one year, the sector has clearly outperformed the broader market, as you can see below:So, value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first, but once that happens, this stock could be a compelling pick. Moreover, broader factors at the industry level support the growth potential of the company as well.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest Strategies It's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

1461,BBY,"The Q1 earnings season is just around the corner and investors are eagerly awaiting the major bank results, which have remained in the spotlight throughout the quarter for a number of reasons.The quarter witnessed investors’ anxiety on uncertainty over the number of rate hikes on upbeat economic numbers and rising inflation, which pulled the benchmark 10-year Treasury bond yields down. This somewhat reversed the rally experienced by bank stocks since last September. Moreover, Trump’s trade-tariff announcements on Chinese imports affected the stock market rally in the quarter.After three straight quarters of muted activities, it appears that volatility is back in the markets, as seen in both February and March. This indicates higher trading activities and increased trading revenues, primarily for big banks.Notably, the first-quarter earnings are expected to report decent numbers as compared with the last quarter (impacted by huge one-time charges related to the tax law reform), with a rising interest-rate environment aiding net interest margins — the backbone for banks’ top-line growth.In addition to the benefits from the rising interest rates, a moderate improvement in lending will likely energize interest income for banks. Per the Federal Reserve’s latest data, loans are predicted to improve slightly on a sequential basis in the to-be-reported quarter. Particularly, weakness in revolving home equity loans might offset growth in commercial and industrial (C&I), consumer and overall real estate loans to some extent.Therefore, major banks in the S&P 500 index (accounting for nearly 45% of the Zacks Finance Sector'stotal earnings) are projected to witness 11.1% year-over-year jump in earnings in the quarter to be reported. This comes in higher than 2.7% growth recorded in the prior quarter.(For detailed look at the earnings outlook for this industry and others, please read our Earnings Preview article.)The trend of earning solid advisory and underwriting fees for debt and equity issuance might reverse in the first quarter, as rising rates will limit corporates’ involvement in these activities. As debt origination fees typically account for about half of total investment banking fees, this could deal a blow to the banks.However, strong equity issuances globally might have got boosted from IPOs and follow-on offerings. So, equity underwriting fees are projected to increase. Also, a potential rise in fees from increasing M&A’s in certain sectors will likely help banks garner advisory fees.Further, credit quality is anticipated to remain strong, backed by an improving economy and conservative underwriting standards.Expense reduction, which has helped banks to remain profitable, is not expected to be a major support, as banks have already slashed the majority of unnecessary expenses. While the absence of considerable legal expenses since the last few quarters is encouraging, increased investments in technology to improve digital offerings might escalate costs moderately.Selecting the WinnersWith the upcoming results likely to be impressive, there are a few major banks that are expected to stand out this earnings season. Therefore, this is the right time for you to select some banking stocks that are well positioned to beat earnings estimates in their upcoming releases.Choosing stocks with earnings beat potential might be a difficult task unless one knows the process to shortlist. One way to do it is by picking stocks that have the combination of a favorable Zacks Rank — Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), #2 (Buy) or #3 (Hold) — and a positive Earnings ESP.Earnings ESP is our proprietary methodology for identifying stocks that have high chances of surprising in their upcoming earnings announcement.

SG&A expenses have increased 18.6%, 2.2% and 3.2% in the fourth, third and second quarter of fiscal 2018, respectively.Management hinted that higher investments in the supply chain and increased transportation costs are likely to weigh on gross profit of the Domestic business by approximately 25 basis points in each quarter. The national roll-out of Total Tech Support offering in the second quarter is also expected to weigh on gross margin of the Domestic business.For the full year, Best Buy expects the rollout to hurt domestic gross margin by approximately 15-20 basis points.

1463,BBY,"A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Best Buy Co., Inc. (BBY  -  Free Report). Shares have lost about 7.1% in that time frame.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is BBY due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Best Buy’s Q4 Earnings Beat, Guides for FY19Best Buy Company, Inc. returned to positive earnings trend in fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 after reporting a miss in the preceding quarter. With this the company has delivered positive earnings surprise in 20 of 21 quarters. Moreover, the company surpassed sales estimates in the fourth quarter, which marked its third beat in the last four quarters.The company’s solid results followed its announcement of closing 257 remaining Best Buy Mobile stand-alone stores in the U.S. The company expects to close down these stores effective May 31.The company posted adjusted earnings per share of $2.42 from continuing operations, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.05. Moreover, the bottom line increased 25% year over year, which came as a big boost to investors.The top line increased nearly 14% year over year to $15,363 million and beat the consensus mark of $14,570 million. Enterprise comparable-store sales (comps) were up 9% against a decline of 0.7% reported in the prior-year period.Comps growth mainly came on the back of smooth execution of the Best Buy 2020 Strategy, alongside improved product availability, rising consumer confidence and a favorable macro environment, a strong gaming category, and a constructive competitive backdrop due to the exit of some of its peers, who filed for bankruptcy.Adjusted operating profit came in at $982 million, up 10.3% year over year. However, adjusted operating margin contracted 20 basis points to 6.4% due to an operating margin decline in the Domestic segment, which contributes nearly 90% of the company’s profitability.Segment DetailsDomestic segment revenues gained 13.4% year over year to $13,987 million, primarily owing to a 9% increase in comparable sales and contribution from the additional 53rd week. This was partially offset by a revenue loss from the shutdown of 18 large-format stores. Comps gained from growth across most categories, with particular strength in mobile phones, gaming, appliances, smart home, wearables and home theater.Domestic online sales came in at $2.8 billion, and grew 17.9% on a comparable basis. This upside was driven by an increase in average order value and conversion rates.The segment’s adjusted gross profit rose 13.2% to $3,113 million, while adjusted gross margin came in at 22.3%, flat year over year. Adjusted operating income jumped 10.9% to $897 million. However, adjusted operating income margin contracted 20 bps to 6.4%. The lower operating profit rate can be attributed to higher SG&A expenses that stemmed from a rise in incentive compensation expense at stores and for corporate employees due to strength witnessed throughout the year. Further, ongoing investments in business growth also led to a rise in SG&A expenses.International segment revenues climbed 20.3% to $1,376 million, primarily on the back of a 9.9% rise in comparable sales growth both in Canada and Mexico, a favorable foreign currency impact of 580 bps and nearly $45 million contribution from the additional week.The segment’s adjusted gross profit grew 9.6% to $308 million in the reported quarter and adjusted gross margin contracted 220 bps to 22.4%. Adjusted operating profit came in at $85 million, up 4.9% from $81 million reported in the year-ago quarter. Adjusted operating income margin came in at 6.2%, down 90 bps.Other Financial DetailsBest Buy ended fiscal 2018 with cash and cash equivalents of $1,101 million, long-term debt of $809 million and total equity of $3,612 million.

1464,BBY,"Walmart Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report), which has long been taking sturdy e-commerce initiatives to counter Amazon’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) growing dominance, is also focused on enhancing store services to customers. This is evident from the expansion of its alliance with household services provider – Handy. Well, sources revealed that Walmart is extending its agreement with Handy, which will let customers hire helpers at about 2,000 Walmart stores to install or assemble their purchases of television and furniture.Per the sources, Walmart has already rolled out Handy’s services at 25 stores in Atlanta, and plans to increase it to nearly 2,000 stores across the United States by April. With this, customers will not only buy TV’s and furniture, but can also enjoy seamless installation and assembling services, by simply scheduling an appointment (between 7 am to 11 pm) during checkout.This deal is aimed at solving issues related to installation and assembling, which in turn is expected to enrich consumers overall shopping experience. With online shopping and services having become the order of the day, retailers are bound to undertake measures to buck up and offer something different in stores in order to attract traffic and stay strong amid a competitive retail landscape.In fact, companies like Best Buy (BBY  -  Free Report) have also taken similar steps to improve customers’ services at home. As for Walmart – while the company has been trying all means to bolster its e-commerce business, this move highlights the big box retailer’s focus on stores. The company is trying every means to evolve with the changing consumer environment to compete with brick-and-mortar rivals as well as the e-commerce king Amazon.This is evident from its transition from Wal-Mart Stores to Walmart — in a bid to officially emerge an omni-channel retailer. In this regard, the company has been taking several e-commerce initiatives, including buyouts, alliances, and improved delivery and payment systems.Most recently, the company inked a deal with Rakuten to sell online groceries in Japan as well as e-books and audiobooks in the United States. Apart from this, Walmart’s buyouts of ShoeBuy, Moosejaw, Bonobos, ModCloth and Jet.com, and deal with Lord and Taylor underscore its quest to build an impressive digital brand portfolio.The company’s Walmart Pay mobile payment system, Mobile Express Returns program and efforts to enhance checkout process further highlight its focus on accelerating online business and making shopping easier and faster. Apart from this, Walmart is making aggressive efforts to expand in the booming online grocery space, as part of which it is making constant moves to improve delivery services.Apart from Walmart, major retail bellwethers such as Kroger (KR  -  Free Report) are also taking incessant strides to improve online grocery services and stay firm in an Amazon-dominated retail world. Moving back to Walmart, we believe that its growth strategies like the aforementioned pact with Handy clearly highlight its efforts to exploit nook and cranny of the retail space and reinforce its competitive flair against Amazon. Notably, these splendid endeavors have helped this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company surge 25.1% in a year, surpassing the industry’s rise of 19.1%.

1465,BBY,"This week we have several important economic reports coming out.  These reports will give us key data on future indicators regarding inflation, housing, retail sales, housing, and consumer sentiment. The biggest report came out before the opening bell this morning; the Consumer Price Index, also called the CPI.  This report is a great indicator of inflationary measurers and has a ripple effect impacting both the Housing market index, and housing starts data, both of which are due out later this week.The CPI showed that year over year core inflation held steady at 1.8%.  This indicates that inflation will probably be more gradual than previously expected.As you can see in the chart, both CPI, and core CPI have begun to pull back from its recent spike.  Which is key to the future growth of the markets as inflation has been the biggest worry among investors.  This data combined with the recent jobs report that showed that wages were not increasing as fast as previously expected helped the markets start the day in the green.  Further, this news caused the 10 year treasury yields to pull back this morning.  All positive signs for the markets.  As of late, the inflationary issues have been putting pressure on the building sector as fears of the Fed rates rising faster than anticipated have subdued several members of the segment.  You can see this downward pressure in the year to date Price return graph.  While the S&P 500 has gained 4.2%, the building sector has fallen by 12.3% with the big players like KB Homes (KBH  -  Free Report) and D.R. Horton (DRI) performing well below that of the S&P 500. But the positive CPI report bodes well for the upcoming Housing Market Index, and Housing Starts reports that come out later this week.  If these data points stay at or near their current high levels, expect the building sector to bounce back. We will also see two other reports that are closely tied together, the Retail Sales report, and Consumer Sentiment.The Retail report is expected to show a big bounce back from a reading of -0.3% to +0.4% after weak results in both December and January.  Sales fell after a strong three month stretch between September and November due to big holiday sales. The largest factor for the upbeat retail sales expectations is overall consumer sentiment which has remained at elevated levels for the past several months.The data has maintained a reading of 95 or higher for the past 7 consecutive months, and is expected to come in at 98.8 when the report is released on Friday.  If consumer sentiment data comes in as expected it will be a positive indicator for the retail sector, as this report gauges consumer spending, and the overall attitude of the economy.  If both the Retail sales and Consumer sentiment numbers come in as expected, several key retail companies will be positively impacted.  These 6 companies currently carry a Zacks Rank #1 Strong Buy rating, and are very well positioned to take advantage of these data points.     Overall, this morning’s CPI report has eased many fears of increasing inflation, and has begun to set a positive tone for the markets. The coming reports due out later in the week can further boost this positive tone if they come in as expected.Zacks Top 10 Stocks for 2018In addition to the stocks discussed above, would you like to know about our 10 finest buy-and-hold tickers for the entirety of 2018?Last year's 2017 Zacks Top 10 Stocks portfolio produced double-digit winners, including FMC Corp. and VMware which racked up stellar gains of +67.9% and +61%.

1470,BBY,"Investors on the lookout for stocks with the potential for maximum growth and value investing may consider the growth at a reasonable price or GARP strategy.This popular strategy helps investors gain exposure to stocks with impressive growth prospects that are trading at a discount. GARP investing employs popular value metrics — price-to-earnings (P/E) and price-to-book value (P/B) ratio — to evaluate whether a stock is undervalued.GARP Metrics – Mix of Growth & Value MetricsThe GARP approach helps identify stocks that are priced below the market or any reasonable target determined by fundamental analysis. These stocks also have solid prospects in terms of cash flow, revenues, earnings per share (EPS) and so on.Growth MetricsStrong earnings growth history and impressive prospects are the main concepts that GARP investors borrow from the growth investing strategy. However, instead of super-normal growth rates, picking stocks with a more stable and reasonable growth rate is a preferred tactic of GARP investors. Hence, growth rates between 10% and 20% are considered ideal under the strategy.Another growth metric that is considered by both growth and GARP investors is return on equity (ROE). GARP investors look for strong and higher ROE compared to the industry average to identify superior stocks. Moreover, stocks with positive cash flow find precedence under the GARP plan.Value MetricsGARP investing gives priority to one of the popular value metrics — price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. Though this investing style picks stocks with higher P/E ratios compared to value investors, it avoids companies with extremely high P/E ratios. Moreover, the price-to-book value (P/B) ratio is another value metric that is considered.Using the GARP principle, we have run a screen to identify stocks that should offer solid returns in the near term.Screening ParametersAlong with the criteria discussed in the above section, we have considered a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).Last 5-year EPS & projected 3–5 year EPS growth rates between 10% and 20% (Strong EPS growth history and prospects ensure improving business.)ROE (over the past 12 months) greater than the industry average (Higher ROE compared to the industry average indicates superior stocks.)P/E and P/B ratios less than M-industry average (P/E and P/B ratios less than that of the industry indicates that the stocks are undervalued.)These few criteria have narrowed down the universe of over 7,700 stocks to only 16.Here are seven of the 16 stocks that made it through the screen:VMware, Inc.

1471,BBY,"Investors generally gauge a stock’s potential return by examining earnings growth and valuation multiples. At the same time, it’s important to measure the performance of such a stock relative to its industry or peers, or the appropriate benchmark.If you see that a stock is underperforming on fundamental factors, then it would be prudent to move on and find a better alternative. However, those outperforming their respective sectors in terms of price should be selected because they stand a better chance to provide considerable returns.Then again, it is imperative that you determine whether or not an investment has relevant upside potential when considering stocks with significant relative price strength. Stocks delivering better than the S&P 500 over a period of one to three months at the least and having solid fundamentals indicate room for growth and are the best ways to go about this strategy.Finally, it is important to find out whether analysts are optimistic about the upcoming earnings results of these companies. In order to do this, we have added positive estimate revisions for the current quarter’s (Q1) earnings to our screen. When a stock undergoes an upward revision, it leads to additional price gains.Screening ParametersRelative % Price change – 12 weeks greater than 0Relative % Price change – 4 weeks greater than 0Relative % Price change – 1 week greater than 0(We have considered those stocks that have been outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 12 weeks, four weeks and one week.)% Change (Q1) Est. over 4 Weeks greater than 0: Positive current quarter estimate revisions over the last four weeks.Zacks Rank equal to 1: Only Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks – that have returned more than 26% annually over the last 26 years and surpassed the S&P 500 in 23 of the last 26 years – can get through.

1472,BBY,"Amazon.com (AMZN  -  Free Report) CEO Jeff Bezos topped the recently announced Forbes 2018 Billionaires list for the first time. Per Forbes, Bezos is worth $112 billion, up $39.2 billion from 2017, the biggest one-year gain in the list’s history.Amazon’s strong share price movement driven by impressive performance has been a key catalyst behind the massive rise in Bezos’ wealth. Amazon carries Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and has returned 81.6% in the past year, significantly outperforming the industry’s rally of 66.5%.Growth Prospects RobustAmazon is primarily benefiting from sustained momentum in Amazon Web Services (“AWS”) and its ubiquitous presence in retail. AWS generates much higher margins than retail, positively impacting Amazon’s profitability.  Moreover, the retail business remains very hard to beat on price, choice and convenience. Moreover, the Whole Foods acquisition has helped the company rapidly penetrate the grocery segment of the brick-and-mortar stores. Further, increasing number of paid Prime members is positive.Additionally, we believe that Amazon’s strategy of diversifying footprint into healthcare and financial services bodes well for its CEO and shareholders in the long haul.Better Choices ExistAlthough entrepreneurship is the best possible way to become a centibillionaire like Jeff Bezos, it is not everyone’s forte. It is here that the Zacks Style Score System can come in handy.We use the Zacks Growth Style Score to pick stocks. Our Growth Style Score condenses all the essential metrics from a company’s financial statements to get a true sense of the quality and sustainability of its growth.Our research shows that stocks with Growth Style Scores of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) offer the best investment opportunities in the growth investing space.

1473,BBY,"Shares of Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) sunk 1% on Wednesday morning after one of the e-commerce power’s longest-serving executives left the company to a take a roll at Airbnb. However, Amazon shares have since rebounded after reports surfaced that it invested in another home electronics startup and will offer steep discounts on its Prime membership to select customers.Top Exec Out The former VP of Amazon Prime, Greg Greeley, who helped create the business and was also involved in integrating Whole Foods, announced recently that he was set to move on to pursue a new challenge. Vacation rental super startup Airbnb just introduced Greeley as the new president of its “Home” business.Greely joined Amazon just a few years after the company went public and has been an integral part of one of its biggest consume-facing business operations.Smart Thermostat Amazon, through its Amazon Alexa Fund, was reportedly part of the $62 million series C round of funding for smart thermostat brand Ecobee, according to a CNBC report. The startup already comes with built-in Amazon Alexa voices services.Ecobee’s software also allows its devices to work with systems from Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report), IFTTT, Google  and Samsung. The products, which vary in price, can cost up to $250 and are currently sold on Amazon and in stores at Best Buy (BBY  -  Free Report), Home Depot (HD  -  Free Report), Lowe’s (LOW  -  Free Report), and Apple.The news comes roughly a week after Amazon announced its purchase of connected doorbell company, Ring—for a reported $1 billion. Amazon’s latest investment also comes after the company decided that it would no longer sell some products from Google’s Nest smart home division.Lower Prime Prices Amazon will now offer customers who receive Medicaid the option to purchase a Prime membership at a discounted rate of $5.99 a month, a discount from the company’s new $12.99 rate. Amazon’s discount plan comes after the company rolled out discounted pricing for customers who hold a valid Electronic Benefits Transfer card.Amazon plans to grab more customers through discounted pricing. However, the company also noted that it hopes to give more people access to additional “aspects of the digital economy — some conveniences and benefits — that I think a lot of us take for granted,” Amazon executive Aaron Perrine told Recode.If widely adopted, Amazon could expand the reach of its hugely popular e-commerce business and delivery services and further encroach on Walmart (WMT  -  Free Report) by grabbing more lower-income customers.Breaking News: Cryptocurrencies Now Bigger than VisaThe total market cap of all cryptos recently surpassed $700 billion – more than a 3,800% increase in the previous 12 months.

1474,BBY,"With Q3 earnings season nearly over, the focus is likely to shift to the retail sector, which hogs all attention with the advent of the holiday season. Retail stocks get a thrust during this busiest part of the year, which is often a make-or-break time for retailers. As the countdown to Black Friday begins, investors also scurry for bright spots in the space.Eye-popping Black Friday deals usher in the Christmas shopping bonanza. Apart from price-matching policies, retailers try to sweep buyers off their feet with early-hour store openings, huge discounts, promotional strategies and free shipping on online purchases. Competition will certainly be tough, be it at the brick-and-mortar stores or online portals.Per the survey conducted by RetailMeNot, consumers are likely to spend an average of $743 this year during the Black Friday weekend through Cyber Monday up from the prior-year figure of $505.Retailers such as Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report), Best Buy (BBY  -  Free Report), Target (TGT  -  Free Report) and others are efficiently allocating a large chunk of their capital toward a multi-channel growth strategy focused on improving merchandise offerings, developing IT infrastructure to enhance the web and mobile experience of customers, renovating stores with a modern look, and developing fulfillment centers to enable speedy delivery.Retail Space Rides on Favorable IndicatorsThe rebound in oil prices from all-time lows, an improving labor market, along with a rising housing market and manufacturing sector signal that the economy is in recovery mode that rose 3% in the third quarter of 2017. Further, the Fed’s indication of a likely rate hike in December reflects the underlying fundamental strength of the economy.Analysts believe that buoyant stock market, gradual wage acceleration, fall in the unemployment rate to 17-year low, and a lift in the economic activity post hurricanes were enough to boost consumer confidence. We anticipate this positive sentiment to translate into higher consumer spending that may help increase sales in the current retail landscape, which is witnessing a sea change with the focus gradually shifting to online shopping.The nation's largest retail trade group, National Retail Federation projects a 3.6-4% rise in November and December sales (excluding autos, gas and restaurant sales) to $678.75-$682 billion, up from $655.8 billion last year and better than the five-year average sales growth of 3.5%. Data compiled by eMarketer forecasts 3.1% jump in holiday sales (November and December) to $923.15 billion, while retail e-commerce holiday season sales are anticipated to rise 16.6%.Indeed, shopping season is likely to be more blissful for retailers. So, how about betting your bucks on lucrative options?4 Prominent PicksHere we have highlighted four Retail/Wholesale stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and a VGM Score of A or B.

1475,BBY,"Making its debut on 12/02/2015, smart beta exchange traded fund SPDR Russell 1000 Momentum Focus ETF (ONEO  -  Free Report) provides investors broad exposure to the Large Cap ETFs category of the U.S. equity market.What Are Smart Beta ETFs?Products that are based on market cap weighted indexes, which are strategies designed to reflect a specific market segment or the market as a whole, have traditionally dominated the ETF industry.Market cap weighted indexes work great for investors who believe in market efficiency. They provide a low-cost, convenient and transparent way of replicating market returns.There are some investors, though, who think it's possible to beat the market with great stock selection; this group likely invests in another class of funds known as smart beta, which track non-cap weighted strategies.By attempting to pick stocks that have a better chance of risk-return performance, non-cap weighted indexes are based on certain fundamental characteristics, or a combination of such.This area offers many different investment choices, such as simplest equal-weighting, fundamental weighting and volatility/momentum based weighting methodologies; however, not all of these strategies can deliver superior results.Fund Sponsor & IndexThe fund is managed by State Street Global Advisors. ONEO has been able to amass assets over $584.92 M, making it one of the average sized ETFs in the Large Cap ETFs. This particular fund seeks to match the performance of the Russell 1000 Momentum Focused Factor Index before fees and expenses.The Russell 1000 Momentum Focused Factor Index reflects the performance of a segment of large-capitalization U.S. equity securities demonstrating a combination of core factors with a focus factor comprising high momentum characteristics.Cost & Other ExpensesExpense ratios are an important factor in the return of an ETF and in the long-term, cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive cousins, other things remaining the same.Annual operating expenses for ONEO are 0.20%, which makes it one of the cheaper products in the space.The fund has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 1.61%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsETFs offer diversified exposure and thus minimize single stock risk, but it is still important to delve into a fund's holdings before investing. Most ETFs are very transparent products and many disclose their holdings on a daily basis.Representing 19.80% of the portfolio, the fund has heaviest allocation to the Consumer Discretionary sector; Information Technology and Industrials round out the top three.Taking into account individual holdings, Micron Technology Inc. (MU  -  Free Report) accounts for about 0.87% of the fund's total assets, followed by Lear Corporation (LEA  -  Free Report) and Best Buy Co. Inc. (BBY  -  Free Report).The top 10 holdings account for about 6.91% of total assets under management.Performance and RiskONEO return is roughly 1.49% so far this year, and as of 05/18/2018, is up about 17.09% in the last one year. In the past 52-week period, the fund has traded between $68.30 and $77.24.ONEO has a beta of 0.93 and standard deviation of 12.97% for the trailing three-year period. With about 879 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.AlternativesSPDR Russell 1000 Momentum Focus ETF is a reasonable option for investors seeking to outperform the Large Cap ETFs segment of the market. However, there are other ETFs in the space which investors could consider.IShares Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV  -  Free Report) tracks S&P 500 Index and the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY  -  Free Report) tracks S&P 500 Index. IShares Core S&P 500 ETF has $146.72 B in assets, SPDR S&P 500 ETF has $259.51 B. IVV has an expense ratio of 0.04% and SPY charges 0.09%.Investors looking for cheaper and lower-risk options should consider traditional market cap weighted ETFs that aim to match the returns of the Large Cap ETFs.Bottom LineTo learn more about this product and other ETFs, screen for products that match your investment objectives and read articles on latest developments in the ETF investing universe, please visit Zacks ETF Center.

1476,BBY,"Lowe’s Companies, Inc. (LOW  -  Free Report) reported first-quarter fiscal 2018 results, with earnings and sales lagging the Zacks Consensus Estimate. This marks the company’s second consecutive bottom-line miss. Nevertheless, the company’s top and bottom line depicted year-over-year improvement in the quarterly results.In the first quarter, unfavorable weather conditions in several regions led to delayed spring season sales, which dented the company’s outdoor categories performance.

The company not only missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate on both earnings and revenue fronts but also witnessed a year-over-year decline in the bottom line.

The company posted earnings of $1.87 in the fiscal first quarter, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.22. It also missed the company’s own projection of $2.12-$2.22.

1478,BBY,"DICK’S Sporting Goods Inc. (DKS  -  Free Report) is slated to report first-quarter fiscal 2018 results on May 30, before the opening bell. In the last reported quarter, the company recorded positive earnings surprise of 1.7%. Notably, its earnings have surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 3.3%.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is 43 cents per share, reflecting a year-over-year decline of 20.4%. We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter has moved up in the last 30 days. Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $1.89 billion, reflecting 3.3% growth from the prior-year quarter. Let’s see how things are shaping up ahead of the upcoming release.DICK'S Sporting Goods, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise DICK'S Sporting Goods, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | DICK'S Sporting Goods, Inc. QuoteFactors at PlayWe note that DICK’S Sporting has underperformed the industry in the past month, reflecting a negative sentiment ahead of earnings. The company’s shares have declined 8.1% against the industry’s increase of 6.3%. The stock is troubled by the soft top-line performance in the last-reported quarter, due to softness in hunting and electronic categories. Additionally, the company’s margins continue to be strained for the past few quarters.Moreover, the company expects the hunting and firearm, as well as electronics businesses, to experience headwinds throughout fiscal 2018, which will hurt the top line. The hunting and firearm business will continue to be impacted by the recent changes to the company’s firearm policies, while the electronics business will be hurt by reduced exposure to this business. While innovations and growth of private brands are likely to ease margin pressures in fiscal 2018, the company still anticipates margins to be negative. Consolidated operating margins are expected to decrease year over year in fiscal 2018, due to SG&A deleverage, relating to increased investments in business and restoration of incentive compensation to historic levels.However, the company’s investments in e-commerce, store technology and store payroll, as well as DICK'S Team Sports HQ and private brands, are likely to enrich customers’ experience and drive market share growth. Also, the company remains on track to expand its e-commerce business. Further, it plans to make significant investments in the business as it remains confident about the long-term potential and tremendous opportunities in the evolving industry. For fiscal 2018, management projects earnings of nearly $2.83 per share.What the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model does not conclusively show that DICK’S Sporting is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter.

1480,BBY,"Take a company’s revenues over a given period of time, subtract the cost of production and you will have its earnings! Earnings growth enthralls all, right from the top brass to research analysts. And why not? If the company doesn’t make money, it won’t be able to stand the test of time.This metric is also considered the most vital variable in influencing the share price. Better-than-expected earnings performance normally leads to a rally in the share price. However, in addition to actual earnings, expectations of earnings play a significant role in influencing the price of a stock.Earnings Estimates Determine Share PricesWe have often seen a decline in the stock price despite earnings growth and a rally in the price following an earnings decline. This is largely a result of a company’s earnings failing to meet market expectations.Earnings estimates embody analysts’ opinion on factors such as sales growth, product demand, competitive industry environment, profit margins and cost control. Thus, earnings estimates serve as a valuable tool while making investment decisions. Earnings estimates also help analysts assess the cash flow to determine the fair value of a firm.Investors, thus, should be on the lookout for stocks that are ready to make a big move. Hence, it is important for investors to buy stocks that have historical earnings growth and are also seeing a rise in quarterly and annual earnings estimates.Screening Parameters:In order to shortlist stocks that have striking earnings growth and positive estimate revisions, we added the following parameters:Zacks Rank equal to 1 (Only Zacks' 'Strong Buys' are allowed.

Moreover, the company surpassed sales estimates in the fourth quarter, which marked its third beat of the last four quarters.The company’s solid results followed its announcement of closing 250 small mobile phone stores in the U.S. malls, which boosted investor sentiment. Sources revealed that the closures were announced to boost profitability and restore business in a competitive environment.

Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Best Buy Co., Inc. QuoteThe top line increased nearly 14% year over year to $15,363 million and beat the consensus mark of $14,570.4 million. Enterprise comparable-store sales (comps) were up 9% against a decline of 0.7% reported in the prior-year period.Comps growth mainly came on the back of smooth execution of the Best Buy 2020 Strategy, alongside improved product availability, rising consumer confidence and a favorable macro environment, a strong gaming category and a constructive competitive backdrop. Favorable comps in turn aided top and bottom-line performances.Adjusted operating profit came in at $982 million, up 10.3% year over year. However, adjusted operating margin contracted 20 basis points to 6.4% due to an operating margin decline in the Domestic segment, which contributes nearly 90% of the company’s profitability.Segment DetailsDomestic segment revenues gained 13.4% year over year to $13,987 million, primarily owing to a 9% increase in comparable sales and contribution from the additional 53rd week. This was partially offset by a revenue loss from the shutdown of 18 large-format stores. Comps gained from growth across most categories, with particular strength in mobile phones, gaming, appliances, smart home, wearables and home theater.Domestic comparable-online sales grew 17.9% to $2.8 billion. This upside was driven by an increase in average order value and conversion rates.The segment’s adjusted gross profit rose 13.2% to $3,113 million, while adjusted gross margin came in at 22.3%, flat year over year. Adjusted operating income jumped 10.9% to $897 million. However, adjusted operating income margin contracted 20 bps to 6.4%.The lower operating profit rate can be attributed to higher SG&A expenses that stemmed from a rise in incentive compensation expense at stores and for corporate employees due to strength witnessed throughout the year. Further, ongoing investments in business growth also led to a rise in SG&A expenses.International segment revenues climbed 20.3% to $1,376 million, primarily on the back of a 9.9% rise in comparable sales growth both in Canada and Mexico, a favorable foreign currency impact of 580 bps and nearly $45 million contribution from the additional week.The segment’s adjusted gross profit grew 9.6% to $308 million in the reported quarter and adjusted gross margin contracted 220 bps to 22.4%. Adjusted operating profit came in at $85 million, up 4.9% from $81 million reported in the year-ago quarter. Adjusted operating income margin came in at 6.2%, down 90 bps.Other Financial DetailsBest Buy ended fiscal 2018 with cash and cash equivalents of $1,101 million, long-term debt of $809 million and total equity of $3,612 million. In the fiscal fourth quarter, the company returned about $965 million to shareholders via buybacks of $866 million and dividends of $99 million.Concurrent to the earnings release, the company raised its quarterly dividend rate by 32% to 45 cents per share. It also approved a share repurchase plan worth nearly $1.5 billion for fiscal 2019. This represents an updated two-year buyback plan of $3.5 billion, following the $3 billion plan announced at the start of fiscal 2018.GuidanceFollowing the solid close to fiscal 2018, Bets Buy provided an encouraging view for the first quarter and fiscal 2019.

Meanwhile, the company expects an effective tax rate of nearly 25% and earnings per share in the range of $4.80-$5, reflecting growth of about 9-13% from fiscal 2018.For first-quarter fiscal 2019, management anticipates Enterprise revenues between $8.65 billion and $8.75 billion, and a comparable sales increase of 1.5-2.5%. Management also projects adjusted earnings in the band of 68-73 cents a share.    Also, in the fiscal first quarter, the company expects domestic comparable sales to rise in the range of 1.5-2.5%, while international comparable sales are estimated in the band of flat to up 3%.Further, the company updated its fiscal 2021 adjusted earnings per share target to $5.50-$5.75, reflecting the benefits of the new tax reform.Interested in the Retail Space?

This particular fund seeks to match the performance of the NASDAQ US Rising Dividend Achievers Index before fees and expenses.The Index is designed to provide access to a diversified portfolio of companies with a history of paying dividends.Cost & Other ExpensesWhen considering an ETF's total return, expense ratios are an important factor. And, cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive cousins in the long term if all other factors remain equal.Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.50%, making it one of the more expensive products in the space.RDVY's 12-month trailing dividend yield is 1.33%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsIt is important to delve into an ETF's holdings before investing despite the many upsides to these kinds of funds like diversified exposure, which minimizes single stock risk. And, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.Representing 29.50% of the portfolio, the fund has heaviest allocation to the Financials sector; Consumer Discretionary and Information Technology round out the top three.Looking at individual holdings, Valero Energy Corporation (VLO  -  Free Report) accounts for about 2.50% of total assets, followed by Best Buy Co., Inc. (BBY  -  Free Report) and Automatic Data Processing, Inc. (ADP  -  Free Report).Its top 10 holdings account for approximately 22.2% of RDVY's total assets under management.Performance and RiskSo far this year, the ETF return is roughly 2.25%, and is up about 17.05% in the last one year (as of 05/18/2018). RDVY has traded between $26.49 and $31.88 in the past 52-week period.The ETF has a beta of 1.01 and standard deviation of 15.17% for the trailing three-year period, making it a medium choice in the space. With about 50 holdings, it has more concentrated exposure than peers.AlternativesFirst Trust Rising Dividend Achievers ETF is an excellent option for investors seeking to outperform the Large Cap ETFs segment of the market. There are other ETFs in the space which investors could consider as well.IShares Russell 1000 Value ETF (IWD  -  Free Report) tracks Russell 1000 Value Index and the Vanguard Value ETF (VTV  -  Free Report) tracks CRSP U.S. Large Cap Value Index.

1485,BBY,"Medtronic plc (MDT  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report its fourth quarter and fiscal 2018 results before the opening bell on May 24.Last reported quarter, the company delivered earnings ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.86%. In fact, Medtronic’s bottom line outpaced estimates in all the trailing four quarters with an average beat of 3.54%.Let’s see, how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Key CatalystsWe look forward to another quarter of solid growth on the company’s successful execution of three growth strategies such as therapy innovation, globalization and an increase in Medtronic’s economic value. Combined with the demographics of an aging population, these positives have started to open up opportunities for Medtronic, which should further get reflected in the fiscal fourth quarter as well.Medtronic PLC Price and EPS Surprise Medtronic PLC Price and EPS Surprise | Medtronic PLC Quote The space for therapy innovation is filled with multiple developments. Under the Cardiac and Vascular Group (CVG), new therapies are helping the company gain traction in the rapidly growing MedTech markets for left ventricular assist device (LVAD), transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), drug-coated balloons, atrial fibrillation ablation and insertable diagnostics.In the to-be-reported quarter, Medtronic is expected to have maintained a market share in the core pacing, ICD (implantable cardioverter defibrillator) and CRT (cardiac resynchronization therapy) product lines within the scope of CRHF (cardiac rhythm and heart failure) while creating new meaningful markets to enhance the company’s weighted average market growth.Within the TAVR space, the company hopes to see continued global growth on strong adoption of Evolut PRO valve around the world as well as expansion in the traditional U.S. TAVR centers and U.S. share capture, resulting from Medtronic’s new intermediate risk indication.After several quarters of dull Drug Eluting stent (DES) performance in coronary, the company’s DES product line witnessed growth in both the United States and Japan since the last few quarters. This upside is driven by the recent launch of Resolute Onyx in the said markets. Further, these developments buoy optimism and strengthen our belief for a strong quarterly performance by the company.Notably, following the FDA approval in February, Medtronic announced the U.S. launch of the Resolute Onyx 2.0 mm DES, the smallest sized DES in the market. We expect this to contribute to the company’s DES business in the yet-to-be-reported quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for CVG revenues in the fiscal fourth quarter is pegged at $3.10 billion, 9.1% higher than the year-ago number of $2.85 billion.Within Minimally Invasive Therapies Group (MITG), surgical innovations should register sturdy growth, driven by new products in advanced stapling and advanced energy. Advanced stapling growth should come on the back of endo stapling specialty reloads with Tri-Staple technology as well as Signia. Advanced Energy growth should bank on a consistent rollout of the company’s LigaSure instruments and Valleylab FT10 energy platform.Medtronic currently remains confident about its ability to grow MITG in the mid-single-digit over the longer term.Within the Restorative Therapies Group (RTG), the company witnesses encouraging developments regarding the brain therapy space. This division experienced 5% growth during the fiscal third quarter, driven by high teens growth in neurovascular and strong sales of StealthStation navigation as well as O-arm imaging technologies, which further led to low double-digit growth in neurosurgery. We expect this bullish trend to continue in the last-completed quarter as well.Within Pain, the company awaits a positive customer uptake from Intellis platform and an evolved workflow.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for RTG revenues in the soon-to-be-reported quarter stands at $2.09 billion, 60.3% above the year-ago reported figure.Here’s What the Quantitative Model Predicts:Per the proven Zacks model, a company with a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has good chances of beating estimates if it also has a positive Earnings ESP.Medtronic has a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP and an Earnings ESP of +0.09%, which raises confidence about a positive surprise. Together, the combination suggests that the company is likely to beat on earnings this period to be reported. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Conversely, we caution against the Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are some other stocks worth considering from the same space as our proven model shows that these too have the right combination of elements to surpass estimates in the upcoming releases:Best Buy Co., Inc.

This reflects a positive sentiment on the stock, ahead of earnings.Factors at PlayRoss Stores has been continuing with its upbeat performance, recording positive earnings and sales surprises for the last seven quarters. The company is gaining from continually delivering broad assortments of compelling bargains to value-focused customers.Further, the company’s solid endeavors, including better price management, merchandising initiatives, cost containment and store-expansion plans, position it for growth.

1488,BBY,"Target Corporation (TGT  -  Free Report) posted second straight quarter of negative earnings surprise, when it reported first-quarter fiscal 2018 results. The company posted adjusted earnings of $1.32 per share that not only missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.38 but also came below the mid-point of the earlier provided guidance range of $1.25-$1.45 per share. Clearly, this was not well perceived by investors.We note shares of this Minneapolis-based company are down roughly 6% during pre-market trading hours. Even investors ignored the fact that the bottom line improved 9.4% from the prior-year period. This year-over-year growth can be attributable to increased sales and fall in interest expense as well as share repurchase activity that to an extent offset rise in cost of sales and higher SG&A expenses.The company generated total revenue of $16,781 million that came ahead the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $16,529 million for the fifth straight quarter and increased 3.4% from the year-ago quarter. Sales rose 3.5% to $16,556 million, while other revenue declined 1.2% to $225 million.Target is trying all means to rapidly adapt to the changes in the retail ecosystem. The company is deploying resources to enhance omni-channel capacities, come up with new brands, remodel or refurbish stores, and expand same-day delivery options to expedite the shopping process.During the quarter under review, Target concluded 56 remodels, opened 7 new outlets and launched three new brands. The company also introduced Drive-Up service in more than 250 stores and expanded Target Restock nationwide. Courtesy to Shipt, the company also rolled out same-day delivery from more than 700 outlets.Notably, comparable sales for the quarter increased 3% compared with 1.3% decline witnessed in the year-ago period. The number of transactions jumped 3.7%, while the average transaction amount decreased 0.6%. Comparable digital channel sales surged 28% and added 1.1 percentage points to comparable sales.These helped this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock to gain 35% in the past six months compared with the industry’s growth of 17%.Gross margin contracted 20 basis points to 29.8%, while operating margin shriveled 90 basis points to 6.2%. Industry experts believe that incremental investments and rise in costs due to new fulfillment options might have hurt margins.Target’s debit card penetration contracted 10 basis points to 13.5%, while credit card penetration fell 50 basis points to 10.6%. Total REDcard penetration declined to 24.1% from 24.7% in the year-ago quarter.Target Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Target Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Target Corporation QuoteOther Financial DetailsDuring the quarter, Target repurchased shares worth $494 million and paid dividends of $334 million.

The increase in the top line was owing to robust performance of its Urban Outfitters, Anthropologie Group and Free People brands.

At Free People, the metric increased 13.7% to $181.3 million.

1490,BBY,"Office Depot, Inc. (ODP  -  Free Report), which is slated to release fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 28, has seen shares plunge 26.8% in the past six months. The stock has not only underperformed the industry that grew 4.8% but also the broader Retail-Wholesale sector that advanced 21.6%.For quite some time now, Office Depot has been grappling with dwindling top-line performance. Analysts pointed out that demand for office products (paper-based) has been decreasing due to technological advancements. Smartphones, tablets and laptops are fast emerging as viable substitutes for paper-based office supplies. Further, stiff competition from online retailers, loss of customers in Business Solutions Division and soft store traffic have been playing spoilsport.Nevertheless, management is not sitting idle, and instead trying all means to bring the stock back on growth trajectory. The company is closing underperforming stores, reducing exposure to higher dollar-value inventory items, shuttering non-critical distribution facilities, concentrating on e-commerce platforms as well as focusing on offering innovative products and services.Which Way are the Estimates Treading?The question lingering in investors’ minds is whether this supplier of a range of office products and services will be able to post positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. In the preceding quarter, it had reported in-line earnings.Let’s look at earnings estimate revisions in order to get a clear picture of what analysts are thinking about the company prior to the release. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review has decreased by a penny in the last 30 days, and is currently pegged at 7 cents. The consensus estimate shows a sharp decline from 11 cents reported in the year-ago quarter.Office Depot, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Office Depot, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Office Depot, Inc. QuoteFactors Influencing the Quarterly ResultsTop-Line Likely to Decline AgainOffice Depot continues to battle a dismal top-line. Total sales had declined 7%, 9% and 8% in the first, second and third quarter of 2017, respectively. Management expects total sales to be lower in 2017 in comparison with 2016, owing to the store closures, tough market conditions, hurricane impacts and losses of contract customers. We also noted that comparable-store sales have tumbled 5%, 6% and 5% in the respective quarters.However, management anticipates the rate of sales decline to decelerate in the final quarter after taking into consideration higher customer retention and strategic endeavors, along with the implementation of new customer wins. Analysts polled by Zacks expect fourth-quarter revenue to be $2,541 million, reflecting a year-over-year decline of 6.8%.Are Remedies Undertaken Sufficient?Office Depot has undertaken a strategic review of business operating model, growth prospects and cost structure with primary focus on core North American market. The company by increasing penetration into adjacent categories and enhancing share of wallet with existing customers intends to boost sales in the contract channel.With respect to the cost containment effort, Office Depot is employing a more efficient customer coverage model, focusing on lowering indirect procurement costs as well as general and administrative expenditures, and also gaining from its U.S. retail store optimization plan.To widen its domain of offerings, Office Depot acquired CompuCom Systems to acclimatize to the rapidly changing retail landscape along with providing enterprise-level tech services and products to customers. The company also launched a new subscription-based business services platform, BizBox, to assist start-ups and small businesses on host of things such as website designing, financing and accounting service, HR/payroll support and others.What Does the Zacks Model Unveil?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Office Depot is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter.

1491,BBY,"Nordstrom, Inc. (JWN  -  Free Report) is slated to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Mar 1, after the closing bell.The company has been gaining from the smooth execution of customer strategy along with disciplined inventory management. Also, it is enhancing market share through persistent store expansion and strengthening capabilities via further investments. Notably, these initiatives helped the company to deliver sixth straight positive earnings surprise in third-quarter fiscal 2017, wherein sales marked its second successive beat. However, higher expenses continue to remain a headwind, which are likely to weigh upon the company’s near-term margin performance.Nordstrom, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Nordstrom, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Nordstrom, Inc. QuoteThe Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.24 for the fourth quarter reflects a year-over-year decline of 9.5%, though it remained stable in the last 30 days. Moreover, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues to come in at $4,611 million, up 6.8% from the prior-year quarter. Furthermore, the consensus mark for sales at Nordstrom full-line stores and Nordstrom Rack are pegged at $2,060 million and $1,097 million, respectively, showing year-over-year increases of 38.4% and 13.6%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to the earnings announcement.Factors at PlayNordstrom is making significant progress with respect to its customer-based strategy and is on track to reach its long-term growth target of $20 billion by 2020. With regard to cost savings, the company plans to strike a balance between its sales and expense growth. Also, it is focused on advancing in the technology space by boosting e-commerce and digital networks, and improving its supply-chain channels and marketing efforts. Management anticipates online penetration to exceed 25% by the end of the year.Recently, the company also released sales and comparable store sales (comps) for the combined months of November and December, which primarily comprises the holiday season. Nordstrom recorded a 2.5% increase in net sales for the nine weeks (ended Dec 30, 2017) while comps for the period rose 1.2%. The solid holiday show was primarily driven by growth in Nordstrom’s full-line and Rack stores compared with the year-to-date sales performance and persistent strength in e-commerce at Nordstrom.com and Nordstromrack.com/HauteLook.Driven by the robust holiday sales, management raised its previously stated guidance for fiscal 2017. The company now expects sales growth of nearly 4.2%, including the 53rd week, with comps expected to gain 0.5%. Additionally, Nordstrom anticipates earnings in the range of $2.90-$2.95 per share, marking an increase from the prior guidance range of $2.85-$2.95 per share. The revised guidance assumes strong sales growth, persistent stability in merchandise margins and higher supply chain, technology, and occupancy costs related to the company’s growth initiatives.These factors have boosted the company’s share price performance in the last three months. The stock has gained 22.7% compared with the industry’s growth of 11.7%.Though Nordstrom’s growth strategy bodes well, higher investments related to occupancy, technology, supply chain and marketing are likely to hurt the company’s performance. Apparently, the company’s merchandise margin was hurt by higher occupancy expenses related to new Rack and Canada stores in the fiscal third quarter. This led contraction in gross margins and increase in SG&A expenses. For fiscal 2017, the company anticipates Retail gross profit to be impacted by higher new store occupancy expenses and mix impact from off-price growth.What the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model does not show that Nordstrom is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter.

The company has been progressing well backed by its solid focus on enhancing product quality and responsiveness to changing consumer trends. Apparently, the company has pulled off a positive earnings surprise in three consecutive quarters, with a trailing four-quarter average beat of 10.3%.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter earnings is pegged at 59 cents, reflecting year-over-year growth of 15.7%. Also, the estimate has moved up by a penny in the last seven days. Gap, Inc. (The) Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Gap, Inc. (The) Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Gap, Inc. (The) QuoteLet’s see how things are shaping up prior to the earnings announcement.Factors at PlayGap remains committed toward its growth strategy, which mainly focuses on the Old Navy and Athleta brands. The company, which had reported growth in comparable-store sales (comps) in the preceding four quarters owing to Old Navy’s robust performance, is likely to continue the momentum in the fourth quarter.Earlier, management had stated that comps reflected strength for the fiscal fourth quarter owing to persistent momentum at key areas of the company’s business. For fiscal 2017, comps are anticipated to grow in low-single digits versus previous projection of flat to marginal improvement.Moreover, comps performance buoyed Gap’s top line, delivering fourth straight beat in the fiscal third quarter. Encouragingly, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $4,667 million in the quarter under review, up nearly 5.4% year over year. Markedly, the consensus estimates for the Old Navy, Gap and Banana Republic brands are pegged at $2,118 million, $1,610 million and $713 million, respectively, representing year-over-year increases of 20.5%, 21.8% and 28%.Also, Gap’s solid strategic efforts are well reflected in the company’s share price movement. In a year’s time, the stock surged 31% substantially outperforming the industry’s gain of 1.5%.Furthermore, Gap continues to focus on boosting its digital and mobile offerings, omni-channel capabilities as well as enhancing its footprint in the value and active space. Backed by these initiatives and a sturdy performance in the nine months of fiscal 2017, management raised outlook for the year as well. For fiscal 2017, Gap envisions adjusted earnings per share in the range of $2.08-$2.12, up from $2.02-$2.10 projected earlier.However, Gap’s significant international presence exposes it to adverse currency fluctuations, which might adversely impact the company’s top and bottom lines.

1493,BBY,"Shares of Best Buy (BBY  -  Free Report) were down more than 7% in morning trading Thursday, just hours after the company reported its third-quarter earnings results. While the electronics retailer was able to record solid growth on the top and bottom line, investors are punishing the stock because earnings and sales missed expectations.In the second quarter, Best Buy reported earnings of 78 cents per share, up about 26% from the year-ago period but slightly below our consensus estimate of 79 cents. The company generated revenues of $9.32 billion, which was a 4.2% year-over-year improvement but behind our consensus estimate of $9.35 billion.So why did Best Buy miss our estimates? Well, management pointed to a pair of possible reasons in the company’s earnings release. For one, Best Buy was impacted by the devastating hurricanes that hit Texas, Florida, Puerto Rico, and Mexico during the quarter.But that’s been an issue that nearly every brick-and-mortar retailer has dealt with, and Best Buy’s other problem was a bit more specific to its own business. Indeed, management also said that revenue from mobile phone sales were “materially lower than expected” in the quarter.“This was due to the fact that a major new phone did not launch until November, which is in our Q4. The related revenue impact in the quarter was more than $100 million,” said CEO Hubert Joly.Joly and the rest of Best Buy’s management team stopped short of saying exactly what “major phone” they were referencing, but it is relatively obvious that the staggered release schedule of Apple’s (AAPL  -  Free Report) iPhone 8 and iPhone X devices is to blame here.The iPhone 8 was released during Best Buy’s third quarter, but demand for the device was significantly muted compared to a typical iPhone release. Simply put, consumers were more excited about the iPhone X, which promised to be the biggest step forward for Apple’s flagship line of phones since the original device.“As a result, we are raising our Q4 outlook versus what was implied in the expectations provided on our last earnings call,” said CFO Corie Barry.In addition to this improved outlook for Q4, Best Buy raised its outlook for the upcoming fiscal year. The company now projects Enterprise revenue to rise between 4% and 4.8% versus 4% guided for earlier.Best Buy might be experiencing some volatility as investors react to its earnings miss, but it should be encouraging that this underperformance can be traced back to one-time occurrences that will have little impact on the company going forward.Zacks’ Best Private Investment IdeasWhile we are happy to share many articles like this on the website, our best recommendations and most in-depth research are not available to the public.Starting today, and for the next month, you can follow all Zacks’ private buys and sells in real time.

Enterprise comparable-store sales (comps) were up 4.4% compared with a gain of 1.8%. reported in the prior-year period.The company’s lower-than-expected performance were due to lack of new launches of mobile, which impacted the revenues by $100 million and the blows of hurricanes in south Texas, Florida, Puerto Rico and Mexico.

While adjusted operating margin was 3.7% in comparison to 3.5% a year ago.Segment DetailsDomestic segment revenues gained 3.6% year over year to $8,491 million, primarily owing to 4.5% increase in comparable sales, further partially offset by a revenue loss from 10 large-format as well as 44 Best Buy Mobile store shutdowns.Domestic comparable-online sales grew 22.3 % to $1.1 billion.

1495,BBY,"New economic data and prominent retail earnings results are among the headline grabbers this morning, as the market anticipates passage of the House version of a domestic tax cut plan for corporations and individuals. Tomorrow the Senate version comes up for a vote, but neither bill fully compliments the other, so expect more heavy lifting in this regard going forward.In fact, should we see a smooth passage in both houses of Congress before the end of the week, this should generate positive sentiment in the market. Losses we’ve seen over the past week of trading may have begun with softness in Asian markets, but have stuck around due to newly found concerns whether a tax reform package will pass Congress this year. Major legislative reform has proven elusive for the Trump administration and its GOP-led lawmakers, and some are hedging these tax reform measures may be headed down the same road.Certainly you can’t blame Q3 earnings for any headwinds in the market; results continue to impress in a general sense, even among many in the tougher Retail space. Today, we see a tale of two big-box retailers:Discount leviathan Wal-Mart Stores (WMT  -  Free Report) once again outperformed estimates on both top and bottom lines in its fiscal Q3 2018 results, bringing in $1.00 per share on $123.2 billion in quarterly sales. These numbers topped the 97 cents and $121 billion expected, respectively. Comps were highest in the past 8 years. The Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company posted Q4 earnings guidance in a range between $4.38 - 4.46; the Zacks consensus estimate had previously been $4.38, so we’ll look to see if earnings estimates rise from here, bringing the Zacks Rank along with it.Wal-Mart shares are up sharply in today’s pre-market, north of 6% at this hour. Year to date, WMT is up more than 30%.Another big-boxer, Best Buy (BBY  -  Free Report), however, missed Q3 earnings by a penny to 78 cents per share, on $9.32 billion in revenues that fell short of the $9.35 billion in the Zacks consensus. Even still, EPS results were 30% higher than in the year-ago quarter, on comps that were up 4.4%. EPS guidance for Q4 is lower than analysts were expecting, however. The Zacks Rank #3 company has sold off 2% following the quarterly release, and shares remain up more than 30% year to date.Econ Data Wrap-UpInitial Jobless Claims jumped by 10,000 for the second week in a row to 249K last week; the previous week’s 239K was unrevised. This is still within the (non-hurricane-affected) multi-year range of 225-250K, synonymous with a robust U.S. labor market. Continuing claims claim down noticeably last week, to 1.86 million — again, a very strong number for overall domestic employment — from 1.9 million the previous week.Import Prices gained 0.2% last month, posting 2.5% growth year over year. Stripping out volatile petroleum costs, this number shaves to 0.1%. Export Prices hit 2.7%, unchanged year over year and, although pretty strong, are still down a tick from the previous month’s 2.8%.

1497,BBY,"Second-quarter earnings season is wrapping up, and results have—once again—proven to be relatively strong across the board. Sure, certain industries are struggling, but the economy appears to be healthy and our major indexes are continuing to hover near all-time highs.With that said, there’s obviously been plenty of positive earnings surprises that have led to skyrocketing share prices. But if you’re worried that you missed out on a chance to profit from an earnings beat, have no fear—earnings season isn’t over just yet.Luckily, we can use the Zacks Earnings ESP to gauge whether a company is poised to beat earnings estimates. Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions.This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.When combining a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks have produced a positive earnings about 70% of the time. Want to target stocks that are more likely to beat estimates before Q2 reporting season is over? Check out these three companies that have yet to report:1.       Walmart Stores, Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report)Walmart has been pumping a ton of cash into revamping its stores and expanding its e-commerce business. Therefore, it will likely face tough year-over-year comparisons this quarter. In fact, the current Zacks Consensus Estimate is calling for earnings of $1.07 per share, which would represent a decline of nearly 0.5% from the year-ago quarter.However, analyst sentiment has been improving recently, and the Most Accurate Estimate currently sits a penny higher—giving Walmart a positive Earnings ESP of 0.94%. Combined with the stock’s Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), this should give investors additional confidence heading into its earnings announcement on Thursday morning. 2.       Deere & Company (DE  -  Free Report)Best known for its line of John Deere agricultural equipment, Deere & Company is scheduled to release its fiscal third-quarter earnings on Friday morning. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently calling for earnings of $1.95 per share—a nearly 26% increase from the prior-year result. Deere & Company has also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of over 70% in each of the trailing four quarters.Analyst sentiment is strong heading into the report, as we’ve seen three positive estimate revisions in just the past seven days. Additionally, the Most Accurate Estimate sits at $1.98 per share, which gives Deere & Company a positive Earnings ESP of 1.54%. This fact, along with the stock’s Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and the company’s strong earnings surprise history, should have investors more confident about the chances of a beat. 3.       Best Buy Co., Inc. (BBY  -  Free Report)The retail sector has had a tough earnings season, but Best Buy has proven its ability to fend off competition from the likes of Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) recently. In fact, the company has surpassed consensus estimates by an average of nearly 34% in each of the last four quarters. This quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate is calling for earnings of $0.63 per share, which would represent year-over-year growth of just over 10%.Best Buy is scheduled to announce its earnings results before the market opens on August 29, and heading into the report, the company is sporting a positive Earnings ESP of 1.59%. The stock also has an “A” grade for Value in our Style Scores system, and its Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) is looking strong as we approach its report date. Want more stock market analysis from this author?

1498,BBY,"The Buckle, Inc. (BKE  -  Free Report) is slated to report second-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Aug 17, before the opening bell. This retailer of casual apparel, footwear and accessories has reported negative earnings surprise in three out of the trailing four quarters, with an average miss of 2.1%. With this in mind, let’s now look into some factors that are likely to impact second-quarter results.What Does the Zacks Model Unveil? Our proven model does not show that Buckle is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) as well as a positive Earnings ESP for this to happen. You may uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Buckle has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% as both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 22 cents. Moreover, the company carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). We caution against Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Estimate Revisions A look into estimate revisions give us an idea of what analysts are thinking about the company right before earnings release. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the second quarter and for the fiscal year 2017 has declined by a penny over the past 30 days to 22 cents and $1.63, respectively. Estimated earnings for the second quarter depict a fall of 31.3% from the prior-year period. The same for the fiscal year shows a decline of 19.7%.Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $195.7 million for the second quarter, down approximately 7.8% from prior-year quarter. Revenues for fiscal 2017 are expected to be $907.4 million, down 6.9% from the previous year.Buckle, Inc. (The) Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Buckle, Inc. (The) Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Buckle, Inc. (The) QuoteInvestors Remain Skeptical The stock has plunged approximately 18.5% in the past three months, wider than the industry’s decline of 12%. However, the broader Retail-Wholesale sector has gained 3.3% in the said time frame. In fact, investors aren’t enthusiastic, ahead of Buckle’s earnings release. We observe that the stock has declined roughly 12.2% in the past six days.Factors at PlayWe are skeptical about Buckles performance in the second quarter, given its sluggish comparable store sales (comps). Comps for the four-week period ended Jul 29, declined 8.4% year over year. This was preceded by a decrease of 5.8% in June, 9% in May, 3.5% in April, 10.1% in March, 23.2% in February and 17.6% in January.The company has not been able to turn around the performance of its Women’s business. It has also been witnessing weakness in its Men’s segment and combined accessory sales. Women's merchandise sales were down about 16% in the first quarter of fiscal 2017, while Men's merchandise sales dropped 11%. Women’s merchandise contributed 53% to total sales, while the Men’s business input was 47%. Combined accessory sales fell nearly 13%, while footwear sales declined 16%, during the first quarter. Further, a competitive retail landscape and cautious consumer spending have been weighing upon the company’s performance.However, in an effort to improve overall performance the company has been focusing on store refurbishment and technology upgrades. These initiatives are yet to bear significant impact upon the company’s top line.Do Retail Stocks Interest You? Check These Here are some other retail companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.94% and carries a Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Burlington Stores, Inc.

1499,BBY,"The U.S. equity market has regained strength after Irma lost its intensity and caused lower-than-anticipated destruction in Florida. The fact that tensions between the United States and North Korea haven’t worsened also helped investors to breathe easy. In fact, major indices moved north following the positive developments.Investors would now like to make the most of the bullish scenario and add stocks with potential to gain handsomely to their respective portfolios. Moreover, with the Q3 reporting cycle not too far away, potential outperformers are highly sought after. No one after all wants to see his/her hard-earned money go down the drains. In fact, maintaining a well-diversified portfolio (selecting stocks from different industries) is a tried and tested strategy to combat market uncertainties and generate handsome returns.However, with a deluge of stocks flooding the market at any point of time, the task of designing one’s portfolio with promising stocks is by no means easy for individual investors. The time constraint that we all face these days makes the task harder in the absence of guidance from experts in the field. These experts are brokers. They are equipped with detailed knowledge about the investing space.Since brokers arrive at their recommendation (Buy, Sell or Hold) on a stock after thoroughly analyzing the minute details associated with the company, it is natural for investors to be guided by estimate revisions while arriving at investment decisions. Estimate revisions serve as an important pointer regarding the price of a stock. In fact, a rating upgrade normally leads to stock price appreciation and vice versa.Estimates can move north for a number of reasons – favorable earnings performance, a bullish guidance, product launch or any favorable macro scenario. Similarly, a stock may fall out of brokers’ favor due to adverse events like pipeline failure (for a biotech player). Trimming of earnings estimates by brokers often results in stock price depreciation. Naturally, investors tend to dump such stocks on the basis of broker advice.Making the Most of Broker OpinionsWe have designed a screen to shortlist stocks based on improving analyst recommendation and upward revisions in earnings estimates over the last four weeks. Also, since the price/sales ratio is a strong complementary valuation metric in the presence of analyst information, it has been included. The price/sales ratio takes care of the company’s top line, making the strategy foolproof.Screening Criteria# (Up- Down Rating)/ Total (4 weeks) =Top #75 (This gives the list of top 75 companies that have witnessed net upgrades over the last 4 weeks).% change in Q (1) est. (4 weeks) = Top #10 (This gives the top 10 stocks that have witnessed earnings estimate revisions over the past four weeks for the upcoming quarter).We have also added the following screening parameters to ensure that the strategy is a winning one:Price-to-Sales = Bot%10 (The lower the ratio the better, companies meeting this criteria are in the bottom 10% of our universe of over 7,700 stocks with respect to this ratio).Price greater than 5 (as a stock trading below $5 will not likely create significant interest for most of the investors).Average Daily Volume greater than 100,000 shares over the last 20 trading days (Volume has to be significant to ensure that these are easily traded).Market value ($ mil) = Top #3000 (This gives us stocks that are the top 3000 in terms of market capitalization).Com/ADR/Canadian= Com (This takes out the ADR and Canadian stocks).Here are five of the 10 stocks that made it through the screen:Abercrombie & Fitch Co. (ANF  -  Free Report) operates as a specialty retailer of premium, high-quality casual apparel for men, women, and kids through a network of over 700 stores in the United States and multiple stores across Canada, Europe, Asia, Australia and the Middle East.

1501,BBY,"Shares of Dick’s Sporting Goods (DKS  -  Free Report) gained more than 5% during morning trading hours Wednesday after analysts from JPMorgan declared the company a “long-term survivor” in the struggling retail sector. On top of this bold declaration, JPMorgan upgraded DKS to “overweight” from “neutral” and raised its price target to $32, which would represent a 20% upside from the stock’s opening price on Wednesday. The firm also suggested that Dick’s is akin to Best Buy (BBY  -  Free Report), in that both brands should be stable enough to survive the retail downturn.“[We] appreciate the company's consistent focus on investing in its stores and the efforts in 2018 to put the customer at the center,” wrote JPMorgan analysts in a note.The firm pointed to management’s plan to initiate an “athletic inventory clean up” in the first half of the upcoming calendar year, arguing an inventory reduction will alleviate promotional pressure and improve average ticket.Interestingly, JPMorgan’s optimistic outlook for the sport retailer’s fiscal 2018 seems to be in contrast with the company’s own tepid guidance. On Tuesday, Dick’s reported a respectable third-quarter fiscal 2017, but the stock tumbled on the back of a not-so-impressive initial view for fiscal 2018 (also read: DICK'S Sporting Falls on Soft FY18 View, Q3 Earnings Top).While Dick’s did report earnings and sales surprises, the company warned of a tough retail environment next year. Management said that it expects the retail environment to be extremely promotional throughout 2018.On top of this, excess inventory in the supply chain, broadened distribution strategies from some vendors, and a lack of innovation and novelty could put pressure on margins. Nevertheless, management anticipates increasing investments in e-commerce, the technology in its stores, and store payroll.Want more stock market analysis from this author?

1503,BBY,"Bargain hunters continue with their shopping spree, as U.S. retail sales tick up again in the month of April, after rebounding sharply in March. Although the rate of sales growth moderated from the prior month, it still clearly indicates that the economy remains well on track after a muted start to the year. Evidently, consumers are splurging on clothing, grocery and furniture.In spite of recent hiccups in the stock market, Americans look much more confident now buoyed by strengthening labor market, tax reform and rising incomes. Certainly, consumer spending — one of the pivotal factors driving the economy — is likely to remain strong in the months ahead, unless arrested by a spike in gasoline prices that might lower their propensity to consume.Retail Sales Continue to Pop UpThe Commerce Department stated that U.S. retail and food services sales in April advanced 0.3% to $497.6 billion, following an upwardly revised reading of 0.8% gain in March. Analysts pointed that retail sales remained soft in the months of February and January, as consumers cut back on their spending due to delay in tax refunds. As a result, consumer spending increased 1.1% in the first quarter, marking the lowest growth rate in a span of roughly five years.Notably, retail sales improved 4.7% from April 2017. The report suggests that sales at motor vehicles and parts dealers inched up 0.1%, while sales at furniture & home furnishing stores rose 0.8%. Meanwhile, sales at both food & beverage stores and building material dealers grew 0.4%. Receipts at gasoline stations rose 0.8%, while sales at clothing & clothing accessories stores improved 1.4%. Sales at non-store retailers climbed 0.6% and surged 9.6% from the prior-year period.However, sales at sporting goods, hobby, book & music stores dipped 0.1%, while at food services & drinking places the same fell 0.3%. Sales at electronics & appliance stores edged down 0.1%.Retail Stocks to Continue MomentumPick up in retail sales is welcome news for retailers, whose fortunes depend upon consumers’ willingness to spend. A robust job market with unemployment rate at 3.9%, massive tax cuts and sound economic fundamentals are likely to boost consumer confidence. We expect this positive sentiment to translate into higher consumer spending. Certainly, favorable economic indicators along with friendlier fiscal and regulatory policies from the current regime bode well for the sector.For obvious reasons, retailers are the end gainers. With digital transformation in shopping, retailers are fast adopting the omni-channel mantra to provide a seamless shopping experience, whether online or in-stores. Moreover, National Retail Federation’s projection of an uptick in U.S. retail sales of 3.8-4.4% this year raises optimism. Additionally, the recent cut in corporate tax rate will allow retailers to channelize the surplus money toward best possible alternatives.Notably, the Retail-Wholesale sector has advanced roughly 10% in the past six months and has comfortably outperformed the S&P 500’s growth of approximately 5%. The sector’s progress card this reporting cycle also looks quite impressive.Markedly, total earnings of the S&P 500 retailers that have already reported results increased 24.8% on the back of 13.6% jump in revenues, per the latest Earnings Outlook. Well, about half of the retailers in the S&P 500 index released their quarterly outcomes, with 70% topping bottom-line estimates and 60% delivering positive revenue surprise.Wrapping UpWith several retail behemoths queued up to report their quarterly numbers, the sector is likely to remain in the limelight. So, picking up stocks that are likely to trump estimates will be a prudent move. This is because a stock generally picks up steam on an earnings beat.These are stocks with a favorable combination of a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) and a positive Earnings ESP.

1504,BBY,"J. C. Penney Company, Inc. (JCP  -  Free Report) is slated to release first-quarter fiscal 2018 results on May 17. In the previous quarter, the company reported better-than-expected earnings. Also, it surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters.An Insight in to Current EstimatesIn order to get a clear picture of what analysts expect from the company’s earnings release, let’s take a look at the earnings estimate revisions.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter bottom line, which has been stable over the past 60 days, is pegged at a loss of 22 cents, comparing unfavorably with the year-ago earnings of 6 cents. Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $2.60 billion, reflecting a decline of 3.8% year over year.J. C. Penney Company, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise J. C. Penney Company, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | J. C. Penney Company, Inc. Quote Despite several measures, we expect the retail landscape to remain tough for J. C. Penney. Also, the company’s store closures are likely to weigh on its performance. Due to change in consumer spending patterns, retailers are making investments on digitalization that might keep margins under pressure in the short term.We note that for first-quarter fiscal 2018, the company had earlier highlighted that the cost of goods sold is likely to increase by 40 to 60 basis points (bps) from the year-ago quarter. Accordingly, the gross margin is likely to decline in the first quarter from the year-ago-quarter.Are Strategies Potent Enough to Fight Headwinds?J. C. Penney has taken up several strategic initiatives to drive traffic. The company, in order to enhance customer shopping experience, has been focusing on remodeling, renovating and refurbishing its stores with special focus on improving high-margin center core department that houses handbags, fashion accessories, sunglasses and fashion jewelry. The company stated that it is planning to rebrand and modernize 100 salons to Salon by InStyle.J. C. Penney continues to work on improving its omni-channel reach. As online shopping traffic is higher than average, improving their shopping experience is the key to build a strong online portal.To drive traffic online, the company is providing convenient shipping and pickup options like pick up in store same day facility, ship to any J. C. Penney store and faster home delivery. The company has invested substantially to boost supply chain efficiency.Meanwhile, the company’s Sephora stores, which have done exceptionally well in the past and are regarded as one of the best performing categories, are likely to maintain the uptrend in the first quarter. In fact, these shops are part of J. C. Penney’s strategy to gain a competitive edge over other beauty product retailers and drugstores that have significantly enhanced their cosmetics businesses in the recent years.Given the aforementioned strategic initiatives, management expects comp sales in the first quarter to be at the high end of the annual guidance which is in the range of flat to up 2%.What the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model does not show that J. C. Penney is likely to beat bottom-line estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter. J. C. Penney has an Earnings ESP of -28.44%.

1506,BBY,"Investors on the lookout for stocks with the potential for maximum growth and value investing may consider the growth at a reasonable price or GARP strategy.This popular strategy helps investors gain exposure to stocks with impressive growth prospects that are trading at a discount. GARP investing employs popular value metrics — price-to-earnings (P/E) and price-to-book value (P/B) ratio — to evaluate whether a stock is undervalued.GARP Metrics – Mix of Growth & Value MetricsThe GARP approach helps identify stocks that are priced below the market or any reasonable target determined by fundamental analysis. These stocks also have solid prospects in terms of cash flow, revenues, earnings per share (EPS) and so on.Growth MetricsStrong earnings growth history and impressive prospects are the main concepts that GARP investors borrow from the growth investing strategy. However, instead of super-normal growth rates, picking stocks with a more stable and reasonable growth rate is a preferred tactic of GARP investors. Hence, growth rates between 10% and 20% are considered ideal under the strategy.Another growth metric that is considered by both growth and GARP investors is return on equity (ROE). GARP investors look for strong and higher ROE compared to the industry average to identify superior stocks. Moreover, stocks with positive cash flow find precedence under the GARP plan.Value MetricsGARP investing gives priority to one of the popular value metrics — price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. Though this investing style picks stocks with higher P/E ratios compared to value investors, it avoids companies with extremely high P/E ratios. Moreover, the price-to-book value (P/B) ratio is another value metric that is considered.Using the GARP principle, we have run a screen to identify stocks that should offer solid returns in the near term.Screening ParametersAlong with the criteria discussed in the above section, we have considered a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).Last 5-year EPS & projected 3–5 year EPS growth rates between 10% and 20% (Strong EPS growth history and prospects ensure improving business.)ROE (over the past 12 months) greater than the industry average (Higher ROE compared to the industry average indicates superior stocks.)P/E and P/B ratios less than M-industry average (P/E and P/B ratios less than that of the industry indicate that the stocks are undervalued.)These few criteria have narrowed down the universe of over 7,700 stocks to only eight.Here are six of the eight stocks that made it through the screen:Grand Canyon Education, Inc.

In fourth-quarter fiscal 2017, e-commerce sales surged 30% year over year and represented about 10% of Kirkland’s top line.This came on the back of constant focus on enhancing omni-channel business, online product range and fulfilment operations. In the near term, the company is expected to continue expanding its third-party partnerships, improve ‘buy online pick up in store’ capability and refine its fulfillment processes to increase the profitability of the Ship to Home business.Kirkland's also undertakes frequent store openings to support its top-line growth. In this respect, the company resorts to the strategy of opening stores at popular locations, while shuttering smaller underperforming stores. During fiscal 2017, Kirkland’s opened 31 stores while shutting 17. This included five store openings and two closures in the fourth quarter. For fiscal 2018, management intends to open 20-25 new stores and close 10-15 stores.Going ahead, management is committed toward making several experiments to attract more customers — online and in stores. That said, Kirkland’s anticipates net sales in fiscal 2018 to advance 3-5%, owing to increased store count and contributions from e-commerce sales. Also, this guidance is based on comps growth of 1-2%.Higher Costs a Concern Higher promotional spending, stemming from consumers’ accelerated changes in shopping patterns has been weighing on Kirkland’s bottom line, as witnessed during the latter half of the fourth quarter. Apart from this, higher store occupancy costs and outbound freight costs have also been a drag on profitability.These factors led to a surge of 60 basis points (bps) in operating costs during the fourth quarter, while operating margin shrank 190 bps.  Persistence of higher operating expenses is a considerable threat to Kirkland’s profitability in the forthcoming periods. While Kirkland’s initiatives to improve sales are encouraging, it is yet to be seen if such growth plans can counter ongoing hurdles.Looking for More?

1511,BBY,"When value or growth investing fails to fetch sustained profits, one should explore another time-tested winning strategy that simply bets on the frontrunner stocks. Translated, one of the most successful strategies today is to get in on momentum stocks at the right time.At the core, momentum investing is buying high, selling higher. It is based on the idea that once a stock establishes a trend, it is more likely to continue in that direction than move against the drift. Thus, this strategy calls for hitching a ride on an already fast-moving train, without fretting about valuations or growth prospects. But why does the momentum strategy work?There is a simple reason behind this. It works because we are humans!There’s a whole laundry list of behavioral biases that most investors exhibit and these emotional responses and mistakes are the very reason that momentum strategy works. For instance, there are investors who are anxious about booking losses and hence hold on to losing stocks for too long, hopeful of a rebound in the prices. On the other hand, a few investors sell their winners way too early.Furthermore, investors initially tend to under-react to news, events or data releases. However, once things become clear, they tend to go with the flow and overreact, causing dramatic price reactions.These behavioral problems extend trends, and thus open up huge opportunities for momentum players. So basically, it’s a way to profit from the general human tendency to extrapolate current trends into the future.Momentum investing is thus based on that gap in time that exists before the mean reversion occurs, i.e. before prices become rational again.Momentum strategies have been known to be alpha-generative over a long period of time and across markets. So obviously, this strategy is quite tricky to implement, as detecting these trends is no child’s play.Here, we have created a strategy that will help investors get in on these fast movers and make handsome gains. Our screen will help you benefit from both long-term price momentum and a short-term pullback in price, which would reflect some profit-taking in the stock.Screening ParametersPercentage Change Price (52 Weeks) = Top #50: This item selects the top 50 stocks with the best percentage price change over the last 52 weeks. This parameter ensures we get stocks that have appreciated the maximum over the past year.Percentage Change in Price (1 Week) = Bottom #10: From the above 50 stocks, we then choose those that are also among the 10 worst performers over a short one-week period.Zacks Rank #1: No matter whether market conditions are good or bad, stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) have a proven history of outperformance. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Momentum Style Score of B or better: A top Momentum Style Score knocks out a lot of the screening process as it takes into account several factors including volume change and performance relative to its peers. It indicates when the timing is best to grab a stock and take advantage of its momentum with the highest probability of success. Stocks with a Momentum Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 (Buy) handily outperform other stocks.Current Price greater than 5: The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of $5.Market Capitalization = Top #3000: We have chosen stocks that are among the top 3000 in terms of market value to ensure strong liquidity.Average 20-Day Volume greater than 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that these stocks are easily tradable.Here are four of the eight stocks that made it through this screen:Best Buy Co., Inc.

1512,BBY,"Both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq gained more than 1% for the first time in 3 months on Aug 14, while the Dow Jones rose more than 100 points as geopolitical fears ebb. In fact, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq traded above their 50-day moving averages as Wall Street sees less tension over North Korea.The broad stock market rally followed a loss of nearly $1 trillion dollar last week, when President Trump warned Kim Jong-un’s hermit state that it would face “fire and fury” if it threatens the United States, leading to a verbal standoff between Washington and Pyongyang.Corporate America, meanwhile, is having its best earnings season in 13 years with top executives from Dow Chemical Co  and Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report) citing rise in overseas sales, a telltale sign that should help boost gains in the second half of this year. Economists also predict that U.S. economic expansion will last another two years, while global growth chugs along. Thanks to such bullish trends, it will be prudent to invest in some of the top gainers.U.S. – North Korea Standoff CalmsGeopolitical fears seem to have faded after Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and U.S. Secretary of Defense James Mattis said that Washington would continue to pursue diplomatic solutions with North Korea. CIA Director Mike Pompeo and National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster also stated that there was no hint of a war with Pyongyang. Chinese President Xi Jinping urged for a peaceful resolution to the North Korea issue.The soothing comments came after Trump said last week that Pyongyang will face “fire, fury and frankly power the likes of which this world has never seen before.” His harsh words came in after U.S. intelligence analysts said that North Korea has developed a miniaturized nuclear warhead. Following Trump’s comments, North Korea said that it was “examining the operational plan” to strike sensitive areas like the Anderson Air Force base.Best Earnings Season for Corporate America in 13 YearsCorporate profits, in the meantime, are on pace to register the highest number of S&P 500 companies beating sales estimates in 13 years, as per Bank of America Corp (BAC  -  Free Report) equity strategists. They added the earnings beats will also be the highest since 2004.Of the 454 companies in the S&P 500 that have so far reported second-quarter results, earnings for these companies are up 10.8% from the same period last year on 5.8% higher revenues, with 74.3% beating EPS estimates and 68% beating revenue estimates.While Europe has been the source of strength in the first three months of this year, emerging-market sales were the driving force from April through June. A weak dollar benefitted U.S. companies like Kellogg Company (K  -  Free Report), which beat earnings estimates.U.S. Economic Growth Will Last Another 2 Years U.S. economic growth also will last at least another two years, according to 34 of 57 economists polled by Reuters. Among those economists, 13 said it would last more than three years, while 21 said two to three years.U.S. GDP has already crossed the $19 trillion mark, according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. Under Trump, the U.S. economy grew more than $300 billion in just two quarters. Conversely, at the end of the first two quarters under President Obama, U.S. GDP had contracted.A rebound in consumer spending boosted overall economic growth. Consumer outlays grew 2.8% in the second quarter as Americans spent more on healthcare, groceries and clothes. Spending rebounded in the last quarter, buoyed by an uptick in household finances. Disposable income adjusted for inflation saw the best back-to-back quarters this year since the first half of 2015.Signs of Global Growth Boosted StocksStocks were also helped by signs that global growth is persisting along. Japan’ economy expanded at an annualized rate of 4% in the second quarter, its fastest pace of growth since the first quarter of 2015. Private consumption and capital expenditures were cited to be the reasons behind this uptick in economic expansion. This also marked the country’s longest streak of uninterrupted growth in 11 years.While growth was faster than expected in Japan, China’s factory output rose 6.4% in July from a year earlier. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has already revised up growth expectations for China for this year and next. Overall, IMF has kept its growth forecasts for the world economy unchanged for this year and next.                       Top 5 GainersBanking on such positive trends, we have selected five solid stocks from the major indices.

1513,BBY,"Foot Locker, Inc. (FL  -  Free Report) is slated to release first-quarter fiscal 2018 results on May 25. Well the obvious question that comes to mind is whether this retailer of athletic shoes and apparel will be able to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported.In the trailing four quarters, the company missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 5.8%. Nonetheless, the company outpaced the consensus mark by a penny in the last reported quarter, resulting in a positive earnings surprise of 0.8%.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review has increased by a cent in the past seven days and is currently pegged at $1.25.Let’s analyze the factors influencing the company’s performance.Factors at PlayFoot Locker is trying to improve performance through operational and financial initiatives. The company is focusing on development of supply chain, improvement of mobile and web platforms, implementation of new point-of-sale software worldwide, and expansion of data analytics capabilities. Apart from these, the company plans to spend a major portion of the capital on its fleet of stores, including revamping and remodeling of the same. Further, it is exploring off-mall retail formats opportunities and executing shop-in-shop spaces in collaboration with vendors.Despite these endeavors, analysts polled by Zacks expect first-quarter revenue to come in at $1,974 million, down marginally by 1.4% year over year. This follows an increase of 4.6% witnessed in the final quarter of fiscal 2017.Management had earlier guided that comparable-store sales (comps) during the first quarter are likely to decline in line with or more than actually registered in the second half of fiscal 2017. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is 3.6%. Comps had declined 3.7% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017.Foot Locker had previously projected gross margin to decline in the range of 150-175 basis points in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 on account of high promotional activity and deleverage of occupancy expenses. Gross margin had contracted 230, 290, 340 and 100 basis points in the fourth, third, second and first quarter of fiscal 2017, respectively.As a result, the bottom line is likely to decline in the quarter. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.25 for the quarter under review shows a sharp decline from earnings of $1.36 per share reported in the year-ago period. The quarterly earnings had declined 8%, 23%, 34% and 2.2% in the fourth, third, second and first quarter of fiscal 2017, respectively.Foot Locker, Inc.

1514,BBY,"Deckers Outdoor Corporation (DECK  -  Free Report) is slated to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 results on May 24. In the trailing four quarters, this Goleta, CA-based footwear and apparel retailer has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 96.4%. In the last reported quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 29.4%.Investors are counting on another beat by Deckers in the to-be-reported quarter. Let’s delve deeper and take a look at the factors that will be influencing the results.Here Are the Deciding FactorsDeckers is targeting profitable markets and remains focused on product innovations as well as store augmentation plan. Also, the company’s focus on expanding brand assortments, bringing more innovative line of products, targeting consumers through marketing and optimizing omni-channel distribution bode well. In keeping with the changing trends, Deckers has made substantial investments to strengthen online presence and opening smaller concept omni-channel outlets.Additionally, the company has undertaken strategic initiatives in an effort to drive long-term growth. Its store-fleet optimization plan focuses on striking the right balance between digital and physical stores. Deckers also expects cost savings of about $150 million backed by improvement in cost of goods sold and SG&A savings, which includes consolidation of retail outlets and process improvement efficiencies. This in turn should help it realize $100-million operating profit improvement by fiscal 2020.Management had earlier guided fourth quarter net sales in the range of $370-$375 million compared with $369.5 million reported in the year-ago period. The company had forecasted earnings in the range of approximately 15-20 cents compared with 11 cents a share delivered in the prior-year quarter.However, industry experts remain concerned about Deckers' over-reliance on the UGG brand. In the event of stagnation or decline of UGG sales growth, the company's overall results will be adversely affected. This is because the percentage of contribution from the company’s other brands are too minimal to offset any slowdown in UGG sales.Deckers Outdoor Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Deckers Outdoor Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Deckers Outdoor Corporation QuoteHow Are Top & Bottom Line Estimates Faring?After registering a bottom-line increase of 21% in the third quarter of fiscal 2018, Deckers is likely to record year-over-year growth of more than 60% in the fourth quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at 18 cents compared with 11 cents reported in the year-ago quarter. We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate has been stable in the last 30 days. Analysts polled by Zacks now project revenues of $377.3 million, up approximately 2% from the year-ago quarter.If all goes well, this will be the fifth straight quarter that the company will surpass the Zacks Consensus Estimate for both the top and bottom lines.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model shows that Deckers is likely to beat estimates this quarter.

1515,BBY,"Best Buy Co., Inc. (BBY  -  Free Report) is slated to report first-quarter fiscal 2019 results on May 24. In the last reported quarter, the company outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 18%. Notably, it has surpassed earnings estimates in the trailing four quarters with an average beat of 19.1%. Let’s see, how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.How Are Top & Bottom-Line Estimates Faring?After registering a bottom-line increase of 18.1% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, Best Buy is likely to record year-over-year growth of 25% in first-quarter fiscal 2019. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at 75 cents compared with 60 cents reported in the year-ago quarter. We note that the company’s Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased by a penny in the last 30 days. Analysts now project $8.77 billion revenues, up from $8.53 billion in the year-ago quarter.If the estimates are taken into consideration, this is going to be the second straight quarter of an earnings and revenue beat for the company.Best Buy Co., Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Best Buy Co., Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Best Buy Co., Inc. Quote Deciding FactorsRobust domestic and international sales are likely to drive the company’s results in the first quarter. Analysts surveyed by Zacks expect domestic revenues of $8,091 million, up 2.7% year over year while international revenues are also anticipated to increase nearly 3.6% to $638 million.Best Buy is making extensive investments to upgrade operations with special focus on developing omni-channel capabilities and strengthening partnership with vendors. In recent quarters, the company reported a massive gain in domestic comparable online sales on the back of conversion rates and higher average order values.Following the successful completion of “Renew Blue” program, the company launched a fresh strategy called “Best Buy 2020: Building the New Blue” to explore and pursue growth opportunities, cost optimization and investing in people as well as systems to drive growth. In addition, management earlier projected first-quarter fiscal 2019 Enterprise revenues of $8.65-$8.75 billion and comparable sales increase of 1.5-2.5%. Management also anticipated adjusted earnings of 68-73 cents a share.In the fiscal first quarter, the company expects domestic comparable sales to rise 1.5-2.5% while international comparable sales are estimated flat to up 3%.However, analysts believe that an increase in investment to boost e-commerce operations and supply chains to counter competition might strain margins. Moreover, challenging retail landscape and waning store traffic may weigh on the company’s performance.We also note that SG&A expenses have increased 18.6%, 2.2% and 3.2% in the fourth, third and second quarter of fiscal 2018, respectively.Additionally, management hinted earlier that higher investments in supply chain and increased transportation costs are likely to weigh upon gross profit of the Domestic business by approximately 25 basis points in each quarter.What the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model shows that Best Buy is likely to beat estimates this quarter as the stock has the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — for this to happen.Best Buy has an Earnings ESP of +2.01%, which, when combined with the company’s Zacks Rank #2, increases the chances of an earnings beat.Other Stocks Poised to Beat Earnings EstimatesHere are some other companies that you may want to consider as our model shows that these too have the right combination of elements to post earnings beat.Deckers Outdoor Corporation (DECK  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +23.37% and a Zacks Rank #3.

That is because the May 25, 2018 $76.00 Put had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Best Buy shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Best Buy is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) in the Retail - Consumer Electronics industry that ranks in the Bottom 23% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, one analyst has increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while none have dropped their estimates. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from 74 cents per share to 75 cents in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Best Buy right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options? Each week, our very own Dave Bartosiak gives his top options trades.

1517,BBY,"Earnings season is finally winding down but it’s not over yet.There are still over 200 companies expected to report earnings this week with many of those being well-known retailers.Has the “brick and mortar is dying” story been put to bed yet? Several of this week’s retailers are skilled at selling products both online and in the stores.And one even has a brand that sells 100% of its products ONLY in stores. It doesn’t even have an online business. Yet that retailer has been crushing it.Online sales still remain a relatively small percentage of total retail sales. The myth of all retailers being Amazoned is just that: a myth.These five retailers have solid track records of beating the consensus.Which of these retailers will surprise again this quarter?This Week’s 5 Must-See Retail Earnings Charts1.    The TJX Companies (TJX  -  Free Report) has missed just 2 times in the past 5 years and that was all the way back in 2014. Shares are trading near 5-year highs for this retailer which sports the Marshall’s, TJ Maxx and Home Goods brands. Will it maintain its 2018 momentum?2.    Ralph Lauren (RL  -  Free Report) sank to new multi-year lows in 2017 but with apparel turning around, the shares have too. It’s well off those 2017 lows but is all the good news already priced in?3.    Williams-Sonoma (WSM  -  Free Report) has missed only one time in the last 5 years but the shares are stuck. The owner of West Elm and Pottery Barn is expected to see double digit earnings growth in fiscal 2018 but investors aren’t buying it as the shares have stagnated. Will the launch of West Elm Kids help move the needle?4.    Best Buy (BBY  -  Free Report) was left for dead several years ago as Wall Street was certain it was going to be Amazoned. It wasn’t. Shares are trying to break out to new 5-year highs. Will this quarter’s report give them the boost they need?5.    Ross Stores (ROST  -  Free Report) has survived the apparel retail angst well as shares hit new 5-year highs in 2018.

1518,BBY,"U.S. retail sales fell for the second straight month in June, reflecting a scenario where consumers are reining in their spending. This casts a doubt over the expected rebound in the economy during the second half of 2017. The dismal sales report overshadowed steady job additions and gradual wage acceleration. Fed officials definitely have their eyes on the latest developments in the economy and the recent event may influence their future action plan. For now, soft retail sales may compel investors to revisit their portfolio.The Commerce Department stated that U.S. retail and food services sales in June declined 0.2% to $473.5 billion – following a revised reading of 0.1% decrease registered in May – as people curtailed their spending on clothes and spent less at gasoline stations, department stores and restaurants. However, retail sales increased 2.8% from Jun 2016.The report states that sales at clothing & clothing accessories stores declined 0.1%, while receipts at gasoline stations fell 1.3%. Sales at food & beverage stores dropped 0.4%. Department store sales decreased 0.7% and were down 3.9% from the prior-year period. Sales at non-store retailers, however, inched up 0.4% in June and increased 9.2% from the prior-year period.The abovementioned data strongly suggests that consumer spending, which plays a pivotal role in driving the economy, lost momentum. The Fed, which raised the benchmark interest rate in June for the second time in 2017, will certainly consider the retail sales report while contemplating an interest rate hike.Current Retail LandscapeThe Retail-Wholesale sector, which is at the bottom 6% of the Zacks Sector Rank (15 out of 16), has been undergoing a fundamental change. With a digital transformation in shopping and consumers splurging online, store and mall traffic has been hit hard. As a result, most retailers, including big-box, are struggling to compete with e-commerce channels and are being forced to trim their store count to focus more on an online model.Nevertheless, the sector still holds some promise, given the favorable economic indicators. We note that so far in the year, the sector has registered an increase of 15.1% compared with the S&P 500 that has risen roughly 10%. The rebound in oil prices from all-time lows, decelerating unemployment rate, and a gradual improvement in the housing market signal that the economy is on a recovery mode. These factors are playing a crucial role in raising consumers’ confidence that rose to 118.9 in June from May’s reading of 117.6.Strategies to Counter the ChallengesThe multiple challenges in the sector, as mentioned above, have compelled retailers to reconsider their strategies. They are now focusing more on enhancing their omni-channel capabilities, optimizing store fleet and restructuring activities.Retailers are efficiently allocating a large chunk of their capital toward a multi-channel growth strategy focused on improving merchandise offerings, developing IT infrastructure to enhance the web and mobile experience of customers, renovating stores, developing fulfillment centers to enable speedy delivery, implementing an enterprise-wide inventory management system as well as enhancing their relationship with existing and new customers.The Children's Place, Inc. (PLCE  -  Free Report), Best Buy Co., Inc. (BBY  -  Free Report), Dollar Tree, Inc. (DLTR  -  Free Report), Staples, Inc. , Macy's, Inc. (M  -  Free Report) and other renowned retailers are trying all means to reach their target customers.Zacks RankAmong the aforementioned stocks, The Children's Place and Best Buy sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), while the remaining stocks carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1519,BBY,"Shares of Kohl’s Corporation (KSS  -  Free Report) moved up 4.7%, following the news of a partnership with e-Commerce giant Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report). Per the deal, both the companies will provide a new Amazon smart home experience for customers in 10 selected stores in Los Angeles and Chicago. The “store-in-store” concept will initiate in October. Customers will now be able to purchase Amazon devices, accessories and smart home devices like the Amazon Echo smart speaker and the Fire tablet directly from Amazon smart home spaces in Kohl’s stores.Like Kohl’s, retailers such as Best Buy Co. Inc. (BBY  -  Free Report) and Sears Holdings Corporation  have also teamed up with the online giant. Best Buy is creating in-store Amazon concepts, while Sears plans to sell Kenmore appliances on Amazon.com. Apart from Amazon, the company has also teamed up with Apple Inc. last year to develop small shops within its stores.Kohl's Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Kohl's Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Kohl's Corporation QuoteBenefits of This PartnershipWe note that Kohl’s has been grappling with numerous headwinds since the past many quarters due to difficult sales environment and cautious consumer spending. Evolving spending patterns of consumers are also hurting sales. Demand for clothes and accessories like watches and handbags have declined as consumers prefer to spend more on home renovations and cars. This has affected the store traffic significantly. In fact, in 2016, the company closed 19 underperforming stores due to tough retail conditions and heightened competition from discount retailers as well as other brick-and-mortar stores.Kohl’s comps have also been declining over the last six quarters due to industry wide headwinds. The company began its turnaround initiative named “Greatness Agenda” in the first quarter of 2014 to increase transactions per store and sales. However, it did not bear fruits. Nevertheless, it has helped the company to deliver positive comps in all the four quarters of fiscal 2015. However, the quarterly growth rates moderated gradually which remained a concern. Moreover, comps have declined consecutively in the last six quarters, including the recently reported the second quarter of fiscal 2017. This is raising concerns over the near term.The partnership therefore seems to be beneficial for both companies. Kohl’s believes its stores traffic will increase, thanks to the availability of Amazon’s varied electronics options. Amazon, on the other hand, will save huge set-up costs and will get more visibility through Kohl’s stores.Other Initiatives to Revive SalesThe company has been undertaking a number of initiatives to attract more shoppers to stores and improve sales. Lately, the company has started offering more outside famous brands and cutting down on the number of in-house clothing brands. The addition of Under Armour workout tights, sneakers and other gear in March was a great success and was very well-accepted among customers.The company is also focusing on sales growth with both Nike and Adidas. Kohl's plans to start selling Clarks shoes for the back-to-school shopping season and is looking for other brands to add to store aisles. The company has gained significant market share in active apparel and footwear in the first half of the year and expects the trend to continue in the back half, based on assortment improvements.During the second quarter of fiscal 2017, the company witnessed improvement in sales trend compared to the prior quarter, driven by the impact of the speed initiative in the supply chain and continued focus on three largest private-label brands such as SONOMA, Croft & Barrow and Apartment 9. Two of its largest exclusive brands, Simply Vera Vera Wang and Lauren Conrad, posted double-digit sales increases in the quarter. The company plans to continue selling the best-selling of its private-label brands, such as Sonoma, Croft & Barrow and Apt. 9, in order to drive traffic.We believe these efforts are well reflected in the share prices of the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 (Strong Buy) Rank stocks here.Notably, in the last three months, the stock has moved up nearly 20% in comparison to the industry and the broader Retail and Wholesale sector. While the industry improved 8.7% in the last three months, the sector declined 0.1% in the said time frame.One Simple Trading IdeaSince 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year. With compounding, rebalancing, and exclusive of fees, it can turn thousands into millions of dollars.This proven stock-picking system is grounded on a single big idea that can be fortune shaping and life changing.

1522,BBY,"Retail sector is hogging all the attention, and this time for good reasons. For the time being, the expression ""retail apocalypse” appears to be a thing of past. The sector has certainly been facing the brunt of heightened online competition, lower footfall and changing consumer spending patterns but of late the tables are turning in favor of the retailers. Stocks once bogged down by tough environment are now suddenly climbing the charts.The first and foremost reason for the same is the latest tax reform that is likely to come into shape, following the approval of the Senate. The tax code once implemented is likely to lower the burden of retailers, who now topped the list with a corporate tax rate of as much as 35%. President Trump has been recommending a tax rate of as much as 20% and pushing hard to pass on the benefits to companies who generate all or most part of revenues in the United States.The news was enough to drive the retail stocks. As a result, shares of Macy’s (M  -  Free Report), Gap (GPS  -  Free Report), Target (TGT  -  Free Report), Kohl's (KSS  -  Free Report) and Best Buy (BBY  -  Free Report) gained 6.7%, 6.6%, 5.1%, 4.4% and 3.7%, respectively, yesterday.Certainly, the “Trump Factor” is ruling the U.S. stock market but it is also the attractive holiday season deals that are exciting consumers. The five-day holiday period starting from Thanksgiving, followed by Black Friday, Small Business Saturday to Cyber Monday, marked an auspicious start to the holiday-shopping season. Retailers are cashing in on customers preferring to shop from the comfort of their homes, mostly online or through their mobile phones.A Stellar Start to the SeasonOnline sales on Thanksgiving Day surged 18.3% to $2.87 billion, per Adobe Analytics. Bargain hunters bought $5.03 billion worth of products online on Black Friday, an increase of 16.9% from last year. The euphoria did not end here, as the shopping frenzy was palpable on Cyber Monday when online sales soared 16.8% to $6.59 billion.A blockbuster Thanksgiving weekend and buoyant Cyber Monday indicate that the season is turning out to be a bonanza for retailers. Per National Retail Federation (“NRF”), approximately 174 million customers shopped in stores and online during this weekend. The trade group estimates that an American spent about an average of $335.47 during the five-day period.Further, shopping through mobile devices was the most prominent trend that developed during this year’s Black Friday and Cyber Monday shopping period, as nearly 63% of customers used their smart phones to make buying decisions, while 29% used it to actually buy goods.This indeed points to a blissful shopping season for retailers. With Christmas falling on Monday and 32 days after Thanksgiving, shoppers are getting one extra day compared with last year and an extended weekend to do last minute purchasing.Wrapping UpImproving labor market, rising disposable income and elevated consumer sentiment have ushered confidence in retailers about a robust holiday season. From Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) to Wal-Mart (WMT  -  Free Report) retailers are gearing up for the busiest part of the year. With digital transformation in shopping they are fast adopting the omni-channel mantra to provide a seamless shopping experience, whether online or in-stores.Overall, NRF projects a 3.6-4% rise in November and December sales (excluding autos, gas and restaurant sales) to $678.75-$682 billion, up from $655.8 billion last year and better than the five-year average sales growth of 3.5%. Data compiled by eMarketer forecasts 3.1% jump in holiday sales (November and December) to $923.15 billion, while retail e-commerce holiday season sales are anticipated to rise 16.6%.As you can see, there are plenty of reasons to be optimistic about the retail sector but what about investing in the space right now? Out of the stocks mentioned above, Wal-Mart carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), while Amazon, Target, Macy’s, Best Buy, Kohl's and Gap carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1523,BBY,"The onset of the holiday season this year seems to have ushered confidence in retailers, who had been reeling under a tough environment characterized by increased competition from online retailers like Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report) and lower footfall.  The five-day holiday period starting from Thanksgiving, followed by Black Friday, Small Business Saturday, Monikerless Sunday and Cyber Monday, marked a good start to a promising holiday season.The spending data from Thanksgiving through Cyber Monday indicates that the U.S. retail industry is ready to shed all worries and embrace a profitable holiday season this year. Data from the nation’s largest retail trade group, National Retail Federation (“NRF”) revealed that more than 174 million Americans shopped in-stores and online during the Thanksgiving holiday weekend, leaving behind its estimate to engage 164 million shoppers.Further, the trade group estimates that Americans spent an average of about $335.47 during the five-day period, with about $250.78 or 75% spent for buying gifts. Among the shoppers, older Millennials aged between 25 and 34 years turned out to be the biggest spenders this year, spending nearly $419.52 on an average.Omni-Channel Retail Is InApart from improving optimism for the holiday season, the five-day shopping fest clearly reflected that omni-channel has become the order of the day and retailers’ investments toward providing a seamless shopping experience, whether online or in-stores, has paid off big time. The long weekend attracted more than 64 million shoppers to make purchases both online and in-stores. Additionally, there were shoppers who chose to buy only at stores or only online. Notably, the weekend saw more than 58 million people shop only online, while over 51 million people chose to shop only in stores.NRF revealed that the omni-channel shoppers spent $82 more on average compared with the people shopping only online. Furthermore, average spending of these shoppers was $49 more than people shopping only in stores.Top Shopping Days – In Store & OnlineThe two top days for in-store shopping this year were Black Friday and Small Business Saturday, when 77 million and 55 million shoppers, respectively, stepped out of their homes to take advantage of the big deals.Meanwhile, online shopping was most popular on Cyber Monday with more than 81 million shoppers using their computers, smart phones and tablets to shop. This popular online shopping day raked in online sales of a record $6.59 million, as per Adobe Analytics. Reflecting a $1 billion (or 16.8%) growth from last year, this day marked the largest online shopping day in U.S. history.Another popular online shopping day, as surveyed by NRF, was Black Friday with more than 66 million shoppers turning to online deals on this day.Further, shopping through mobile devices was the most prominent trend during this year’s Black Friday and Cyber Monday shopping period, as nearly 63% of customers used their smart phones to make buying decisions while 29% used it to actually buy goods.The BeneficiariesNotably, the long weekend had all favorable factors from a pleasant weather to low unemployment rate and improved consumer confidence that encouraged shoppers get going with their shopping lists, in preparation for Christmas. The most popular items on sale during the weekend were televisions, laptops, toys and gaming consoles. Driven by the huge discounts and promotions, retailers witnessed a splurge in traffic and online conversion trends, which is likely to make up for an otherwise tough year.Further, this five-day shopping fest saw trends reverse for some retailers, particularly department stores, which bore the brunt of a tough retailing environment. Notably, department stores were at the top of this season’s top shopping destinations attracting 43% shoppers. This was followed by online retailers (42%), electronic stores (32%), clothing and accessories stores (31%) and discount stores (31%).The Black Friday event witnessed some big sales coming from Best Buy (BBY  -  Free Report), which aired many lucrative offers shoppers couldn’t resist. Much of this is also attributed to the fact that shoppers have lately realized the importance of in-store purchases for large items for their homes. We believe this trend is surely going to benefit Best Buy this holiday season and into 2018.Another stock that is ready to make it big this holiday season, knocking down competition from online giant — Amazon, is Wal-Mart (WMT  -  Free Report). Apart from offering car loading services for groceries, Wal-Mart is pushing hard to compete with Amazon on price and service grounds.The success of Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales not only set the cash registers ringing, it also led the retail stocks trade higher. This was particularly true for Macy’s (M  -  Free Report), Target (TGT  -  Free Report), Best Buy and Home Depot (HD  -  Free Report), that witnessed 4.5%, 1.4%, 1.8% and 1.4%, respectively, after a blockbuster Cyber Monday on Nov 27.This gives all the reasons to be optimistic about the performance of retailers this holiday season. At this juncture, it would be wise to invest in stocks that promise returns this season. Out of the stocks mentioned above, Wal-Mart and Home Depot carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), while Amazon, Target, Macy’s and Best Buy carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Holiday Sales ProjectionOverall, NRF projects retail sales for November and December (excluding autos, gas and restaurant sales) to improve 3.6-4% to $678.75-$682 billion, up from $655.8 billion (or 3.6% growth) last year and better than the five-year average sales growth of 3.5%.Moreover, Deloitte projects holiday season sales to go up as much as 4.5%, while e-commerce sales are envisioned to improve 18-21%.Bottom LineThe start to the 2017 holiday season certainly looks promising.

Did it keep up the momentum in the last holiday quarter?3.    L Brands (LB  -  Free Report) has struggled as its premier brand, Pink, has slowly gotten off trend. The company was also hurt more than expected from its decision to stop selling swimwear. Shares have rebounded off the lows.

Shares are trading near a 5-year high despite reporting a rare earnings miss last quarter.5.    J.C. Penney (JCP  -  Free Report) has been left for dead as investors still aren’t convinced it can make it. It has only missed twice since 2015, however, so it has a solid earnings surprise track record.

1526,BBY,"Foot Locker, Inc. (FL  -  Free Report) is slated to release third-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Nov 17. Well the obvious question that comes to mind is will this retailer of athletic shoes and apparel will be able to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported.In the trailing four quarters, the company missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 6.6%. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.What to Expect?The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third quarter has been stable in the past 30 days and is currently pegged at 80 cents. This shows a sharp decline from earnings of $1.13 per share reported in the year-ago period. Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $1,844 million, down from $1,886 million generated in the prior-year quarter.Factors at PlayChallenging retail landscape and changing consumer spending pattern have resulted in a tough operating environment for Foot Locker. In fact, the company’s dismal top line and comparable-store sales performance concerns investors. Following meagre growth of 0.7% in the first quarter of fiscal 2017, total sales declined 4.4% in the second quarter. Meanwhile, comparable-store sales fell 6% in the second quarter, following an increase of 0.5% in the preceding quarter.Management envisions adjusted earnings per share decline of 20-30% (excluding a benefit of 12 cents from 53rd week) for the second half of 2017. In the second quarter of fiscal 2017, earnings plunged 34% year over year. Foot Locker had projected gross margin contraction in the range of 230-250 basis points (bps) for the third quarter. Gross margin contracted 340 basis points in the second quarter, after shrinking 100 bps in the first.Nevertheless, we believe that building robust capabilities in direct-to-customer unit, augmenting e-commerce platform, rationalizing store fleet and improving supply chain infrastructure may provide cushion to the stock. Continuous exploitation of opportunities such as shop-in-shop expansion, store banner.com business, store refurbishment and enhancement of assortments also bode well. International expansion, especially in Europe, is another growth catalyst.Foot Locker, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Foot Locker, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Foot Locker, Inc. QuoteWhat the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Foot Locker is likely to beat earnings this quarter.

1527,BBY,"Here are the top Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) stories from last week-Amazon Prime's 100 Million SubscribersIn his annual shareholder letter, company founder Jeff Bezos revealed that Amazon now has 100 million subscribers – that’s actual paying customers, not people who are trying out the service. Although Prime itself doesn’t cost the same for everyone: students get concessions while monthly subscribers end up paying more than the annual charge of $99.The number doesn’t come as a huge surprise, since Consumer Intelligence Research estimated last year that as of September 30, Amazon had 90 million Prime members in the U.S. alone. And that these members were spending an average $1,300 a year, roughly double the $700 spent by other customers.But Prime is having the same effect in international markets as well. As a Morningstar analyst says, ""What we’re seeing in Europe and other markets is similar to what we saw in the US between 2010 and 2014. People see value in Prime memberships in terms of shipping speed and content. It’s important to investors because membership retention rates are north of 90%.""In India, Amazon signed on more Prime subscribers in its first year than any other previous geography in company history on the basis of 40 million local products. Amazon sold 5 billion items globally through Prime in 2017.Amazon’s Prime membership is a solid growth tool. It’s a perennial loyalty program rolled into the shopping experience that gets better the more you shop. Bezos had earlier said that you’re going to feel irresponsible for not using Prime, indicating that he was going to stuff many things into it, which is exactly what he has done. So today, you not only get to shop what you want, but also gain access to things like Prime videos, songs and e-books.So Prime is a leading digital subscription and compares well with others in the space including Netflix, which has 125 million subscribers, HBO 142 million, Spotify 71 million users, Hulu 17 million and Tinder 3 million.Amazon Has Deal with Best Buy   Amazon and Best Buy (BBY  -  Free Report) have signed a deal that will improve distribution for both.According to the terms, Best Buy will showcase and sell 10-11 high-definition and 4K TVs made by Toshiba and Best Buy’s house brand Insignia running Amazon’s Fire TV operating system in its 1000+ stores. The Fire TVs as they will be called will offer programming from cable networks as well as streaming services like Amazon's Prime Video, Netflix, HBO, PlayStation Vue and Hulu. The partnership ends Best Buy’s agreement with Roku, which used to live inside the Insignia TVs before this deal.  For Amazon, the physical presence was necessary because TVs are the kind of things people want to see and interact with before buying. All the better that the TVs can be paired with Amazon smart speakers and that the remotes have Alexa integration, because this puts Amazon in the center of your living room.For Best Buy, which gets preferred supplier status on Amazon, it means access to the platform’s huge user base. It will also lead to higher traffic in-store and customers coming in to buy a TV may end up buying other things as well (including iPhones, Android phones and other products that compete with Amazon’s).International Shopping ExperienceWith this feature, people living outside the U.S. gain access to 45 million items that will be shipped to them from the U.S. The feature is available in 5 languages including English, Spanish, Simplified Chinese, German and Brazilian Portuguese, on both mobile browser and mobile app within the Amazon Shopping App for iOS and Android mobile devices. It allows you to shop in 25 currencies.Amazon Government ContractWhile the Pentagon has denied it, Amazon does appear to be the front runner to receive a $10 billion contract to provide cloud services to the government’s Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure (JEDI) project. That’s because its cloud services have been certified for the highest possible security level and Amazon is already doing work for the government, including the hosting of top-secret data from the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and government contractors like Boeing (BA  -  Free Report). Last week, the Pentagon released the second draft request for proposal, with the final proposal expected next month.  Amazon Will Stream U.S. Open TennisAmazon has confirmed a five-year deal with the United States Tennis Association (USTA) to stream the games to viewers in the UK and Ireland starting this year. Amazon forked out $40 million (£30 million) to buy the rights for Prime video. Discovery-owned Eurosport, which previously also owned the UK and Ireland rights, bought the rights to stream the games to the rest of Europe for another five years.  Amazon has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), as does other players in the space including IAC/Interactive Corp. (IAC  -  Free Report) and Stamps.com (STMP  -  Free Report). Internet commerce peers Petmed Express (PETS  -  Free Report) and Secoo Holding Ltd. (SECO  -  Free Report) are Zacks #2 (Buy) ranked stocks that are therefore also worth buying.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks hereToday's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

1528,BBY,"Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) recently clinched a partnership deal with the electronic retailer, Best Buy (BBY  -  Free Report) to expand its product offering by introducing voice automated smart TVs.The idea behind the partnership is to integrate Amazon’s Fire TV with the smart TVs manufactured by Toshiba and Best Buy’s Insignia.Fire TV offers streaming and subscription services for the web series and movies from Netflix, Prime Video, HBO, PlayStation Vue, Hulu and many more. Additionally, it is equipped with the voice assistant, Alexa, which enables customers to search TV shows, play music, switch inputs and control smart home devices through voice command.Fire TV is compatible with Amazon’s smart speaker, Echo. Hence, we believe the customer base of the company will increase with the latest move of combining smart TVs with Fire TV. This will in turn, drive the top-line growth.Notably, the shares of Amazon have returned 69.4% over a year, outperforming the industry’s rally of 38.4%. AvailabilityBest Buy has decided to launch more than 10 4K and HD Fire TV Edition smart TVs during this summer. TVs will be available offline at Best Buy stores and online on the websites of both retailers.Customers in the United States will able to buy new TVs starting this summer whereas in Canada, it will be available from the second half of the year.Rising CompetitionAmazon has strengthened its competitive position in the smart TV market against Roku (ROKU  -  Free Report), a developer of various streaming players that enable customers to watch online streaming videos and movies on their TVs.Shares of Roku plunged massively by 11.8% on Wednesday after the deal got announced. Additionally, Best Buy will no longer use Roku's operating system in Insignia TVs.Notably, Best Buy has been posing stiff competition to Amazon for quite some time. The latest partnership lends Amazon an edge keeping the competition intact.Strengthening Physical PresenceAmazon’s efforts on boosting its physical presence in the retail space is providing it with a competitive edge against the local stores who are already reeling under competitive pressure related to price and delivery from the company due to its online presence.The latest move will provide a brick and mortar showroom to Amazon, which will help in providing a better hands-on experience to customers for its latest smart TV. This is likely to bring in more customers and will help in gaining momentum in the market.Recently, the company strengthened its physical presence by opening its third bookstore in the Bay Area. Amazon began opening book stores in late 2015, the first one being in Seattle. The company has now 15 offline stores, while three are in work-in-progress status.With the Whole Foods acquisition, the company started establishing its presence in the grocery market.Amazon.com, Inc.

1529,BBY,"On Wednesday, shares of department store Kohl’s Corp. (KSS  -  Free Report) are rallying, up about 4.7% in afternoon trading after the company announced a new partnership with e-commerce giant Amazon.com (AMZN  -  Free Report).Kohl’s will open 1,000-square feet Amazon areas in 10 of its stores, offering popular devices like the Amazon Echo smart speaker and the Fire tablet. Called the Amazon Smart Home Experience, the new “store-in-store” concept will start appearing in Kohl’s locations in the Los Angeles and Chicago areas next month.Kohl’s joins fellow retailers Best Buy (BBY  -  Free Report) and Sears  who have chosen to collaborate with the online behemoth, in addition to tech company Microsoft Corp. (MSFT  -  Free Report). Best Buy is similarly creating in-store Amazon concepts, and Sears recently said it will sell Kenmore appliances on Amazon.com. Meanwhile, Microsoft’s Cortana and Amazon’s Alexa are collaborating in a new voice assistant alliance.“We are thrilled to offer a unique new way for customers to try out our lineup of Alexa-enabled Amazon devices, learn more about our smart home services from Amazon experts and then buy those items directly from Amazon — all within Kohl’s stores,” said Dave Zimmer, vice president of sales and marketing for Amazon Devices, in a statement.While this is clearly a smart move on Kohl’s part, especially if this turns into a broader rollout to the company’s roughly 1,160 stores, but it also benefits Amazon. Amazon has been opening a number of its own brick-and-mortar stores, mainly bookstores, but this partnership is way to sidestep those huge building costs; the company also completed its acquisition of Whole Foods last week, another retail space in which Amazon can sell its Echo devices.Amazon isn’t the first tech company Kohl’s has struck a deal with. Last year, it teamed with Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) to create small shops within its stores. Kohl’s has suffered through six straight quarters of sales declines, but its focus on electronics—and surprisingly, activewear; earlier this year, the company began selling Under Armour (UAA  -  Free Report) product)—has helped the retailer stand out.Kohl’s sits at a #3 (Hold) on the Zacks Rank, and has lost almost 19% year-to-date.4 Surprising Tech Stocks to Keep an Eye On Tech stocks have been a major force behind the market’s record highs, but picking the best ones to buy can be tough. There’s a simple way to invest in the success of the entire sector.

1530,BBY,"Lowe's Companies, Inc. (LOW  -  Free Report) seems to be gaining from its strategic acquisitions, solid focus on Pro-Customers and robust shareholder-friendly moves. Additionally, a decent job scenario, buoyant consumer confidence, gradual recovery in the housing market and merchandising initiatives are driving the stock further. Analysts believe that the latest tax reform as well as blissful holiday season may also benefit the stock.Impressively, shares of Lowe's have hit a 52-week high of $89.33 on Dec 19, though it closed a tad lower at $88.86. In fact, in the past one month, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has gained 10.2%, outperforming the Zacks Building Products - Retail industry’s growth of 8.2% that ranks in the top 29% of the Zacks categorized industries (74 out of 256). Also, we are encouraged by the company’s VGM Score of A and long-term earnings growth rate of 14.7%.Lowe's Canadian business has been performing quite well. The buyout of RONA is likely to further augment its position in the Canadian market. Lowe's Canada entered into a strategic partnership with Solar Brokers Canada to provide solar energy installation services to homeowners under Lowe's Solar banner. Also, the company is streamlining its store portfolio, which along with its strategy of enhancing customer shopping experience and merchandising transformation is likely to generate incremental sales.In fact, Lowe’s solid focus toward increasing pro-customers base cannot be ignored. In an effort to strengthen its relationship with pro customers, management has concluded the acquisition of Maintenance Supply Headquarters — the distributor of maintenance, repair and operations products. This buyout will help in adding multi-family property management customers.Of late, Lowe’s has also been focusing on maintenance, repair and operations products, which is evident from its acquisition of Maintenance Supply Headquarters and the earlier buyout of Central Wholesalers. Furthermore, Lowe’s, which competes with The Home Depot, Inc. (HD  -  Free Report), is also poised to gain from the acquisitions of Orchard Supply Hardware Stores and ATG Stores.Other Retail stocks that have hit 52-week high yesterday are Best Buy Co., Inc.

1531,BBY,"After the news of an uptick in the U.S. consumer confidence to a 17-year high and the latest tax reform that is likely to lower the burden, retailers got another reason to smile as retail sales increased for the third straight month. The better-than-expected November retail sales added extra jingle to the holiday season that is approaching its crescendo with Christmas just a week away.A solid start to the shopping season highlights the underlying economic strength that paved the way for a rate hike for the third time this year. Analysts believe that a buoyant stock market, gradual wage acceleration, improved employment picture and modest inflation are enough to trigger consumer spending. All these sound favorable for retailers, who try to make the most of the season that accounts for a sizeable chunk of yearly revenues and profits.Sturdy Retail SalesThe Commerce Department stated that U.S. retail and food services sales in November advanced 0.8% to $492.7 billion — following a revised reading of 0.5% increase registered in October. Retail sales improved 5.8% from November 2016. The report suggests that sales at electronics & appliance stores rose 2.1%, while receipts at gasoline stations and sales at building material dealers jumped 2.8% and 1.2%, respectively.Sales at motor vehicles and parts dealers dipped 0.2%, while at clothing shops the same rose 0.7%. Meanwhile, sales at food & beverage stores and receipts at restaurants witnessed growth of 0.2% and 0.7%, respectively. Sales at non-store retailers climbed 2.5% and increased 10.4% from the prior-year period.Holiday Season: Likely Bonanza for RetailersHealthy November retail sales only raises hope for a blissful holiday season. A blockbuster Thanksgiving weekend and buoyant Cyber Monday also echo the festive spirit. Be it early-hour store openings, huge discounts, promotional strategies, price matching and free shipping on online purchases, retailers are going that extra mile.Online sales on Thanksgiving Day surged 18.3% to $2.87 billion, per Adobe Analytics. Bargain hunters bought $5.03 billion worth of products online on Black Friday, an increase of 16.9% from last year. The euphoria did not end here, as the shopping frenzy was palpable on Cyber Monday when online sales soared 16.8% to $6.59 billion.Per National Retail Federation (“NRF”) an American spent about an average of $335.47 during the five-day period. Further, shopping through mobile devices was the most prominent trend which developed during this year’s Black Friday and Cyber Monday shopping period, as nearly 63% of customers used their smart phones to make buying decisions, while 29% used it to actually buy goods.Overall, NRF projects a 3.6-4% rise in November and December sales (excluding autos, gas and restaurant sales) to $678.75-$682 billion, up from $655.8 billion last year and better than the five-year average sales growth of 3.5%. Data compiled by eMarketer forecasts 3.1% jump in holiday sales (November and December) to $923.15 billion, while retail e-commerce holiday season sales are anticipated to rise 16.6%.Wrapping UpRetail sector is hogging all the attention, and this time for good reasons. For the time being, the expression ""retail apocalypse” appears to be a thing of past. The sector has certainly been facing the brunt of heightened online competition, lower footfall and changing consumer spending patterns but of late the tables are turning in favor of the retailers.From Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) to Wal-Mart (WMT  -  Free Report), Target (TGT  -  Free Report) to Macy’s (M  -  Free Report) and Gap (GPS  -  Free Report) to Best Buy (BBY  -  Free Report) retailers are gearing up for the busiest part of the year. With digital transformation in shopping retailers are fast adopting the omni-channel mantra. The Retail-Wholesale sector has gained roughly 30% so far in the year, outperforming the S&P 500 index, which advanced 20.7%.As you can see, there are plenty of reasons to be optimistic about the retail sector but what about investing in the space right now?

1532,BBY,"With the objective of capitalizing on the booming online shopping, Target Corporation (TGT  -  Free Report) has announced its intention to buy Shipt, Inc., a same-day delivery platform. The value of the deal, which is pegged at $550 million, is likely to be concluded by the end of this calendar year. Following, the news the company’s shares gained nearly 3% yesterday.With the help of this acquisition, Target will start providing same-day delivery services from nearly half of its stores by early 2018 and the services will be available from most of the stores in major markets by the beginning of 2018 holiday season. Initially, the company will provide same-day delivery services of groceries, essentials, home, electronics as well as other products before expanding it to all major products by the end of 2019.The retail landscape has been undergoing a fundamental change. With digital transformation in shopping and consumers splurging online, store and mall traffic has been hit hard. As a result, most retailers, including big-box, are struggling to compete with e-commerce channels and are being forced to trim store count to focus more on an online model. We believe, the company’s decision to bring same-day delivery services is likely to lure more customers and in turn will drive the top line higher. The acquisition will also aid the company to compete with e-commerce biggie Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report), Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report) and Best Buy Co., Inc. (BBY  -  Free Report).Other InitiativesCurrently, the company has Restock program, which allows customers to restock their shipping box with essential items online and get them delivered at door steps by the next business day for a nominal charge. Further, in order to improve supply chain and expand delivery capabilities, the company had acquired Grand Junction. This transportation technology company provides a platform that allows retailers, distributors and third-party logistics providers to manage local deliveries through a network of over 700 carriers.In October, the company had launched curbside pickup program, at 50 Twin Cities stores. This program gives customers an option to get ordered items without leaving the comfort of their cars. To avail the service the customers need to place orders via the latest version of Target’s app and then select “Drive Up”. Target will inform the customers when the order is ready for delivery. Once the shopper arrives to the chosen parking spot outside the Target store, an employee will bring the order to the vehicle.The company’s initiatives such as the development of omni-channel capacities, diversification and localization of assortments along with emphasis on flexible format stores bode well for the stock. The shares of Target have outpaced the industry in a month. The stock has advanced 15.7%, outperforming the industry’s growth of 12%.Target currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put Best Buy Co., Inc. (BBY  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Best Buy has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 18.05, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 stands at about 21.26. If we focus on the long-term PE trend, Best Buy’s current PE level puts it above its midpoint over the past five years, with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months.Further, the stock’s PE compares favorably with the Zacks Retail - Wholesale sector’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 30.45. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that Best Buy has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 15.7, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for Best Buy stock in the near term too.P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, Best Buy has a P/S ratio of about 0.55. This is significantly lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.48 right now. This makes the stock undervalued from the P/S aspect too.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Best Buy currently has a Value Score of A, putting it into the top 20% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes Best Buy a solid choice for value investors.What About the Stock Overall?Though Best Buy might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of A and a Momentum Score of B. This gives BBY a Zacks VGM score — or its overarching fundamental grade — of A. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been quite encouraging. The current quarter and full year have seen three upward estimate revisions each in the past sixty days compared to two no downward revisions.This has had a positive impact on the consensus estimate, as the current quarter consensus estimate has risen by nearly 2% in the past two months, while the full year estimate has inched higher by 0.7%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:Best Buy Co., Inc. Price and Consensus  Best Buy Co., Inc. Price and Consensus | Best Buy Co., Inc. QuoteThis bullish trend is why the stock sports a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and why we are looking for outperformance from the company in the near term.Bottom LineClearly, Best Buy is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. Moreover, this Zacks Rank #2 company flaunts a solid Zacks Industry Rank (among top 2% of more than 250 industries). Notably, over the past two years, the industry has clearly surpassed the broader market, as you can see below:So, it might pay for value investors to delve deeper into the company’s prospects, as fundamentals indicate that this stock could be a compelling pick.Zacks Top 10 Stocks for 2018In addition to the stocks discussed above, would you like to know about our 10 finest buy-and-hold tickers for the entirety of 2018? Last year's 2017 Zacks Top 10 Stocks portfolio produced double-digit winners, including FMC Corp. and VMware which racked up stellar gains of +67.9% and +61%.

1534,BBY,"Big moves from giants such as Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B  -  Free Report), Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report), 3M (MMM  -  Free Report), and Intel (INTC  -  Free Report) helped lift the market and boost investor confidence on Monday.But despite the Dow Jones Industrial Average adding nearly 400 points and the S&P 500 climbing over 1.18%, investors shouldn’t assume that the recent extended sell-off is completely over. This means investors should remain aware of the most recent analyst sentiment, and as always, focus on stocks that are likely to top earnings estimates.Finding stocks that beat analysts’ expectations is a great and proven way to beat the market. With that in mind, one way for investors to try to make solid returns—especially during somewhat volatile times—is to pick stocks expected to beat earnings estimates.Luckily, Zacks Premium customers can utilize the Earnings ESP Screener in order to search for stocks that are expected to beat. Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst estimates.This is done because, generally speaking, when an analyst posts an estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.A positive Earnings ESP paired with a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better ranking helps us feel confident about the potential for an earnings beat. In fact, our 10-year backtest has revealed that this methodology has accurately produced a positive surprise 70% of the time.With all of this said, we are giving our readers a free look at five strong stocks in order to help them identify a handful of companies that seem ready to top earnings estimates this week.1.      Builders FirstSource, Inc. (BLDR  -  Free Report)This Texas-based supplier of building products and prefabricated components for residential construction is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and sports a “B” for Value in our Style Scores system. Builders FirstSource’s fourth-quarter sales are projected to jump nearly 10%, while its earnings are expected to climb by 6.25%, based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimates.On top of that, BLDR’s Earnings ESP of 10.15% signals that earnings estimates have been higher directly ahead of the firm’s Q4 results.

(TJX  -  Free Report)This off-price retail power, which owns TJ Maxx, Marshalls, and HomeGoods, is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and rocks a “B” grade for Value.

1535,BBY,"Foot Locker, Inc. (FL  -  Free Report) is slated to release fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Mar 2. Well the obvious question that comes to mind is whether this retailer of athletic shoes and apparel will be able to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported.In the trailing four quarters, the company missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 4.8%. Nonetheless, in the preceding quarter the company posted positive earnings surprise of 8.8%.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review has increased by a couple of cents in the past 30 days and is currently pegged at $1.25. However, it shows a sharp decline from earnings of $1.37 per share reported in the year-ago period.Let’s analyze the factors influencing the company’s performance.Factors at PlayFoot Locker is certainly trying to improve performance through operational and financial initiatives. Management believes that capitalizing on opportunities like kids’ and women’s business, shop-in-shop expansion in partnership with its vendors, store banner.com business, store refurbishment and enhancement of assortments, is likely to benefit the company in the long run. It is focusing on augmenting e-commerce platform, growing direct-to-consumer operations and tapping underpenetrated markets.Industry experts believe that these endeavors are likely to support the top line. Analysts polled by Zacks expect fourth-quarter revenue to come in at $2,221 million, up roughly 5% year over year, following declines of 0.8% and 4.4% in the preceding two quarters.In spite of expected increase in the total revenue, gross margin is likely to remain under pressure in the quarter. Foot Locker had earlier projected gross margin (on a 13-week basis) to contract in the range of 220-240 basis points in the final quarter of fiscal 2017 due to higher markdowns.During the third quarter, gross margin contracted 290 basis points to 31% of sales primarily due to fall in merchandise margin on account of higher markdowns to pull traffic and clear slow-moving inventory. Gross margin had contracted 340 and 100 basis points in the second and first quarter, respectively.Further, SG&A as a percentage of sales is likely to be up 60-80 basis points in the fourth quarter. SG&A expense rate increased 30 basis points to 19.7% during the third quarter.As a result, the bottom line is likely to decline in the quarter. Foot Locker had earlier forecasted earnings per share to decline in the range of 15-25% in the fourth quarter, excluding the benefit of 12 cents a share from 53rd week. In the third, second and first quarter, the same has declined 23%, 34% and 2.2%, respectively.Foot Locker, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Foot Locker, Inc.

1536,BBY,"Third quarter earnings season is winding down, but this week there are still over 250 companies expected to report earnings, with many of them being the big retailers.The retail sector has been one of the gloomiest groups on Wall Street. Many investors believe that they will ALL be Amazoned. But the department stores have already reported and it wasn’t too bad. Will the others follow suit?Tracey looked through the retail earnings charts to find those with the best track records this week. Some of these are trading near new highs, but some are not.Keep an eye on comparable store sales guidance as well as the earnings miss or beat. It’s just as important as beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate.All 5 of these companies have had great comparable store sales results in the last few quarters. Can they do it again in a challenging retail environment?5 Top Retail Earnings Charts1.    Home Depot (HD  -  Free Report) is a beast. Not only has it beat every quarter for 5 years it is also crushing the comparables. In the second quarter, it did a 6.3% sales comp. Almost no one in the industry is doing it as well as Home Depot.2.    TJX Companies (TJX  -  Free Report) is cashing in on the popular Home Goods chain, which did a 7% sales comparable last quarter. Consumers are willing to spend on their homes. But TJ Maxx’s shares have been a bit weak. Will another good quarter boost the stock out of its narrow trading range?3.    Children’s Place (PLCE  -  Free Report) is a mall-based retailer who hasn’t missed in 5 years. This type of specialty retailer was supposed to be Amazoned, and its competitor, Gymboree, was, as it declared bankruptcy and closed 330 stores. But this gave a boost to Children’s Place. It had a 3.1% comparable last quarter.4.    L Brands (LB  -  Free Report) used to be the darling of the Street with its popular Pink brand but Pink isn’t as popular as it once was and it has also exited swimwear. It pre-announced sales comps of 2% and shares are off the lows.5.    Best Buy (BBY  -  Free Report) was supposed to be Amazoned years ago but instead of caving in to the competition, it upped its game and came roaring back. Its last earnings miss was nearly 5 years ago and it did a 5.4% comp last quarter, among the best in the industry.

1537,BBY,"Target Corporation (TGT  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release first-quarter fiscal 2018 results on May 23. Well the obvious question that comes to mind is whether this operator of general merchandise stores will be able to deliver positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported.In the trailing four quarters, the company outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 10.7%. However, it reported a negative earnings surprise of 1.4% in the preceding quarter. Meanwhile, estimates have been stable ahead of the first-quarter earnings release.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the first quarter is pegged at $1.38 up from $1.21 reported in the year-ago period. Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $16,432 million, up from $16,017 million reported in the prior-year quarter.Here Are the Deciding FactorsOmni-channel & Restock Program to Lift SalesTarget has chalked out strategies to adapt to the fast-changing retail landscape. The company is deploying resources to enhance omni-channel capacities, coming up with new brands, remodeling or refurbishing stores, and expanding same-day delivery options. Target has undertaken rationalization of supply chain with same-day delivery of in-store purchases for a flat fee along with technology and process improvements.Retailers are ensuring a speedy delivery to customers. They are either acquiring or partnering with delivery service companies for same-day delivery to stay ahead in the race. In this respect, Target acquired Shipt to expand same-day delivery of more than 55,000 groceries, essentials, home, electronics, toys and other products.The company has rolled out Target Restock program that allows customers to restock their shipping box with essential items online and get them delivered at door steps by the next business day for a nominal charge. Drive Up, an app-based service, is another initiative to expedite the shopping process. The service allows customers to place orders using the Target app and have them delivered to their cars.All these strategic endeavors are likely to favorably impact the quarterly results. Management had earlier guided first-quarter fiscal 2018 comparable sales to be up low-single digit and projected earnings in the band of $1.25-$1.45.Will Margins Remain Under Pressure?Margin, an important financial metric that gives an indication about the company’s health, has been declining. We note that the operating margin shriveled 80 basis points (bps), 90 bps, 120 bps and 140 bps to 7.4%, 6.8%, 5.2% and 5.1% during the first, second, third and fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, respectively. Management expects operating margin to contract roughly 60-80 bps in the first quarter. Target informed that increase in depreciation and amortization on account of its remodel program, rise in costs due to new fulfillment options, higher wages and incremental investments are the primary headwinds.Target Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Target Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Target Corporation QuoteWhat Does the Zacks Model Suggest?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Target is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Target has a Zacks Rank #3 but an Earnings ESP of -0.65%.

1538,BBY,"Tiffany & Co. (TIF  -  Free Report) is slated to report first-quarter fiscal 2018 results on May 23. In the trailing four quarters, this designer, manufacturer and retailer of jewelry and other items has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 4.5%. In the last reported quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 2.5%.Investors are counting on another estimate beat by Tiffany in the to-be-reported quarter. Let’s delve deep and take a look at the factors that will be influencing the results.Here Are the Deciding FactorsTiffany is well positioned to augment its top and bottom-lines performance in the long run by leveraging capital investments made over the past several years in distribution, manufacturing and diamond sourcing processes. The company is also looking at other revenue generating avenues. It also intends to expand distribution network by adding stores in both new and existing markets. The company is focused on opening smaller stores that offer selected collections of lower priced higher-margin product, which in turn boosts store productivity.The company is gradually coming up with new jewelry designs, range of watches and fragrance. It has also introduced “build-your-own program” on its website under which customers are allowed to personalize their charm bracelets. Also, Tiffany is allowing customers to customize rings. Apart from this, the company renewed its licensing agreement with Luxottica Group — slated to expire on Dec 31, 2027 — for the development, production and global distribution of sunglasses and prescription frames.However, despite the company’s efforts to boost the top line, rising SG&A expenses are likely to dent the operating margin. In this regard, we note that management expects fiscal 2018 SG&A expenses to increase at a rate higher than sales on account of increased spending on technology, marketing communications, visual merchandising, digital and store presentations. We noted that in the first, second, third and fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, SG&A expenses had increased 0.2%, 3.7%, 3.3% and 2.2%, respectively.Tiffany & Co. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Tiffany & Co. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Tiffany & Co. QuoteHow Are Top & Bottom Line Estimates Faring?After registering a bottom-line increase of 15% in the final quarter of fiscal 2017, Tiffany is likely to record year-over-year growth of more than 13% in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 as well. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at 84 cents compared with 74 cents reported in the year-ago quarter. We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate has been stable in the last 30 days. Analysts polled by Zacks now project revenues of $960.7 million, up from $899.6 million in the year-ago quarter.If all goes well, this will be the fourth straight quarter that the company will surpass the Zacks Consensus Estimate for both the top and bottom lines.What Does the Zacks Model Suggest?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Tiffany is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — for this to happen.

1539,BBY,"Lowe's Companies, Inc. (LOW  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter fiscal 2018 results on May 23. In the preceding quarter, the company’s earnings lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 15.9%. This home improvement retailer failed to beat the consensus mark in the trailing four quarters, the average being a negative 4.9%.Which Way Are Estimates Treading?After registering an earnings decline of 14% in the final quarter of fiscal 2017, Lowe's Companies is expected to record year-over-year growth of more than 18% in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at $1.22 compared with $1.03 reported in the year-ago quarter. Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $17,457 million, up 3.6% year over year.Factors at PlayAn improving job scenario, housing market recovery and merchandising initiatives along with efforts to enhance omni-channel capabilities bode well for Lowe’s. Moreover, the company’s focus on strengthening its relationship with Pro customers is encouraging.Lowe's Companies, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Lowe's Companies, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Lowe's Companies, Inc. QuoteThe buyout of Maintenance Supply Headquarters is enhancing the company’s relationship with Pro customers. Further, Lowe’s has refurbished its pro-service business website, LowesForPros.com, in order to cater to the needs of its Pro customers. The company’s Canadian and Mexican businesses has been doing pretty well. Meanwhile, the buyout of RONA has been fortifying the company’s position in the Canadian market.Lowe's Canada entered into a strategic partnership with Solar Brokers Canada to provide solar energy installation services to homeowners under Lowe's Solar banner. Of late, the company has been focusing on maintenance, repair and operations products, evident from its acquisition of Maintenance Supply Headquarters and also the earlier buyout of Central Wholesalers.In fact, the reflection of these endeavors is quite evident from a 4.1% rise in fourth-quarter comparable sales (comps), following an increase of 5.7%, 4.5% and 1.9% recorded in the third, second and first quarter, respectively.Undoubtedly, the above discussion makes us optimistic about Lowe’s performance in the soon-to-be-reported quarter. However, threats emerging from cannibalization and stiff competition cannot be ignored. Also, we observed that the company’s gross margin has been under pressure for quite some time now. Moreover, higher SG&A expenses may act as a headwind too. Evidently, Lowe's gross margin in the first, second, third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2017, declined a respective 64, 23, 28 and 70 basis points to 34.4%, 34.2%, 34.1% and 33.7%.Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review has witnessed a downward revision of roughly 5.7% in the past 30 days. Estimates have been trending down lately ahead of first-quarter fiscal 2018 earnings release, as analysts polled by Zacks also remain apprehensive about unfavorable weather that might result in lower spring seasonal spending, and in turn could hurt the company's top line.We note that Home Depot’s (HD  -  Free Report) top line for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 were short of consensus mark mainly due to softness in the spring season categories as the weather across the United States was colder than normal. The extreme winter weather in the quarter negatively impacted its garden categories, which usually represent 15-20% of sales in the first quarter.What the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model shows that Lowe's is not likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because the stock doesn’t have the right combination of two ingredients — a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) and a positive Earnings ESP.

1540,BBY,"It has been a busy week for retailers, with industry giants from Macy’s (M  -  Free Report) to Nordstrom (JWN  -  Free Report) all reporting their first quarter earnings results. But Q1 hasn’t treated all of these companies the same, so let’s take a look at a few more big-name retailers that investors might want to consider buying ahead of earnings next week.Shares of Macy’s surged over 11% on Wednesday after the company topped both top and bottom line estimates, and raised its full-year earnings guidance. Meanwhile, fellow department store power Nordstrom did not perform as well and saw its stock price sink nearly 10% through morning trading on Friday after its comps climbed only 0.6%.With that said, there are clearly still gains to be had from retail stocks even as worries about Amazon (AMZN) and other online sellers mount. Investors just need to look in the right places and search for stocks that are expected to top quarterly earnings estimates.Luckily, Zacks Premium customers can utilize the Earnings ESP Screener in order to search for stocks that are expected to surprise, in one way or the other. This is done because, generally speaking, when an analyst posts an estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.A positive Earnings ESP paired with a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better ranking helps us feel confident about the potential for an earnings beat. In fact, our 10-year backtest has revealed that this methodology has accurately produced a positive surprise 70% of the time.Today, we are giving our readers a free look at three of these strong stocks ahead of their upcoming quarterly earnings reports.

1542,BBY,"It was not UGG but sturdy sales performance across HOKA ONE ONE and Teva brands coupled with lower cost of sales and SG&A expenses that enabled Deckers Outdoor Corporation (DECK  -  Free Report) to post better-than-expected second-quarter fiscal 2018 results. Despite tough retail scenario, this footwear and apparel retailer reported quarterly earnings of $1.54 that beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.03 and surged 25.2% from the year-ago period.The top line did feel the pinch of soft sales across UGG and Sanuk brands, and fell 0.7% to $482.5 million during the second quarter, following an increase of 20.3% registered in the preceding quarter.

1543,BBY,"Wall Street has been on the second-longest bull run in U.S. history with the major bourses hitting new milestones. Notably, the Dow Jones industrial Average hit another landmark 23,000 last week. Resumption of Trump trade, upbeat economic data, and deluge of solid earnings reports are instilling optimism in the world’s largest economy (read: Dow ETFs Soar as the Index Hits 23,000).Manufacturing activity, as measured by the Institute for Supply Management, reached a 13-year high in September while non-manufacturing activity or the service sector expanded to the highest level since August 2005. Additionally, auto sales strongly rebounded in September posting the best month of the year, following the eighth consecutive month of decline. Consumer confidence soared to highest level since 2004 in early October, per the preliminary University of Michigan reading.Further, the Senate’s passage of the $1.4 trillion budget resolution has paved the way for tax cuts later this year or early next year. The reform will likely create an economic surge, boosting job growth in manufacturing and other sectors. The step toward the tax overhaul sparked a strong rally in the stocks lately and is a key catalyst to the likely future market boom (read: 5 Biggest ETF Winners of Trump Trade Resurgence).While the rally is broad-based, there is still some bargain hunting for investors. Additionally, any dip in the stock market could be an attractive entry point.

Notably, the Dow Jones witnessed the biggest one-day fall since Sep 5.As a result, we have highlighted five ETFs and five stocks that have been selling at a bargain price. Investors could definitely look at these products for outperformance in the coming weeks.How to Find Bargain ETFs?Using our database, first we selected the ETFs with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold).

1544,BBY,"It has been quite challenging for retailers over the past several years, with many facing store closures. Growth in e-commerce significantly changed the way consumers shop, while natural calamities like hurricanes impacted many retailers more recently.Even though retailers mostly flopped this year, things are starting to turn around. Many retailers are poised to open new stores as September sales rose at the highest rate since 2015. And with the holiday shopping season around the corner, sales are expected to improve.Meanwhile, consumer confidence crushed expectations and scaled to its highest level in October since 2004. As American consumers are gaining confidence in the economy, things are looking up for retailers. Thus, let us keep an eye on retail stocks that are likely to make the most of the third-quarter earnings season.Is the Retail Death Overhyped?Investors have been concerned about a sizeable number of bankruptcies and store closures in the retail space over the last several years. Sporting goods, clothing, and electronics retailers, in particular, closed stores to curtail expenses and subsequently drive profits. There has also been a significant decline in comparable-store sales, mostly due to a rise in online deals. However, of late, companies closing stores are often referred to as attention-seeking, as a large number of stores are actually being opened. As per IHL Group, the total net increase of stores planned for 2017, including retail and restaurants, is 4,080. Core retail stores, which excludes restaurants, are anticipated to see a net gain of 1,326 this year.The store openings are mainly driven by a broad-based gain in retail sales last month, including those that have been the hardest hit by bankruptcies and store closures over the past year. Overall U.S. retail sales climbed 1.6% in September from August, marking the highest increase since March 2015. Retail sales received a sizeable boost from automobiles, gasoline stations, and building materials. Excluding such categories and foodservices, retail sales were up 0.4%.Holidays Right Around the CornerRetail sales are expected to gain further traction this year thanks to the upcoming holiday shopping season. Both Black Friday and Cyber Monday, historically, have seen retail sales move north. According to Adobe Digital Insights, consumers had spent a solid $3.34 billion on Black Friday and $3.45 billion on Cyber Monday.Respondents surveyed said that Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT  -  Free Report) is the most sought-after destination for the upcoming Black Friday weekend, while Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report) is the top destination for the Cyber Monday holiday.In fact, this year, holiday retail sales for the upcoming two months are expected to grow. According to the National Retail Federation, retail sales in November and December are projected to increase between 3.6% and 4% over last year, with an estimated total of $678.75 billion to $682 billion.Consumers Gain ConfidenceAnother thing investors should consider is the renewed faith that Americans have in the economy. According to the University of Michigan, the U.S. Consumer Sentiment Index touched 101.1 this month, up from 95.1 last month. Such a record consumer confidence number is a significant reading since it has been historically good at predicting consumer spending for the next three to six months. The more confidence households generate, the more will they spend and, in turn, boost the revenues of retailers.Household optimism was largely driven by falling gas prices and underlying strength in the labor market. A clearer view of last month’s labor market data, in the meanwhile, showed that keeping the effects of the hurricane aside, the U.S. employment scenario is continuing to tighten.The unemployment rate declined to 4.2% last month, the lowest since February 2001, while wages increased 0.5% to an average of $26.55 an hour, per the Labor Department data. In fact, in the last 12 months, hourly pay increased 2.9%, up from 2.7% in the prior month and in-line with a post-recession high.Looking Ahead to Q3 Earnings: 5 Solid ChoicesAs retailers have staged a comeback, they are likely to see steady growth in the third-quarter reporting cycle. This calls for investing in five retail stocks, which are expected to report a significant uptick in Q3 earnings.These stocks have a positive Earnings ESP.

1545,BBY,"Barring a few hiccups, the U.S. stock market has displayed a decent run in an economy that witnessed a rise in the benchmark interest rate, recorded sharp rise in U.S. factory activity in June, saw oil prices lose ground and encountered political gridlock. We note that the Dow Jones Industrial Average has advanced 9%, the S&P 500 has gained 9.1%, while the tech-laden Nasdaq Composite Index has surged 16.3% so far in the year.The buoyant market provides an ideal opportunity to boost your portfolio by adding growth stocks. These are generally hot and flourishing stocks with earnings growth potential. Among the 16 Zacks categorized sectors, we are focusing on Retail-Wholesale. The sector has gained 14.3% so far in the year and has comfortably outperformed the S&P 500 index.The rebound in oil prices from all-time lows, improving labor market and gradual recovery in the housing market signal that the economy is on a recovery mode. These factors are favorable for retailers. On the other hand, steady job additions and gradual wage acceleration offer a perfect background to drive consumer confidence. We expect this positive sentiment to translate into higher consumer spending that may help revive sales in the current retail landscape that is witnessing a sea change with the focus gradually shifting to online shopping.As a result, retailers are now concentrating more on enhancing their omni-channel capabilities, optimizing store fleet and restructuring activities. Best Buy Co., Inc. (BBY  -  Free Report) is one of those retailers who are making extensive investments to upgrade operations with special focus on developing omni-channel and strengthening partnership with vendors. The company also launched a fresh strategy called “Best Buy 2020: Building the New Blue” to explore and pursue growth opportunities and optimize cost with focus on key areas.These initiatives have led shares of this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company 25% higher year-to-date.

1548,BBY,"In retrospect, it was apparent that the market never had a chance today. Wednesdays session started on negative consumer spending news as Best Buy (BBY  -  Free Report) announced that it slashed its fiscal 2009 earnings outlook to a level that is below analyst forecasts, describing the current state of affairs as the toughest retail environment it has ever seen.
"
1549,BBY,"The Best Buy news translated into negative early-session trading, which cascaded into further pessimism as Paulson explained that the original plan to buy banks bad mortgages would have taken too much time. He stated that, instead, the Treasury will focus on using $250 billion of the bailout package to continue buying stock in banks. According to Paulson, this change of path is intended to strengthen bank balance sheets and encourage them to resume more normal lending.

1562,BBY,"Best Buy Co., Inc. (BBY  -  Free Report) looks good on the back of its strategic efforts, sturdy online sales growth and solid earnings surprise history. Though the company delivered robust results in second-quarter fiscal 2018, the stock was hurt as investors are concerned about margins that may come under pressure due to increase in investments.In fact, shares of this leading multinational specialty retailer have declined 11.5% since the company reported its earnings on Aug 29. Nevertheless, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has been up 29.5% year to date compared with the Zacks Electronics Retail industry’s gain of 25.2%. Currently, the industry is placed at the top 9% of the Zacks classified industries (24 out of 256).Moreover, the stock boasts a VGM Score of A with a long-term earnings growth rate of 12%, which portrays its inherent potential.Let’s take a detailed analysis of the company’s pros and cons.Best Buy 2020: A Game ChangerFollowing the successful completion of Renew Blue program, the company has launched a fresh strategy called Best Buy 2020: Building the New Blue.Meanwhile, Best Buy remains focused on expansion of multi-channel retail business, offering services and solutions that cater to customer needs. In addition, it is focusing on accelerating growth in Canada and Mexico.Under this strategy, the top most priority for fiscal 2018 will be exploring and pursuing growth opportunities, better execution in key areas, cost optimization and investing in people as well as systems to drive growth, implementation and efficiencies.Notably, the company has already achieved the cost reduction target of $450 million and targets $600 million of cost reduction as well as gross profit optimization by fiscal 2021.Robust Q2 & Estimates TrendBest Buy reported better-than-expected earnings for the 19th straight quarter in second-quarter fiscal 2018. In the trailing four quarters, the company’s earnings have surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 27.2%.Best Buy Co., Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Best Buy Co., Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Best Buy Co., Inc. QuoteIn fact, the bottom line increased 21% year over year in the fiscal second quarter. The company was also impressive on the revenue front, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the second straight quarter. Results were driven by the robust demand for technology products.

Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 76 cents for the fiscal third quarter has climbed 12 cents.Other Strategic EndeavorsBest Buy is making extensive investments to upgrade operations with special focus on developing omni-channel capabilities and strengthening partnership with vendors. Also, the company is leaving no stone unturned to attract consumers and attain incremental revenues.In fact, we believe that the store-in-a-store concept is likely to be considered a game changer for the company as it facilitates the display of different brands under one roof and ensures larger footfall.Best Buy Vs. IndustryWeakness/ConcernsBest Buy is planning to spend nearly $700 million in fiscal 2018, up from the previous estimate of $650 million. This is because the company wants to increase the investment to boost e-Commerce operations and supply chains to counter competition. The increase in investment is likely to hurt margins in the coming quarters.Further, stiff competition, tepid retail landscape and aggressive promotional strategies might hurt the company’s growth and profitability.Still Interested in Retail?

1563,BBY,"Fred’s, Inc.  is slated to report second-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Sep 6, before the opening bell. The question lingering in investors’ minds is, whether this leading discount retailer will be able to post a positive earnings surprise again in the to-be-reported quarter. The company’s earnings have outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing four quarters with a negative surprise in one quarter. This brings the company’s average to a miss of 0.61%.Let us see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Which Way are Estimates Treading?Let’s look at the estimate revisions in order to get a clear picture of what analysts are thinking about the company right before the earnings release. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter and fiscal 2017 has been declining over the last 30 days. While estimates for the second quarter widened from a loss of 16 cents to a loss of 18 cents, the same for the fiscal year widened from loss of 33 cents to a loss of 36 cents per share.However, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 18 cents per share for the second quarter remains flat from the prior-year quarter. Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $507.4 million for the said quarter, down 4.2% from the year-ago period.Fred's, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Fred's, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Fred's, Inc. QuoteWhat Does the Zacks Model Unveil?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Fred’s is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) and a positive Earnings ESP for this to happen. You may uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Fred’shas an Earnings ESP of 0.00% as the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at a loss of 18 cents. The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Note that Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement.Factors at PlayFred’s has been posting dismal comps for quite some time now due to the sale of low productive discontinued inventory. Declining traffic trends are also hurting comps. We note that the company’s comp sales fell 0.8% in May 1.6% in June and 0.1% in July. In the preceding quarter, sales were also affected by the closure of 39 underperforming stores, which further dented August comp store sales, which dipped 0.5% year over year. Comparable store sales for August were negatively impacted by the continued increase in Generic Dispensing Rate as well as a 0.5% impact from the sale of low productive discontinued inventory versus August of last year.Also, it seems that the company is yet to recover from the cancelled Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. and Rite Aid Corporation merger. The Walgreens-Rite Aid merger was important to the company, as it would allow Fred’s to buy 865 Rite Aid stores. The acquisition of these stores would have positioned Fred’s Pharmacy as the third-largest drugstore chain in the nation after Walgreens and CVS Health Corporation. Additionally, Fred’s would have had greater negotiating power and would have also improved its healthcare growth strategy. The cancelled merger, however, led to higher selling, general and administrative expenses mainly due to higher professional, legal, banking and integration planning fees incurred in connection with the announced agreement to acquire Rite Aid stores and the development and implementation of the company's growth strategy.We note that the company has been witnessing improved growth in Retail Pharmacy adjusted script comps and year-over-year progress in sales trends in the Specialty Pharmacy business, as the company continues to execute the Fred’s Pharmacy healthcare transformation. The company is also closing underperforming stores and has been upgrading technical knowhow, improving supply chain and is focusing on its health care strategy in relation to execution of the Fred’s Pharmacy transformation.However, Fred’s sluggish traffic trends and declining comps remain its woes and is well reflected in the share price of the company. If we look into the past three months’ performance of Fred’s, we note that the stock has significantly declined 54.7% in comparison to the industry, which declined only 7.7% in the said time frame.Stocks with Favorable Combination Here are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Big Lots Inc.

1564,BBY,"The U.S. equity market has been subdued due to domestic as well as international factors. Concerns pertaining to recent actions of the Trump administration, havoc wreaked by Harvey and the North Korea-Japan tensions have kept markets on the edge.However, investors, irrespective of the current scenario, are on the lookout for stocks that would fetch them handsome returns. They are, after all, spending their hard-earned money in the stock market and would not want the amount to go down the drains. Maintaining a well-diversified portfolio (selecting stocks from different industries) is a tried and tested strategy to tackle the uncertainties and get handsome returns.The task is, however, easier said than done. With a deluge of stocks flooding the market at a particular point of time, one needs to have thorough understanding of the nitty-gritty associated with investing, to select appropriate stocks for his/her portfolio. Given the time constraint that we all face these days, it is near to impossible for individual investors to have the requisite expertise. The process is as trying as spotting a needle in a haystack, especially if the investor is unaided.This is where the need for guidance comes in. To get proper guidance, investors often fall back on the advice of experts while arriving at their investment decision (buy, sell or hold).  The experts in the field of investing are brokers. Why Broker Advice is Crucial?Brokers not only scrutinize the publicly available financial documents but also attend company conference calls and other presentations. Since brokers arrive at their recommendation (Buy, Sell or Hold) on a stock after thoroughly analyzing the minute details associated with the company, it is natural for investors to be guided by estimate revisions while arriving at investment decisions. Estimate revisions serve as an important pointer regarding the price of a stock. In fact, a rating upgrade normally leads to stock price appreciation and vice versa.Estimates can move north for a number of reasons – favorable earnings performance, a bullish guidance, product launch or any favorable macro scenario.  Similarly, a stock may fall out of analysts’ favor due to adverse events like pipeline failure (for a biotech player). Trimming of earnings estimates by brokers often leads to stock price depreciation. Naturally, investors tend to dump such stocks on the basis of broker advice.Designing a Winning PortfolioTo take care of the performance with respect to the bottom line, we have designed a screen based on improving analyst recommendation and upward estimate revisions over the last four weeks.While we have talked about the bottom line in detail, the top line (revenue portion) cannot be ignored. The price/sales ratio has been clubbed with the above criteria as it is a strong complementary valuation metric in the presence of analyst information. The price/sales ratio takes care of the company’s top line, making the strategy foolproof.Screening Criteria# (Up- Down Rating)/ Total (4 weeks) =Top #75: This gives the list of top 75 companies that have witnessed net upgrades over the last four weeks.% change in Q (1) est. (4 weeks) = Top #10: This gives the top 10 stocks that have witnessed earnings estimate revisions over the past four weeks for the upcoming quarter.To ensure that the strategy is a winning one, covering all bases, we have added the following screening parameters:Price-to-Sales = Bot%10: The lower the ratio the better, companies meeting this criteria are in bottom 10% of our universe of over 7,700 stocks with respect to this ratio.Price greater than 5: A stock trading below $5 will not likely create significant interest for most investors.Average Daily Volume greater than 100,000 shares over the last 20 trading days: Volume has to be significant to ensure that these are easily traded.Market value ($ mil) = Top #3000: This gives us stocks that are the top 3000 if one judges by market capitalization.Com/ADR/Canadian= Com: This eliminates the ADR and Canadian stocks.Here are five of the 10 stocks that made it through the screen:Based in Columbus, OH and founded in 1967, Big Lots, Inc.

1565,BBY,"Big Lots, Inc. (BIG  -  Free Report) is expected to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Mar 2. Notably, the company’s earnings have outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate for eight straight quarters now, with a trailing four-quarter average of 11.1%.Moreover, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.42 for the fiscal fourth quarter has moved up by a penny in the last 30 days and is likely to witness a year-over-year growth of more than 7%. Analysts polled by Zacks also expect revenues of $1,649 million in the impending quarter, up nearly 4.3% from the year-ago quarter.Big Lots, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Big Lots, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Big Lots, Inc. QuoteLet’s see how things are shaping up prior to the earnings announcement.Factors Likely to Impact 4Q17Big Lots’ furniture financing programs and soft home category have been consistently gaining traction, which is likely to continue in the fourth quarter as well. Meanwhile, management has been expanding assortments in the furniture category by including lawn and garden items. In order to tap the opportunities in the furniture and soft home categories, the company also added more brands and revamped the food department by giving it a fresh look for the convenience of customers. Moreover, the company’s merchandising strategies and effective marketing seem to be paying off quite well.Notably, all these initiatives are driving the company’s comparable-store sales (comps), which increased in 13 of the trailing 15 quarters. For the fourth quarter, comps are expected to be up in the range of flat to up 2%. Comps are likely to grow roughly 1% in fiscal 2017. Further, adjusted earnings per share are envisioned in the band of $4.23-$4.28 for the fiscal, which represents growth of 16-18% from the previous year. For fiscal 2017, the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged higher at $4.30.However, Big Lots is not doing well on the revenue front. Its sales have lagged estimates in seven of the last nine quarters. Also, management had earlier trimmed sales guidance for fiscal 2017. Sales growth for the year is projected to be up approximately 2% compared with 2-2.5% anticipated earlier. Analysts surveyed by Zacks expect revenues of $5.28 billion for the fiscal year.Moreover, sluggishness in electronics, toys and accessories remains a concern. Gross margin is expected to decline year over year in the final quarter of fiscal 2017 as well.What Does the Zacks Model Unveil?Nonetheless, our proven model shows that Big Lots is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Big Lots has an Earnings ESP of +0.87% and a Zacks Rank #2, making us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.Other Stocks With Favorable CombinationHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these too have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:G-III Apparel Group, Ltd.

1566,BBY,"Skechers U.S.A., Inc. (SKX  -  Free Report) is slated to release third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 19. In the trailing four quarters, it had underperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 19.2%. In the preceding quarter, it missed the consensus mark by 13.6%. The question lingering in investors’ minds now is whether Skechers will be able to post positive earnings surprise in the third quarter. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.What to Expect?After witnessing a decline in the bottom line for the five straight quarters, Skechers is likely to post earnings growth in the third quarter of 2017. We note that the current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is 43 cents, which is a penny above from the year-ago period. Meanwhile, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $1,065 million, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 13%. However, we notice that the rate of growth may decelerate from the preceding quarter that saw 16.9% jump in the top line.Management had earlier guided third-quarter net sales in the band of $1.050-$1.075 billion compared with $942.4 million reported in the prior-year quarter. Additionally, the company had envisioned earnings per share in the range of 42-47 cents.Factors at PlayInvestors remained apprehensive about Skechers’ bottom-line performance that has been declining since the past few quarters due to rise in selling and general & administrative expenses. However, we believe that greater emphasis on new line of products, cost containment efforts, inventory management and global distribution platform may help reverse trend. The company is also enhancing e-commerce platform. Although, Skechers expects to deliver flat sales in the domestic wholesale business, it envisions double-digit growth at its international business as well as company-owned retail stores.Skechers U.S.A., Inc.

1567,BBY,"Kohl’s Corporation (KSS  -  Free Report) has been gaining from its strong portfolio of brands, growth in e-commerce business and continued innovation. Strong inventory and expense management have also been positively impacting the company’s bottom line.In addition, we also believe that the extended tie-up between Kohl’s and Amazon.com (AMZN  -  Free Report) have enhanced investor’s confidence in the stock. Shares of Kohl’s have surged 8.3% in the past six months, outperforming the industry’s decline of 15.8%.Let’s delve into the factors that have been impacting Kohl’s performance lately.Surging e-commerce Kohl’s e-commerce sales have almost doubled since 2011 at a compound annual growth rate of almost 40% over the last five years. In the recently reported second quarter of 2017, digital conversion improved at a double-digit rate on the back of better customer experience on smartphone and smartphone app. In fact, technology improvements in both application and the device along with omni-channel efforts are expected to bear positive impact on customer experience.Similarly, retailers like Target Corporation (TGT  -  Free Report) are also focused on boosting omni-channel retailing and e-commerce.Initiatives to Enhance Margins Kohl’s has undertaken several initiatives to reduce inventory, in order to boost profits. During the second quarter of fiscal 2017, the company made additional progress on its initiatives. As a result, inventory per store decreased 2%, while units per store were 3% lower, which was consistent with expectations for a low to mid-single-digit decrease for the year. The company continues to expect inventory to be down low to mid-single digits for fiscal 2017.Strong Portfolio of Brands Kohl’s prides on having a diverse product portfolio which includes apparel, shoes, accessories, beauty and home products. The company has established a strong brand portfolio with national brands such as Dockers, Levi’s, Columbia Sportswear, Reebok, Champion, Oshkosh, Pfatzgraff and KitchenAid. The company has also been keen on innovation and regularly introduces new brands in order to keep the inventory assortment fresh and drive customer traffic to its stores and website. Popular launches include Fit Bed under its active and wellness business and Jumping Beans collection, amongst many more. Efforts to Improve Store Traffic Kohl’s has been struggling with lower comps for quite some time now. The company’s comps started declining from the first quarter of fiscal 2016 and plummeted consecutively for the next six quarters. This signifies that the company’s strategic initiative, Greatness Agenda, is failing to deliver results. The initiative, which commenced in first-quarter 2014, was designed to increase transactions per store and sales.In an effort to drive store sales, Kohl’s has started offering more outside famous brands and cutting down on the number of in-house clothing brands it sells. The addition of Under Armour workout tights, sneakers and other accessories in March was a great success and was well received among customers. The company’s focus on large private-label brands such as, SONOMA, Croft & Barrow and Apartment 9 has also been aiding store traffic expansion.Tie-Up with AmazonKohl’s recent initiatives to strengthen its tie-up with Amazon are also expected to enhance store traffic. The company recently announced its initiative to accept returns for Amazon customers on selected products in 82 of its U.S. store locations from October 2017. Additionally, the retailer will provide free service of packing and shipping the merchandises to Amazon’s fulfillment centers. Through such a partnership, Kohl’s is expected to expand its omni-channel capabilities and make use of Amazons’ wide consumer base.In recent times, Kohl’s had also announced to sell Amazon’s devices, accessories and smart home products in 10 selected stores in Los Angeles and Chicago.

Today we will focus on Best Buy and try to analyze the catalysts that may help the stock to sustain its momentum going forward.Strategic Endeavors Well on Track Best Buy has exhibited a bullish run in the index owing to strategic efforts, sturdy online sales growth and solid earnings history. The company is making extensive investments to upgrade operations with special focus on developing omni-channel capabilities and strengthening partnership with vendors.The company’s Renew Blue program, which was announced in November 2012 aided it to overcome two major problems, “negative comparable sales and declining operating income rate”. The strategy helped the company to deliver compounded annual adjusted earnings growth rate of 8% in the past five years. Best Buy, which has generated cost savings of $1.4 billion in the past five years, continues to expect an additional annualized cost reduction of $600 million by 2021. These efforts have helped the stock to register a whopping gain of 223.7% in the past five years, outpacing the industry's increase of 129.9%.Following the successful completion of “Renew Blue” program, the company launched a fresh strategy called “Best Buy 2020: Building the New Blue”. In an effort to drive growth, the company is focused on expansion of multi-channel retail business, offering services and solutions that solve customer need. Moreover, it is concentrating on accelerating growth in Canada and Mexico.

Meanwhile, the company anticipates enterprise revenues of $43 billion for fiscal 2021 compared with the fiscal 2017 revenues of $39.4 billion.Following better-than expected third-quarter fiscal 2018 results, the company raised fiscal 2018 guidance. For the fiscal year, management forecasts Enterprise revenues (including 53rd week) growth of 4%, up from the prior guidance of 2.5%. The company anticipates adjusted operating income (including 53rd week) growth rate in the range of 4-9%, up from the earlier guided range of 3.5-8.5%.

1572,BBY,"If you haven’t completed your holiday shopping yet, Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report) surely has some good news for you. This supermarket giant, which is leaving no stone unturned to evolve with the changing consumer trends and combat competition from Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report), came up with plans to ease eleventh-hour shopping.Wal-Mart’s Plans for This Holiday SeasonWell, there were rounds last week that this holiday season, Wal-Mart plans to significantly increase its Walmart.com offerings available for same-day pickup in stores. Notably, this big-box retailer has grown its offerings on Walmart.com by roughly three times over a year. As the company expects demand for same-day deliveries to double in the last two weeks of the holiday season, it plans to strengthen its online assortment more than it had ever done before.Further, per a CNBC report, customers can shop on Walmart.com for items noted ""Free Pickup Today"" until 4 p.m. on Dec 23, and can pick up those products from the company’s stores until 6 pm on Christmas Eve. Also, the big-box retailer came up with another enticing plan, of filling some online order cases with unloaded gift cards. These cards will allow customers to make another gift purchase by adding funds to it.We believe that this last-minute online shopping and pick up in store option is likely to be a bliss for customers. In fact, this step also strengthens Wal-Mart’s competitive position against e-commerce king Amazon. Clearly, these moves reflect Wal-Mart’s aggressive efforts to resonate with the changing trends and make the most of the holiday season.Well, this is not Wal-Mart’s first attempt to make most of the opportunity. This is evident from the company’s recent strategy of keeping its online prices almost on par to that of Amazon this Cyber Monday. Sources revealed that Walmart’s prices were just 0.3% higher than Amazon’s, reflecting the company’s efforts to gain a good share this holiday season.What Other Retailers Are Doing?Notably, the U.S. holiday season is the most important time for retailers who garner a significant chunk of revenues during this period. Consequently, retailers go all out during the season, with early-hour store openings, huge discounts, promotional strategies and free shipping on online purchases. This is visible from the holiday season strategies undertaken by many industry players, other than Wal-Mart.Evidently, Target Corp. (TGT  -  Free Report) announced weekend deals and discounts on select categories (which don’t usually appear for sale in the company’s stores and online) in the beginning of this holiday season. The departmental biggie further stated that it will have weekend offers throughout the season. We also commend Target’s efforts to enhance online shopping during the busy selling period, with its free holiday shipping, Ship from Store, myCheckout, Order Pickup and Target Restock programs, among others.Best Buy (BBY  -  Free Report) is also taking initiatives to boost up sales this holiday season as evident from its “20 Days of Doorbusters” event. With lucrative offers, free shipping, price match guarantee and enticing gift ideas, this consumer electronics retailer is set to make most of this holiday season. Apart from this, Kohl’s (KSS  -  Free Report) and GameStop (GME  -  Free Report) are also luring shoppers with impressive deals and the online shopping and pickup at store facility.Incidentally, the National Retail Federation projects November and December sales (excluding autos, gas and restaurant sales) to rise 3.6-4% year over year to $678.75-$682 billion, which also fares better than the five-year average sales growth of 3.5%.All said, we believe that in an Amazon-dominated world, these retailers’ superb game plans should help them win over customers this holiday season. While Target, Best Buy, Kohl’s and GameStop carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) each, Wal-Mart boasts a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) thanks to its fantastic past performance and successful endeavors to resort to the dot.com bandwagon.

1575,BBY,"The stock market runs on sentiment and any unforeseen event in a particular sector has a ripple effect on others with a clear reflection on major indices that bear the brunt. The case is more or less the same for specific sectors that often see good or bad performance by one player influencing the performance of others. While major indices — Dow Jones Industrial Average, Nasdaq and S&P 500 — ended the last trading session on a positive note, the SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT  -  Free Report) fell 1%. We believe Best Buy Co., Inc.’s (BBY  -  Free Report) disappointing long-term earnings forecast may have been one of the reasons behind the SPDR S&P Retail ETF’s decline.Best Buy Long-term GoalsShares of Best Buy tanked 8% yesterday after the company’s long-term earnings guidance disappointed investors. It expects adjusted earnings per share in the range of $4.75-$5.00, which demonstrates a compounded annual growth rate of 8-9% from fiscal 2017 but is below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of long-term growth estimate of 12%. Meanwhile, the company anticipates enterprise revenues of $43 billion for fiscal 2021, compared with the fiscal 2017 revenues of $39.4 billion.The Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company stated that the Renew Blue program, which was announced in November 2012 aided it to overcome two major problems, “negative comparable sales and declining operating income rate”.

Following, the news investors pressed the panic button that took a toll on other retail stocks.J. C. Penney Company, Inc. (JCP  -  Free Report) also felt the heat as its shares tumbled 4.3%. The operator of department stores, which reported second-quarter fiscal 2017 results in August, impressed investors with its top-line performance.

This Zacks Rank #3 company reported first-quarter fiscal 2017 results last month, wherein the company reported a loss of 58 cents per share, which compares unfavorably with the year-ago period earnings of 35 cents, as well as the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 21 cents. Management blamed the quarterly loss on considerable markdowns in the quarter.Shares of Macy's, Inc. (M  -  Free Report) decreased 1.5% yesterday.

(AAPL  -  Free Report) laid out at its much-hyped Keynote event held last week at the brand-new Steve Jobs Theater.Before the company unveiled the slew of new devices we’ll all likely be putting on out holiday wish lists, senior vice president of retail and online stores, Angela Ahrendts, came out to discuss Apple’s vision for a new kind of retail store.And boy, is it different. Because Apple views its retail stores as its “largest product,” the company’s redesigned locations are now town squares, a public space were customers can get tech support for their Apple device but also hang out with friends afterwards.While it is a risky concept, Apple town squares aren’t all that different from what traditional retailers are trying to implement. Companies like Nordstrom (JWN  -  Free Report), Best Buy (BBY  -  Free Report), and Kohl’s (KSS  -  Free Report) are creating and experimenting with different kinds of store concepts that focus on an experience rather than just buying a product.Apple’s notion of what retail can be is definitely different and certainly risky, but it’s also a reflection of where the broader retail industry is headed.As a reminder, if you feel that something was missed, or if you want a different topic covered, send an email to podcast@zacks.com.

1577,BBY,"After the news of an unexpected uptick in the U.S. retail sales — +0.2% — in October, retailers got another reason to smile as they head into the holiday season. Consumer Confidence — a key determinant of the economy’s health — reached its highest level in almost 17 years. Per the Conference Board data, the Consumer Confidence Index surged to 129.5 in November from October’s revised reading of 126.2.Analysts believe that buoyant stock market, gradual wage acceleration, fall in the unemployment rate to a 17-year low, and a lift in the economic activity post hurricanes were enough to boost consumer sentiment. The positive sentiment is likely to trigger consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of the U.S. economic activity. Any increase in this metric at this juncture signals consumers’ willingness to spend more this season.This Means a Lot for RetailersImproving labor market, rising disposable income and elevated consumer sentiment have ushered confidence in retailers about a robust holiday season. The festive season is often a make-or-break time for retailers, as it accounts for a sizeable chunk of yearly revenues and profits. Be it early-hour store openings, huge discounts, promotional strategies, price matching and free shipping on online purchases, retailers will go the extra mile.The five-day holiday period starting from Thanksgiving, followed by Black Friday, Small Business Saturday to Cyber Monday, marked an auspicious start to the holiday-shopping season. Per National Retail Federation (“NRF”) approximately 174 million customers shopped in stores and online during this weekend. The trade group estimates that an American spent about an average of $335.47 during the five-day period.Indeed, shopping season is likely to be more blissful for retailers. With Christmas falling on Monday and 32 days after Thanksgiving, shoppers are getting one extra day compared with last year and an extended weekend to do last minute purchasing.Overall, NRF projects a 3.6-4% rise in November and December sales (excluding autos, gas and restaurant sales) to $678.75-$682 billion, up from $655.8 billion last year and better than the five-year average sales growth of 3.5%. Data compiled by eMarketer forecasts 3.1% jump in holiday sales (November and December) to $923.15 billion, while retail e-commerce holiday season sales are anticipated to rise 16.6%.Wrapping UpFrom Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) to Wal-Mart (WMT  -  Free Report), Target (TGT  -  Free Report) to Macy’s (M  -  Free Report) and Gap (GPS  -  Free Report) to Best Buy (BBY  -  Free Report), retailers are gearing up for the busiest part of the year. With digital transformation in shopping and consumers splurging, online retailers are fast adopting the omni-channel mantra.Wal-Mart is making huge investments in e-commerce initiatives. The company’s acquisitions of ShoeBuy, Moosejaw, ModCloth and Jet.com are in sync with its quest to build an impressive digital brand portfolio. Further, the company partnered with Alphabet’s Google to enable shopping through Google Express using voice-activated service. The company is also trying to keep the prices of items more competitive.Target has been also focusing on developing online business. In a bid to stimulate digital sales this holiday season, the company is strengthening relationship with Google by allowing customers nationwide to shop through Google Express, including voice-activated shopping.

Retailers are splurging on promotions, early-store openings, heavy discounts, as well as free shipping on online purchases to lure customers.According to the National Retail Federation (NRF), more than 164 million Americans are expected to shop both in-store and online during the Thanksgiving weekend (spanning four days — Thanksgiving Day, Black Friday, Small Business Saturday and Sunday). Of them, 70% (115 million) are planning to shop on Black Friday. An improving economy, acceleration in the job market, increasing consumer confidence and high spending power will make Black Friday a huge success  (see: all the Consumer Discretionary ETFs here).Though e-commerce or online shopping has been a key source of sales in recent times, queuing up and camping out for Black Friday has become as much of an American tradition as the feast itself.  What’s Hot?Black Friday sales bonanza both online and in stores is already in full swing as a number of retailers have offered their deals early. We have highlighted some of the best deals from retailers.Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) is ahead of all retailers offering attractive deals across 30 product categories from Thanksgiving Day to Cyber Monday. The company introduced this as a “Black Friday Deals Week.” Some of the hottest deals include Echo Dot for $29.99 (save $20), All-New Echo for $79.99 (save $20), Echo Plus for $119.99 (save $30), Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones for $179 (save 40%), LG 55-inch 4K Ultra Smart OLED TV for $1,497 (save 35%), and Samsung 55-Inch 4K Ultra HD Smart LED TV for $1198 (save 25%). The Nintendo Switch, the most popular current-gen gaming console, in grey version is available at just $299 (read: Amazon ETFs to Buy on Q3 Blowout Results).Wal-Mart (WMT  -  Free Report), the world's largest retailer, kicked off its big “Pre-Black Friday” sale on Nov 20. A few enticing deals are 55-inch Vizio 4K TV for $398, an Xbox One S bundled with two games for $249, a popular ASUS Zenbook for $479, Google Home Mini + $25 Shopping Offer for $29 (save $20), and a free $300 Walmart Gift Card with purchase of Apple’s iPhone X. The company is also offering new “Samsung Savings Event” that adds even more deals on Samsung TVs, sound bars, mobile devices and more (read: Wal-Mart ETFs to Buy on Blockbuster Q3 Results).Best Buy (BBY  -  Free Report) also started offering Black Friday deals from Nov 20. Some of the biggest deals include 50-inch 4K Smart TV for $180 (save $320), a Google Home Mini for $30 (save $20 plus get a $10 gift card), up to $150 off a 10.5-inch iPad Pro, up to $120 off Apple Watch Series 2 models, and the lowest price ever on the Philips Hue Color Starter Kit.Target (TGT  -  Free Report) is promising the ""lowest prices of the year"" on video games, TVs and other electronics. The hot deals are an XBox One S 500 GB console for $190 (save $90 and get a $25 gift card), a 65-inch Samsung 4K TV for $850 (save $156) and urBeats Earbuds for $49.99 (save $50). Additionally, Target will provide a 20% off coupon to customers who spend $50 on Black Friday.Kohl’s (KSS  -  Free Report) is offering some of the steepest discounts of any major retailer this Black Friday with PlayStation 4 for $200 (save $100), a diamond bracelet for $70 (save $230), a Google Home for $80 (save $50), or a Sky Rider HD camera drone for $50 (save $100). Additionally, a Disney castle toy or an indoor basketball game can be grabbed for just $20.ETFs to TapAll these attractive offers would boost retail sales and lead to a surge in stock prices in the days to follow. While an individual stock is certainly a great option to tap the Black Friday deals in the investment world, a basket approach through ETFs is diversified and more cost effective at lower risk.

"
1587,BBY,"Keep in mind that median growth rates are inherently equally weighted, so the growth rate for Cabot Oil and Gas (COG) is just as significant to the results for the Energy sector as the growth rate for Exxon (XOM).  Share repurchases were still very significant in the fourth quarter of last year and the first quarter of this year (the data is not out yet for the second quarter), and the reduction in share count also boosts EPS growth.  Currency translation gains will be less of a factor this quarter due to the rebound in the dollar.
"
1588,BBY,"However, the strong overseas demand that the previously very weak dollar stimulated will still prove to be a boost to the earnings of many firms.  The delay is because in the third quarter they will be shipping goods ordered previously.  Given both the rebound in the dollar and the very significant economic slowdown abroad, look for the export boom to fade in the fourth quarter and into 2009.

This ratio simply divides the total number of positive estimate revisions by the total number of estimate cuts. Thus, a high ratio is a bullish indicator and a low ratio is bearish.
"
1604,BBY,"For the S&P 500 as a whole, a number below 0.80 or above 1.25 is generally significant.  With smaller totals for any given sector than the S&P 500 over all, the ratio should be farther away from 1.0 to be truly significant.  However, for the sake of consistency, we refer to readings above 1.25 as being in positive territory and below 0.80 as being in negative territory.

"
1638,BBY,"As I write this on Friday afternoon, there is a possibility of major events impacting how stocks trade on Monday, Sep 15.
"
1639,BBY,"The first is Hurricane Ike. Ike is projected to make landfall late tonight or early Saturday morning between the Freeport/Lake Jackson area and Galveston as either a Category 2 or Category 3 storm. If the storm causes refineries to stay shut down for an extended period of time, oil prices could rally. Furthermore, if the wind and flood damage are significant, insurers and reinsurers could be under pressure.
"
1640,BBY,"The second is Lehman Brothers (LEH). There are rumors that a sale could be completed before the Asian markets open on Monday. The actual timing and terms may help or hurt other financial stocks.
"
1641,BBY,"(There are also rumors that J.P Morgan (JPM  -  Free Report) is close to acquiring beleaguered Washington Mutual (WM).)
"
1642,BBY,"Even in the absence of these events, I would still expect the week to be volatile.
"
1643,BBY,"The earnings calendar features reports from 12 S&P 500 members, including brokers Goldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report) and Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report). Other notable reports will come from Best Buy (BBY  -  Free Report), FedEx (FDX  -  Free Report) and Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report). In total, we have confirmed reports from over 30 companies.
"
1644,BBY,"The Fed will hold a one-day meeting on Tuesday, Sep 16. Rates should stay unchanged, though fed fund futures have recently started reflecting a higher possibility of a quarter-point cut. The odds of a cut actually occurring, however, are slim.
"
1645,BBY,"Friday, Sep 19, is a quadruple witching day. This means both option and futures contracts will expire. The combined expirations can lead to higher volume and greater fluctuations in stock prices.
"
1646,BBY,"August consumer inflation, industrial production and housing starts will be among the key economic data being released:
"
1647,BBY,"Monday: September Empire State manufacturing survey, August industrial production and capacity utilization

"
1653,BBY,"Earnings estimate revisions are not signaling a probability of positive surprises from any of the companies scheduled to report.
"
1654,BBY,"Companies That Could Issue Negative Earnings SurprisesDarden Restaurants (DRI  -  Free Report) recently warned that it expects fiscal first-quarter earnings to be between 60 and 62 cents per share. The company cited a 1.1% decline in same-store restaurant sales at its Red Lobster, Oliver Garden and LongHorn Steakhouse chains. Nearly all of the covering brokerage analysts cut their profit projections in response, causing the consensus earnings estimate to fall 14 cents to 61 cents per share. DRI has missed expectations twice during the past three quarters. Darden Restaurants is scheduled to report on Tuesday, Sep 16, after the close of trading.

"
1661,BBY,"Although we are still a few weeks away from the ""official start"" of second-quarter earnings season, there will be some notable reports during the third week of June. Five S&P 500 members are on the calendar: Adobe Systems (ADBE  -  Free Report), Best Buy (BBY  -  Free Report), FedEx (FDX  -  Free Report), Goldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report) and Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report).
"
1662,BBY,"Second-quarter earnings will be down on an aggregate basis, but up on a median company basis.
"
1663,BBY,"At the aggregate level, earnings for the S&P 500 will be down 9.6% on a bottom-up basis (compiling estimates for all 500 companies) and down 7.5% on an top-down basis (compiling estimates for the index itself). Conversely, if growth is calculated on a median company basis, which diminishes negative impact of financial companies, earnings should grow by 6.4%.
"
1664,BBY,"Nearly 60% of the companies within the S&P 500 should report a year-over-year increase in per share earnings.
"
1665,BBY,"Key economic data will include:
"
1666,BBY,"Monday: June New York Fed survey, June National Association of Homebuilders index
"

"
1674,BBY,"Recent earnings estimate revisions do suggest any of the 25 companies confirmed to report are likely to beat expectations. This said, investors may want to note that Goldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report) has topped forecasts for 11 consecutive quarters. Fiscal-second quarter, and full-year 2008 and 2009, forecasts have been falling, however, so another positive surprise is by no means guaranteed. Goldman Sachs is scheduled to report on Tuesday, June 17, before the start of trading.
"
1675,BBY,"Companies That Could Issue Negative Earnings Surprises during the Week of June 16 - 20
"
1676,BBY,"More than half of the covering brokerage analysts have slashed their fiscal second-quarter forecasts on Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report) within the past 30 days. The cuts have caused the consensus earnings estimate to fall 33 cents to 98 cents per share. The most accurate estimate is more bearish at 95 cents per share. MS has missed expectations twice during the past four quarters. Morgan Stanley is scheduled to report on Wednesday, June 18, before the start of trading.

"
1682,BBY,"April can be a volatile month for weather and I expect it also to be volatile for the equity markets. The major indexes are in a broad trading range and daily direction is being influenced by the news du jour. Given the ongoing credit crunch, sputtering economy and probable poor first-quarter earnings reports from financial companies, the most logical prediction is that investors are in for more of the same in terms of stock price movement.
"
1683,BBY,"Moving on to the week at hand, just 47 companies are scheduled to release results. This very small group will include S&P 500 members Best Buy (BBY  -  Free Report), Constellation Brands (STZ  -  Free Report), Family Dollar (FDO), Micron Technology (MU  -  Free Report) and Monsanto (MON).
"
1684,BBY,"The reason for so few reports is that first-quarter earnings season will not ""officially"" start until Apr 7, when Alcoa (AA) reports. There will be a sharp rise in the number of earnings reports starting in the second half of the month.
"
1685,BBY,"March employment numbers will be published on Friday, Apr 4. Forecasts are calling for a small increase in nonfarm payrolls. The unemployment rate could rise to 5%.
"

Citing market share gains and strong performance by Roundup and other herbicides, MON believes it will report ongoing EPS of $1.75 for the fiscal second-quarter. Brokerage analysts, who collectively had been expecting profits of $1.34 per share, quickly boosted their projections to match the company's guidance.

"
1696,BBY,"Two of the 20 covering brokerage analysts lowered their fiscal second-quarter profit expectations on Micron Technology (MU  -  Free Report) during the past seven days. The cuts likely reflect concerns about a lack of pricing power. The consensus earnings estimate calls for a loss of 35 cents per, one cent worse than a week ago. The most accurate estimate is more bearish at a loss 43 cents per share. The semiconductor company has missed expectations three times during the past four quarters. Micron is scheduled to report on Wednesday, Apr 2, after the close of trading.

1702,BBY,"The New Year Shift
"
1703,BBY,"With the new year, we turn our attention to 2008 and 2009 from 2007 and 200 and the tables will be significantly different from those of weeks past. In our system, the fiscal year is determined on if the year has been completed, not if it has been reported. Thus 2007 is now FY(0) and 2008 is now FY(1).
"
1704,BBY,"The total number of estimates for 2009 is still thin, and the number of estimate revisions is even thinner. Thus, dont put too much emphasis on the 2009 data yet. Also realize that the changes in growth rates you will see over the coming weeks will be as much a reflection of new estimates being added as changes in existing estimates.
"
1705,BBY,"Earnings Scorecard and Median Growth Rates
"
1706,BBY,"The fourth-quarter earnings season is off to a mixed start. Positive surprises are out numbering disappointments by just over 2:1, which is a little bit behind the normal 3:1 margin. The median surprise is a healthy 3.36%. The median year-over-year growth rate is 6.98%, which is well behind the double-digit median growth rates we have been accustom to for the last five years.
"
1707,BBY,"It is still very early, with less than 5.0% of firms reporting, and the sample of fourth-quarter earnings is hardly representative. Five sectors have yet to have any firms report.
"
1708,BBY,"Among those that do have reports in, Tech looks terrific with median year-over-year growth of 29.7%. That number should come down significantly as the reporting season wears on as the remaining firms have a median expected growth rate of 14.3%. Still, that sort of growth is better than a sharp stick in the eye, and should be good enough for silver in the median year-over-year growth race. On the other hand, the Financials would probably prefer the sharp stick in the eye. The median earnings growth is -141.5%, indicating that more than half the reporting firms have moved from positive earnings in a year ago to a loss this year. That number should get better as reporting season continues, but is still likely to be anemic at best when all is said and done. The median expected year-over-year growth for the remaining firms in the sector is just 2.7%, and the estimates are falling fast.
"
1709,BBY,"Energy should be the top performing sector on a median growth rate basis with 19.0% growth anticipated. Tech and Industrials are predicted to take the silver and bronze with growth rates of 14.3% and 13.5%, respectively. Utilities and Health Care should make it over the double-digit threshold as well with 12.8% and 10.8% growth, respectively. Materials, Telecom and Consumer Discretionary are expected to be the weakest on a median growth rate basis.

"
1711,BBY,"On a total net income basis, the fourth quarter can be summed up in a single word: UGLY. Total net income reported so far is 18.2% below year ago levels. However it very much looks like a tale of two markets, with Tech doing well and Financials doing awful. The Financials total net income is 38.0% below year ago levels, and based on the expectations of the yet to report firms (-55.4%), should deteriorate further. Telecom will lead the pack but that is artificially boosted by the AT&T/Bell South merger a year ago.
"
1712,BBY,"Technology total income should come down slightly from the 22.9% growth reported so far, based on the 19.8% growth expected for those yet to report. Energy and Health Care dont have any firms which have reported yet, but should turn in double-digit total net income growth performances of 14.9% and 11.4%, respectively.
"
1713,BBY,"While at first glance, looking at the yet to be reported group (the vast majority of firms), a decline of 8.5% in total earnings looks bleak, keep in mind just how concentrated the declines are. If just Financials are excluded, expected total net income growth jumps to positive growth of 7.2%. Given the importance of the Financials to both the market and to the overall economy, that may be a little akin to asking: ""Aside from that Mrs. Lincoln, how did you like the play,"" but it does help put things into perspective. If one goes one step further and excludes the Consumer Discretionary sector, which is being hammered by some of the effects of the consumer credit crunch and a very promotional Christmas season, the overall growth rate in total net income jumps to the double digits at 10.8%. Looking forward to the first quarter, many of the same trends are in place, albeit in a more muted fashion with significant weakness expected among the Financials and the Discretionary firms and significant strength in Technology and Energy.

"
1715,BBY,"To help gauge the direction of the market, we take note of what analysts are thinking. By tallying their EPS changes, we can determine our revisions ratio. This ratio simply divides the total number of positive estimate revisions by the total number of estimate cuts. Thus, a high ratio is a bullish indicator and a low ratio is bearish. For the S&P 500 as a whole, a number below 0.80 or above 1.25 is generally significant. For individual sectors the distance from 1.0 should be greater for the numbers to be significant.
"
1716,BBY,"The revisions ratio for 2008 is 0.56, indicating nearly two estimate cuts for every increase. The total number of revisions over the last four weeks was slightly lower than it was last week (three weeks of overlap) largely due to the holidays. As earnings season gets into full swing over the next few weeks the totals will climb significantly from current levels.
"
1717,BBY,"By far the sector that is faring the worst is the Financials where cuts outnumber increases by almost 10:1. In fact, the Financial sector accounts for 47% of all the estimate cuts for 2008. Put another way, the revisions ratio for the rest of the S&P 500 is 0.95, which is very much in the neutral range.
"
1718,BBY,"The revisions ratios for the Materials and Utilities sectors were also ugly at 0.24 and 0.30 respectively, however the total number of revisions for those two sectors was very light, which means that the picture is not quite as bleak as it appears at first glance.
"
1719,BBY,"The Consumer Discretionary sector was also weak with almost two cuts for every increase, and that on a much more robust total number of estimate revisions. Just three firms, AutoZone (AZO  -  Free Report), Best Buy (BBY  -  Free Report) and McDonald's (MCD  -  Free Report) accounted for 41% of all upward revisions in the sector however. Note that the ratio of firms with rising estimates to falling estimates confirms the weak numbers for the sectors with weak revisions ratios.
"
1720,BBY,"Only two sectors were showing substantial strength, Energy and Staples. Both had a reasonably robust total number of revisions.  The reason for the strength in Energy is clear enough: $100/barrel. For Staples it appears that much of the strength comes from the grocery stores where higher food prices are helping profitability.

"
1722,BBY,"The first peak at 2009 revisions shows that analysts are already revising their estimates downward on balance for the year, although not at the same rate they are doing so for 2008. As with 2008, Energy and the defensive Health Care and Staples sectors are doing well while the picture for the Financials looks bleak. However, the total number of revisions for the whole S&P 500 for 2009 is just 600 (250 up and 350 down) and the numbers for some of the individual sectors are very light. If this holds up, the go heavy on Energy and light on Financials play that was so profitable in 2007 looks like it will work again in 2008.

"
1724,BBY,"When making investment decisions, growth should always be looked at in conjunction with how much you are paying for a stock. Thus, it makes sense to look at the total earnings expected for a sector, relative to that sectors total market capitalization. This is basically a variation on looking at the P/E.
"
1725,BBY,"The chart below shows the share of total earnings for 2007, 2008 and 2009, as well as the share of total market capitalization for each sector (the final bar shown). Since the S&P 500 is a market cap weighted index, this is the same as its index weight. On the chart below, the difference between the sizes of the first three bars shows if a sector is gaining or losing earnings share. The difference between the final bar and the first three bars shows if the sector is selling for an above or below market P/E. If the final bar is smaller than the other bars, the sector is selling for a below market P/E. However, as opposed to just showing the sector P/Es, it also shows the relative importance of the sectors to the overall index.
"
1726,BBY,"Despite their current problems, the Financials still have a very significant influence on the market, accounting for a much larger slice of the earnings in each year than any other sector. Even with all the disasters in the sector, for 2007, the Financials will account for 22.7% of the total net income for the S&P 500. However, in recent years the sector has accounted for well over a quarter of all earnings. Thus even though the sector is the cheapest on a P/E basis, it is still the second largest overall influence on the market. For many years it was clearly the dominate factor in the overall market. Just within the last moth it lost that spot to the Tech sector. Based on 2007 earnings, the Financials have a P/E of only 12.5x and based on 2008, only 10.4x. However given the pace of estimate cuts in the sector, the true P/E is probably higher since the actual earnings will be significantly lower.
"
1727,BBY,"Energy is the second largest sector based on total earnings, both for 2007 (15.6%) or 2008 (15.2%), but is a fairly distant third when it comes to total market capitalization (and thus weight in the index) at 12.8%. On a P/E basis, Energy is the second cheapest sector at 13.7x for 2007 and 12.2x for 2008.
"
1728,BBY,"Much has changed during 2007, and it is likely that much will also change in 2008 as well. At the start of 2007, the Financials represented 21.9% of the S&P 500 total market capitalization and were expected to provide 26.9% of the total earnings. In other words the sector has lost 4.92% of ""market cap share"" in just one year, and 4.16% of 2007 ""earnings share"".
"
1729,BBY,"For perspective, the whole Utilities sector currently comprises just 3.53% of market capitalization and 3.30% of 2007 earnings. Energy on the other hand has seen its share of the market capitalization of the index rise 3.80% share points.
"
1730,BBY,"Clearly the Financials are a big influence on the market, comprising 17.1% of the total market capitalization of the S&P 500. The credit crunch and mortgage woes have had an effect on the sector. At the beginning of 2007, it comprised 21.9% of the market capitalization of the index. The Financials sector is relatively cheap on an earnings basis, and serves to hold the overall P/E of the index down. In other words, Financials deserve to be a big influence on the market, since they contribute 22.3% of the total expected earnings for 2007 and 23.2% of the expected earnings for 2008.  However, at the start of the year, Financials represented 26.9% of the expected earnings for 2007. The Financials are the cheapest sector in the market followed Energy on a P/E basis. However, given recent events in the credit markets there have to be serious questions about how real the earnings are for many of the firms in the sector. Given the pace of estimate cuts, look for the actual total earnings to be significantly less than is currently forecast.
"
1731,BBY,"Energy looks to be under represented in its influence on the 12.4% of the total market capitalization of the index. It is expected to contribute 15.2% of the total earnings in 2007 and 14.7% in 2008. At the beginning of the year Energy was just 9.0% of the total market capitalization of the index. Tech on the other hand represents 17.4% of the total market capitalization, but only 12.5% of the 2007, and 13.2% of the 2008 total earnings. Tech recently dethroned Financials as the biggest sector in the market, a position it has not held since the height of the dotcom bubble. Energy last held the title back in the late 1970s.
"
1732,BBY,"In more conventional terms, the Energy sector is trading for 13.6x 2007 and 12.1x 2008 earnings. The Financials are trading for 12.7x 2007 and 10.6x 2008 earnings. The S&P is trading for 16.6x and 14.3x, respectively. Tech continues to be the most expensive sector trading at 22.9x and 18.9x 2007 and 2008 earnings, respectively. Based on 2008 expectations the P/E for the overall market translates to an earnings yield of 6.9%, which is far more attractive than the 3.86% level available on a 10 year T-Note. The note however has been helped by a flight to quality. The yield on 10-year AA corporates is at 5.33%. Still, equities look much more attractive than bonds on this basis. However, keep in mind that these earning are after several years of very robust growth and corporate profits are near a record high percentage of GDP. If firms were to return to more normal levels of profitability, they would be much less attractively valued. The second chart below shows the sector P/Es ranked from lowest to highest based on estimated 2008 P/E ratios.

However, it has surpassed earnings estimates in three of the trailing four quarters with an average beat of 18.9%.Let’s see, how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.What to Expect?For the quarter under review, the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $2.03 reflecting a year-over-year increase of over 4%. Notably, the consensus mark has moved up by a couple of cents over the past 30 days. Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $14,490 million, up about 7.5% from the year-ago quarter.Factors at PlayRobust domestic and international sales are likely to drive the company’s results in the fourth quarter. Analysts surveyed by Zacks expect domestic revenues to be $13,135 million, up 6.5% year over year, while international revenues are also anticipated to increase nearly 8% to $1,235 million.Best Buy is making extensive investments to upgrade operations with special focus on developing omni-channel capabilities and strengthening partnership with vendors. Sound promotional strategies and improvement in merchandise margins along with robust expense management are likely to drive the company’s results as well. In recent quarters, the company had reported a massive gain in domestic comparable-online sales on the back of improved traffic, conversion rates and higher average order values.Further, following the successful completion of “Renew Blue” program, the company has launched a fresh strategy called “Best Buy 2020: Building the New Blue” to explore and pursue growth opportunities, cost optimization and investing in people as well as systems to drive growth. In addition, management had earlier guided fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 enterprise revenues between $14.2 billion and $14.5 billion, and a comparable sales increase of 1-3%. Best Buy had also projected adjusted earnings in the band of $1.89-$1.99 a share.However, analysts believe that an increase in investment might strain margins. Moreover, the challenging retail landscape and waning store traffic may weigh on the company’s performance.Best Buy Co., Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Best Buy Co., Inc.

1736,BBY,"Burlington Stores, Inc. (BURL  -  Free Report) is expected to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Mar 1. The question lingering in investors’ minds is, whether this retailer of branded apparel products will be able to maintain its positive earnings surprise streak in the to-be reported quarter as well.Notably, the company’s earnings have outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 16 straight quarters now, with a trailing four-quarter average of 15.2%. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review stands at $2.08, reflecting year-over-year growth of 16.9%. The consensus estimate is ahead of the company’s guided range of $2.02-$2.06 per share.Burlington Stores, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Burlington Stores, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Burlington Stores, Inc. QuoteLet’s delve deeper to find out the factors likely to have a bearing on the company’s fourth-quarter results.Factors at PlaySound Fundamentals Support Margin ExpansionBurlington Stores has made multiple changes in its business model to resonate well with the ongoing changes in the industry. Impressively, the company’s current Open-to-Buy off-price model is helping customers to get nationally branded, fashionable, high quality and fair priced products. Furthermore, it has increased vendor counts, made technological advancements, initiated better marketing approach and focused on localized assortments.These factors along with effective inventory management and cost containment efforts have helped elevate gross margin, which has shown constant improvement in the last few years. Additionally, gross margin expanded 80, 110 and 100 basis points to 40.9%, 40.7% and 42.2%, respectively, in the first, second and third quarters of fiscal 2017.Top Line Buoyed by Sturdy Comps PerformanceApart from having a robust earnings history, Burlington Stores has been doing well on the revenue front. Evidently, the company’s top line has outpaced consensus mark in five of the trailing seven quarters and also shown constant improvement over the past few quarters. Management had earlier projected total sales increase of 11-12% including 5% from the 53rd week for the fiscal fourth quarter. For the impending quarter, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $1,882 million, up nearly 11.6% year over year.Additionally, amid a competitive retail backdrop, Burlington Stores’ comparable-store sales (comps) have witnessed constant improvement over the past few years. In fact, the positive momentum continued in fiscal 2017 as well, with the first, second and third quarters witnessing a growth of 0.5%, 3.5% and 3.1%, respectively. For the final quarter, comps are envisioned to grow in the 2-3% range. Meanwhile, analysts surveyed by Zacks expect comps to increase by 2.8%.What the Zacks Model Say?Our proven model shows that Burlington Stores is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter.

1737,BBY,"Though Walmart Inc.’s (WMT  -  Free Report) e-commerce sales did not grow as fast as expected last quarter, the retail giant has ample ways to please its online and instore shoppers. Walmart has planned to make huge investments in the online space this year, while its bricks-and-mortar stores will drive grocery orders and same-day deliveries. Investment in new brands and technology should also attract customers, which will eventually help the company achieve its sales goal.The retail industry expects to see sales growth this year and continue the momentum of a strong holiday season. Higher consumer confidence, record low jobless rate and solid wage growth are expected to boost retail sales throughout the year, while the Republican tax cut will help retailers save a whopping $175 billion, per the National Retail Federation (NRF). This extra cash can be used to buy back shares, pay dividends, and execute mergers and acquisitions.With the overall trend in the retail industry remaining promising, investors should double down on the hottest retailers right away.Efforts to Please Online & Instore CustomersWalmart’s online sales rose 23% in the final quarter of 2017, lagging the previous quarter’s 50% rise. In fact, sales jumped 60% in the two periods prior to that. The decline in growth rattled investors as it implied the company is not in a position to fend off competition from Internet giant Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report). Walmart saw its steepest one-day drop in three decades on Feb 20, plummeting 10.2% (read more: Walmart’s Q4 Earnings Miss Hurts Stock, Comps Up Again).Nonetheless, Walmart has more avenues to regain the interest of online and instore customers. The company is planning to make extensive investments in e-commerce operations later this year, which will drive online sales by 40% in fiscal 2019. The retailer has already scooped up e-commerce sites like Jet.com to strengthen its online presence.Walmart has also dropped “Stores” from its corporate name, giving an impression that it intends to operate as more than a traditional store-based company. By the way, Walmart’s stores does help it gain an edge over Amazon. The retailer is planning to double the locations offering grocery delivery that should boost sales. CEO Doug McMillon in the earnings call has said that “stores are executing better, we’re innovating more, and customers are responding with higher sales and traffic.”Lest we forget, Walmart will completely revamp its website with a focus on fashion and home goods later this spring. The retailer will partner with Hudson’s Bay-owned Lord & Taylor in order to bring high-end clothing items to its website, which should bode well in the near future.  Retail Sales to Grow in 2018 The NRF has predicted retail sales growth of solid 3.8% to 4.4% this year over 2017. When it comes to online and other non-store sales, the numbers are expected to increase by 10% to 12%. Retail sales have grown a healthy 3.9% to $3.53 trillion in 2017 from 2016, as per preliminary estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau.Meanwhile, January retail sales fell unexpectedly. After all, U.S. retail sales dropped 0.3% last month largely due to a decline in motor vehicle, gasoline, food services, and home appliances sales. But, the core retail sales that show the GDP’s consumer spending segment remained unchanged, which shows that retail sales remained nearly as good as the holiday season’s strong showing (read more: Retail is Staging a Big Comeback in 2018: 5 Solid Buys).NRF President and CEO Matthew Shay further added that “with consumer confidence high, unemployment low and wages growing, there is every reason to believe that retail sales will be robust throughout the year.”Catalysts Behind the SurgeThe University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment index increased from 95.7 in January to 99.9 in February. This was the highest recorded since 2004 and the second highest since the 13-year high hit in October 2017. This reading exceeded most economists’ expectations of 95.5 to 95.7 (read more: Consumer Sentiment Soars to Record High: 5 Picks).The labor market, in the meantime, has come a long way since the Great Recession, with broad-based job gains in January. Non-farm payrolls climbed by 200,000 jobs in January after rising 160,000 last December, per the Labor Department. In fact, the economy added jobs for 88 successive months, while unemployment rate remained unchanged at a 17-year low of 4.1%.But, it was wage growth that hit the fastest pace last month in more than eight-and-a-half years. Average hourly wages increased 9 cents, or 0.3%, to $26.74. This helped the average year-on-year hourly earnings to rise to 2.9%, the highest since June 2009. Needless to say, several states have raised wages. Minimum wage has been raised in 18 states in January, which had a positive impact on 4.5 million workers, per the Economic Policy Institute (read more: Wages See Fastest Growth Since 2009: Top 5 Gainers).5 Solid PicksGiven the aforesaid positives, investing in sound retail stocks seems judicious.

1738,BBY,"Historic volatility has shaken the stock market badly and pushed it to correction territory last week, with investors fearing the end of cheap money policy era due to higher inflation, faster growth and rising budget deficits. This has raised the appeal of value investing (read: Best and Worst ETFs of Last Week).This is especially true as value stocks have strong fundamentals — earnings, dividends, book value and cash flow — that trade below their intrinsic value and are undervalued by the market. Value stocks often overreact to both positive and negative news, resulting in share price movement that does not reflect the company’s true long-term fundamentals. This creates buying opportunities in such stocks at depressed prices and shows the potential for capital appreciation when the stock finally reflects its true market price.As a result, value stocks have the potential to deliver higher returns and exhibit lower volatility compared with growth and blend counterparts. In fact, these stocks outperform the growth ones across all asset classes when considered on a long-term investment horizon. Also, value stocks are less susceptible to trending markets.The long-term fundamentals for the stocks have been bullish given accelerating global economic growth, strong corporate earnings and the euphoria surrounding the new tax legislation. Additionally, growth in the U.S. economy has been solid, buoyed by an impressive labor market, higher wages, increasing consumer spending and high consumer confidence.In particular, the biggest tax overhaul in decades is expected to provide a huge boost to the value stocks. This is because massive tax cuts will create an economic surge, boosting job growth in manufacturing and other sectors, increasing inflation and interest rates. Additionally, it would lead to higher earnings, increased buyback activities, and fatty dividends, prompting investors to rotate out of growth and into value stocks (read: Volatility ETF Crash: Important Takeaways).Given this, investors may want to consider a nice value play in the current erratic market. For them, we have presented five ETFs and stocks that will likely outperform in the coming weeks if volatility prevails.ETF PicksUsing our database, we have selected popular value ETFs that provide exposure to the broad stock market instead of a particular sector and have a Zacks ETF Rank #3 (Hold) with an expense ratio of below 0.50%.

1739,BBY,"A decent run in the U.S. stock market, sturdy retail sales data along with solid job addition in July and improvement in the manufacturing sector have lifted investors’ mood as well as highlighted the solid economic report card. These were reflected in Consumer Confidence — a key determinant of the economy’s health — that reached its second highest level in August since late 2000. As per the Conference Board data, the Consumer Confidence Index surged to 122.9 last month from July’s revised reading of 120.The rebound in oil prices from all-time lows, improving labor market and gradual recovery in the housing market signal that the economy is on a recovery mode. Per the Labor Department, the economy added 209,000 jobs in July, up from 231,000 and 145,000 in June and May, respectively, while the unemployment rate was 4.3%. These factors are favorable for retailers and definitely play a crucial role in raising buyers’ confidence. We expect this positive sentiment to translate into higher consumer spending that may help revive sales.U.S. retail sales in July recorded biggest increase this year. The Commerce Department stated that U.S. retail and food services sales in July rose 0.6% to $478.9 billion — following a revised reading of 0.3% growth registered in June. Retail sales increased 4.2% from July 2016. Sales were widespread in July, mostly led by strong demand for new autos and Internet shopping. Meanwhile, sales at non-store retailers jumped 1.3%.This latest report on retails sales unveils that consumers have significant buying power as the third quarter got underway. We note that the consumer outlays grew 2.8% in the second quarter. Consumer spending at retail outlets was off to a good start, banking on strong labor market and improved household finances. This looks favorable for retailers.Changing Retail DynamicsGiven the favorable economic indicators, the Zacks Retail-Wholesale sector holds some promise. We note that so far in the year, the sector has registered an increase of 14.9% compared with the S&P 500’s gain of roughly 9.4%. Kiplinger’s latest forecast shows that retail sales, excluding gasoline, are expected to jump 4% in 2017. The report further suggests that e-commerce sales are expected to increase 14% this year.The retail landscape has been undergoing a fundamental change, with technology playing a major role and the focus shifting to online shopping. Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report) has been in the spotlight for the last few years, as changing customer patterns made the retail industry more dependent on e-commerce.This transition in consumer shopping pattern is compelling retailers to fast adapt to the changes in the ecosystem. Retailers now have no option left but to keep pace with the changing retail scenario or get eliminated. They are now focusing more on enhancing omni-channel capabilities, optimizing store fleet and restructuring activities.Retailers are efficiently allocating a large chunk of capital toward a multi-channel growth strategy focused on improving merchandise offerings, and developing IT infrastructure to enhance the web and mobile experience of customers. Further, the retailers are renovating stores, developing fulfillment centers to enable speedy delivery, implementing an enterprise-wide inventory management system along with enhancing relationship with existing and new customers.The Children's Place, Inc. (PLCE  -  Free Report), Best Buy Co., Inc. (BBY  -  Free Report), Macy's, Inc. (M  -  Free Report), Target Corporation (TGT  -  Free Report), Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.

1740,BBY,"On Tuesday, shares of electronics and appliance retailer Best Buy Co. (BBY  -  Free Report) are plummeting, down about 11% in morning trading after the company reported its latest quarterly earnings results.Interestingly, Best Buy posted strong results across the board. Earnings of 69 cents per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 63 cents per share and grew 21% from the prior-year period; net income was $209 million. Revenues came in at $8.94 billion, also beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $8.66 billion.Same-store sales, in particular, rose 5.4% year-over-year, much better than the expected 2.2% growth. Online comparable sales surged roughly 31% compared to the growth rate of 23.7% seen a year ago, thanks to faster shipping, improvements to its online checkout process, and enhanced search functionality attracted more customers.Comps were also driven by heightened consumer demand for technology, especially wearable devices, laptops, and gaming consoles.However, CEO Hubert Joly does not think his company’s current mid-single digit rise in comparable sales would continue, saying on a call with analysts these same-store sales results “did not represent a new normal.”These remarks, in turn, have raised concerns about whether or not Best Buy’s recent turnaround is as maintainable as it seems, worry seen in BBY’s performance today.This turnaround included strategies like closing underperforming stores, matching Amazon’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) prices, and improving customer service. Best Buy was able to reinvigorate declining sales and profits, and is one of the only electronics companies that can say it has beaten analyst estimates in six of the past eight quarters, while its competitors hhgregg and RadioShack have gone bankrupt.Best Buy now expects full year revenue to rise about 4% compared to earlier guidance that of only a 2.5% increase. The consumer electronics retailer also expects income growth of 4% to 9%, higher than its previous forecast of 3.5% to 8.5% growth.Best Buy In-DepthSince the start of 2017, shares of Best Buy have gained over 46%, and in the past one year, the electronics retailer stock is up over 60%. BBY is currently a #2 (Buy) on the Zacks Rank, with a VGM score of ‘A.’ The company is in a high-performing industry as well, and Retail-Consumer Electronics has returned over 39% year-to-date, sitting in the top 5% of all 265 industries ranked on the Zacks Industry Rank.Its P/E of 16.04 falls in-line with its industry’s, though Best Buy still trades below the S&P 500. However, if you look at the company’s performance over the last three years, you’ll see not only see Best Buy’s turnaround start taking effect, but you’ll also notice its valuation slowly begin to rise as a result.While investor sentiment rightfully took a downturn in the wake of Mr. Joly’s statement, Best Buy is still one of the more expensive retail stocks out there. This higher valuation, though, is because the company is doing something right. Because of its niche inventory and dedication to customer needs, i.e. fast shipping and installation services, Best Buy has been able to compete with Amazon where others have failed.Zacks' 10-Minute Stock-Picking SecretSince 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year. With compounding, rebalancing, and exclusive of fees, it can turn thousands into millions of dollars.But here's something even more remarkable: You can master this proven system without going to a single class or seminar. And then you can apply it to your portfolio in as little as 10 minutes a month. Learn the secret >>

1741,BBY,"Kirkland's Inc. (KIRK  -  Free Report) is slated to report second-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Aug 22, before the market opens. We note that the company’s earnings have missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing four quarters, with an average miss of 16.8%.With this in mind, let’s look into some factors that are likely to impact second-quarter results of this specialty retailer of home decor products.What Does the Zacks Model Unveil?Our proven model does not show that Kirkland's is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) as well as a positive Earnings ESP for this to happen. You may uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Kirkland's has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% as both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at a loss of 28 cents. The company carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, its ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult.Which Way are Estimates Treading?A look into estimate revisions give us an idea of what analysts are thinking about the company right before earnings release. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the second quarter as well as for fiscal 2017 has remained stable over the past 30 days. Estimated loss of 28 cents for the second quarter depicts a year-over-year decline of 28.8%. Estimated earnings of 53 cents for fiscal 2017 also depict a year-over-year decrease of 21.6%.Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $126.4 million for the second quarter which depicts a growth of 2.8% from the prior-year period. The same for fiscal 2017 are expected to be $621.1 million, up 4.5% from the previous year.Kirkland's, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Kirkland's, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Kirkland's, Inc. QuoteFactors Impacting the Quarter Kirkland's has been struggling with higher operating expenses for several quarters now, primarily due to an increase in store occupancy costs. The higher costs also resulted from increased shipping, higher store payroll and benefits expenses. Planned increases in advertising costs and packaging expenses have also pressurized margins in the past few quarters. E-Commerce related operating expenses also add to the expenses.Kirkland’s has been experiencing low traffic over the past few quarters and expects the trend to persist in fiscal 2017 as well. Lower traffic due to tough retail environment has also resulted in lesser comps. Including online sales, comps declined 3.8% in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. Further a difficult consumer spending environment also poses concerns in Kirkland’s’ top-line growth.Such headwinds are well reflected in the company’s share price performance. The stock has plunged 22.1% over the past six months against the industry’s increase of 12.4%.In an effort  to reduce costs and induce efficiency, Kirkland’s is closing the smaller underperforming stores in the malls and expects to open bigger off-mall stores at popular locations which are likely to boost sales. Moving ahead, the company intends to inaugurate 25 to 30 new stores and close 20 stores in fiscal 2017. Kirkland’s is also focusing on upgrading its information system to maintain growth and momentum in its e-Commerce business. The company has redesigned and leveraged the rollout of new information systems to improve online purchase and planning execution.Although the company is trying to improve its omni-channel and attract customers to its e-Commerce business, it lags when compared with stronger performers such as Amazon.com (AMZN  -  Free Report). Further, its e-Commerce and store expansion related expenses are expected to add to the ongoing trend of surged operating expenses. Though the company is taking initiatives to revive itself, we believe it will take time to show sturdy and positive results.Do Retail Stocks Interest You?

1742,BBY,"Just when you thought it was safe to focus on other things than North Korea, Kim Jong-un last night launched a missile from Pyongyang over Hokkaido, the main northernmost island of the country of Japan. It’s a clearly provocative move meant to get the attention of President Trump as much as anyone else.Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe wasted no time responding verbally: “This outrageous action of firing a missile over our country is an unprecedented, grave and serious threat that seriously damages peace and security in the region.” Abe also has called for an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council, and said he and President Trump spoke about the act for 40 minutes last night, with the president giving a strong commitment to Japan’s security.For Trump’s part, instead of speaking in front of cameras in an impromptu manner — or by releasing a series of tweets, as per his normal method of disseminating information — Trump first met with his generals — Chief of Staff Kelly and National Security Advisor McMaster — before releasing an official White House statement: “The world has received North Korea's latest message loud and clear: this regime has signaled contempt for its neighbors, for all members of the United Nations, and for minimum standards of acceptable international behavior. Threatening and destabilizing actions only increase the North Korean regime's isolation in the region and among all nations of the world. All options are on the table.”The missile itself crashed into the Pacific some 700 miles off the coast of Hokkaido, while South Korea’s response was military, sending F15K fighter jets to drop bombs on a shooting range near the border in what was described as a “military drill,” but nonetheless should serve as a stern warning to its hostile neighbor to the north. A full-scale war on the Korean peninsula would likely open up an entirely new scenario on the world stage, and it remains to be seen what China — North Korea’s main trading partner — will do about this latest development.Stock market futures are sufficiently spooked: the Dow Jones now looks to open lower by more than 100 points, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq indexes down as well. This follows a mixed day of trading yesterday, and the month of August looks as if it may be the first down month of trading in what has been a very strong 2017 overall so far. We even see gold prices climbing as a result of this conflict potentially getting worse.Even with the dorms from Hurricane Harvey continuing to wreak havoc on Southeastern Texas, this looks to be the news story to influence markets for today — and perhaps beyond.Quarterly Earnings Still Hitting the TapeZacks Rank #2 (Buy)-rated Best Buy (BBY  -  Free Report) topped Q2 earnings estimates by 6 cents to 69 cents per share, 21% higher than the year-ago quarter. Sales in the quarter of $8.94 billion rose 4.8% year over year and outperformed the Zacks consensus estimate of $8.66 billion. Fiscal year guidance was also upped, led by expected 4% growth in its Enterprise business as opposed to the 2.5% expected earlier.Shares of Best Buy initially were buoyed by this news, up 4%, before trending back into negative territory in the pre-market. Shares are now trading down almost 4%. Keep in mind this is a stock that had been up 46% year to date, so expect some of this is “sell the news.”Hain Celestial (HAIN  -  Free Report) is trading up nearly 8% this morning after also beating fiscal Q4 estimates and raising guidance. The tea and other snack brand retailer reported a 3-cent beat on the bottom line to 43 cents per share, while sales of $725 million in the quarter also beat estimates. Earnings guidance for fiscal year 2018 has been ratcheted up to a range of $1.63 - 1.80 per share, where consensus had previously been around $1.65.

1743,BBY,"Today, the phrase “Black Friday” is synonymous with the hoards of U.S. shoppers who descend upon retail businesses, shopping centers, and downtown shopping hubs in the hopes of finding the best deals on all of their holiday gifts during the one-day shopping festival.However, Black Friday has not always meant marked-down TV and toys.The history of the phrase Black Friday and where it originated is not set in stone, but research puts the basic—and relatively contemporary—timeline of the massive shopping phenomenon in simple enough order.An 1860s Gold Crisis Black Friday, as its name might suggest, originally marked an awful day for the U.S. economy. The phrase initially referred to the day the American gold market crashed on Friday, Sept. 24, 1869.As the story goes, two Wall Street financial speculators, Jim Fisk and Jay Gould, bought up as much gold as they could in hopes of driving up U.S. gold prices and selling their positions at a massive profit. The idea was simple enough, but Fisk and Gould’s run on the gold market ended up causing a substantial crash.When things got out of hand, President Grant decided to have the U.S. Treasury sell $4 million worth of gold on the next trading day. News circulated quickly, which caused Wall Street and the stock market to tumble. “Possibly no avalanche ever swept with more terrible violence,” the New York Herald later wrote of the day that would become known as Black Friday.In The BlackEarly 20th-century holiday shopping trends helped shape the modern use of the term Black Friday. The idea and phrase stems from the basic terms that businesses use to mark profitability. “Black” meant retail stores and companies were able to finally get “into the black,” or turn a profit, when shoppers began their holiday spending.Nevertheless, this is still not the real genesis of all of the Black Friday ads and deals most U.S. retail businesses run today.Upset Police The modern phrase related to this day of frenzied shopping seems to trace back to upset police officers. Starting in the 1950s, Philadelphia police began to refer to the day after Thanksgiving as “Black Friday,” and their reasoning was clear.The department came to dread the influx of suburban shoppers that flooded the city, as well as the tourists who began arriving for the Army-Navy football game, which was often played in the city. Philadelphia police officers resented the long hours and increased congestion the day after Thanksgiving brought.The phrase caught fire in the area quickly, with retail stores trying unsuccessfully to flip the phrase into a happy term meant to encourage more shoppers to come in on the days following Thanksgiving.Black Friday ShoppingStill, the official Black Friday deals that the likes of Best Buy (BBY  -  Free Report), Target (TGT  -  Free Report), Walmart (WMT  -  Free Report), Macy’s (M  -  Free Report), and almost every U.S. retailer promote did not catch on until the 1980s.There was no official start to the current trend of discounts and hype, but most place it sometime near the tail end of the 80s, when retailers found a way to rebrand the phrase into a sales-producing positive.Since the 80s, Black Friday has morphed into something insane. Deals now start on Thanksgiving Day and run all the way through Small Business Saturday/Sunday into Cyber Monday. The shopping holiday has even spread to the U.K. and places that do not celebrate Thanksgiving.However, it wasn’t until the early 2000s, after years of marketing, that Black Friday overtook the Friday before Christmas as the most popular shopping day of the year.Now, Black Friday has evolved into its own Thanksgiving shopping season that tends to help retail stocks surge during the last two weeks of November. In fact, since 2007, retail is the top U.S. equities sector during the week before and after Black Friday, according to a CNBC analysis.This year—despite a wave of pushback and an overall retail shift—the National Retail Federation estimates 164 million people will shop on Black Friday, which is up from 87 million in 2014.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time. It’s a once-in-a-generation opportunity to invest in pure genius. Click for details >>

1746,BBY,"Since we have entered the Q4 reporting cycle, looking for stocks with unswerving earnings growth is the highest priority for astute investors. And why not? If the company doesn’t make money, it won’t last over the long haul. Consider a company’s revenues over a given period of time, subtract the cost of production and you have earnings.This metric is also considered to be the most noteworthy variable in influencing the share price. Better-than-expected earnings performances normally lead to a rally in the share price. However, in addition to actual earnings, expectations of earnings play a significant role in influencing the price of a stock.Earnings Estimates Shape Share PricesWe have often seen a decline in the stock price despite earnings growth and a rally in the price following an earnings decline. This is largely a result of a company’s earnings failing to meet market expectations.Earnings estimates embody analysts’ opinions of factors such as sales growth, product demand, competitive industry environment, profit margins and cost controls. Thus, earnings estimates serve as a valuable tool while taking investment decisions. Earnings estimates also help analysts assess the cash flow to determine the fair value of a firm.As the earnings season picks up pace, investors should be on the lookout for stocks that are ready to make a big move. Hence, it is important for investors to invest in stocks that have historical earnings growth and are also seeing a rise in quarterly and annual earnings estimates.The Winning StrategyIn order to shortlist stocks that have striking earnings growth and positive estimate revisions, we have added the following parameters:Zacks Rank equal to 1 (Only Zacks' 'Strong Buys' are allowed. With the Zacks Rank proving itself to be one of the best rating systems out there, this is a great way to start things off.)

(BBY  -  Free Report) operates as a retailer of technology products, services, and solutions in the United States, Canada, and Mexico.

During the past few quarters, Target has implemented a ton of strategic business initiatives, and the impact of this new direction brought surprise positive same-store sales last quarter. Will this new direction help Target manage strong results in Q3?Also reporting this week is Walmart (WMT  -  Free Report), who has significantly stepped up its e-commerce game in an effort to compete with Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report).

Will this trend continue when the retailer releases results on Thursday?Another big name to keep an eye on is Best Buy (BBY  -  Free Report). Just a few months ago, the company held its first investor meeting in five years, outlining new goals for its next phase of growth.

1748,BBY,"Best Buy Co., Inc. (BBY  -  Free Report) is slated to report third-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Nov 16. Last quarter, the company exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 9.5%. Notably, it has surpassed earnings estimates in the trailing four quarters with an average beat of 27.2%. Let’s see, how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.What to Expect?The question lingering in investors’ minds now is whether Best Buy will be able to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at 79 cents, reflecting a year-over-year increase of nearly 27%. Notably, the consensus mark has been stable in the past 30 days. Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $9,352 million, up about 4.6% from the year-ago quarter.Factors at PlayShares of Best Buy, which have exhibited a bullish run on the bourses owing to strategic efforts, sturdy online sales growth and a solid earnings history, are likely to impress investors with solid financial numbers in the third quarter as well. The stock has gained 42.6%, outperforming the industry’s increase of 35.7% in a year.The company is making extensive investments to upgrade operations with special focus on developing omni-channel capabilities and strengthening partnership with vendors. Sound promotional strategies and improvement in merchandise margins along with robust expense management are likely to drive the company’s results. In the past few quarters, the company had reported a massive gain in online comparable sales on the back of improved traffic, conversion rates and higher average order values.Management had earlier projected third-quarter enterprise revenues in the range of $9.3-$9.4 billion and comparable sales growth of 4.5-5.5%. The company also estimated adjusted earnings in the range of 75-80 cents a share.Best Buy is also likely to spend nearly $700 million in fiscal 2018, up from the previous estimate of $650 million to boost e-commerce operations and improve supply chains to counter competition. However, analysts believe that an increase in investment may strain margins. Moreover, the challenging retail landscape and waning store traffic may weigh on the company’s performance.What the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model shows that Best Buy is likely to beat estimates this quarter as the stock has the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — for this to happen. The company has an Earnings ESP of +0.35%, which indicates a likely earnings surprise. Further combined with the company’s Zacks Rank #3, which icreases the predictive power of ESP, the chance of an earnings beat is pegged higher.

"
1751,BBY,"SIGM generated fiscal third-quarter revenues of $66.2 million, versus $25.1 million a year prior. The sharp increase was driven by greater demand for IPTV set-top boxes and Blu-ray players. (IPTV, or Internet Protocol Television, is typically provided with Video on Demand and Internet access.) Per share earnings more than doubled to 72 cents per share; the consensus estimate had called for profits of 48 cents per share.

Brokerage analysts expect companies within the S&P 1500 (S&P 500, S&P MidCap 400 and S&P SmallCap 600) to post median growth of 8.5%. Although this would be a slower pace of growth than a year ago (Q306), it is still indicative of notable increases in corporate profits. If earnings come in above expectations, it is reasonable to expect the median company within the S&P 500 to report double-digit growth.
"
1765,BBY,"There are a few reasons why profits are continuing to rise. Many companies have been able to leverage higher raw material costs into higher prices. Corporations are continuing to invest in software and equipment. The consumer, despite the rise in foreclosures, is continuing to spend. (Just yesterday, Best Buy (BBY  -  Free Report) said that demand for high definition TVs remains strong.) The weak dollar both makes exports more competitive and increases the value of profits earned abroad. Share repurchases are increasing the relative proportion of profits per share. And, most importantly, the economy is still expanding.
"
1766,BBY,"At the industry level, there are relatively few surprises as to the type of company that is likely to report strong growth and the type that is likely to report weak growth.
"
1767,BBY,"On the positive side, Aerospace appears set for another round of good reports. Air traffic has been on the rise worldwide, airlines are investing in their fleets and demand for parts remains healthy. Boeing (BA  -  Free Report) has been a beneficiary of these trends with a lengthy backlog for its new Dreamliner jet last years, even though the aircraft has yet to go on its inaugural flight. On the replacement parts side of the industry, Precision Castparts (PCP) is projected to generate a 60% increase when it reports this fall. BA and PCP are both Zacks #2 Rank (""buy"") stocks.
"
1768,BBY,"Beverage makers appear likely to generate median double-digit growth. Demand for bottled water and flavored beverages are helping to offset the traditional dependence on soda. Price increases have also helped. Pepsi Bottling Group (PBG), which topped second-quarter expectations by seven cents, is expected to report am 11% rise in third-quarter earnings. PBG is a Zacks #2 Rank stock.
"
1769,BBY,"Those food companies able to pass along higher commodity prices should also fare well. Corn Products International (CPO) reaffirmed its full-year guidance last month. Heinz (HNZ) raised its full-year guidance last month, citing good sales performance of its beans, soups, Smart Ones diet frozen meals and its Classico sauces. The company also realized a 13% increase in ketchup sales during its fiscal first-quarter. CPO is a Zacks #1 Rank (""strong buy"") stock and HNZ is a Zacks #2 Rank stock.
"
1770,BBY,"Staying with the agriculture theme for a moment, Deere & Co (DE  -  Free Report) is projected to report 27% profit growth this quarter. Those who regularly read this column will know that the push for increased use of ethanol and worldwide economic growth has created a booming agricultural economy. Prices of several food-related commodities have recently hit new highs. DE is a Zacks #1 Rank stock.
"
1771,BBY,"Tech giants Hewlett-Packard (HPQ  -  Free Report) and Cisco Systems (CSCO  -  Free Report) both pleasantly surprised their shareholders last quarter and are expected to achieve another good quarter. Strong sales of laptop computers are providing a boost to HPQ. Brokerage analysts believe the company could deliver 19% growth this quarter. Higher corporate spending and ever-growing reliance on networks should enable CSCO to generate 18% growth this quarter. Two analysts have raised their fiscal first-quarter forecasts on the company within the past month. Both HPQ and CSCO are Zacks #2 Rank stocks.
"
1772,BBY,"On the flip side, the median projected growth rate for regional banks within the S&P 1500 is 0.0%. As I discussed a couple of weeks ago, profit forecasts for many banks have been cut. Fewer mortgage originations, the ongoing credit crisis and more intense competition for deposits are all headwinds facing many financial institutions. Although yesterday's rate cut was welcome news, it is unlikely to reverse the current trends in the housing market. IndyMac (IMB), First Horizon National (FHN) and Susquehanna (SUSQ) are among those projected to post the largest drops in year-over-year earnings. IMB is a Zacks #3 Rank (""hold"") stock, SUSQ is a Zacks #4 Rank (""sell"") stocks and FHN is a Zacks #5 Rank (""strong sell"") stock.
"
1773,BBY,"The third-quarter outlook for the mega banks is only slightly more positive. The median growth rate for Bank of America (BAC  -  Free Report), Citigroup (C  -  Free Report), J.P. Morgan Chase (JPM  -  Free Report), Wachovia (WB) and Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report) is just 4.7%. WB is a Zacks #4 Rank stock, the other banks are Zacks #3 Rank stocks.
"
1774,BBY,"Eight homebuilders within the S&P 1500 have a Zacks Rank of 5. The median projected growth rate for these eight homebuilders is -138%. Despite yesterday's rally, the outlook for homebuilders is not positive.
"
1775,BBY,"The problems with the housing market are well known, but what isn't discussed as much are the headwinds facing semiconductor companies. Although demand for electronics remains very healthy, chip prices are still under pressure. The lack of pricing power hurt chip companies in the second-quarter and is remaining an issue in the third quarter. This is why the median semiconductor company is expected to report no change in profits from a year ago. Three companies, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD  -  Free Report), Adaptec (ADPT) and Micron Technology (MU  -  Free Report) are likely to report triple-digit percentage declines in earnings. These three chipmakers are Zacks #3 Rank stocks.

1779,BBY,"T-Mobile US Inc. (TMUS  -  Free Report) has unveiled its first branded smartphone, the REVVL, and is promoting more models on its JUMP! On Demand handset leasing programme.The phone features some basic specifications such as a 5.5-inch HD display, 2GB RAM, 32GB storage, a 13-megapixel rear-facing camera, a 5-megapixel front-facing camera, a 3,000mAh battery and a rear fingerprint sensor. The device supports Android Nougat and is available since Aug 10.Accompanying the phone’s launch, the company has also adjusted its JUMP! On Demand services. T-Mobile US is marketing it as an affordable option because it will cost only $5 a month with no down payment through the company's Jump! On Demand service, or $125 up front. T-Mobile US also debuted smart pick recommendations, which showcases affordable smartphones with high-end features and specs and will be available via JUMP! On Demand. The affordable models include ZTE ZMAX Pro, the LG Aristo, the LG K20 Plus and the Samsung Galaxy J3 Prime.Such launches combined with attractive promotional offers will lure customers from rival carriers. With increasing smartphone launches, we expect aggressive promotional offers by the company to hurt margins in the coming quarters. The marketing costs of advertisements and promotions also lead to high cash burn and heavy losses for the company.Similar EventsSprint Corp. (S  -  Free Report), the fourth largest U.S telecom operator, has signed the deal to sell the first phone from Essential. The wireless network operator will be the exclusive network carrier for the new phone Essential PH-1.

1780,BBY,"The TJX Companies, Inc. (TJX  -  Free Report) hit a 52-week low of $66.66 on Jul 24, closing at $66.90. Declining pre-tax margins, lack of exposure in the emerging markets and currency headwinds have been creating challenges for the company of late. The impact of such factors is visible on the company’s share price performance. Shares of TJX Companies have declined 15.2% in the last three months compared with the broader Retail-Wholesale sector’s gain of 3.5%.Let’s now take a closer look at some of the challenges that TJX Companies has been dealing with.Wage Hike and Higher Costs TJX Companies announced a wage hike for all full and part-time hourly U.S. store associates. The hike led to a rise in selling, general and administrative costs during the first quarter of 2018. Higher wages are expected to keep pre-tax margins under pressure for the next few quarters. In fact, it is expected to affect fiscal 2018 earnings by 2%. Further, the company expects incremental investments, additional supply chain costs and pension costs to pressurize margins in the coming quarters.Moreover, being an off-price retailer, TJX Companies cannot increase the price of its products despite rising product cost. This consequently leads to lower margins.Other Headwinds TJX remains exposed to unfavorable foreign currency translations owing to a considerable international presence. Currency headwinds dented sales by two percentage points during the first quarter of 2018. Unfavorable currency translations are expected to hurt results in the near term.Although the company is well placed internationally, it does not have any presence in developing markets which deprives the company of benefits from high growth opportunities in developing nations.Bottom-LineWe are optimistic about TJX Companies business expansion initiatives which include aggressive store opening strategies and plans to add more categories to the online shopping site. Its brand enhancing plans in the form of product innovation and marketing campaigns are also appealing. While these efforts are expected to boost store traffic, we are cautious about the challenges which may dent the company’s performance in the near term.Given the mixed pros and cons, TJX Companies currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Looking for Better Stocks in the Retail Space?

1781,BBY,"It is going to be one very busy and volatile week.
"
1782,BBY,"The main event is the September Federal Open Market Committee meeting. This is will be a one-day meeting with a statement due out around 2:15 ET. Expectations call for the Fed to cut the federal funds rate by as much as 50 basis points, though I think the cut will be 25 basis points. As important as the size of the rate cut will be, which is not guaranteed to happen, the wording in the statement will matter too. Any language judged to be overly hawkish or that signals the pace of growth is slowing too rapidly will cause some turmoil. Bluntly put, there is a lot of room for error. A ""sell on the news"" reaction to an otherwise favorable rate cut and statement is also not out of the realm of possibilities.
"
1783,BBY,"Four of the leading investment banking firms will be reporting fiscal third-quarter results. Lehman Brothers (LEH) is scheduled for Tuesday morning. Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report) will report on Wednesday. Bear Stearns (BSC) and Goldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report) will both report on Thursday. Profit forecasts have been falling for all four firms.
"
1784,BBY,"Friday is a triple witching day, meaning stock options, index options and futures contracts will all expire. Combined, these expirations can lead to increased volatility. In addition, Yom Kippur, the Jewish day of atonement, starts that evening. As a result, trading volume could taper in the afternoon and some of Friday's volatility could start on Thursday.
"
1785,BBY,"To better convey just how the busy the week is going to be, here is a day by day schedule.
"
1786,BBY,"Monday: The New York Fed's Empire State Index will be released in the morning. This is the last piece of ""up-to-the-date"" economic data released before the Fed meeting, though it is a regional survey. Two companies are scheduled to report including S&P 500 member Adobe Systems (ADBE  -  Free Report)
"
1787,BBY,"Tuesday: Lehman Brothers will report before the bell and will hold a conference call at 10 a.m. ET. August PPI will be released in the morning, giving the Fed one additional reading on inflation. The FOMC will release its statement around 2:15 (possibly, a few minutes earlier or later). In addition to Lehman, eight companies will report earnings including S&P 500 members AutoZone (AZO  -  Free Report), Best Buy (BBY  -  Free Report), Darden Restaurants (DRI  -  Free Report) and Kroger (KR  -  Free Report)
"
1788,BBY,"Wednesday: August CPI, housing starts and building permits will be released in the morning. Morgan Stanley will report as will 13 other companies, including S&P 500 fellow member General Mills (GIS  -  Free Report).
"
1789,BBY,"Thursday: Bear Stearns and Goldman Sachs will report before the start of trading. (BSC was the only major brokerage firm to miss second-quarter expectations and profit forecasts have been falling ever since.) The Conference Board's index of leading indicators and weekly initial jobless claims will be published in the morning. In addition to BSC and GS, earnings reports from 15 other companies have been confirmed including S&P 500 members ConAgra Foods (CAG  -  Free Report), Circuit City (CC), FedEx (FDX  -  Free Report), Nike (NKE  -  Free Report) and Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report).

1791,BBY,"Companies That Could Issue Positive Earnings Surprises during the Week of Sep 17 - 21General Mills recently revealed that it generated ""good sales and earnings per share gains for its fiscal 2008 first quarter"". The company guided for sales growth above its previous forecast of low single-digit growth and for earnings per share of about 81 cents per share. The majority of the covering brokerage analysts raised their forecasts in response, pushing the consensus earnings estimate five cents higher to 81 cents per share. GIS matched fiscal fourth-quarter expectations after previously topping estimates for 10 consecutive quarters. General Mills is scheduled to report on Wednesday, Sep 19, before the start of trading.

1793,BBY,"As I stated previously, forecasts for Bear Stearns have been falling ever since the company missed second-quarter expectations. During the past three months, fiscal third-quarter profit projections have plunged 35% to $2.22 per share. The most accurate estimate is even more bearish at $1.70 per share, reflecting cuts by two brokerage analysts within the past seven days. Bear Stearns is scheduled to report on Thursday, Sep 20, before the start of trading.
"
1794,BBY,"Lehman Brothers easily surpassed fiscal second-quarter expectations after coming up a penny shy during the first quarter. Profit forecasts for the fiscal third-quarter have dropped materially over the past 30 days with nine of the 14 covering brokerage analysts lowering their projections (including two within the past week). The current consensus estimate of $1.60 per share is 21 cents below the average forecast of a month ago. The most accurate estimate is more bearish at $1.47 per share. Lehman Brothers is scheduled to report on Tuesday, Sep 18, before the start of trading.

1801,BBY,"Catalysts? What catalysts?
"
1802,BBY,"Anyone who wants for a reason for the markets to move in one direction or another during the week of June 18 is going to be disappointed. Daily market fluctuations, both here and overseas, possible comments out of Fed officials and sentiment are all the market will have to rely on. The list of scheduled events is small, few companies are providing guidance and people are taking summer vacations. Even the Stock Trader's Almanac offers nothing except to say that the week after June triple witching has been negative for the Dow during 14 out of the past 16 years.
"
1803,BBY,"To be fair, there are eight S&P 500 companies on deck as the second-quarter earnings preseason continues. The companies are Best Buy (BBY  -  Free Report), Circuit City (CC), Carnival (CCL  -  Free Report), Darden Restaurants (DRI  -  Free Report), FedEx (FDX  -  Free Report), H&R Block (HRB  -  Free Report), Jabil Circuit (JBL  -  Free Report) and Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report). None of these, however, should wield enough influence to do anything more than cause some potential intraday swings in the market. 
"
1804,BBY,"The economic calendar won't add much excitement either. May housing starts will be published on Tuesday. Thursday brings the May Leading Economic Indicators and the Philadelphia Fed's June survey.
"
1805,BBY,"Given this backdrop and lack of catalysts, interest rates could continue to play a role. The Fed's next meeting is not until June 27-28 (a two-day meeting) and although the committee should leave interest rates unchanged, the bond markets remain weak on a technical basis. Higher interest rates are a problem for the housing market and for the capital markets since they make more expensive to complete corporate deals. This is why perhaps the best catalyst for the bulls would be a large, private equity takeover - a clear sign that interest rates haven't risen too much. Of course, predicting if and when this will happen is beyond the scope of my crystal ball.

"
1807,BBY,"Companies That Could Issue Positive Earnings Surprises during the Week of June 18 - June 22Commercial Metals (CMC  -  Free Report) has had a mixed record when it comes to earnings performance. It has beat expectations and missed expectations twice over the past four quarters. A recent improvement, albeit small, in the consensus estimate suggests CMC might just report bullish fiscal third-quarter reports. A revision by one brokerage analyst pushed the quarterly consensus estimate up by one cent to 78 cents per share. The Most Recent Consensus is at 79 cents per share. Commercial Metals is scheduled to report on Wednesday, June 20, before the start of trading.
"
1808,BBY,"Gerber Scientific (GRB) recently preannounced results for its fiscal fourth quarter. The company, which makes graphics software for signs and apparel, expects to report revenues of $153 to $155 million and earnings of 22 to 26 cents per share. Both numbers were above the company's previous guidance. All of the covering brokerage analysts raised their projections in response, sending the consensus earnings estimate six cents higher to 23 cents per share. GRB has topped profit expectations for four consecutive quarters. Gerber Scientific is scheduled to report on Thursday, June 18.
"
1809,BBY,"Two brokerage analysts have raised their projections on Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report) within the past 30 days. The impact of these revisions has been to push the second-quarter earnings estimate up by a penny to $2 per share. The Most Recent Consensus is considerably more bullish at $2.09 per share. The investment banking and brokerage firm has topped expectations during each the past four quarters by an average margin of 40 cents per share. Morgan Stanley is scheduled to report on Wednesday, June 20, before the start of trading.

"
1811,BBY,"About one quarter of the covering brokerage analysts have cut their forecasts for Best Buy's (BBY  -  Free Report) fiscal first quarter. The downward revisions may reflect concerns about weaker sales of LCD televisions and higher gasoline prices. The consensus earnings estimate of 50 cents per share is a penny less than 30 days ago and two cents below the average forecast of 60 days ago. BBY has missed expectations once during the past four quarters. Best Buy is scheduled to report on Tuesday, June 19, before the start of trading.

1816,BBY,"Benchmarks turned in a mixed performance on Monday as markets digested the impact of Hurricane Harvey. Energy shares declined after the hurricane disrupted oil refineries in the coastal areas of Texas, rendering them dysfunctional. Meanwhile, the oil prices also declined, weighing further on energy shares. The tropical storm caused widespread destruction of property on the southern coast of U.S., leading to losses for commercial insurers and reinsurers. This led to a decline in shares of insurance companies such as Travelers which weighed heavily on the Dow as the blue-chip index ended in the negative territory. The S&P 500 ended in the positive territory buoyed by gains for healthcare and tech stocks. The healthcare stocks gained because of merger deals. The Nasdaq also finished in the green due to gains in tech and biotech shares.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) closed at 21,808.40, declining 0.1% or 5.27 points. The S&P 500 Index (INX) increased 1.19 points to close at 2,444.24. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite Index (IXIC) closed at 6,283.02, rising 17.37 points or 0.3%. A total of only around 5.13 billion shares were traded on Monday, lower than the last 20-session average of 6 billion shares. Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 1.14-to-1 ratio.  On the Nasdaq, decliners outnumbered advancers by a 1.02-to-1 ratio.Hurricane Harvey Weighs on Energy SharesEnergy shares were impacted after tropical Hurricane Harvey, hit the coast of Texas, rendering oil refineries in the area dysfunctional. Harvey is by far the most powerful hurricane to have hit the southern coast of U.S. in the last 50 years, delivering about 30 inches of rain in Houston and leaving it flooded over the weekend. Conditions could worsen if engineers released water from overflowing reservoirs in order to safeguard the dams.  The coast of Texas houses approximately 30% of the total refining capacity of the U.S. and Houston alone hosts 15% of the total capacity. The shutting down of major oil refineries in and around Houston has impacted almost 15% of the nation’s total refining capacity. Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM  -  Free Report) closed its Baytown refinery and Dutch Shell  shut its Deer Park facility after the storm pummeled Texas. This disruption led to a decline in the energy shares. The Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLE) was down 0.5%. Shares of Exxon, Chevron Corp. (CVX  -  Free Report) and Chesapeake Energy (CHK  -  Free Report) declined 0.4%, 0.4% and 3.7% respectively due to shutdown of refining operations.Oil prices also declined on Monday. West Texas Immediate oil futures dipped 2.7% to $46.57 a barrel. Also, United States Oil Fund plummeted 2.3%. Economists said that it would take weeks before the refineries became fully functional and therefore the demand for oil by refineries would be low. This led to a decline in West Texas oil futures. Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement announced on Sunday that a total of 331,370 barrels a day equivalent of crude-oil production was affected after the hurricane’s landfall.Insurance Sector Battered by HarveyInsurance stocks also declined after the destruction caused by Harvey. Current estimates place the estimated damage at around $30 billion and analysts expect it to be one of the costliest storms in the history of the U.S. In case of such natural calamities, insurance shares are sent lower due to high number of claim payouts.As a result, shares of top American insurance companies like Travelers Companies Inc. (TRV  -  Free Report), Allstate Corp (ALL  -  Free Report) and Progressive Corp (PGR  -  Free Report) all declined 2.5%, 1.4% and 2.2% on Monday.  The SPDR S&P Insurance exchange-traded fund (KIE) dipped almost 1%, posting its worst day since April 28, 2017. Declining shares of Travelers weighed the heaviest on the Dow.Stocks That Made HeadlinesMotorola Solutions Closes Kodiak Buyout, Expands PortfolioMotorola Solutions (MSI  -  Free Report) completed the acquisition of the privately held Kodiak Networks in a bid to broaden its software product portfolio.(Read More)Abercrombie Further Expands Footprint in the Middle EastAmid a highly challenging retail landscape, Abercrombie & Fitch Co. (ANF  -  Free Report) continues to strengthen its footprint, which in turn, boosts its overall performance in second-quarter fiscal 2017 results.

1817,BBY,"A week out from Super Bowl LII in Minneapolis, with much of the football world beginning to descend upon Minnesota, businesses around the Twin Cities hope to experience an economic boost.Estimates regarding the economic impact of hosting a Super Bowl vary widely. But after Minneapolis was awarded the big game, which is set to be held in the new $1.13 billion U.S. Bank Stadium, Minnesota Gov. Mark Dayton proclaimed that the 10-day event would lead to a $500 million win for the state.A more updated impact forecast from the Minnesota Super Bowl Host Committee notes that the game will generate more than $400 million and attract more than one million visitors. Still, even if these lofty monetary goals aren’t met, some major companies poured money into the committee’s efforts to bring the Super Bowl back to Minneapolis.These companies include 3M (MMM  -  Free Report), U.S. Bank (USB  -  Free Report), Best Buy (BBY  -  Free Report), and an array of other publicly traded firms that pledged to help stir up economic growth as part of Minnesota’s “Bold North” push.With that said, let’s take a look at three great stocks from Minnesota-based companies that helped bring Super Bowl LII to Minneapolis.1.       Polaris Industries Inc. (PII  -  Free Report)This Medina, Minnesota-headquartered maker of off-road recreational vehicles instantly conjures up pictures of rugged northern landscapes. Polaris is also one of Minnesota’s biggest companies and has facilities located throughout the state. To help keep all the Super Bowl festivities safe, Polaris provided the Super Bowl Law Enforcement Team with a fleet of Polaris Rangers. On top of that, Polaris is set to sponsor snowmobiler Levi LaVallee’s backflip attempt over Nicollet Mall the night before the big game.Polaris is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and sports “A” grades for both Growth and Momentum in our Style Scores system.2.       Target Corporation (TGT  -  Free Report)Minneapolis-based Target is an active part of the Twin Cities community, with a substantial presence in the professional sports world. Target currently owns the naming rights to the Minnesota Twins’ ballpark, and the NBA’s Minnesota Timberwolves play their home games at the Target Center. And aside from selling TVs, party favors, and Super Bowl LII gear, Target hopes the culmination of the NFL season shines a positive long-term light on the city it calls home.Target is currently a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and boasts an overall “B” VGM score.3.       H.B. Fuller Company (FUL  -  Free Report)This adhesive technology giant’s world headquarters are located in St. Paul. H.B. Fuller is also an official member of the Minnesota Super Bowl Host Committee. The company recently published a post titled “Uncovering Adhesives at a Football Game,” touting all the ways its adhesives help move America’s favorite sport along. H.B.’s adhesives, sealants, and other specialty chemical products are currently used in and on uniforms, helmet decals, concessions, jumbotrons, stadiums, locker rooms, and more, throughout many different levels of football.FUL is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and rocks an “A” grade for Value to help it earn an overall “B” VGM grade.Zacks Top 10 Stocks for 2018In addition to the stocks discussed above, would you like to know about our 10 finest buy-and-hold tickers for the entirety of 2018?Last year's 2017 Zacks Top 10 Stocks portfolio produced double-digit winners, including FMC Corp. and VMware which racked up stellar gains of +67.9% and +61%.

1818,BBY,"Many have lauded the recent opening of Amazon.com’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) eight brick-and-mortar stores in the U.S. as a death blow to independent bookstores. Since its launch in 1995 as an online retailer of books, Amazon has been blamed for the closing of bookstores nationwide because thanks to its wide-selection and low prices.In an act of irony, the online retail giant has decided that its next step in its massive growth is to open brick-and-mortar bookstores where consumers can buy products in person. Amazon opened its first physical bookstore in 2015 in Seattle and has since opened seven more, including one in Chicago’s Southport Corridor this past March.As an avid book reader, and a lover of independent bookstores, I had my trepidations about visiting the new Amazon Books in Chicago. To see what kind of competition Amazon Books poses for bookstores in the Second City, I decided to head up to the Lakeview neighborhood and witness this new phenomenon for myself.The Amazon Books ExperienceAs the first Amazon Books in the Midwest, the Amazon Bookstore is a blend of a bookstore, electronics store, and a coffee shop. The bookstore was sleek and modern, but it felt impersonal—like an airport gift shop. In some ways, the store felt like the Amazon website had come to life.Jennifer Cast, a vice president at Amazon Books, said that Amazon wanted to embrace its roots as a bookseller with these new stores. “We also realized we had an opportunity to create a new kind of store and create a different experience in a physical world. Our special sauce is knowing the reading habits and passions of a city through our Amazon.com data,” Cast said.One Amazon Books innovation is the decision to display every book with its cover facing outward. As a result, their covers are always on display, with special lighting encasing each title. This strategy makes the books eye-catching, although it means that the store can’t have as many books on its shelves. Each book is displayed with an Amazon customer review beneath it so consumers can read for themselves what others thought, just as they would online. The store also includes the number of ratings and the average stars each book has obtained online.The books chosen to be sold in the store are based on algorithms and analytics. They also must have at least a 4 star (out of 5) rating on Amazon’s website. Many of the books available for purchase are chosen from Amazon.com best-sellers list, book-buying trends, and online ratings, with some input from a curation team.The books are organized by the common literature genres, but the store also has special categories meant to appeal to Amazon customers. One of my favorite shelves was “Page Turners: Books Kindle Readers Finish in 3 Days or Less.”A Prime WonderlandThe most important feature about Amazon Books wasn’t the books, but the company’s Prime membership.The store clearly made the shopping experience worthwhile for anyone that currently subscribes to a Prime membership for $99-a-year. Throughout the store, price check machines stood ready. When I tried one book, it showed me the difference in price based on whether I had a Prime account or not.A Prime member could also obtain exclusive Amazon Prime Day deals at store locations. This year, Amazon had its most successful Prime Day yet. At its eight bookstores, it offered special deals on Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report) Xbox Ones, Joule Sous Vide Precision Cookers, Osmo Genius Kits, and Philips Smart LED bulbs.The store also served as a testing-ground for the variety of devices Amazon now manufactures. Beyond the Kindle, one can try the Fire Tablet, Fire TV, the Echo, and Echo Dot.Many people go to Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) stores and Best Buy (BBY  -  Free Report) in order to test out new technology before making expensive purchases. With this new testing site, Amazon is clearly trying to encourage consumers to commit to its voice-activated, Alexa-enabled devices that can play music, control home devices, make phone calls, and more.A few workers constantly roamed the store and offered to help me try out the devices as I looked at them. The store also offers “Flash Course,” 5-7 minute tutorials on how to use the technology, every Friday through Sunday.The Bottom Line for Booksellers and RetailersWhile these stores certainly have a lot to offer, their biggest appeal is their novelty. As I sat by the window drinking my Stumptown coffee, I saw at least one other person stop and take a photo—just as I had done before entering the store.And if anyone should be worried about new Amazon bookstore, it won’t be indie booksellers.Readers who are willing and able to pay for the price and experience of independent bookstores will continue to do so. Chicago favorites, like Women and Children First in Andersonville and Myopic Books in Wicker Park, won’t be going anywhere anytime soon. At least, not because of Amazon’s physical bookstores. The companies that stand the most to lose are big retailers like Barnes & Noble . While Barnes & Noble offers a good membership program for $25 a year (which includes free shipping, over $50 in coupons, and member-exclusive deals), this subscription seems unnecessary if one already pays for Prime.So while I won’t stop going to independent bookstores any time soon, the convenience and deals available through Amazon could convince me, and many others, to switch my periodic purchases from Barnes & Noble to Amazon Books.But it’s hard to picture Amazon sticking to just bookstores. With its recent acquisition of Whole Foods Market , Amazon seems to be moving into brick-and-mortar territory for the long term.Amazon also launched a mobile payment feature called Amazon Pay Places this week. Like it or not, Amazon is well on its way to being a part of nearly every purchase we make.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.

1826,BBY,"Earlier this week, Circuit City (CC) projected that fiscal 2007 domestic same-stores sales growth likely came in at 6% versus previous guidance for 7% to 8% growth. One-third of the 21 covering analysts promptly cut their forecasts for fourth-quarter earnings in response, causing the consensus estimate to fall two cents to 64 cents per share.

1833,BBY,"3. SCREEN OF THE WEEKBack to topZacks created the first and best screening system on the web and that`s what earned us the distinction as the ""#1 site for screening stocks"" by Money Magazine.  Discover 2 excellent screening tools perfectly suited for individual investors.* Free Stock Screener on Zacks.com: http://screening.zacks.com.* Research Wizard with backtesting: http://researchwiz.zacks.com.Each week Kevin Matras, of Zacks Investment Research, will share with you another screen he has discovered that has created winning results. Here are his latest findings:Increasing P/Es for Stocks on the MoveStudies have shown that the best stocks over the past decade saw their P/E ratios increase by more than 100% from their breakout point. The good news is that you can use screening tools to catch these stocks early in their breakout cycle and ride them for substantial gains.Heres an example to explain this scenario. Say a stock price is at $20 and its earnings over the last 4 quarters = $1 per share. Then its P/E ratio will be 20. ($20 divided by $1 = 20)If the earnings rise (to $1.25 for instance) and the stock doesn`t, the P/E ratio will fall. ($20 divided by $1.25 = 16)If the stock rises and its earnings stay the same, the P/E ratio will increase. If the stock is at $30 and its earnings remain at $1, ... the P/E will have increased to 30 as well. ($30 divided by $1 = 30)But now let`s say next quarter earnings come out and its 4 quarter combined numbers show the EPS at $1.25 and the stock has also increased to $30. The P/E ratio will now be 24. ($30 divided by $1.25 = 24  -- a 20% increase in its P/E ratio)The interesting dynamic is that as earnings increase, so should prices. And as forecasts for continued earnings arrive, the demand for the stock should continue to send prices even higher.So basically, if the price is rising, usually that implies a strengthening fundamental outlook. And if there`s a strengthening fundamental outlook, that usually leads to higher prices.This increase in price and earnings is an ideal way to spot stocks in favor and that are anticipated to continue to trend higher. And instead of looking for nominal P/E changes, screen for P/E increases in excess of 20%, which should provide the greatest upside potential.Just like a 20% increase in the price of a stock can alert you to a new potential uptrend, you can also use a 20% increase in the P/E ratio to alert you to potentially significant price and earnings events too.So in this Screen of the Week Im looking for current P/E`s that are at least 20% higher than their P/Es from 3 months ago (but not greater than 100% higher). They had to be trading at $10 or higher three months ago with a minimum daily volume of at least 100,000 shares traded.I also want to see a 20% increase in the most recently reported Quarterly Earnings (recent over last) and an increase in the Quarter`s Earnings before that (last over previous).And for good measure, I want last year`s EPS growth to be greater than the previous year, along with projections for this year`s growth to be greater than last.Currently, there are 15 companies that meet this criteria, with many looking poised to breakout even higher, like:BBY   Best Buy

1840,BBY,"Tuesday, August 29th, 2017Just when you thought it was safe to focus on other things than North Korea, Kim Jong-un last night launched a missile from Pyongyang over Hokkaido, the main northernmost island of the country of Japan. It’s a clearly provocative move meant to get the attention of President Trump as much as anyone else.Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe wasted no time responding verbally: “This outrageous action of firing a missile over our country is an unprecedented, grave and serious threat that seriously damages peace and security in the region.” Abe also has called for an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council, and said he and President Trump spoke about the act for 40 minutes last night, with the president giving a strong commitment to Japan’s security.For Trump’s part, instead of speaking in front of cameras in an impromptu manner — or by releasing a series of tweets, as per his normal method of disseminating information — Trump first met with his generals — Chief of Staff Kelly and National Security Advisor McMaster — before releasing an official White House statement: “The world has received North Korea's latest message loud and clear: this regime has signaled contempt for its neighbors, for all members of the United Nations, and for minimum standards of acceptable international behavior. Threatening and destabilizing actions only increase the North Korean regime's isolation in the region and among all nations of the world. All options are on the table.”The missile itself crashed into the Pacific some 700 miles off the coast of Hokkaido, while South Korea’s response was military, sending F15K fighter jets to drop bombs on a shooting range near the border in what was described as a “military drill,” but nonetheless should serve as a stern warning to its hostile neighbor to the north. A full-scale war on the Korean peninsula would likely open up an entirely new scenario on the world stage, and it remains to be seen what China — North Korea’s main trading partner — will do about this latest development.Stock market futures are sufficiently spooked: the Dow Jones now looks to open lower by more than 100 points, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq indexes down as well. This follows a mixed day of trading yesterday, and the month of August looks as if it may be the first down month of trading in what has been a very strong 2017 overall so far. We even see gold prices climbing as a result of this conflict potentially getting worse.Even with the dorms from Hurricane Harvey continuing to wreak havoc on Southeastern Texas, this looks to be the news story to influence markets for today — and perhaps beyond.Quarterly Earnings Still Hitting the TapeZacks Rank #2 (Buy)-rated Best Buy (BBY  -  Free Report) topped Q2 earnings estimates by 6 cents to 69 cents per share, 21% higher than the year-ago quarter. Sales in the quarter of $8.94 billion rose 4.8% year over year and outperformed the Zacks consensus estimate of $8.66 billion. Fiscal year guidance was also upped, led by expected 4% growth in its Enterprise business as opposed to the 2.5% expected earlier.Shares of Best Buy initially were buoyed by this news, up 4%, before trending back into negative territory in the pre-market. Shares are now trading down almost 4%. Keep in mind this is a stock that had been up 46% year to date, so expect some of this is “sell the news.”Hain Celestial (HAIN  -  Free Report) is trading up nearly 8% this morning after also beating fiscal Q4 estimates and raising guidance. The tea and other snack brand retailer reported a 3-cent beat on the bottom line to 43 cents per share, while sales of $725 million in the quarter also beat estimates. Earnings guidance for fiscal year 2018 has been ratcheted up to a range of $1.63 - 1.80 per share, where consensus had previously been around $1.65.Mark VickerySenior EditorQuestions or comments about this article and/or its author?

1844,BBY,"As summer vacation is coming to a close, it’s time for students to head back to colleges and schools. This time around, however, back-to-college and back-to-school spending is expected to reach record-high levels as more students are expected to join institutions, and most notably, consumers are regaining confidence. The increased confidence can be attributed to an improving economy and healthy labor market.As spending levels are poised to scale record highs, retailers have been witnessing an uptick in sales. Retail stocks are already moving north in a relief rally as second-quarter earnings came in better than expected. Given such bullish trends, investing in sound retail stocks seems to be prudent.Back-to-College Season: A Big Event on the HorizonAccording to the National Retail Federation’s (NRF) annual survey, back-to-college spending is expected to surpass $54 billion. This figure had bottomed out in 2015, declining 19% from the peak reached in 2012. But since then, spending has increased 25%.Deciding to send your child to college will be one of the most expensive financial decisions a family will make, and back-to-college costs--think dorm room necessities and textbooks, for instance--add up. Families are expected to spend an average of $969.88 this year, compared with $888.72 last year.College students expect to spend mostly on electronics, with costs poised to hit $12.8 billion. Back-to-college spending will also impact a wide variety of other industries, including clothing and snacks and food items, while online, discount, and department stores are pegged to be top shopping destinations for families.Overall, back-to-school spending is expected to rise to its second highest level on record. Families with children in elementary through high school plan to spend a total of $29.5 billion, up from $27.3 billion last year. Parents are expected to spend an average of $204.33, $238.89, $130.38 and $114.12 on electronics, apparel, shoes and school supplies, respectively. In fact, it is shoes and school supplies that are expected to see the highest increase.And this year, the combined back-to-college and back-to-school spending is anticipated to touch $83.6 billion. This will be the second biggest haul after $83.8 billion. Spending is likely to rise on pent-up demand following the prolonged recession when parents curtailed purchases.What’s Behind the Upbeat Projections?College enrollments have jumped this year, as students are more likely to live in off-campus housing, according to Katherine Cullen, director of retail and consumer research at NRF. This, in turn, will drive spending on home goods across several categories like snacks and beverages. Retail stocking stuffers, from Ramen noodles to futons, are well-positioned to lure these shoppers.Electronics also constitute a large portion of students’ budget, as laptops are popular among 35% of this age group, while 40% plan to buy a tablet. Needless to say, apparel, footwear and classic school supplies continue to be popular among back-to-school candidates.Not only are more young adults enrolling in colleges, thus boosting spending levels, but greater consumer confidence is also playing a significant role. And the more confident consumers are, the more they spend. As per a survey by The University of Michigan, the consumer sentiment index rose to 97.6 in August, the highest since January.Consumer sentiment returned to peak levels on a more positive outlook for the overall economy. Americans spent more in the spring driving the U.S. economy beyond the $19-trillion mark for the first time. Real gross domestic product grew at an annual rate of 2.6% in the second quarter and almost doubled the downwardly revised 1.2% pace of growth in the first quarter.Consumer sentiment was also driven by the strongest labor market in years. The United States added 16.6 million jobs since 2010, driving the unemployment rate down to nearly a 16-year low of 4.4%. In fact, the U.S. job market roared back to life in June, with a better-than-expected 222,000 job additions. Payroll in May and April was revised higher to 152,000 and 207,000, respectively.Gad Levanon, chief economist North America, for the Conference Board said that “the strong job growth in June and the upward revisions for May and April suggest that the concerns about a major slowdown in job growth were premature”. Employment gains have averaged 180,000 a month this year and several economists believe that the economy might need to add only 100,000 jobs on a regular basis to maintain growth levels.5 Retail Stocks to Rally on Back-to-College Shopping SpreeBack-to-college spending is expected to hit an all-time high, offering bright prospects for retailers and leading to a ramp up in sales. For now, retail stocks are on a rally, which is definitely encouraging amid speculations of decline in foot traffic, store closures, and bankruptcies.We have, thus, selected five fundamentally sound retailers that can make the most of the back-to-college shopping season. Such stocks flaunt a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy) and a VGM Score of A or B.

1845,BBY,"Best Buy Co., Inc. (BBY  -  Free Report) is slated to report second-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Aug 29. In the previous quarter, the company exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 50%. Notably, it has surpassed earnings estimates in the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 33.8%. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.What to Expect?The question lingering in investors’ minds now is whether Best Buy will be able to post positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is 63 cents, reflecting a year-over-year increase of nearly 11%. We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate has been stable in the past 30 days. Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $8,661 million, up about 1.5% from the year-ago quarter.Factors at PlaySound promotional strategies, improvement in merchandise margins along with robust expense management is likely to drive the Best Buy results higher in the second quarter of fiscal 2018. Moreover, the company is making extensive investments to upgrade operations with special focus on developing omni-channel capabilities and strengthening partnership with vendors.In the past few quarters, the company had reported massive gain in online comparable sales on the back of improved traffic, conversion rates and higher average order values, which is expected to boost results in the quarter to be reported.For second-quarter fiscal 2018, management anticipates Enterprise revenues between $8.6 billion and $8.7 billion, and comparable sales increase of 1.5-2.5%. Management also projects earnings in the range of 57-62 cents a share. Also in the fiscal second quarter, the company expects domestic comparable sales to rise in the range of 1.5-2.5%, while international comparable sales are projected to be in the range of flat to up 3.0%.However, the challenging retail landscape, aggressive promotional strategies and waning store traffic may hurt the stock.Best Buy Co., Inc.

QuoteWhat Does the Zacks Model Unveil?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Best Buy is likely to beat on earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. Best Buy has an Earnings ESP of -1.29%. The company’s Zacks Rank #2 increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise.

1846,BBY,"As the markets attempted to digest Apple’s (AAPL  -  Free Report) historic “Special Event,” which featured the unveiling of several new devices—including the iPhone 8 and iPhone X, investor attention quickly shifted to the other companies that could stand to benefit from sales of the new products.Of these, it seems that electronics-heavy retailers would be the most logical winners, besides Apple, in the wake of today’s event. This, of course, includes brick-and-mortar giants like Best Buy (BBY  -  Free Report), as well as e-commerce behemoths like Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report).“Anytime you have a new iPhone, typically with a high-profile launch, it drives store traffic, sales and overall interest in the consumer electronics space,” Loop Capital Markets analyst Anthony Chukumba told The Street on Thursday.And Apple certainly gave customers plenty to get excited about. First, the tech pioneer debuted the third generation of its popular wearable device, the Apple Watch Series 3. The new Apple Watch will feature built-in cellular capabilities, a 70% faster processor, and several new bands (also read: What You Need To Know About The New Apple Watch Series 3).On top of this, Apple also revealed its new Apple TV device, which will include 4K and HDR compatibility. Apple that the Apple TV 4K library will soon feature all of the 4K content from Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report) and Amazon Prime, as well as live sports streaming (also read: New Apple TV Offers Live Sports, Netflix & Amazon 4K Content Coming to iTunes).Of course, the biggest announcements today were the two new iPhone devices that Apple unveiled. In line with its typical release schedule, Apple finally revealed the full details of the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus.And as a means of celebrating the tenth anniversary of its flagship smartphone, Apple also announced the iPhone X, an even slicker version of the device that it promised was the biggest leap forward since the original iPhone (also read: Everything You Need to Know About the iPhone 8 and iPhone X).If these devices prove to be extremely popular, and they very well should be, Apple is obviously the big winner here. In fact, the speculation surrounding these releases has been a big part of AAPL’s nearly 37% year-to-date gain.However, Amazon and Best Buy could stand to receive some serious residual gains. Not only do these companies get a cut when shoppers use their platform to buy a device, but they also get the added benefit of accompanying impulse buys.For example, a shopper who decides on buying a new $999 iPhone X in a Best Buy store will likely also consider picking up a protective case or an additional pair of headphones. In the past, we’ve seen iPhone releases result in noticeable increases in electronics retail activity.Still, investors appear hesitant to start the iPhone X party too soon. Apple and Amazon shares moved into the red following the event, although Best Buy did finish an impressive 1.5% higher on Tuesday.Want more stock market analysis from this author?

1847,BBY,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put Best Buy Co., Inc. (BBY  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Best Buy has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 14.4, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 compares in at about 20.0. If we focus on the stock’s long-term PE trend, the current level puts Best Buy’s current PE ratio slightly above its midpoint (which is 13.1) over the past five years.Further, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with the sector’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 27.3. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that Best Buy has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 13.8, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for Best Buy’s stock in the near term too.P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, Best Buy has a P/S ratio of about 0.4. This is substantially lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.1 right now. Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is marginally below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.If anything, Best Buy is towards the higher end of its range in the time period from a P/S metric, which suggests that the company’s stock price has already appreciated to some degree, relative to its sales.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Best Buy currently has a Value Style Score of A, putting it into the top 20% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes BBY a solid choice for value investors.What About the Stock Overall?Though Best Buy might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name.

1848,BBY,"Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report) is leaving no stone unturned to attract holiday shoppers with great deals this year. This year, in the holiday layaway program, initiated on Sep 1, the company plans to offer more than 1,000 new toys, including more than 300 exclusive toys, to have an edge above competitors. Notably, these items were witnessing sluggish sales for quite some time owing to tough competition from videogames and YouTube videos. The company is thus planning to unveil the much awaited ""Star Wars"" Droid kit, ""Frozen""-branded sleigh and ""Paw Patrol"" lookout tower from Hatchimals and Fingerlings. Walmart anticipates demand for toys to improve this year, thanks to the Star Wars items. About 25% of the toys will be available exclusively at Wal-Mart stores and on Walmart.com.Layaway programs, which starts with 'Toy Week', allow shoppers to buy holiday merchandise like electronics and toys and pay in installments. Further customers can also enjoy the privilege of picking up products at a later date. This program helps the company to gain 15% of holiday revenues at Walmart stores in remote areas of the United States. In this year’s annual holiday season layaway program, customers can pay as low as $10 for items worth $50 and can also shop till Dec 11 at no extra fee.The holiday shopping season is crucial for retailers like Walmart, Best Buy Co. Inc. (BBY  -  Free Report), Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report) and Target Corp. (TGT  -  Free Report) and they try all means to drive footfall. Be it early-hour store openings, promotional events, free shipping on online purchases or heavy discounts, retailers try every mean to boost sales during the holiday season.Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. QuoteApart from boosting store traffic, Walmart is also trying to gain traction in the e-Commerce market and to catch up with online giant Amazon. In a recent move, the company has opened its 1,000th Online Grocery Pickup location, which enables customers to order groceries online and pick them up at their local Walmart store.Walmart’s Other Services to Take on AmazonWalmart is trying every means to develop an impressive digital brand portfolio and has been aggressively adopting a number of initiatives in this regard. Recently, it has teamed up with Alphabet Inc's Google to enter the budding voice-shopping market, following the footsteps of Amazon.In order to expand in the online grocery and delivery market, the retailer has partnered with the ride hailing service provider Uber and Lyft for speedy online grocery deliveries. Walmart now operates online grocery delivery service in six markets. The giant retailer also enables customers to order groceries online and collect them from 900 locations. Also, with Easy Reorder on walmart.com, customers can repurchase items by looking into their previous in-store and online purchases records. The company also has a dedicated back-to-school destination on walmart.com which enables customers to shop school supply lists for more than 1 million classrooms across the country.The company’s free two-day shipping service to U.S. shoppers on a minimum order of $35 and that too without a membership fee has also proved to be a success. This service replaced Walmart's existing two-day shipping program named 'Shipping Pass' that charged shoppers an annual membership fee of $49 and competed strongly with Amazon’s Prime shipping program, which charges customers $99 a year for two-day shipping with additional features like a streaming video service. In April, Walmart introduced a program wherein it offered discounts on online items, only if shoppers picked their orders from a nearby store. The discount given had an added feature to Walmart’s already existing delivery service called Walmart Pickup, which enables customers to place orders online and then pick them up from a store for free.Not only this, Walmart continues to make huge investments in e-Commerce initiatives, including acquisitions, in order to compete with brick-and-mortar stores and online retailers. The company has acquired four e-Commerce businesses (Bonobos, ShoeBuy, Moosejaw, ModCloth) since the Jet.com acquisition (in September 2016) is in line with the Walmart’s expansion efforts. Recently, the company plans to invest in online cosmetics startup Birchbox. If the deal materializes, it will become the fifth e-Commerce acquisition, since the buyout of Jet.com. The company is also expanding in Mexico and China to gain substantial market share in those regions.If we look into the last six months’ performance, we note that Wal-Mart’s shares have rallied 14.7%, higher than the industry, which grew 10.6%. The broader Retail-Wholesale sector has increased 11.7% in the said time frame.Our TakeAs we can see, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company has been undertaking a number of initiatives to boost sales. While the layaway program is expected to help the company increase store traffic, it will also help shoppers with a long shopping list but limited credit.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions. Apple sold a mere 1 billion iPhones in 10 years but a new breakthrough is expected to generate more than 27 billion devices in just 3 years, creating a $1.7 trillion market.Zacks has just released a Special Report that spotlights this fast-emerging phenomenon and 6 tickers for taking advantage of it.

1849,BBY,"Shares of Kohl’s Corporation (KSS  -  Free Report) moved up to eventually close the day 1.1% higher after it announced to extend its partnership with online giant Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report). The retailer has decided to start accepting returns for Amazon customers on selected products in 82 of its U.S. store locations from October 2017. Additionally, the retailer will provide free service of packing and shipping the merchandises to Amazon’s fulfillment centers.The latest move comes after Kohl's decided to sell Amazon devices, accessories and smart home devices in 10 selected stores in Los Angeles and Chicago earlier this month. Kohl’s believes this store-within-store concept will boost stores traffic.The partnership is poised to benefit both companies. Kohl’s will make use of its stores and omni-channel capabilities, while Amazon will now be serving a widened customer base. Leveraging the benefits of the two, we believe Kohl’s is expected to generate more store traffic, curtesy of the availability of Amazon’s varied electronics options and the return facility. Amazon, on the other hand, will be able to lower set-up costs and get more visibility through Kohl’s stores.Like Kohl’s, retailers such as Best Buy Co. Inc. (BBY  -  Free Report) and Sears Holdings Corporation  have also teamed up with the online giant ahead of the holiday season. While Best Buy is creating in-store Amazon concepts, Sears plans to sell Kenmore appliances on Amazon. Apart from Amazon, the company has also teamed up with Apple Inc. last year to develop small shops within its stores.Kohl's Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Kohl's Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Kohl's Corporation QuoteOther Initiatives to Boost Traffic and Drive SalesKohl’s of late, has been taking a number of initiatives to attract shoppers and improve sales. The company has added Under Armour workout tights and sneakers in its portfolio and is focusing on sales growth with both Nike and Adidas. Kohl’s plans to sell Clarks shoes to capture the back-to-school shopping season and is also contemplating to add other brands to store aisles.The company gained significant market share in active apparel and footwear segment in the first half of the year and expects the momentum to continue in the latter half, based on assortment improvements. The company also intends to focus on three largest private-label brands such as SONOMA, Croft & Barrow and Apartment 9 to propel traffic, thanks to the improving sales in the past, driven by an impact of speed initiative in the supply chain. In order to drive comps, the company has also taken an initiative of Greatness Agenda during the first quarter of 2014 to increase transactions per store and sales.Inventory Reduction InitiativesKohl’s has also undertaken several steps to reduce inventory to raise profits. Lower stock levels have led to improvement in merchandise margins, thus leading to gross margin growth. The company continues to expect supply to be down at low to mid-single digits for fiscal 2017.Growing e-commerce BusinessThe company is also striving to boost its e-commerce business over the last few years. As a result, digital conversion improved at a double-digit rate in the recently reported second quarter of fiscal 2017 on the back of better customer experiences on smartphone and smartphone app. In fact, technological advancement in terms of online applications, order placement on phone handsets and omni-channel efforts are expected to have a substantial impact on customer experience.Regular InnovationsKohl’s has been introducing new brands regularly to keep the inventory assortment fresh and the flow of customer traffic to both company’s stores and website stable. Popular launches like Fit Bed under the active and wellness business, the Jumping Beans collection featuring Disney characters, IZOD branded menswear and the Juicy Couture brand for women and girls, Gaiam Yoga product, Stride Rite branded kids’ footwear collection and many more further provide stimulus to the company’s robust product portfolio. Kohl’s also partnered with designer Reed Krakoff to unveil an exclusive, limited-edition collection called REED, exclusively at Kohl’s retail outlets and on Kohls.com in April 2016.We believe these efforts are well-reflected in the share prices of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 (Strong Buy) Rank stocks here. Over the last three months, the stock has rallied more than 25% in comparison to the industry and the broader Retail and Wholesale sector. While the industry has increased 10.7% in the last three months, the sector has grown around 3%.Kohl’s also flaunts a VGM Score of A, which makes it a favorable investing option.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

1850,BBY,"While new hurricane concerns surround the events in Puerto Rico and elsewhere, two earthquakes, registering 8.1 and 7.1 — major, by any measure — have hit Mexico in the last few days. Earthquakes tend to reverberate over time, resulting in after-shocks, and those we have seen as well. Mexico has nowhere near the value per square mile the U.S. has, but even still, the loss of life and industry has got to be taking its its toll in the country, which is home to plenty of U.S. companies which relocated there in order to reduce costs and pass the savings along to shareholders.Hurricane Maria has struck a direct hit on the American property of Puerto Rico, and damages will be days away from being tallied. Clearly, businesses here will have been affected on someone’s balance sheet next month; we’ve already seen negative results in initial jobless claims last week that tie directly to Hurricanes Harvey and Irma over the past month. This is not taking into account the resources and industries of transport affected by these natural disasters that will come along in economic metrics as time goes on. Something to think about as stock markets continue their climbs into the stratosphere.Will the Fed have anything to say about any of this? Today we hear from Fed Chair Janet Yellen regarding interest rate policy (a raise at this stage would be BIG news) and the unwinding of the gigantic $4.5 trillion balance sheet. Former Fed Chair Ben Bernanke ordered a buyback system in order to backstop U.S. currency in helping the nation dig out of the Great Recession, which happened almost exactly 9 years ago. All signs are that the U.S. economy has fully recovered, and so we expect that ratcheting down of backstopping to commence with today’s press conference with Ms. Yellen today.For now, we continue to see record highs in the markets; clearly investors see little in the way of continued growth across most industries. But we would caution that these natural disasters will have a negative affect at some point in the near future, and we would expect these to manifest in economic data released monthly over time. Whether the market decides to digest these items without difficulty remains to be seen.Best Buy (BBY  -  Free Report) shares have fallen precipitously following its Q2 2018 earnings results after the bell Monday.

1853,BBY,"Target Corporation (TGT  -  Free Report), which has introduced several innovative endeavors to counter competition, has announced it will begin same-day delivery across Florida in partnership with an online deliver platform, Shipt, Inc. Notably, the company has acquired Shipt, Inc. recently with the objective of capitalizing on the booming online shoppingShipt will begin the same-day delivery from Target stores in Tampa and South Florida, beginning Feb 1, 2018.  The facility will also be available in Daytona Beach, Fort Myers, Gainesville, Gulf Shores, Jacksonville, Naples, Sarasota, Orlando, Space Coast, St. Augustine, Tallahassee and Treasure Coast form Feb 8, 2018. More than 6.3 million customers across the state can avail this service.The company will provide same-day delivery services of groceries, essentials, home, electronics as well as other products. However, the company will expand it to all major products by the end of 2019. Moreover, with the help of Shipt, Target will start providing same-day delivery services from nearly half of its stores by early 2018. The services will also be available from most of the stores in major markets by the beginning of 2018 holiday season.Founder and CEO of Shipt, Bill Smith said “Florida’s growing community of Shipt members continues to be loyal and enthusiastic about the service, and we look forward to expanding throughout the state with our newest retail partner, Target.”The retail landscape has been undergoing a fundamental change. With digital transformation in shopping and consumers splurging online, store and mall traffic has been hit hard. As a result, most retailers, including big-box, are struggling to compete with e-commerce channels and are being forced to trim store count to focus more on an online model. We believe, the company’s decision to bring same-day delivery services is likely to lure more customers and in turn will drive the top line higher. The acquisition will also aid the company to compete with e-commerce biggie Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report), Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report) and Best Buy Co., Inc.

1855,BBY,"The chapter of 2017 is about to conclude, and it reads as an eventful year for stock market based on encouraging economic indicators and improved corporate results. Before we kick off 2018, retailers have some more good news to cheer about.The latest addition to the streak of encouraging economic indicators is the holiday season sales data from Nov 1 to Dec 24, 2017, reflecting an increase in consumer spending. According to MasterCard SpendingPulse, sales (excluding automobiles) during the period jumped 4.9% compared with 3.7% rise in the prior-year period. This marks the biggest year-over-year increase in holiday spending since 2011.Per report, sales of electronics and appliances, jewelry, and home furnishings rose 7.5%, 5.9% and 5.1%, respectively. Meanwhile, specialty apparel as well as department stores witnessed “moderate” sales increase. Further, market analysts are also optimistic about the holiday sales as unemployment is at its lowest level in 17 years and consumer sentiment has touched the highest level since 2000.The data by MasterCard SpendingPulse fared better than the National Retail Federation (“NRF”) projection of 3.6-4% rise in November and December sales (excluding autos, gas and restaurant sales) and eMarketer forecasts 3.1% jump in holiday sales.Following the news, retailers like Macy's, Inc. (M  -  Free Report), Kohl's Corporation (KSS  -  Free Report), J. C. Penney Company, Inc. (JCP  -  Free Report), Best Buy Co., Inc. (BBY  -  Free Report) and Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.

For the time being, the expression ""retail apocalypse” appears to be a thing of past. The sector has certainly been facing the brunt of heightened online competition, lower footfall and changing consumer spending patterns but of late the tables are turning in favor of the retailers.Analysts believe that a buoyant stock market, gradual wage acceleration, improved employment picture and modest inflation are enough to trigger consumer spending. All these sound favorable for retailers, who try to make the most of the season that accounts for a sizeable chunk of yearly revenues and profits.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

1856,BBY,"Best Buy Co., Inc.‘s (BBY  -  Free Report) extensive investments to upgrade operations with special focus on developing omni-channel capabilities, strengthening partnership with vendors and strategic initiatives bode well. These efforts helped the stock to gain 53.6% in a year, outperforming the industry’s growth of 45%. While these factors inspire optimism, intense competition and increase in spending, which might hurt margins are dampeners. Let’s delve deeper.Hidden CatalystThe Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s Renew Blue program, which was announced in November 2012 aided it to overcome two major problems, “negative comparable sales and declining operating income rate”. The strategy aided the company to deliver compounded annual adjusted earnings growth rate of 8% in the past five years.Following the successful completion of “Renew Blue” program, the company has launched a fresh strategy called “Best Buy 2020: Building the New Blue”. Fiscal 2018 is the first year of Building the New Blue initiative implementation by the company. Under this strategy, the top most priority for fiscal 2018 is exploring and pursuing growth opportunities, better execution in key areas, cost optimization and investing in people as well as systems to drive growth. Under the program, the company has already achieved the cost reduction target of $450 million. The company targets $600 million of cost reduction and gross profit optimization by 2021. The company has already accomplished $100 million of the projected target.Earlier, Best Buy raised fiscal 2018 view following the third-quarter results. Management now envisions Enterprise revenue (including 53rd week) growth of 4-4.8%, up from the prior projection of 4%. The company anticipates adjusted operating income (including 53rd week) growth rate in the 7-9.5% range, up from the earlier guided range of 4-9%. For fourth-quarter fiscal 2018, management anticipates Enterprise revenues between $14.2 billion and $14.5 billion, and a comparable sales increase of 1-3%. Management also projects adjusted earnings in the band of $1.89-$1.99 a share. The company also expects domestic comparable sales to rise in the range of 1-3% in the fourth quarter, while international comparable sales are estimated in the band of flat to up 3%.Hurdles to CrossBest Buy is planning to spend approximately $750 million to $800 million in fiscal 2018, up from the previous estimate of $700 million as the company wants to increase the investment to boost e-commerce operations and supply chains to counter competition. Analyst believes increase in investment may strain margins in the coming quarters. We also noted that SG&A expenses have increased 2.2% and 3.2% in the third and second quarters of fiscal 2018, respectively. Higher expenses may also weigh upon margins.We also believe that challenging retail landscape, aggressive promotional strategies and waning store traffic might hurt Best Buy's performance.3 Other Retail Stocks Hogging the LimelightG-III Apparel Group, Ltd.

1857,BBY,"Nintendo Co Ltd (NTDOY  -  Free Report) is again drawing flak from fans for the chaotic way in which preorders of its much awaited console, Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES) Classic edition were locked in.Per media reports, yesterday, retailers like Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) and Best Buy (BBY  -  Free Report) started taking preorders without any intimation. Best Buy started taking preorders at 1.30 A.M. ET while Amazon went live at around 5.00 A.M. ET. Wal-Mart and Target Corp went live a little later in the day but again with no prior intimation.However, reportedly, GameStop (GME  -  Free Report) announced that it was going to start taking preorders at 1.00 P.M. ET. Sadly, this wasn’t of any help as the site crashed due to heavy traffic. It was learnt later that the sixth retailer Toys ""R"" Us wasn’t going to take any preorders for SNES.  Reportedly, Nintendo has collaborated with these six retailers to sell SNES Classic edition consoles.Nintendo Co. Price Nintendo Co. Price | Nintendo Co. QuoteThe consoles were immediately sold out. Most of the fans were caught off guard given the odd hours and the lack of any intimation. Nintendo loyalists thus ended up having a rough day.Nintendo seemingly is yet to learn from the NES Classic fiasco that occurred last year. Betting big on nostalgia, Nintendo revived NES almost 20 years after discontinuing it. Upon release, NES Mini met with tremendous response from the gaming community. However, Nintendo faltered as there was limited inventory causing massive supply shortages. Fans were extremely irate. NES Mini, which went on sale in fall 2016, was abruptly discontinued earlier this year in spite of immense popularity.Given the debacle, the company, back then, had issued a statement promising to produce significantly more units of SNES Classic Edition than it did of NES Classic Edition until the end of calendar year 2017. Unfortunately, Nintendo again failed to have a smooth beginning.Nintendo fans still have a chance to buy SNES mini when it hits stores on Sep 29, 2017. However, analysts expect supply to be “extremely limited.”We can only hope that this time around Nintendo must have learnt its lesson and there will be adequate inventory to meet the demand. Nintendo does not need any more bad press for SNES Classic. It is to be noted that in July due to a “technical glitch” SNES Classic was erroneously made available on Wal-Mart for pre-orders. After the detection of the error, all the orders were cancelled igniting extensive criticism.Nintendo has had a dream run since last year when the augmented reality game Pokémon Go became a worldwide sensation. After that Nintendo saw success with both NES Mini and Switch consoles. As a result, over the past one year, shares have vastly outperformed the Industry. While the stock returned 47.9%, the industry gained 36.1%.Nintendo’s upcoming second-generation machine reflects the company’s smart initiative to cash in on its yesteryear gaming successes. Nintendo is a pioneer in the field of video gaming, riding on the back of its characters – Mario, Pokémon, Zelda and others. It is worth mentioning that the original SNES, launched in 1990, sold over 49 million units globally.The SNES micro-console features a suite of 21 preloaded fan favorites games such as Super Mario World, The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past, Donkey Kong Country and Mega Man X.Alongside the classic titles, Nintendo will also bundle in an unreleased sequel with the original space-fighting game Star Fox. Worldwide release of Star Fox 2 is one of the most attractive additions to the package.Currently, Nintendo carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

1862,BBY,"Return on equity is one of the most sought-after metrics for an investment. The metric enables investors to differentiate between a profit-churner and a profit-burner. It is a profitability ratio that measures the earnings that a company generates from its equity.To shortlist these gems, one can look at the DuPont technique to analyze the basic ROE at an advanced level. Here is how DuPont breaks down ROE into its different components:ROE = Net Income/EquityNet Income / Equity = (Net Income / Sales) * (Sales / Assets) * (Assets / Equity)ROE = Profit Margin * Asset Turnover Ratio * Equity MultiplierImportance of Du PontAlthough one can’t play down the importance of normal ROE calculation, the fact remains that it doesn’t always provide a complete picture. The DuPont analysis, on the other hand, allows investors to assess the elements that play a dominant role in any change in ROE. It can help investors to segregate companies having higher margins from those having high turnover. For example, high-end fashion brands generally survive on high margin as compared with retail goods, which rely on higher turnover.In fact, it also sheds light on the company’s leverage status, which can go a long way in selecting stocks poised for gains. A lofty ROE could be due to the overuse of debt. Thus, the strength of a company can be misleading if it has a high debt load.So, an investor confined solely to an ROE perspective may be confused if he or she has to judge between two stocks of equal ratio. This is where DuPont analysis wins over and spots the better stock.Investors can simply do this analysis by taking a look at the company’s financials.However, looking at financial statements of each company separately can be a tedious task. Screening tools like Zacks Research Wizard can come to your rescue and help you shortlist the stocks that look impressive with a DuPont analysis.Screening Parameters• Profit Margin more than or equal to 3: As the name suggests, it is a measure of how profitably the business is running. Generally, it is the key contributor to ROE.• Asset Turnover Ratio more than or equal to 2: It allows an investor to assess management’s efficiency in using assets to drive sales.• Equity Multiplier between 1 and 3: It’s an indication of how much debt the company uses to finance its assets.• Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Stocks having a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) generally perform better than their peers in all types of market environment.• Current Price more than $5: This screens out the low priced stocks. However, when looking for lower priced stocks, this criterion can be removed.Here are five of 20 stocks that made it through the screen:Sanderson Farms Inc.

1863,BBY,"Investors are always hunting for estimate-beating stocks before an earnings release. It is because investors always try to place themselves ahead of time and look to play stocks that are rich in quality and have high chances of beating earnings estimates.Why Is a Positive Earnings Surprise So Important?Historically, stocks of companies with solid quarterly earnings (on a nominal basis) tank if they miss or merely meet market expectations. After all, a 20% earnings rise (though apparently looks good) doesn’t tell you if it has been decelerating.Also, seasonal fluctuations can come into play. If a company’s Q1 is seasonally weak and Q4 is strong, it is likely to report a sequential earnings decline. In such cases, growth rates are misleading while judging the true health of a company.On the other hand, after a whole lot of research and analysis on a company’s financials and initiatives, Wall Street analysts project its earnings. They also take a company’s guidance into consideration when deriving an earnings estimate.Thus, outperforming that estimate is almost equivalent to beating the company’s own expectation as well as the market perception. And if the margin of earnings surprise is big, it typically drives the stock higher right after the release. Thus, more than anything else, an earnings surprise can push a stock higher.How to Locate Potential Outperformers? Now, finding stocks that have the potential to beat on the bottom line is a dream that investors chase but might not always come true. One way of fulfilling it is by looking at the earnings surprise history of a company.An impressive track in this regard generally acts as a driver in sending a stock higher. It indicates the company’s ability to exceed estimates. And investors generally believe that the company will have the same trick up its sleeve to deliver yet another earning beat in its upcoming release.The Winning StrategyIn order to shortlist stocks that are likely to come up with an earnings surprise, we chose the following as our primary screening parameters.Last EPS Surprise greater than or equal to 10%: Stocks delivering positive surprise in the last quarter tend to surprise again.Average EPS Surprise in the last four quarters greater than 20%: We lifted the bar for outperformance slight higher by setting the average earnings surprise for the last four quarters at 20%.Average EPS Surprise in the last two quarters greater than 20%: This points to a more consistent surprise history and makes the case for another surprise even stronger.In addition, we place a few other criteria that push up the chance of a positive surprise.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Only companies with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) rating can get through.Earnings ESP greater than zero: A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank of #1, 2 or 3 for an earnings beat to happen, as per our proven model.In order to zero in on those that have long-term growth potential and high trading liquidity we have added the following parameters too:Next 3–5 Years Estimated EPS Growth (Per Year) greater than 10%: Solid expected earnings growth exhibits the stock’s long-term growth prospects.Average 20-day Volume greater than 100,000: High trading volume implies that the stocks have adequate liquidity.A handful of criteria has narrowed down the universe from over 7,700 stocks to 12.Here are five out of 12 stocks that passed the screen:FormFactor Inc. (FORM  -  Free Report): The company manufactures, sells and supports high-performance, advanced semiconductor wafer probe cards. The stock belongs to a Zacks Industry Rank in the top 35%. It has a Zacks Rank #1. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Best Buy Co. Inc. (BBY  -  Free Report): The Zacks Rank #2 company operates in a single business segment, selling personal computers and other home office products and related accessories principally through its retail stores.

1864,BBY,"U.S. retail and food services sales in June declined 0.2%, following a revised reading of 0.1% decrease registered in May, as people curtailed their spending on clothes and spent less at gasoline stations, department stores and restaurants. This suggests that consumer spending, which plays a pivotal role in driving the economy, may have lost momentum.As per the Commerce Department report, sales at clothing & clothing accessories stores declined 0.1%, while receipts at gasoline stations fell 1.3%. Sales at food & beverage stores dropped 0.4%. Department store sales decreased 0.7% and were down 3.9% from the prior-year period. Sales at non-store retailers, however, inched up 0.4% in June and increased 9.2% from the prior-year period.Certainly, the second straight month of slump in retail sales overshadowed steady job additions and gradual wage acceleration. This also cast a doubt over the expected rebound in the economy, which at one end witnessed a rise in interest rate and U.S. factory activity in June, while on the other end saw oil prices lose ground and encountered political gridlock.If the downward spiral in retail sales has put you in a spot of bother, we advise you to dismiss concerns about its impact on your portfolio and locate greener pastures.Where to Look for the Right Stocks?Although the Retail-Wholesale sector has not been a spectacular performer, it still holds promise, given some favorable economic indicators. Moreover, friendlier fiscal and regulatory policies from the current administration also bode well. The rebound in oil prices from all-time lows, improving labor market and gradual recovery in the housing market signal that the economy is on a recovery mode.The economy added 222,000 jobs in June, while the unemployment rate was 4.4%. These factors are favorable for retailers and definitely play a crucial role in raising buyers’ confidence.Here we have highlighted five Retail/Wholesale stocks with a favorable combination of a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy) and a VGM Score of “A” or “B.” These stocks are backed by sound fundamentals, surging share price and a track record of better-than-expected results.5 Prominent PicksWe suggest investing in Aaron's, Inc. (AAN  -  Free Report), an omni-channel provider of lease-purchase solutions, with a VGM Score of “A.” The company posted an average positive earnings surprise of 10.6% in the trailing four quarters. In the past six months, the stock has surged roughly 30.6% and outperformed the Zacks categorized Retail-Consumer Electronic industry, which advanced 26%. Moreover, it flaunts a Zacks Rank #1. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.You may also count on Red Robin Gourmet Burgers, Inc. (RRGB  -  Free Report), which has a long-term earnings growth rate of 10.3% and a VGM Score of “B.” This operator of casual-dining and fast-casual restaurants delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 17.3% in the trailing four quarters and carries a Zacks Rank #1. We note that in the past six months, the stock has advanced approximately 29.8%, while the Zacks categorized Retail-Food & Restaurants industry gained 13.7%.Another stock worth considering is Best Buy Co., Inc. (BBY  -  Free Report), which has a long-term earnings growth rate of 11.8% and a VGM Score of “A.” This retailer of technology products, services, and solutions delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 33.8% in the trailing four quarters and sports a Zacks Rank #1. We note that in the past six months, the stock has advanced approximately 28.4%, while the Zacks categorized Retail-Consumer Electronic industry gained 26%.The Home Depot, Inc. (HD  -  Free Report) with a long-term earnings growth rate of 13% and a VGM Score of “B” is also a solid bet. This home improvement retailer delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 3.5% in the trailing four quarters and carries a Zacks Rank #2. We note that in the past six months, the stock has advanced approximately 13.7%, while the Zacks categorized Building Products – Retail/Wholesale industry has gained 9.8%.You may also safely bet on Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report), which operates as a chain of discount department stores, hypermarkets and grocery stores. The stock holds a Zacks Rank #2 and has a VGM Score of “B.” The company posted an average positive earnings surprise of 3% in the trailing four quarters and has a long-term earnings growth rate of 6.1%. In the past six months, the stock has increased 12.9%, while the Zacks categorized Retail-Supermarkets industry rose 7.4%.These five stocks are not the end of the road and with the help of the Zacks Stock Screener and some permutation and combination, you can find out other stocks that have the potential to beat the market.5 Trades Could Profit ""Big-League"" from Trump PoliciesIf the stocks above spark your interest, wait until you look into companies primed to make substantial gains from Washington's changing course.Today Zacks reveals 5 tickers that could benefit from new trends like streamlined drug approvals, tariffs, lower taxes, higher interest rates, and spending surges in defense and infrastructure.

1865,BBY,"Investors in Best Buy Co., Inc. (BBY  -  Free Report) need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Sep 22nd 2017 $56.00 Put had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Best Buy, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Best Buy is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Retail - Consumer Electronicsindustry that ranks in the Top 3% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 30 days, the current year Zacks Consensus Estimate has seen ten upward versus no downward revisions. The net effect has been taken by the Zacks Consensus Estimate going to 79 cents from 64 cents in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Best Buy right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Often times, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Each week, our very own Dave Bartosiak gives his top options trades.

1866,BBY,"On Tuesday, shares of department store Kohl’s Corp. (KSS  -  Free Report) popped, up over 4.5% at one point (though the stock is currently trading up about 1.3% in late-morning trading), after the retailer said it will begin to accept returns on select merchandise from Amazon.com (AMZN  -  Free Report).The return program is set to start in October in 82 Kohl’s locations throughout Los Angeles and Chicago, the same cities that the company is implementing its “store-in-store” concept called Amazon Smart Home Experience (read more: Kohl’s Rallies on New Store-In-Store Partnership with Amazon).These mini shops will sell Amazon’s popular Alexa-enabled devices like the Echo smart speaker, and customers will be able to try and test out the e-commerce giant’s growing tech lineup.This returns-focused program, however, will likely be a solid traffic driver for Kohl’s. Customers will be able to bring their Amazon products into a Kohl’s store, and the company will package and transport the items to Amazon’s return centers for free.""This is a great example of how Kohl's and Amazon are leveraging each other's strengths – the power of Kohl's store portfolio and omnichannel capabilities combined with the power of Amazon's reach and loyal customer base,"" said Richard Schepp, Kohl's chief administrative officer.And, Kohl’s said that customers will be able to use “designated parking spots” close to store entrances if visiting a Kohl’s location for an Amazon return.Other retailers are teaming up with Amazon, a smart move ahead of the upcoming holiday season. Sears , for instance, signed a deal to sell its Kenmore appliances on Amazon.com, while Best Buy (BBY  -  Free Report) has also created in-store Amazon concepts.This is also not Amazon’s first time utilizing a brick-and-mortar retailer for its return services. After it completed its acquisition of Whole Foods Market, the company allowed shoppers to both pickup and return orders made on Amazon.com at one of the organic grocer’s over 400 stores.4 Promising Stock Picks to Keep an Eye On With news stories about computer hacking and identity theft becoming increasingly commonplace, the cybersecurity industry looks like a promising investment opportunity.

1867,BBY,"GameStop Corp. (GME  -  Free Report) stock has witnessed a sharp decline of 19.7% year to date, underperforming the industry’s whopping gain of 31.8%. Meanwhile, stocks such as Best Buy Co., Inc. (BBY  -  Free Report), Conn's, Inc. (CONN  -  Free Report) and Systemax Inc.  which belong to the same industry have surged 37.4%, 74.3% and 185.5%, respectively. So after observing the performance of its peers, the first question which comes to our mind is why GameStop is lagging behind and how much time will it take to match the industry’s performance? Let’s delve deeper and find out what’s ailing the stock.What’s Hurting the Stock?Stiff competition, aggressive promotional strategies and waning store traffic are the headwinds with which the retail sector is grappling, and GameStop is not immune to it. We note that the bottom line continues to decline year over year. Earnings per share had declined 2.9%, 12.9%, 9.3% and 0.8% in the first, second, third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2016. In the first and second quarter of fiscal 2017, it declined 4.5% and 44.4%, respectively. The reflection of the same is visible in the stock’s dismal run.The bottom line which has been witnessing a downtrend in the past quarters will continue to decline in fiscal 2017 too. Management continues to anticipate earnings for fiscal 2017 in the range of $3.10-$3.40 per share, compared with fiscal 2016 earnings of $3.77 per share. Moreover, GameStop expects comps in fiscal 2017 to be at the higher end of earlier provided guidance of flat to down 5%.GameStop’s basic concern is the weakness prevailing in new software sales, which is heightening apprehensions about the impact of digital downloads on the same. New software sales witnessed 3.4% decline in second-quarter fiscal 2017. During fourth-quarter fiscal 2016 conference call, the company stated that it expects new software sales to decline mid-single digits in fiscal 2017.Technology Brands & Collectibles Business Looks RobustThough the stock has underperformed the industry in the recent times, the stock can bounce back in the near future. Both Technology Brands & Collectibles Business are growing at a very rapid pace and can help the company regain its lost position.Technology Brands, which has been witnessing robust growth in the past, impressed investors in the second quarter too. In the reported quarter, Technology Brands sales gained 7%, following an increase of 21.5% in the previous quarter, driven by year-over-year growth in AT&T authorized retail stores. Management anticipates sturdy performance of Technology Brands and Collectibles to continue in fiscal 2017, and added that new hardware innovation in the video game category also looks promising.Management also anticipates Technology Brands’ operating earnings to rise over 30% to $120 million during fiscal 2017 and to be $200 million in fiscal 2019. During fourth-quarter fiscal 2016 conference call, the company stated that it expects Technology Brands sales to increase 10-16% in fiscal 2017.GameStop’s foray in to the collectibles and licensed merchandising category, and Technology Brands has been profitable. During the fiscal second quarter, the collectibles business sales surged 36.1% to $122.5 million buoyed by robust sales of Pokémon and Marvel-related products. The company added five Collectibles stores during the quarter, taking the total count to 99 stores. GameStop expects to enhance collectibles business to approximately $650-$700 million during fiscal 2017 and anticipates becoming a $1 billion business by the end of fiscal 2019. In the third quarter, Collectibles sales are forecasted to increase by 30-40%.GameStop currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1868,BBY,"The TJX Companies, Inc. (TJX  -  Free Report) is well poised to achieve growth on the back of its brand enhancing initiatives, aggressive store opening strategy and improving e-Commerce business. These factors also aided the company to improve margins and market share, leading to better-than-expected results in its recently reported second-quarter fiscal 2018.Though shares have been declining for the last several quarters owing to disappointing comps growth and higher costs, the stock has turned around and started moving up over the last one month on the back of solid fundamentals. Shares of this discount retailer have gained 6.8% in the last one month compared with the industry’s increase of 4.7%.Let’s now take a closer look into some of the factors that have been aiding the company’s performance as well as few of the challenges it has been dealing with.Initiatives Boosting Performance TJX Companies posted its second-quarter fiscal 2018 results wherein both earnings and revenues exceeded expectations, driven by margin growth, improved traffic and higher market share. As traditional retailers struggle in the face of changing consumer tastes and competition from Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report), TJX Companies has maintained its solid earnings trend and outpaced estimates for the last 11 quarters. In fact, higher traffic has been benefiting comps growth for the last 33 quarters. However comps growth rate is slowing down. The company’s consolidated comps grew 3% in the second quarter, lower than the 4% growth in the year-ago quarter.TJX Companies has an aggressive store opening strategy. The company regularly opens stores and is rapidly expanding across the United States, Europe and Canada. With almost 3,800 stores in nine countries, the company plans to increase the number of stores to 5,600 over the long term. TJX Companies plans to open approximately 260 stores in fiscal 2018. In July, the company announced plans to launch a fourth chain called Homesense, which provides furniture, lighting and art. The company has opened its first Homesense store recently, with a few more stores slated for the fall.An increasing number of retailers are focusing on online businesses spread to a greater number of customers. TJX Companies has undertaken several initiatives to boost online sales and is aiming to add more categories to the online shopping site to differentiate the same from its brick-and-mortar stores.The company’s aggressive marketing and advertising campaigns through multiple mediums (TV, radio and social media) have also been aiding sales growth. Its gift-giving initiatives, unique among off-price retailers and loyalty card program also help in improving customer engagement.Factors Posing Concerns Being an off-price retailer, TJX Companies cannot increase the price of its products despite rising product costs. Moreover, lower spending on apparel and accessories and a general slowdown in consumer spending are hurting sales at department stores. To add to its worries, TJX Companies has also been experiencing an increase in employee payroll. Higher wages are expected to negatively impact fiscal 2018 earnings by 2%. Further, the company expects incremental investments, additional supply chain costs and pension costs to pressurize margins in the coming quarters.Bottom Line TJX Companies’ business expansion initiatives which include store openings, e-Commerce growth and marketing campaigns are quite appealing and are expected to yield favorable results. While these efforts are expected to boost store traffic, we are cautious about the challenges which may dent the company’s performance in the near term.Given the mixed pros and cons, the company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Do Retail Stocks Interest You?

1869,BBY,"Herbalife Ltd. (HLF  -  Free Report) recently announced that it has commenced a self tender offer by way of a “modified Dutch auction” to buy back $600 million worth common stock, in cash at a price of not less than $60 or exceeding $68.Herbalife also stated that against each of its tendered shares, shareholders would be provided with a non-transferable contractual contingent value right (CVR). This will allow shareholders to receive a contingent payment in cash, in case Herbalife becomes acquired through a private transaction in the forthcoming two years.The offer will expire on Sep 19, unless extended. Post the announcement on Aug 21, shares of this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company increased 9.8% in the after market trading hours.By way of providing a tender offer that includes both cash payment as well as a CVR, the company offers not only adequate liquidity to its shareholders but also value.  As a result, shareholders can receive a higher price in addition to the self tender, under the possible scenario of the company becoming privately acquired.Notably, on Aug 16, the company held talks with an undisclosed prospective financial investor which indicated that there might be a possibility of Herbalife becoming privately acquired, per media sources. These talks ended with no formal decisions. Nevertheless, the company’s board of directors decided to offer its shareholders with adequate protection in case of a private acquisition. Such a move clearly indicates the company’s commitment toward enhancing shareholder value.During 2017, the company already acquired $299 million of its shares, as per its $1.5 billion share buy back plan. The tender offer is therefore a lucrative process for the company to purchase additional shares. In relation to this offer, Carl Icahn, the company’s largest shareholder, entered into an agreement with Herbalife stating that he would keep his ownership within 50% and not exceed the same, unless he intends to acquire 100% of the company’s outstanding shares. As of now, Icahn and his affiliates (Icahn Entities) hold a 24% stake in the company.  However, talks of Herbalife going private could have been a significant blow for billionaire investor Bill Ackman, who has made a $1 billion bet against the nutrition company, accusing it of being a pyramid scheme since December 2012. Ackman believed that the nutrition clubs run by Herbalife's distributors focus on recruitment instead of selling products. Also, it received a civil investigative demand in 2014 from the FTC related to its marketing practices. However, Herbalife resolved the probe with the FTC and paid $200 million in fines and settlements without being named a pyramid scheme.Besides these allegations, we note that Herbalife’s sales volumes have declined in the recent times owing to new stringent FTC regulations in the United States, softness in its Mexico operations and price hike in China. Sales were also hurt as distributors are adhering to the latest protocols.  Nevertheless, the company remains confident regarding its performance which is reflected in its earnings history. Impressively, the company’s earnings have outpaced the Zacks Consensus estimate for 11 straight quarters now, with an average beat of 25.1% in the trailing four quarters.

1870,BBY,"The final weeks of the back-to-school are keeping retailers on the edge with initiatives to push up sales. Representing the second-busiest shopping season after Christmas holidays, back-to-college spending is expected to hit an all-time high this year while back-to-school spending is expected to see its second-highest spending level on record.As per the National Retail Federation (NRF), the combined spending on back to school and college supplies is expected to reach $83.6 billion this year, up 10% from $75.8 billion last year (read: Retail Sales Off to a Great Start to Q3: ETFs to Buy).Families with children in elementary through high school are expected to spend $687.72 per child on clothing, electronics such as computers or calculators, apparels and other school supplies such as notebooks, folders, pencils, backpacks and lunchboxes, for a total of $29.5 billion, up 8% year over year.While more than one-fourth of the families are being perceived to shop two months before the beginning of school, 46.7% are expected to shop three weeks to one month before school starts and 21% to wait until the last week or two. This suggests that budget-constrained parents are looking to shop last minute to get extra discounts from retailers, which will come mostly at the end of summer or the Labor Day weekend.Departmental stores and discount stores are definitely attractive shopping destinations but online sales will remain a hot spot for shopping with 45.5% expected from back-to-school and 44.1% from back-to-college customers. As per eMarketer, online sales for back-to-school will grow 14.8% this year.What’s Hot?In the final days of the ongoing shopping season, retailers continued to lure customers with more promotional offers such as cash back, coupon discounts and free shipping.E-commerce behemoth Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) is offering up to 80% off on essentials such as school supplies, kids' apparel, and electronics. Meanwhile, the world's largest retailer, Wal-Mart (WMT  -  Free Report), introduced a rollback sale in addition to a higher number of back-to-school and back-to-college items through both its Online Grocery Pickup and Pickup Today services, offering tens of thousands more items than in the past. In fact, Wal-Mart is still selling more than 300 items under $1.00 (read: Why You Should Buy the Dip in Amazon Shares with ETFs).Tech giant Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) is offering a free pair of $300 Beats Solo3 Wireless headphones with the purchase of a new Mac computer or iPad Pro. Best Buy (BBY  -  Free Report) is not behind, offering a series of student-exclusive deals including $100 off on select MacBook and iMac models, $125 off on select computers and 10% off on select Surface devices.For school supplies, Target (TGT  -  Free Report) could be an exciting bet as character backpacks with a lunch bag and pencil pouch could be found starting at $14 while school supplies are for less than $1, $3, $5 and $10. On the other hand, Staples  is proposing store-brand paper, notebooks, pens and other school supplies at 50 cents and $1 in stores only. Office Depot (ODP  -  Free Report) is selling pencils, pens, markers, notebooks and more for as little as 1 cent (read: Will Big-Box Retailers Push Up Retail ETFs in Q2 Earnings?).For school uniforms and clothes, Kohl’s (KSS  -  Free Report) is offering school uniforms at less than $10 and an extra 20% off on juniors' and kids' clothing, shoes and backpacks with a promo code.How to PlayAll these attractive offers will definitely boost sales of all types of retailers, leading to a surge in their stock prices.

1871,BBY,"Return on equity (ROE) is one of the most coveted metrics among investors in search of profit-generating stocks. Delving into the basic ROE, with the help of DuPont analysis, before shortlisting stocks could lead to even better returns.It’s basically taking ROE apart to examine how it works. Here is how DuPont breaks down ROE into its different components:ROE = Net Income/EquityNet Income / Equity = (Net Income / Sales) * (Sales / Assets) * (Assets / Equity)ROE = Profit Margin * Asset Turnover Ratio * Equity MultiplierInside DuPont’s EffectivenessAlthough one can’t stress the importance of ROE enough, the fact remains that it doesn’t always provide a complete picture. But the DuPont analysis allows investors to assess which of the elements is dominant in any change in ROE. It can help investors to segregate companies having high margins from those having high turnover. For example, high end fashion brands generally survive on high margin as compared with retail goods which rely on higher turnover.In fact, it also sheds light on a company’s leverage status, which can go a long way in selecting stocks poised for gains. A lofty ROE could be due to the overuse of debt. Thus, ROE of a company can be misleading if it has a high debt burden.So, an investor looking at two stocks only from an ROE perspective will be impartial if the values are the same. However, DuPont analysis will help to differentiate between the two stocks and find the better one. Thus, a company with a healthy mix of all the three ratios – profit margin, asset turnover ratio and equity multiplier – will be the most alluring.DuPont analysis is not very difficult, as the required numbers are available in the company income statement and balance sheet of a company.However, looking at financial statements of each company separately can be a tedious task. Screening tools like Zacks Research Wizard can easily shortlist the stocks that look impressive with a DuPont analysis.Screening Parameters• Profit Margin more than or equal to 3: As the name suggests, it is a measure of how profitably the business is running. Generally, it is the key contributor to ROE.• Asset Turnover Ratio more than or equal to 2: It allows an investor to assess management’s efficiency in using assets to drive sales.• Equity Multiplier between 1 and 3: It’s an indication of how much debt the company uses to finance its assets.• Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Stocks having a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) generally perform better than their peers in all types of market environment.• Current Price more than $5: This screens out the low priced stocks. However, when looking for lower priced stocks, this criterion can be removed.Here are five of 13 stocks that made it through the screen:Sanderson Farms Inc.

1872,BBY,"We expect Ireland-based medical device major Medtronic plc (MDT  -  Free Report) to beat expectations when it reports first-quarter and fiscal 2018 results on Aug 22, before the opening bell.Last quarter, the company posted earnings of $1.33 per share, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2 cents. In fact, Medtronic’s earnings outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all of the past four quarters with an average beat of 1.33%. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement. Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that Medtronic is likely to beat earnings because it has the perfect combination of two key ingredients.Zacks ESP:  Medtronic has an Earnings ESP of +0.93% as the Most Accurate estimate of $1.09 is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.08. A favorable Zacks ESP serves as a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise.  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Medtronic currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Note that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings estimates.Conversely, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.The combination of a favorable Zacks Rank and a positive ESP makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.Medtronic PLC Price and EPS Surprise  Medtronic PLC Price and EPS Surprise | Medtronic PLC QuoteWhat is Driving the Better-than-Expected Earnings?We look forward to another quarter of solid growth on successful execution of its three growth strategies, therapy innovation, globalization and economic value for Medtronic. Combined with the demographics of an aging population, these positives have started to open up opportunities for Medtronic, which should get reflected in the first quarter as well.Within therapy innovation, there have been multiple developments. Under the Cardiac and vascular group, new therapies are helping the company gain traction in the rapidly growing MedTech markets such as left ventricular assist device (LVAD), transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), drug-coated balloons, atrial fibrillation ablation and insertable diagnostics.Within cardiac rhythm implantables, the company is fast capturing market share on its differentiated 3T MRI technology. Within TAVR, we expect Medtronic to register strong growth in the quarter on the back of the FDA approval for the extended use of its self-expanding CoreValve Evolut TAVR platform in July 2017. With this approval, patients with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis and at an intermediate risk for open-heart surgery will be eligible for treatment using the technology.In coronary, Medtronic has been seeing weak Drug Eluting stent (DES) performance, particularly in the United States. Per management, the FDA approval of the Resolute Onyx DES in May 2017 put a check on the decline in U.S. DES sales by fiscal 2018. Also, Medtronic has started selling Resolute Onyx DES in the high-growth Japan market from Jul 10, as per a Cardiovascular Business report released on Jul 7. These developments buoy optimism and strengthen our belief for strong quarterly performance by the company in first-quarter fiscal 2018.Over the recent past, the company has been witnessing soft sequential performance in its diabetes business owing to the anticipated full launch of the MiniMed 670G hybrid closed loop system. In June 2017, Medtronic announced the U.S. launch of the MiniMed 670G system for type 1 diabetes. This should reflect in the company’s top line from the first-quarter fiscal 2018.In June 2017, Medtronic announced a new outcomes-based agreement with Aetna for type 1 and type 2 diabetes patients currently on multiple daily insulin injections. This development may also start contributing to the company's diabetes business in near term.Also, within the brain therapy space, under the Restorative Therapies Group business, the company saw encouraging developments. Medtronic announced the receipt of Health Canada licence for SureTune 3 software for deep brain stimulation (DBS) in June 2017. The latest innovations in the SureTune technology allow for more precise, efficient treatment while also improving patient management with centralized data storage for easy reference. The company received CE Mark for its SureTune software for deep brain stimulation in the same month.The company’s estimate revision trend for the fiscal first quarter has also been positive. In the past seven days, one analyst moved north, with no movement in the opposite direction. However, the magnitude of the estimate revision trend with earnings estimates remained at $1.08 over the same time frame.Medtronic has provided its initial fiscal 2018 revenues and EPS guidance. The company expects full-year revenue growth in the range of 4% to 5% at CER. Foreign currency fluctuation is expected to have a positive $75 million to $175 million impact in the fiscal. Fiscal 2018 adjusted earnings per share are expected to grow 9% to 10% at CER. Currency translation will negatively impact full-year earnings by approximately 5 cents to 10 cents, including the 3 cents to 5 cents impact in the first-quarter fiscal 2018.With Medtronic gaining a significant portion of its sales from the international market, currency fluctuations are a major concern. This has been a dampener for the company over the last few quarters. Considering this, for first-quarter fiscal 2018, Medtronic anticipates currency headwind to affect revenues by $10 million to $60 million. Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are some other companies you may want to consider as our proven model shows they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in the upcoming quarter:Big Lots, Inc. (BIG  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +6.56% and a Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. Best Buy Co., Inc.

1873,BBY,"Looking for a stock that might be in a good position to beat earnings at its next report? Consider Best Buy Co., Inc. (BBY  -  Free Report), a firm in the Retail - Consumer Electronics industry, which could be a great candidate for another beat.This company has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. In fact, in these reports, BBY has beaten estimates by at least 15% in both cases, suggesting it has a nice short-term history of crushing expectations.Earnings in FocusTwo quarters ago, BBY expected to post earnings of $1.66 per share, while it actually produced earnings of $1.95 per share, a beat of 17.5%. Meanwhile, for the most recent quarter, the company looked to deliver earnings of 40 cents per share, when it actually saw earnings of 60 cents per share instead, representing a 50% positive surprise.Best Buy Co., Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Best Buy Co., Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Best Buy Co., Inc. QuoteThanks in part to this history, recent estimates have been moving higher for Best Buy. In fact, the Earnings ESP for BBY is positive, which is a great sign of a coming beat.After all, the Zacks Earnings ESP compares the most accurate estimate to the broad consensus, looking to find stocks that have seen big revisions as of late, suggesting that analysts have recently become more bullish on the company’s earnings prospects. This is the case for BBY, as the firm currently has a Zacks Earnings ESP of +1.59%, so another beat could be around the corner.This is particularly true when you consider that BBY has a great Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) which can be a harbinger of outperformance and a signal for a strong earnings profile. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.When you add this solid Zacks Rank to a positive Earnings ESP, a positive earnings surprise happens nearly 70% of the time, so it seems pretty likely that BBY could see another beat at its next report, especially if recent trends are any guide.4 Surprising Tech Stocks to Keep an Eye on Tech stocks have been a major force behind the market’s record highs, but picking the best ones to buy can be tough.

1874,BBY,"We are halfway through August, and parents and young people around the country are preparing to pack up and head off to college. So Zacks is here to look at two companies with huge exposure in the college shopping market that also happen to have high Zacks Ranks.As most students and parents know, going back to school shopping can be very expensive. For elementary and high school students the costs are enormous. But parents and kids headed back to college or for the first time know that the costs are much higher. In fact, overall back to school spending for college students is almost double that of K-12.Notebooks, backpacks, and new clothes are expensive, but laptops, speakers, futons, and microwaves cost a whole lot more.K-12 back to school spending is projected to jump 8% to $29.5 billion, according to a National Retail Federation survey. However, college kids and their families are expected to spend a total of $54.1 billion on back to school related shopping, which is up from $48.5 billion in 2016.The 2017 college spending projections place this year ahead of the previous high water mark reached in 2012. The staggering figure is due in part to a rise in college enrollment, along with reviewed consumer confidence—but also because big-ticket purchases and the sheer amount of goods just add up.Now, let’s take a look at two big-name companies with high Zacks Ranks that could turn college student spending into major profits.Best Buy (BBY  -  Free Report) Best Buy (BBY  -  Free Report) is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) that scored an “A” for Value and a “B” for growth in our Style Score system. The electronics powerhouse has a market cap of $18.5 billion and a forward PE of 15.61.Best Buy’s estimated earnings growth rate for the current year is 9.2%, which is far above the industry average of 3%. Shares of Best Buy have skyrocketed from $32.32 a share a year ago to rest at over $60 per share today, which is only a few dollars below its 52-week high.Best Buy’s massive climb has been spurred in part by the company’s commitment to grow its online sales. In the most recent quarter, the company’s domestic online comparable sales jumped by 22.5% from the year-ago period.The company—which sells computers, printers, TVs, tablets, video game consoles and more—could really cash in on the back to college market. Based on the National Retail Federation report, electronics will be the top spending sector out of all of the back to school related categories at $12.8 billion.Wal-Mart (WMT  -  Free Report)Wal-Mart (WMT  -  Free Report) is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and sports an overall VGM grade of  “A.” The we-sell-everything retailer’s current market cap sits at $244 billion, and the company is coming off a solid second-quarter earnings report.Wal-Mart beat earnings and revenue expectations, and even showed that it can contend in retail’s war against Amazon (AMZN). The company posted adjusted earnings of $1.08 per share, which just topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate and prior-year quarter’s adjusted earnings of $1.07.On top of that small beat, the company posted revenues that were up 2.1% year-over-year to $123.4 billion, which also surpassed our Zacks Consensus Estimate. Walmart U.S. same-store sales climbed 1.9%, while Sam’s Club comparable store sales gained 1.2%.Maybe more importantly, management noted that the company’s online sales and GMV climbed 60% and 67%, respectively.Shares of Wal-Mart dipped on Thursday despite its strong report, but that seems to have more to do with the overall market than Wal-Mart. The company’s stock currently sits $2 below its 52-week high of $81.99 a share.Bottom LineBack to school college shopping is a big-time moneymaker for many retail outlets around the country. Best Buy and Wal-Mart are both major names with large exposure in this highly coveted early fall spending spree.One Simple Trading IdeaSince 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year. With compounding, rebalancing, and exclusive of fees, it can turn thousands into millions of dollars.This proven stock-picking system is grounded on a single big idea that can be fortune shaping and life changing.

1875,BBY,"Kohl's Corporation (KSS  -  Free Report) has recently announced plans to expand the capabilities of its e-Commerce network and also invest in store base by opening four new small format stores. The company is also focused on optimizing and rightsizing store space across a number of Kohl's outlets.Store and Facility Development Plans Kohl's plans to commence shipping operations of it’s recently opened fifth e-Commerce fulfillment center in Plainfield, IN by the end of this month. The centre would mainly cater to filing, processing and shipping of orders from its website, Kohls.com. The 937,000 square feet facility is well equipped with advanced technology for maximizing throughput and productivity.Additionally, the company plans to launch four small format stores in October 2017, adding to its existing fleet of eight small format stores that were opened in 2016. The new stores would be located at North Smithfield, RI; Blue Ash, OH; East Windsor, NJ and Montebello, CA. The new stores would be close to 35,000 square feet in size.Owing to their small size, these stores will be flexible and can easily be adapted for localized merchandise. Moreover, these stores will have kiosks for online shopping from Kohl's website and would also serve as pick up locations for online purchases.Kohl's store development plans also incorporate optimizing and rightsizing store space to better serve customers and also operate in a more efficient manner. The company has plans to lessen operations in half of its stores by the end of 2017. This would require the stores to balance its inventory and adjust fixtures.In this respect, the company has already optimized store space in close to 300 stores to include new layouts, making them operationally smaller. Rightsizing initiatives also include opening a single-level 55,000 square feet store in Greenfield, WI, relocating the same from its existing two-level 85,000 square feet store located nearby at Southridge Mall.Initiatives to Improve Sales Kohl's has also been undertaking a number of initiatives to attract more shoppers to its stores and improve sales. Lately, the company has started offering famous brands from outside the United States and cutting down on the number of in-house clothing brands it sells. Kohl’s has started selling Under Armour products, as well as Clarks shoes and is looking for other brands to add to its store aisles.The company also plans to continue its best-selling private-label brands such as Sonoma, Croft & Barrow and Apt. 9 that had delivered strong sales in the recently reported second-quarter fiscal 2017 results. Kohl’s has also been undertaking several initiatives to reduce its inventory and improve merchandise margins that benefited the company’s second-quarter earnings.Lower Comps Posing Concern Despite such efforts to boost sales and store traffic, the company’s comps have been declining over the past few quarters. Lower spending on apparel and accessories, competition from discount retailers and cautious consumer spending are hurting sales at department stores. This signals that its turnaround initiative named “Greatness Agenda,” which began in 2014, is failing to deliver results.The initiative was designed to increase transactions per store and sales. Though the plan has helped the company to deliver positive comps in all the four quarters of fiscal 2015, the quarterly growth rates moderated gradually, thus posing a concern. Moreover, comps have now declined consecutively in the last six quarters, including the recently reported second-quarter fiscal 2017 results.These headwinds are well reflected in the company’s share price performance. The stock has declined 15.1% in the past year, in comparison to the broader Retail-Wholesale sector, which grew 10.6%.Given the industry-wide challenges impacting Kohl's comps growth, investors need to wait and see whether its ongoing store expansion and rightsizing efforts prove to be effective.Kohl's currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Do Retail Stocks Interest You?

1876,BBY,"A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Best Buy Co., Inc. (BBY  -  Free Report). Shares have added about 3.3% in that time frame, outperforming the market.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to the stock's next earnings release, or is it due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Best Buy Beats on Q2 Earnings & Sales, Raises ViewBest Buy Company reported better-than-expected earnings for the nineteenth consecutive quarter as the company reported second-quarter fiscal 2018 results. The company posted adjusted earnings per share of 69 cents that comfortably surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 63 cents. Moreover, earnings also increased 21% year over year, which came as a big surprise to the investors.Including one-time items, quarterly earnings per share came in at 67 cents compared with 56 cents in the year-ago quarter.Moreover, the company was also impressive on the revenue front by beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the second straight quarter. The company’s revenues increased 4.8% to $8,940 million and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $8,661 million. Enterprise comparable-store sales (comps) were up 5.4%, compared with a meager gain of 0.8% reported in the prior-year period. Moreover, comps also topped the company’s expectation primarily owing to robust demand for technology products.Adjusted operating profit came in at $323 million, up 11.4% year over year. While adjusted operating margin was 3.6%, in comparison with 3.4% in the prior-year quarter.Segment DetailsDomestic segment revenues gained 4.9% year over year to $8,272 million, primarily owing to 5.4% increase in comparable sales, partially offset by loss of revenues from 11 large-format as well as 42 Best Buy Mobile store shut downs.Domestic comparable-online sales increased 31.2 % to $1.1 billion.
