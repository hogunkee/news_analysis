2,AMAT,"The equity markets bounced back yesterday as the House of Representatives passed a historic tax bill, inching closer to a legislative tax overhaul centered on President Trump’s electoral promise. With corporate taxes likely to come down from 35% to 20%, expectations of higher corporate earnings and dividend payouts are likely to drive stocks.As investors employ a wait-and-see approach in a classic example of “backing and filling” in the market, they could benefit from ‘cash cow’ stocks that garner higher returns.However, singling out cash-rich stocks alone does not make for a solid investment proposition unless they are backed by attractive efficiency ratios like return on equity (ROE). A high ROE ensures that the company is reinvesting its cash at a high rate of return.ROE: A Key MetricROE = Net Income/Shareholders’ EquityROE helps investors distinguish profit-generating companies from profit burners and is useful in determining the financial health of a company. In other words, this financial metric enables investors to identify stocks that diligently deploy cash for higher returns.Moreover, ROE is often used to compare the profitability of a company with other firms in the industry – the higher, the better. It measures how well a company is multiplying its profits without investing new equity capital and portrays management’s efficiency in rewarding shareholders with attractive risk-adjusted returns.Screening ParametersIn order to shortlist stocks that are cash rich with high ROE, we have added Cash Flow greater than $1 billion and ROE greater than X-Industry as our primary screening parameters. In addition, we have taken a few other criteria into consideration to arrive at a winning strategy.Price/Cash Flow less than X-Industry: This metric measures how much investors pay for one dollar of free cash flow. A lower ratio indicates that investors need to pay less for a better cash flow generating stock.Return on Assets (ROA) greater than X-Industry: This metric determines how much profit a company earns for every dollar of asset, which includes cash, accounts receivable, property, equipment, inventory and furniture. The higher the ROA, the better it is for the company.5-Year EPS Historical Growth greater than X-Industry: This criterion indicates that continued earnings momentum has translated into solid cash strength.   Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Here are five of the 15 stocks that qualified the screen:Monsanto Company : Missouri-based Monsanto is a leading global provider of agricultural products.

6,AMAT,"Per a research report by Canalys, Apple Inc (AAPL  -  Free Report) was the market leader in the wearables bands space in the third quarter of 2017, benefiting from the launch of Watch Series 3.Canalys analyst Jason Low stated that “strong demand for the LTE-enabled Apple Watch Series 3 has dispelled service providers’ doubts about the cellular smartwatch not appealing to customers.” He also added that Apple Watch 3 hasn’t reached its “full potential” as service providers underestimated its demand.In the third quarter of 2017, Apple took the lead with shipments of 3.9 million units including 800,000 LTE editions.Apple called Watch series 3 as the “ultimate expression of Apple Watch” at its key note address at the September event. Integrated with a built-in cellular and Apple Music, the Watch is powered by a new dual core processor, which is 70% faster than its predecessor. Users can now call, text as well as access GPS and third-party applications like WeChat with the Watch.Apple had touted the built-in cellular as the USP of the Watch. However, initially, the Watch had troubles connecting to LTE. A bug caused the watch to join unauthenticated Wi-Fi networks, thus preventing it from connecting to cellular networks. In October, Apple released the watch OS 4.0.1 update to Apple Watch Series 3, which fixes the bug.We note that Apple doesn’t provide any data on Watch sales. On its last earnings conference call, the company said that Watch sales were up 50% for the third successive quarter while the entire wearables business was up 75% year over year.Though its current contribution to the top line is minimal, Watch underscores Apple’s efforts to reduce its dependence on iPhone. iPhone sales constitute the major chunk of Apple’s revenues.Apple Inc. Revenue (TTM) Apple Inc. Revenue (TTM) | Apple Inc. QuoteComing back to the report, Xiaomi and Fitbit (FIT  -  Free Report) occupied the second and third spots in the wearables space with shipments of 3.6 million and 3.5 million units, respectively. Overall, the market was down 2% to 17.3 million units, marred by falling demand of basic bands, added the report.Zacks Rank and Share Price MovementApple carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Notably, the company has outperformed the industry in the past year. Shares of Apple have surged 55.8% compared with the industry’s 54% rally.Stocks to ConsiderBetter-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector include NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report) Applied Materials (AMAT  -  Free Report), and Jabil Inc (JBL  -  Free Report).

(GRMN  -  Free Report) hit a new 52-week high of $61.28 on Nov 14, closing a shade lower at $60.75.The share price momentum has been largely driven by the company’s impressive third-quarter results.

The company also unveiled new wearables including vívoactive 3, vívomove HR, vívosport and vívofit jr.

The year-over-year increase was backed by higher demand across outdoor, marine and aviation segments.Moreover, the company raised its guidance for full-year 2017.

13,AMAT,"Per a TechCrunch report, Apple Inc (AAPL  -  Free Report) has acquired InVisage Technology, the startup behind QuantumFilm technology. The acquisition is likely to have been completed almost a month back.TechCrunch noted that many InVisage tech employees have stated on their LinkedIn accounts that they now work for Apple. The report added that several people connected to InVisage were contacted who conveyed that “they were not at liberty to discuss the acquisition, but in doing so also inadvertently confirmed that it took place.”Why Is Apple Interested in QuantumFilm Tech?Founded in 2006, InVisage is a startup that specializes in developing image sensors. Its QuantumFilm technology as described by InVisage “is a photosensitive layer that relies on InVisage’s newly invented class of materials to absorb light; specifically, the new material is made up of quantum dots, nanoparticles that can be dispersed to form a grid once they are synthesized. Just like paint, this dispersion of solid materials can be coated onto a substrate and allowed to dry.”Apple Inc. Price Apple Inc. Price | Apple Inc. QuoteIn short, QuantumFilm’s image sensors are designed to allow maximum “light sensing capability” compared with the conventional sensors.Though Apple hasn’t disclosed the reason behind InVisage’s acquisition, its a no-brainer that the company will leverage this image sensor technology to make cameras on iPhones much better. The iPhone camera has always been a big draw for users.Also, reportedly, this technology can help Apple improve its Face ID sensors. iPhone X is the first iPhone to use Face ID technology for phone unlocking.Since Apple is now building several key components in-house like bionic chips in the latest phones as well a graphics processor, it is possible that the company might consider manufacturing image sensors, adds Business Insider.Zacks Rank and Share Price MovementAt present, Apple carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

18,AMAT,"Apple Inc.’s (AAPL  -  Free Report) fiscal fourth-quarter 2017 results showed a massive reacceleration in China sales after several quarters of decline. China WoesStiff competition from the likes of cheaper handsets like Oppo, Vivo and Xiaomi primarily affected Apple’s market share and revenues in the region. This sparked off investor concerns as China was (and still remains) vital to Apple’s performance.China is the biggest market for Apple after the United States and Europe and contributes 16% to 19% of revenuesChina Numbers in DetailsIn the fourth quarter, Apple saw improvement in iPhone, Mac, iPad and Services segment across the region, leading to a 12% increase in revenues to $9.8 billion. This represented 16% of total revenues, after Americas (44%) and Europe (25%).This was in stark contrast to a decline of 30% witnessed in the year-ago quarter. Also, sales in the region had declined 12%, 14% and 10% in the first, second and third quarters of 2017, respectively.In the fourth quarter, iPhone shipments registered double-digit growth (driven mostly by iPhone 8 and 8 Plus) while iPad shipments saw 25% rise. Mac and Services segment revenues from the region reached an all-time high per Apple.Will the Momentum Continue?We believe iPhone X sales should help to sustain the momentum. However, Chinese handset makers have already upped their ante and are coming up with their own high-end devices.Per a report by IDC, “Apple's rebound shows there is still pent up demand for iPhones in China.” IDC said there is huge demand for iPhone X in China as it looks very different from the earlier iPhones.India – Another Big OpportunitySince last year, Apple has been focused on expanding its footprint in India. The country presents an attractive growth opportunity for the company over the long run, given its younger population and increasing investment in 4G networks. Apple has partnered with Reliance Jio and Bharti Airtel. Also, Apple has set up its first manufacturing unit in Bangalore, Karnataka and teamed up with Wistron Corp. from Taiwan to take care of the assembly of the iPhones, mostly SE models.This seems to have worked. Apple said it witnessed “great momentum” in India in the fourth quarter, which led a two-fold rise in revenues. iPhone shipments increased in double digits, similar to other markets like mainland China, the Middle East, Central and Eastern Europe, Mexico. iPad unit sales grew 39% in the quarter.Apple remains keen on India as it is predicted to become the second largest smartphone market. Apple, at present, holds only about 2% of the market and there is huge scope for expansion.Zacks Rank & Stock Price MovementCurrently, Apple carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The company’s shares marginally outperformed the broader market in the past year.

21,AMAT,"Investors always try to hit the jackpot while picking stocks. But striking the right chord each time is not easy unless you are blessed with Midas touch.When it comes to the investment market, experts consider value style as one of the most effective approaches. In value investing, investors pick stocks that are cheap but fundamentally sound. So, the chance of outperformance is high when the market moves higher.There are different valuation metrics to determine a stock’s inherent strength but a random selection of ratios cannot serve your purpose if you want a realistic assessment of a company’s financial position. For this, we would recommend Price to Cash Flow (or P/CF) as one of the key metrics. This metric evaluates the market price of a stock relative to the amount of cash flow that the company is generating on a per-share basis — the lower the number, the better.Price to Cash Flow Reveals Financial Health Questions may arise as to why we are considering the Price to Cash Flow valuation metric, when the most widely used metric is Price/Earnings (or P/E). Well, what makes P/CF stand out is that operating cash flow adds back non-cash charges such as depreciation and amortization to net income, truly reflecting the financial health of a company.Analysts caution that a company’s earnings are subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation. However, cash flow is reliable. It is net cash flow that reveals how much money a company is actually generating and how effectively management is putting the same to use.A positive cash flow indicates an increase in the company’s liquid assets. This gives the company the means to settle debt, shell out for its expenses, reinvest in its business, endure downturns and finally pay back its shareholders. Then again, a negative cash flow implies a decline in the company’s liquidity, which in turn lowers its flexibility to support these moves.What’s the Optimum Strategy?However, an investment decision solely based on the P/CF metric may not fetch the desired results. To identify stocks that are trading at a discount, you should expand your search criteria and take into account price-to-book, price-to-earnings and price-to-sales ratios. Adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a Value Score of A or B to your search criteria should give you even better results as they eliminate the chance of falling into a value trap.Here are the parameters for selecting true value stocks:P/CF less than or equal to X-Industry Median.Price greater than or equal to 5: The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.Average 20-Day Volume greater than 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.P/E using (F1) less than or equal to X-Industry Median: This parameter shortlists stocks that are trading at a discount or are equal to its peers.P/B less than or equal to X-Industry Median: A lower P/B compared with the industry average implies that there is enough room for the stock to gain.P/S less than or equal to X-Industry Median: The P/S ratio determines how a stock price compares to the company’s sales — the lower the ratio the more attractive the stock is.PEG less than 1: The ratio is used to determine a stock's value by taking the company's earnings growth into account. PEG ratio portrays a more complete picture than the P/E ratio. A value of less than 1 indicates that the stock is undervalued and that investors need to pay less for a stock that has robust earnings growth prospect.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Value Score of less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a Style Score of A or B when combined with Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential. Here are four of the nine stocks that qualified the screening:Vishay Intertechnology, Inc. (VSH  -  Free Report), which manufactures and supplies discrete semiconductors and passive components, delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 6% over the trailing four quarters.

22,AMAT,"Apple’s (AAPL  -  Free Report) fiscal fourth-quarter 2017 earnings and revenues breezed past the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The results were boosted by the fast growing Services segment.

In the fourth quarter, iPhone contributed 54.6% to total revenues of $52.6 billion.Apple Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Apple Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Apple Inc. QuoteIn the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, total iPhone unit sales came in at about 46.7 million, up 3% year over year. Revenues from iPhone grew 2% from the year-ago quarter to $28.8 billion, falling short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $29.6 billion.We had earlier pointed out that launching three new models in quick succession will lead to cannibalization of sales. However, higher average selling price of the phones provided cushion to revenues from this segment.The segment is poised to do well now that iPhone X has been launched. The latest edition is one of the most anticipated phones and demand is said to be off the charts. With the holiday season round the corner, we believe this segment will get a massive boost.Other Segments Firing On All CylindersApple’s efforts to lessen its dependence on the iPhone segment to drive revenues seem to be paying off with robust performance at all other segments.The Services segment has become the second biggest contributor in a short span of time. The segment contributed 16% of the total revenues in the fourth quarter. Services – including revenues from Internet Services, App store, Apple Music, AppleCare, Apple Pay, and licensing and other services – surged 34% year over year to nearly $8.5 billion. App Store sales were a big contributor. Apple Music saw 75% year-over-year growth in subscriptions.Strong Services sales also helped to reaccelerate China business, which saw a 12% jump in revenues year over year. Services revenues hit an all-time high in the region, per Apple. Services revenues jumped over 40% in emerging markets with “great momentum in India”, said Apple CEO Tim Cook on the earnings call.The recovery witnessed in iPad and Macs business has been an added positive. iPad and Mac units grew 11% and 10% year over year, respectively while revenues from these increased 14% and 25% year over year.A refresh of the iPad product lineup and adoption by schools in the domestic market have played an instrumental role in driving sales. In China and India, unit sales grew 25% and 39%, respectively.Moreover, Apple Watch sales (unit) were up 50% while the entire wearbles business was up 75%.Encouraging OutlookBuoyed by strength witnessed in iPhone X demand as well as across other segments and global markets, Apple gave a very encouraging outlook for the first quarter of fiscal 2018. For the current quarter, sales are expected to be in the range of $84 to $87 billion, compared with $78.4 billion reported in fiscal first-quarter 2017.

In the past one year, Facebook’s shares have generated a return of 52.2%, compared with the industry’s gain of 31%. However, the company said that operating margins will take a hit going forward as it will make sizable investments to strengthen security on its platform in light of recent developments. Also, expenses will rise due to investments made in video content to support Watch and development of augmented/ virtual reality (AR/VR) and Artificial Intelligence (AI).Additional spend on infrastructure to support and improve the available products will lead to a 100% increase in capex in 2018.

29,AMAT,"The Q3 earnings season is approaching its end, with over 327 S&P 500 companies releasing results till Nov 1, 2017. Although earnings growth is trending lower than in comparable periods, the dollar amount of total earnings is on track to reach an all-time quarterly high.As investors employ a wait-and-see approach in a classic example of “backing and filling” in the market, they could benefit from ‘cash cow’ stocks that garner higher returns.However, singling out cash-rich stocks alone does not make for a solid investment proposition unless they are backed by attractive efficiency ratios like return on equity (ROE). A high ROE ensures that the company is reinvesting its cash at a high rate of return.Why ROE?ROE = Net Income/Shareholders’ EquityROE helps investors distinguish profit-generating companies from profit burners and is useful in determining the financial health of a company. In other words, this financial metric enables investors to identify stocks that diligently deploy cash for higher returns.Moreover, ROE is often used to compare the profitability of a company with other firms in the industry – the higher, the better. It measures how well a company is multiplying its profits without investing new equity capital and portrays management’s efficiency in rewarding shareholders with attractive risk-adjusted returns.Parameters Used for Screening StocksIn order to shortlist stocks that are cash rich with high ROE, we have added Cash Flow greater than $1 billion and ROE greater than X-Industry as our primary screening parameters. In addition, we have taken a few other criteria into consideration to arrive at a winning strategy.Price/Cash Flow less than X-Industry: This metric measures how much investors pay for one dollar of free cash flow. A lower ratio indicates that investors need to pay less for a better cash flow generating stock.Return on Assets (ROA) greater than X-Industry: This metric determines how much profit a company earns for every dollar of asset, which includes cash, accounts receivable, property, equipment, inventory and furniture. The higher the ROA, the better it is for the company.5-Year EPS Historical Growth greater than X-Industry: This criterion indicates that continued earnings momentum has translated into solid cash strength.   Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Here are five of the 17 stocks that qualified the screen:Monsanto Company : Missouri-based Monsanto is a leading global provider of agricultural products.

The figure was also better than guided.The year-over-year growth was primarily attributed to growing demand in the company’s end markets. Management was particularly positive about the company’s flash-based storage segment and joint venture fab operations in Yokkaichi. The ongoing transformation to 3D NAND technology is another tailwind for Western Digital.Shares of Western Digital have gained 31.6% year to date, substantially outperforming the 17.8% rally of the industry it belongs to. Segment Revenue DetailsClient Devices soared 13% year over year to $2.7 billion. Accelerated demand for client solid state drives (SSD) and embedded flash products was beneficial for the segment.The company began the ramp up of 64-layer based client SSDs for original equipment manufacturers (OEM) during the quarter. The expansion of the product suite increased the adoption of client SSDs in OEM offerings.Client Solution also surged 16% to $1.1 billion, owing to robust performance of hard disk drive (HDD) and flash-based products. The product launches during the quarter such as iXpand Base and My Cloud Home and a microSD card of 400 gigabytes with the highest capacity to date were the major drivers. These have enhanced the company’s global retail brand value further.Data Center Services and Solutions revenues were $1.4 billion, almost flat on a year-over-year basis. Management noted that the accumulated growth of enterprise SSDs and capacity enterprise hard drives was negated by declining performance enterprise hard drives.In the capacity enterprise segment, shortage of DRAM supply still remains a concern, resulting in slow petabyte growth during the year. The company expects its 12-terabyte offering to be capable of managing varied workloads as DRAM market tightness reduces.Management noted that the acquisition of Tegile Systems, a provider of flash storage, is expected to enhance Western Digital’s product suite, thereby helping it to meet varied customer requirements. The company’s buyout of Upthere, an app-based cloud-storage startup will further enrich its solutions suite.Joint Venture DisputeNotably, management is positive about Western Digital’s flash memory joint venture with Toshiba, which is currently being taken care of by Sandisk, the company’s recently acquired subsidiary. Western Digital intends to seek a court injunction to prevent Toshiba from selling its ownership interests in the joint venture unit to SK Hynix-Bain consortium, without the consent of Sandisk.Management projects supply bit growth rate of 35% to 45% for calendar years 2018 and 2019, backed by its joint venture partnerships, which are legally compelled to provide it with NAND supply till 2029.Operating DetailsNon GAAP gross margin increased to 42.3% from 33.9% in the year-ago quarter, driven by a favorable supply-demand environment for flash-based products, product cost improvements, a higher mix of flash-based revenue, and strength in the capacity enterprise HDD product line-up.Non-GAAP operating expenses, as a percentage of revenues, decreased 250 basis points (bps) to 15.8%.Non-GAAP operating margin was 26.5% compared with 15.6% in the year-ago quarter.Balance Sheet/Cash FlowWestern Digital ended the quarter with, cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities worth of $7 billion. Net debt decreased around $600 million to $6.3 billion during the quarter, mostly driven by strong cash flow generated from business.GuidanceFor second-quarter fiscal 2018, revenues are expected to be within the range of $5.2–$5.3 billion.Non-GAAP gross margin is projected to be a bit higher compared with the previous quarter. Total operating expenses are anticipated to be almost $830 million.Interest and other expense is anticipated to be around $205 million.Management expects non-GAAP earnings to be in the range of $3.60–$3.70 per share. They also noted that the synergy targets from the acquisitions of HGST and SanDisk are on track.For fiscal 2018, Western Digital forecasts non-GAAP earnings per share to exceed $13.00.Notably, Western Digital expects to take microwave-assisted magnetic recording (MAMR) technology into production in 2019. The commercial availability of this technology will aid in the development of higher capacity drives and prove to be a key growth catalyst in the long run.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderWestern Digital has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector include Applied Materials, Inc.

44,AMAT,"Industrial goods manufacturer Ingersoll-Rand Plc (IR  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results before the opening bell on Oct 25. The company is likely to report lower revenues in the quarter due to a challenging macroeconomic environment.This, in turn, is likely to result in lower earnings for the quarter.Top-Line WoesIngersoll continues to reposition its portfolio to focus on high-barrier markets. While such efforts are encouraging, they involve upfront costs, which might lead to earnings dilution in the near term. Consequently, the company is continually under stress to maintain profitability through stringent cost-cutting measures.In addition, when the economy in Europe is highly unpredictable post the Brexit referendum, it becomes difficult for the company to increase revenues and reduce costs. In addition, Ingersoll is likely to be stifled by the renegotiated deals and restrictions imposed on trade with other European Union members. Brexit could further result in higher tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade between the U.K. and the European Union, lowering productivity of the company.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Industrial Technologies segment revenues is currently pegged at $729 million, down from $765 million reported in the second quarter. Revenues from Climate Control Technologies are also expected to be $2,992 million compared with reported revenues of $3,144 million in the prior quarter.Other Key FactorsOperating income for Industrial Technologies ad Climate Control Technologies segments are expected to be $88 million and $505 million, respectively, compared with the corresponding tallies of $92 million and $527 million in the prior quarter.Moreover, our proven model does not conclusively show that Ingersoll is likely to beat earnings this quarter as it does not possess the key components.

45,AMAT,"Shares of DST Systems Inc.  surged more than 7%, yesterday, following the company’s better-than-expected third-quarter 2017 results.The company’s non-GAAP earnings (excluding amortization of intangible assets, restructuring charges and one-time items) of 76 cents per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 73 cents. However, the company’s non-GAAP earnings registered a year-over-year decrease of 1.3%.Notably, the stock price underperformed the industry in the past one year. While the industry gained 21.9%, the stock yielded a return of just 20%.Quarter DetailsTotal revenues in the third quarter came in at $562.6 million, up 45.5% from the year-ago quarter. Excluding out-of-the-pocket reimbursements, consolidated operating revenues increased 43.6% year over year to $524.8 million, ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $511 million. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to synergies from Boston Financial Data Services (""BFDS"") and International Financial Data Services U.K. (""IFDS U.K."") acquisitions.In first-quarter 2017, DST changed reportable segment structure, which splits the previously reported Financial Services segment, into two new segments, Domestic Financial Services and International Financial Services. The Healthcare Services segment remains unchanged.Domestic Financial Services operating revenues (excluding out-of-the-pocket reimbursements) rose 23.4% year over year and came in at $305.3 million. Benefits from businesses acquired from BFDS in 2017 and increased revenues from organic growth along with positive market movement at ALPS positively impacted the segment.International Financial Services Segment increased from $26.9 million reported in the year-ago quarter to $129.4 million, primarily owing to synergies from IFDS U.K acquisition.Healthcare Services operating revenues were down 1.8% on a year-over-year basis and came in at $104.2 million, primarily due client migrations.Total cost and expenses soared 63% from the year-ago quarter to $472.1 million. Also, as a percentage of revenues, costs and expenses increased from 79.2% to 89.9%.Non-GAAP operating income decreased 1.5% year over year and came in at $72.5 million, primarily due to higher stock compensation expenses. Moreover, operating margin was down from 20.1% reported in the year-ago quarter to 13.8%, primarily due to higher operating expenses as a percentage of revenues.DST Systems reported non-GAAP net income of $46.5 million compared with $50.7 million reported in the year-ago quarter.The company exited the quarter with $140.7 million in cash and equivalents compared with $139.1 million in the previous quarter. Long-term debt (including current portion) was $644.8 million compared with $645.4 million in the previous quarter.During the third quarter, DST Systems repurchased roughly 1.2 million shares worth $75 million. The company has $225 million shares remaining under the current share repurchase program.Additionally, the Board declared a quarterly cash dividend of 18 cents per share.Our TakeDST Systems reported stellar third-quarter results. Further, revenues grew year over year, primarily due to BFDS and IFDS acquisitions.We believe that DST Systems’ business volume and massive scale of operation in Financial Services will attract new customers. Moreover, we expect steady contributions from acquisitions to support revenue growth. Continued share buybacks and dividend payments are the other encouraging factors.However, persistent decline in registered accounts, ongoing consolidation in the U.S. financial services market and stiff competition from International Business Machines Corporation (IBM  -  Free Report) and Fiserv Inc. (FISV  -  Free Report) might put its fundamentals under pressure. Moreover, a high debt burden remains a major concern.Currently, DST Systems carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).A better-ranked stock worth considering in the broader technology industry is Applied Materials, Inc. (AMAT  -  Free Report), which sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

46,AMAT,"Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD  -  Free Report) is set to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 24. Notably, the company has a positive record of earnings surprises in the trailing four quarters, with an average surprise of 35%.In the last quarter, the company reported a loss of a penny per share, which was narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 2 cents per share. Revenues increased 19% year over year to $1.22 billion, primarily driven by growing demand for the Graphics Processor Units (GPU) and an expanding customer base. Revenues also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.15 billion.           AMD expects third-quarter 2017 revenues to increase 23% sequentially (+/- 3%). At the mid-point, this reflects 15% growth on a year-over-year basis. Further, gross margin is likely to be 34%, while non-GAAP operating expenses are estimated to be $400 million.AMD stock has gained 23% year to date, underperforming the 28.4% rally of the industry it belongs to. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors to ConsiderWe note that AMD has introduced a host of new products during the quarter which is anticipated to boost the top-line positively going ahead. The company unveiled AMD4U comprising gaming applications and tools that are in compliance with AMD processors and graphics.Notably, the lineup of Ryzen mainstream desktops was completed with AMD releasing Ryzen 3 1300X and Ryzen 3 1200 processors during the soon-to-be-reported quarter. The company also focused on certain advancements related to creation of professional content as evident from the company’s introduction of Radeon Pro WX 9100 and Radeon Pro SSG, a new range of professional graphics cards.Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. QuoteThe company also launched Radeon RX Vega, a gaming card aimed at enhancing experiences on PC gaming platforms. Additionally, arrival of 16-core, 32-thread Ryzen Threadripper 1950X and 12-core, 24-thread Ryzen Threadripper 1920X processors is a further positive for the company.We believe these new launches will prove to be beneficial for the company’s top line, thereby providing AMD with a competitive edge against industry peers like Intel (INTC  -  Free Report) and NVIDIA (NVDA  -  Free Report).Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Advanced Micro is likely to beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Advanced Micro’s Earnings ESP is -7.90%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at 7 cents per share and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stands at 8 cents per share. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Advanced Micro carries a Zacks Rank #3, which when combined with a negative ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 and 5 (Sell-rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stock to ConsiderA better-ranked stock in the broader technology sector is Applied Materials, Inc.

47,AMAT,"Texas Instruments (TXN  -  Free Report) or TI is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 earnings on Oct 24 after the bell.We expect the company to perform well driven by strength in several high-margin, high-growth areas of the analog and embedded processing markets. It continues to prudently invest its R&D dollars in these areas. This is gradually increasing its exposure to industrial and automotive markets and increasing dollar content at customers, while reducing exposure to volatile consumer/computing markets.We observe that shares of Texas Instruments have gained 28.1% year to date, underperforming the industry’s 32.9% rally.Expectations from AnalogTI’s analog business has been witnessing both sequential and year-over-year growth over the last four quarters. This was driven by strong performance in almost all the product lines. Last quarter, this segment generated $2.4 billion, up 6.9% sequentially and 18% from the year-ago quarter.We expect this trend to continue in the to-be-reported quarter given TI’s compelling product line and manufacturing efficiencies that include growing 300-millimeter Analog output. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Analog segment revenues is currently pegged at $2.6 billion.Expectations from Embedded ProcessingThis segment has also been growing sequentially and year over year over the last four quarters driven by growth across all product lines. Last quarter, it generated $868 million, up 8.1% sequentially and 15% year over year.This segment is also expected to do well in the to-be-reported quarter as product lines remain strong. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Analog segment revenues is currently pegged at $904 million.Texas Instruments Incorporated Revenue (TTM) Texas Instruments Incorporated Revenue (TTM) | Texas Instruments Incorporated QuoteOverall The company has always executed rather well. It, along with chipmaker Intel (INTC  -  Free Report), is one of the few semiconductor companies that depend on internal capacity for manufacturing the bulk of its devices.Since the company usually builds out capacity well ahead of demand, it is able to make opportunistic purchases. As a result, it is able to contain capex at up to 4% of sales even while on an expansion plan. Management remain focused on increasing free cash flow per share and strengthening competitive advantages.What Our Model SaysAccording to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or #3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive Earnings ESP. The Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or #5) are best avoided.Texas Instruments has a Zacks Rank #1 and an Earnings ESP of +0.43% and that indicates a likely positive surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are a couple of stocks that you may also want to consider as our model shows these have the right combination of elements to post a positive earnings surprise:Applied Materials, Inc.

The industrial market will be up sequentially and from the year-ago quarter, driven by strength from factory automation content. Also, the Communications and Data Center market is likely to be modestly up in the upcoming quarter. However, Consumer revenue is expected to be down in the December quarter, due to cyclicality.Maxim remains financially strong with convincing margin expansion opportunities through its cost-saving initiatives and R&D focus on high-return investments.The company is expanding its manufacturing footprint to enhance flexibility and profitability, while lowering capital expenditure.

51,AMAT,"The Q3 earnings season is off to a slow start and is likely to pick up pace with more releases flowing in. Although earnings growth is trending lower than in comparable periods, expectations are high that the current quarter will likely continue with the healthy growth momentum of the past few quarters.     As investors employ a wait-and-see approach in a classic example of “backing and filling” in the market, they could benefit from ‘cash cow’ stocks that garner higher returns.However, singling out cash-rich stocks alone does not make for a solid investment proposition unless they are backed by attractive efficiency ratios like return on equity (ROE). A high ROE ensures that the company is reinvesting its cash at a high rate of return.ROE: A Key MetricROE = Net Income/Shareholders’ EquityROE helps investors distinguish profit-generating companies from profit burners and is useful in determining the financial health of a company. In other words, this financial metric enables investors to identify stocks that diligently deploy cash for higher returns.Moreover, ROE is often used to compare the profitability of a company with other firms in the industry – the higher, the better. It measures how well a company is multiplying its profits without investing new equity capital and portrays management efficiency in rewarding shareholders with attractive risk-adjusted returns.Screening ParametersIn order to shortlist stocks that are cash rich with high ROE, we have added Cash Flow greater than $1 billion and ROE greater than X-Industry as our primary screening parameters. In addition, we have taken a few other criteria into consideration to arrive at a winning strategy.Price/Cash Flow less than X-Industry: This metric measures how much investors pay for one dollar of free cash flow. A lower ratio indicates that investors need to pay less for a better cash flow generating stock.Return on Assets (ROA) greater than X-Industry: This metric determines how much profit a company earns for every dollar of asset, which includes cash, accounts receivable, property, equipment, inventory and furniture. The higher the ROA, the better it is for the company.5-Year EPS Historical Growth greater than X-Industry: This criterion indicates that continued earnings momentum has translated into solid cash strength.   Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Here are five of the 28 stocks that qualified the screen:Monsanto Company : Missouri-based Monsanto is a leading global provider of agricultural products.

52,AMAT,"Industrial goods manufacturer General Electric Company (GE  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results before the opening bell on Oct 20. The company is likely to report higher industrial segment profit in the quarter on the back of a change in top management.Whether this could drive the bottom line of the company remains to be seen.Core Industrial FocusWith a reshuffle in its top management, GE intends to focus solely on its core industrial operations after completing the GE Capital exit plan. John Flannery took the helm as the Chairman and CEO of the company replacing Jeff Immelt. Flannery has led complex financial and industrial businesses of GE across the world and the company is likely to capitalize on his rich experience to fuel growth.GE is selectively acquiring assets to boost its Industrial Internet vision and improve the top line. The company is also focusing on the commercialization of the Predix software through periodic updates and new capabilities to augment its revenues.Amid this backdrop, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Industrial segment profit in the to-be-reported quarter is currently pegged at $4,546 million compared with second-quarter profit of approximately $3,947 million. Almost all the sub-segments within the Industrial segment are likely to record healthier profits on a sequential basis except Healthcare. Profit from the Oil & Gas segment is likely to double to $304 million from $155 million in the second quarter while that from Power & Water and Aviation is expected to rise to $1,277 million from $1,031 million and $1,559 million from $1,492 million, respectively.Other Key FactorsDespite prudent steps to limit its financial exposure by divesting GE Capital assets, GE is still susceptible to various market risks. The company’s objectives of simplification and productivity improvement pose operational execution risks as well. For a company as big as GE, the additional revenues needed for growth are quite large, posing a challenge to developing businesses on such a vast scale.Moreover, as Flannery assumed the role of the Chairman as Immelt retired three months in advance, three top order exits followed in quick succession. These included Chief Financial Officer Jeffrey Bornstein stepping down after 28 years of service on Oct 31, 2017 and fellow vice chairs, John Rice and Beth Comstock, retiring at year end after 39 and 27 years of service, respectively. Such sweeping changes in top management created a negative investor perception and fuelled speculations that fundamental challenges within the company are worse than what Wall Street is currently discounting.Furthermore, our proven model does not conclusively show that General Electric is likely to beat earnings this quarter as it does not possess the key components. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here as you will see below:Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is -1.01% with the former currently pegged at 49 cents and the latter at 50 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.General Electric Company Price and EPS Surprise General Electric Company Price and EPS Surprise | General Electric Company QuoteZacks Rank: General Electric has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) or 5 going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing a negative estimate revisions momentum.   Stocks to ConsiderHere are some companies that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:KEMET Corporation (KEM  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +7.46% and a Zacks Rank #1. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Synovus Financial Corp. (SNV  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.52% and a Zacks Rank #2.Applied Materials, Inc.

53,AMAT,"Danaher Corporation (DHR  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results before the opening bell on Oct 19. In the quarter to be reported, the company is expected to report strong revenues in Life Sciences & Diagnostics business, which constitutes more than half of its total revenues.Last quarter, the company’s adjusted earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 97 cents by 2.1%. The company has an excellent earnings surprise history, with an average positive surprise of 2.50% in the trailing four quarters.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.What’s Driving Better-Than-Expected Earnings?Danaher has successfully repositioned itself as a healthcare company, broadening its presence in the healthcare and dental markets, which are anticipated to benefit from the rise in the aging population as well as increased spending on healthcare and fitness.Additionally, lucrative prospects in pharma and clinical end-markets bode well for the company in the upcoming quarters. Further, Danaher believes that it is well-positioned in the biopharma business, which will prove conducive to operating profit and bottom-line growth for the third quarter.Moreover, the company’s aggressive acquisition strategy is proving to be a strong profit churner, and is expected to boost top-line growth in the quarter under review. The company also expects core growth rate to accelerate going forward, in light of improving order trends and recent acquisitions like Cepheid and Phenomenex.Phenomenex has meaningfully enhanced Life Sciences portfolio, and is anticipated to help the company achieve a double-digit return on investment in less than five years. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues from the Life Sciences & Diagnostics business in the to-be-reported quarter currently remains high at $1,403 million compared with second-quarter reported revenues of $1,384 million.Furthermore, the company’s constant focus on introduction of products to penetrate new markets has enabled it to gain competitive edge over peers. Further, Danaher remains optimistic about core revenue and earnings growth, on the back of improving order trends and its operating culture, Danaher Business System (“DBS”). Historically, DBS has contributed to meaningful core revenue growth, adjusted earnings per share improvement and cash flow generation.Other Major FactorsOur proven model shows that Danaher has the right combination of the two key ingredients. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is perfectly the case here as you will see below:Zacks ESP: Danaher has an Earnings ESP of +0.36%, as the Most Accurate estimate of 96 cents is pegged higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 95 cents.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Danaher Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Danaher Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Danaher Corporation QuoteZacks Rank: The company carries a Zacks Rank #2, which when combined with a positive ESP, makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.Conversely, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Ranks #4 or 5 (Sell-rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions.Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are some other companies that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these too have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Applied Materials, Inc.

55,AMAT,"Infosys Limited (INFY  -  Free Report) managed to impress investors with first-quarter fiscal 2018 results, wherein its earnings beat estimates by 4.3%. Infosys’ Renew New strategy, strategic partnerships, new offerings are proving conductive to the company’s impressive performance, consequently stoking growth. We believe that the earnings momentum is likely to continue as it has plenty ofroom to run. Here’s discussing a few highlights.Existing Business ScenarioInfosys recorded impressive revenue growth in the fiscal first quarter, driven by lucrative client wins along with impressive traction of new high growth services and software business. Moreover, the company’s Renew New Strategy is proving to be growth driver, helping in attracting more clients. During the reported quarter, the company added a total of two active clients.In light of the strong momentum, Infosys hiked fiscal 2018 guidance. The company now forecasts revenue growth in the range of 7.1-9.1%, up from the earlier guided range of 6.1-8.1%.The company has been diligently following its “Renew New” program, which includes restructuring of customer-centric functions, streamlining of sales function, unification of delivery systems as well asredesigning of other fee and oral processes. This program has helped the company reap multiple benefits, including renewal of traditional services, winning deals, introduction of services and improvement of employee engagement.In recent times, the company has been strengthening core competencies by pursuing strategic acquisitions that enable it to leverage emerging technologies in a mutually beneficial and cost-competitive manner. In the past few quarters, it has entered into several strategic partnerships with other technology behemoths to boost digital, cloud, legacy modernization and automation business.Further, innovation has become the keyword of Infosys’ business strategy, fostered by pursuing two avenues, namely, empowering every employee with Zero Distance Program and improving next-generation services with AiKiDo offerings (acronym for Artificial Intelligence, Knowledge-based IT and Design thinking). Innovative actions like ‘Zero Bench’ program that was devised by the company to eliminate the notion of “bench” in the IT service industry is also proving to be a major asset, bolstering itsinternal strength.However, the company faces strong competition from various big and small sector players including the likes of Applied Materials, Inc. (AMAT  -  Free Report), Arista Networks, Inc. (ANET  -  Free Report) and Apptio Inc. (APTI  -  Free Report). Further, it seems that escalating costs, President Trump’s anti-immigration stance and on-site expansion are likely to affect performance.Considering growth drivers and the risks that the company faces, we believe its focus on Renew New program, strong innovation, greater operational efficacy and robust revenue growth offer solid growth opportunities.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars? Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers.

Accenture expects operating cash flow of $5–$5.3 billion and free cash flow of $4.4–$4.7 billion.Our TakeAccenture delivered strong fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results, wherein the top and bottom lines, both, surpassed the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate and marked year-over-year improvement. Moreover, the company provided and encouraging first-quarter and fiscal 2018 outlook.Going ahead, the company’s long-term prospects look promising, driven by sustained focus on innovative product roll outs, consistent investments in enhancing digital and marketing capabilities, along with major acquisitions. In addition, we believe regular acquisitions will significantly contribute to the revenue stream.However, Accenture’s announcement of creating 15K new jobs by 2020 and investment plan of $1.4 billion for employee training and opening of 10 innovation centers across the U.S. cities may dent its bottom-line results, in our opinion.Additionally, increasing competition from peers such as Cognizant Technology Solutions (CTSH  -  Free Report) and IBM Corp. (IBM  -  Free Report), and an uncertain macroeconomic environment may deter its growth to some extent.Accenture currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A better-ranked stock worth considering includes Applied Materials, Inc.

57,AMAT,"Shares of Applied Materials (AMAT  -  Free Report) soared to a new all-time high on Wednesday after the company detailed its plans for the future at its annual analyst day, leaving some investors to wonder: should you buy AMAT as it hits a new peak?Recent MovesJust last week, RBC Capital analyst Amit Daryanani upgraded AMAT to “Outperform” from “Sector Perform” and upped its price target from $48 to $55 per share. The analyst cited an optimistic outlook about Applied Materials’ semiconductor market dominance as a major reason for the renewed confidence.Now, one day after Applied Materials celebrated its 45-year anniversary as a public company by ringing the Nasdaq opening bell, the company announced a new three-year financial outlook.Applied Materials projects to post non-GAAP adjusted earnings of $5.08 per share in fiscal 2020—the company posted EPS of $1.75 in its most recent fiscal year. AMAT also announced that it expects its service sector to experience a compound annual growth rate of 15% for the next three years, reaching revenues of $4.5 billion by 2020.“Continued strong demand for its equipment, higher process complexity and greater demand for comprehensive service agreements,” will help lead to this growth, according to a company statement.The company also authorized a new $3 billion share repurchase plan to help return cash to shareholders and invest in new technologies that should help it push forward as the Internet of Things ecosystem grows and artificial intelligence proliferates.“Our markets are strong and getting stronger. New technology inflections like A.I. and big data will increase demand for high-performance semiconductor processing and storage,” CEO Gary Dickerson said in a statement. “With the industry’s broadest and most innovative technologies, Applied Materials helps accelerate customer roadmaps by enabling chips and displays to be built in entirely new ways.”Now let’s take a look at some of the semiconductor giant’s fundamentals to see if it might be a good investment.Fundamentals Studies have shown that tapping into an average stock in a strong industry can be a better option than picking an outstanding stock in a relatively poor-performing industry. Therefore, Applied Materials’ position in the ever-growing “Semiconductor Equipment – Wafer Fabrication” industry, which currently rests in the top 5% of the 265 industries tracked by Zacks, might incite some investors.On top of that, Applied Materials is currently a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock that also sports an overall VGM grade of “A.”The company is currently trading at 14.36x earnings, which marks a discount compared to the S&P 500 and industry averages. Applied Materials’ P/S ratio of 3.56 is not outstanding, but it outpaces its industry’saverage of 4.46. Also, AMAT’s Price/Cash Flow ratio of 21.22 matches the industry’s average.Applied Materials’ Current Ratio of 2.91 falls within the generally accepted “good” range and also fares well compared to the industry’s ratio. The company’s 33.93% projected sales growth for the current year tops the 27.95% average in this booming industry. Additionally, AMAT’s 40.74% Return on Equity gives it an advantage over the industry’s 36.19% and helps show that the company is putting investors’ money to good use.After seeing its stock pop nearly 55% over the last year, the company’s share price could be ready to keep climbing. Based on our current consensus estimates, the company’s earnings are set to jump 36.93% in the current quarter and skyrocket 84.32% for the year.Maybe more importantly than Applied Materials’ staggering earnings projections, the company has experienced a ton of earnings estimate revisions recently—a metric that Zacks weighs heavily in determining the Zacks Ranks.Applied Materials has experienced five upward earnings estimate revisions for its current quarter, three for the next quarter, six for the full year, and four for the following year—all within the last 60 days.Bottom LineThis semiconductor equipment company seems poised to expand its business over the next few years and invest in new sectors of the economy that will only grow, including the IoT and AI. Along with its Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and vast amount of earnings estimate revisions, Applied Materials is certainly a stock to consider, even as it rests near a new high.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions. Apple sold a mere 1 billion iPhones in 10 years but a new breakthrough is expected to generate more than 27 billion devices in just 3 years, creating a $1.7 trillion market.Zacks has just released a Special Report that spotlights this fast-emerging phenomenon and 6 tickers for taking advantage of it.

58,AMAT,"On Sep 25, we issued an updated research report on Model N (MODN  -  Free Report), a provider of cloud-based revenue management software.Model N is benefiting from a growing customer base, transition to cloud-based applications and synergies from the Revitas acquisition. This was evident from the  third-quarter 2017 results.Adjusted loss of 14 cents per share was narrower than the year-ago quarter loss of 16 dents. The figure was also better than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 18 cents per share. Revenues of $34.2 million increased 22.7% year over year.Model N expects fourth-quarter GAAP revenues to come in the range of $34.6-$35.1 million.

Also, frequent contract wins from existing and new customers have boosted the company’s top line.Model N, Inc. Revenue (TTM) Model N, Inc. Revenue (TTM) | Model N, Inc. QuoteDuring the last reported quarter, its customer base witnessed the addition of ICU Medical, a Medtech company; a high-tech company called Diodes and Ampleon, a radio frequency (RF) power provider. Moreover, a significant number of systems became operational in the third quarter, including Smith & Nephew, Edwards Lifesciences (EW  -  Free Report), J&J Japan, Stryker (SYK  -  Free Report) and Shire.Notably, the company has eliminated duplicated general & administrative and sales & marketing costs as well as redundant products outside the life sciences vertical post the acquisition. The initiative is well reflected in its cost structure and drove its bottom line.Zacks Rank and Key PickModel N currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).A better-ranked stock in the broader technology sector is Applied Materials, Inc. (AMAT  -  Free Report), sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

59,AMAT,"Last week, Scientific Games Inc. (SGMS  -  Free Report) announced that it has reached an agreement to acquire Canada-based NYX Gaming Group Ltd. (""NYX"") for about $632 million. The company expects to complete the deal by the first quarter of 2018.Scientific Games is benefiting from its acquisition strategies and innovative product lines. Strategic acquisitions have been a key growth factor for Scientific Games over the years.We have seen that acquisitions of Bally Technologies (2014),WMS Industries (2013), Parspro and Provoloto (2012), Barcrest Group Limited (2011), Sceptre Leisure Solutions (2010) and GameLogic (2010) have expanded the company’s ability to offer computerized systems and services to the global gaming industry.Scientific Games also completed the buyout of DEQ Systems in January and Red7Mobile in July, which will help the company to solidify its position, going ahead.Coming to the NYX deal, the company says the buyout will help Scientific Games to broaden its product pipeline in digital gaming and online lottery markets.

60,AMAT,"Shares of FireEye Inc.’s (FEYE  -  Free Report) have been on the rise since it reported splendid second-quarter 2017 results. The indicators of a stock’s bullish run include a rise in its share price and strong fundamentals.Rising Share PriceFireEye has been clocking solid returns on a year-to-basis and has surged approximately 40.6%, outperforming the industry’s gain of 22.8%.Upward Estimate RevisionsIn the last 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for FireEye’s fiscal 2017 witnessed upward revisions. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2017 is currently pegged at a loss of 21 cents share compared with a loss of 29 cents projected 60 days ago.Earnings DiscussionIt seems that FireEye’s turnaround efforts such as product refreshes, acquisitions and cost optimization are paying off, as reflected from the company’s splendid second-quarter results, along with the overwhelming third-quarter and 2017 outlook. The cyber security solution provider’s second-quarter results not only fared better than our estimates, but also marked a significant year-over-year improvement.Other Driving FactorsFireEye is a specialized provider of a security platform against cyber-attacks to enterprises and governments.FireEye is currently focused on selling more subscription-based services. This business model generates recurring revenues that leads to stable revenues. Subscription-based services also generate higher margins for the company (approximately 80%) than the hardware-centric model. Notably, the company garners nearly 79% of total revenues (FY16) from these services, which has helped it to maintain gross margins above 60% over the last few quarters. We believe that the strategy will continue to boost the top and bottom line.The company has been witnessing tremendous customer growth for its subscription-based services. We believe that continued focus on subscription-based products and services along with product upgrades will boost the top line.FireEye pursues strategic acquisitions to drive growth. Its latest acquisitions include that of iSIGHT Partners during first-quarter 2016. We consider that the iSIGHT Partners buyout will prove to be a game changer for FireEye in the long run. The deal has beefed up FireEye’s cyber security suite and enhanced competitive dynamics. iSIGHT Partners invested nearly $100 million over the last eight years to build its cyber intelligence capability which can identify the source of the threat. The iSIGHT acquisition is just what FireEye needed, in our view. The buyout will strengthen the company’s current product line-up and offer an intelligence-led security model for enterprises of any size that other security providers will find difficult to match.Additionally, the long-term EPS growth rate is currently an impressive 16%, suggesting pretty good prospects for the long haul. The company also delivered positive earnings surprises in the trailing four quarters with an average beat of 63.8%.Bottom LineLooking at these positives, we believe that FireEye is one technology stock that deserves a place in investors’ portfolio. Consequently, investing in this stock can yield returns in the short term.Zacks Rank & Other PicksCurrently, FireEye carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Other top-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector include Applied Materials, Inc. (AMAT  -  Free Report), NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report) and Micron Technology, Inc. (MU  -  Free Report). All the three stocks sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

61,AMAT,"Science Applications International Corp. (SAIC  -  Free Report) has recently received a $165 million information technology (IT) contract from the Commonwealth of Virginia to serve as a multisourcing service integrator (MSI).Per the contract, Science Applications will be assisting Virginia Information Technologies Agency (VITA) in modernizing the state’s IT infrastructure.VITA is a provider of consolidated technology services and solutions for the commonwealth and it is in charge of all technology related operations of the state including procuring products and services and supervision of major IT projects.This award has a five-year base period and two 2-year options, which add up to a potential value of $272 million, if all options are exercised.SCIENCE APPLICATIONS INTERNATIONAL CORP. Revenue (TTM) SCIENCE APPLICATIONS INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION Revenue (TTM) | SCIENCE APPLICATIONS INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION QuoteThe contract entrusts Science Applications with the responsibility of monitoring the state executive branch agencies’ IT infrastructure services suppliers. This will also involve diversification of the state’s suppliers’ portfolio and improvement of the quality of service delivery. It will also look into cost effectiveness and provide a transparent view of the entire service delivery platform.Frequent Contract Wins by SAIC: A Boon or a Bane?Notably, Science Applications has been steadily winning contracts from the federal government, but these low-margin deals have affected the company’s profitability.In the recently reported fiscal second-quarter 2018, the company won a contract worth $621 million (if all options are exercised) from the General Services Administration (GSA) Federal Systems Integration and Management Center (FEDSIM). Moreover, the GSA, on behalf of the Army Software Engineering Directorate (SED), awarded another contract worth $404 million (if all options are exercised).Science Applications also won contracts from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) GSFC Omnibus Multidisciplinary Engineering Services, U.S. Navy - Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command (SPAWAR), NASA Joint Operations, and National Institute of Mental Health.These contracts ensure recurring revenues but adjusted operating income margin contracted 120 basis points (bps) to 5.5% in the reported quarter. The deals with the federal civilian bodies and re-competed supply chain management contracts weigh the most on margins. Also, an increase in cost reimbursement type contracts compared with fixed price contracts are a headwind.Nevertheless, we believe that the frequent government deals have increased the company’s prominence in the market and have positively impacted its top line.Zacks Rank and Key PicksScience Applications currently has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Better ranked stocks in the broader technology sphere include Applied Materials, Inc.

Additionally, the share price hit a new 52-week high of $48.53 on Sep 18, eventually closing at $48.05.Also, shares of Applied Materials have been steadily treading higher on a year-to-date basis. The stock returned 48.9% compared with the industry’s gain of 46.6%.Why the Hike?Analysts at RBC Capital remain optimistic about Applied Materials’ market dominance in the semiconductor space.There have been significant developments in emerging technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), virtual reality, augmented reality, big data, artificial intelligence and self-driving cars. These areas have the potential to significantly increase semiconductor spending and drive the advances in silicon technology in the future.These new technologies will be key sources of growth for Applied going ahead.Given this material shift in capital intensity due to increasing demand in these areas, the analyst believes that capital equipment spending has become less cyclical and the current wafer fab equipment (WFE) growth will continue in the near future, benefiting Applied Materials.Notably, the company has tasted considerable success in expanding beyond semiconductors, particularly in display. New display technologies like OLED and large format TVs are opening new market opportunities for Applied Materials. With about 34% of revenue coming from display and services, Daryanani expects Applied Materials to remain in a better position to deal with WFE cyclicality compared with its peers.Also, Daryanani expects the company earnings per share to increase to more than $4.00 per share by fiscal year 2020. He believes that modest WFE growth, margin expansion, display tailwinds, expansion in China and buybacks, among others, will drive earnings in the years to come.With its sustained focus on growth areas, sound fundamentals, margin expansion and strength within the semiconductor space, Daryanani remain positive about the company’s overall success in the future.To add to it, the analyst expects Applied Materials’ Analyst Day, which is to be held on Sep 27, to be a positive event.Applied Materials, Inc.

(SNPS  -  Free Report) recently announced the completion of the buyout of a privately-held self-funded company, QuantumWise.

However, the financial terms of the deal have been kept under wraps.Headquartered in Copenhagen, Denmark, QuantumWise tools and solutions reduces time-to-marketand cost by enabling co-optimization of materials, processes, devices, and circuits across many applications, including semiconductors and electronics. The integration of QuantumWise with Synopsys' Sentaurus TCAD will aid Synopsys better in managing simulation tasks and analyzing simulation resultsThe acquisition is expected to strengthen its position in the TCAD business. By using QuantumWise's solutions, the company will be able to create a higher-quality initial Process Design Kits (PDKs) for Design-Technology Co-Optimization (DTCO). In short, the acquisition will enhance its technical efficiency along with augmenting product and service portfolio.According to Synopsys, ""The QuantumWise technology is a key component of our DTCO solution as it enables the systematic evaluation of new materials by providing TCAD models in the very early stages of technology research before wafers are available."" Consequently, the acquisition will help Synopsys to reduce the costly and time-consuming test wafer runs when evolving a new semiconductor device or technology.Furthermore, through the acquisition, Synopsys will gain QuantumWise’s customers thereby boosting the top line.Notably, in the year-to-date period, the stock has outperformed the industry to which it belongs to.

66,AMAT,"Alphabet Inc.'s (GOOGL  -  Free Report) Google continues to grapple with legal hassles as it faces fresh allegations for practicing pay discrimination against its female workforce. The suit was filed on Thursday in San Francisco Superior Court on behalf of former women employees Kelly Ellis, Holly Pease, and Kelli Wisuri who accused Google of placing women employees in lower career paths. They also say that the company is paying them lower salaries and bonuses than their male peers.The suit claims that Google violated the California Equal Pay Act and urged the court to compel it to pay for damages and correct its hiring practices.We observe that Alphabet has gained 17.7% year to date, outperforming the 14.6% rally of the industry it belongs to.James Finberg, a San Francisco attorney and the lawyer for the plaintiffs stated that ""this lawsuit is an effort to pull down the barriers and shatter the stereotypes."" He added, ""We can bring about positive change not only at Google but at other companies in the Silicon Valley"".Finberg expects the lawsuit to attain class action status and represent all women who worked for Google in California over the last four years.Google’s ReactionSenior manager of corporate communications at Google, Gina Scigliano wrote in an email that the company does not agree with the lawsuit’s central allegations.Alphabet Inc. Revenue (TTM) Alphabet Inc. Revenue (TTM) | Alphabet Inc. Quote“Job levels and promotions are determined through rigorous hiring and promotion committees, and must pass multiple levels of review, including checks to make sure there is no gender bias in these decisions,” she wrote. She added “And we have extensive systems in place to ensure that we pay fairly”.Does the Gap Really Exist?Earlier this month, The New York Times published salary data shared by around 1,200 Googlers (roughly 2% of the company’s global workforce) in the United States.The data containing salary and bonus information for 2017 disclosed that women make less than men in 5 out of 6 job levels. At level 3, the entry level for technical positions, women get 4% less in salary and bonus than men. The gap widens to 6% at level 5. Google said that the spreadsheet information ignored a number of important factors such as employee location, position and performance.The lawsuit itself cites data from a 2015 review of Google’s employment practices by the contract compliance unit of the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL). A statistical regression analysis performed by the agency on pay of about 21,000 employees of the tech giant’s Mountain View office revealed “systemic compensation disparities against women.”Notably, earlier this year, the company was sued by DOL for not revealing employee pay information that the department seeks regularly for compliance evaluation.According to David Gottlieb, a civil rights attorney at Wigdor LLP in New York, despite U.S. companies and the society at large taking steps in favor of equality, gender-based pay disparity against women continues.Is Google in Trouble?The charges are disgraceful for a brand that apparently has always been vocal about its stand against any gender-based disparity. According to Fortune, on Equal Pay Day (Apr 4, 2017), Google used the Twitter (TWTR  -  Free Report) platform to announce that it has “closed the gender pay gap globally.”However, amid repeated gender disparity charges, this claim can now be taken with a pinch of salt. If Google’s found guilty, it will not only lead to a hefty penalty but also affect its brand image.Alphabet is already mired in legal troubles practically across all continents, which have earned it a bad name on privacy concerns, anti-competitive concerns, patent infringements, tax theft and what have you.Recently, the European Commission (“EC”) slapped a record $2.9 billion fine on the company for favoring Google Shopping/Google Product Search/Froogle over comparison shopping services of competitors. Google has appealed against this fine.The company has two other cases pending. One of these is related to Google using the Android platform to force hardware makers bundle Google services and prevent the preloading of rival services on the devices. The other involves restricting access to ads provided by its competitors, which might hit its core AdSense business. Therefore, investors remain wary.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderAlphabet carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector include Activision Blizzard, Inc.

68,AMAT,"Per media reports, Facebook Inc (FB  -  Free Report) has furnished “detailed” records on Russian ad spending during U.S. Presidential elections to special counsel, Robert Mueller. This was in response to Mueller obtaining a search warrant against the tech giant.There has been a widespread speculation that Russia meddled with 2016 U.S. presidential elections that resulted in Donald Trump’s victory. To investigate this, the Department of Justice (DoJ) appointed Mueller, an ex FBI chief.Per Wall Street Journal, the furnished records include details of the accounts and the copies of ads and the targeted audience. Almost a fortnight back, Facebook revealed to Congress that it identified Russian accounts (about 470) spending nearly $100,000 in ads (over 3K) coinciding with the U.S. election (from June of 2015 to May of 2017), causing a massive uproar.Facebook, Inc.

Also, Facebook feared that revealing everything to Congress escalated chances of a leak compared to furnishing details to DoJ.Business Insider quoted ex federal prosecutor Renato Mariotti who said that the warrant implies that “Mueller has concluded that specific foreign individuals committed a crime by making a 'contribution' in connection with an election.""Mariotti further added, ""That has implications for Trump and his associates, too. It is a crime to know that a crime is taking place and to help it succeed. That's aiding and abetting. If any Trump associate knew about the foreign contributions that Mueller's search warrant focused on and helped that effort in a tangible way, they could be charged.""However, there has been no word from Mueller’s office while Facebook has maintained that it will cooperate with the concerned authorities.Zacks Rank and Share Price MovementFacebook carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Notably, the company has outperformed the industry in the past year.

The deal for sure will expand the transportation-related technology services portfolio of the original equipment manufacturer of positioning, surveying and machine control products.The financial details of the deal have been kept under wraps.On a year-to-date basis, shares of Trimble have been steadily treading higher. The stock has returned 31.5% compared with the industry’s gain of 24.5%. This has been largely backed by the company’s aggressive merger and acquisition strategy.10-4 Systems Deal Complements Trimble's PortfolioAcquisitions have helped Trimble in building a comprehensive portfolio, entering new markets and generating additional revenues.Headquartered in Boulder, CO, 10-4 Systems offers transportation-related applications and technologies. These solutions help shippers and carriers to electronically monitor the movement of goods and process freight transactions in a more transparent and an effective way.The acquisition, effective immediately, will enhance Trimble’s capabilities in serving its customers in the transportation business. The deal will allow Trimble to add 10-4 Systems’ cloud-based solution for its small carriers, thereby providing increased visibility to shipments. It will focus on advanced technologies and implementation solutions for better freight management. The acquisition will enable Trimble to provide its customers with robust and effective transportation enterprise solutions.Post acquisition, 10-4 Systems’ businesses will become part of Trimble's Transportation Segment (TMS). Also,Travis Rhyan, president and CEO of 10-4 Systems, will continue to lead the business as the executive vice president and general manager.Bottom LineThe acquisitions are part of Trimble’s bid to expand its international business, while sustaining focus on commercial applications. These being more macro-sensitive, allow a stable revenue stream and better profits.Trimble has added a large number of companies to its portfolio in the last few years. In June, Trimble acquired privately held company, Innovative Software Engineering (ISE),which offers telematics systems to track driver hours of service and vehicle maintenance. In April, it acquired Muller-Elektronik, a German-based company which specializes in implement control and precision-farming solutions. In 2014, 2015 and 2016, it acquired 10, five and three companies, respectively, as well as important assets of several others to complement its current business and capabilities.These acquisitions are small in comparison to Trimble, so there have been no integration issues. Instead, the acquisitions facilitated market expansion and revenue buildup. The company also forms joint ventures to build positions in strategic areas. We expect acquisitions to remain an important growth driver going ahead.Trimble Navigation Ltd. Price and Consensus  Trimble Navigation Ltd. Price and Consensus | Trimble Navigation Ltd.

70,AMAT,"TiVo Corporation’s (TIVO  -  Free Report) shares have added more than 2% in yesterday’s trading session, outperforming the market.In the past three months, its shares have advanced 3.5%, outperforming the industry’s gain of 1.2%.Before we discuss how investors and analysts have reacted of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent fundamentals and trends in order to get a better understanding of the important drivers.Growth DriversDigital home entertainment services and solutions provider reported strong results for second-quarter 2017, wherein both the top and bottom lines came ahead of expectations. It should be noted that TiVo was formerly known as Rovi Corporation. Upon successfully completing the acquisition of TiVo Inc. in early September 2016, Rovi adopted the iconic TiVo brand name.The company posted adjusted earnings of 30 cents per share, which fared better than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 10 cents. The year-over-year improvement was primarily owing to robust top-line growth resulting from the acquisition of TiVo.TiVo’s revenues surged 66.5% year over year to $208.6 million, mainly backed by the acquisition of TiVo Inc.’s business, new licensing agreements and launch of innovative products. Notably, increasing demand for Pay-TVs prompted various Pay-TV service providers, TV manufacturers, mobile device makers and OTT companies to make licensing deals with TiVo.Prior to the acquisition, Rovi provided a set of solutions that allowed businesses to protect, enable and distribute digital goods to consumers, helping them discover and manage digital media across multiple channels. Meanwhile, TiVo Inc. pioneered a brand new category of products by developing the first commercially available digital video recorder. However, over the years, the company expanded its capabilities beyond hardware sales and patent licensing to online subscription services.The merger has brought together two leading players in the media entertainment industry, with complementary products and services, as well as a number of patented technologies. The new TiVo Corporation is the global leader in entertainment technology and audience insights. The company has a diverse product portfolio that ranges from interactive program guide to DVR. The combined company has emerged as the world’s leading media and entertainment provider to deliver the ultimate entertainment experience.Apart from this, the combined company has over 6,000 issued and pending patents, which offers it a competitive advantage over other media and tech giants.ConclusionThe stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Additionally, the stock has long-term earnings per share growth rate of 10%. Notably, the company has delivered a positive earnings surprise in three of the trailing four quarters with an average beat of 66.3%.In our opinion, the stock deserves a place in investor’s portfolio and we are expecting an impressive return from the stock in the next few months.A few better-ranked stocks worth considering are Applied Materials, Inc.

71,AMAT,"At times, it is prudent to hold on to certain stocks that have enough potential but are weighed down by tough market conditions. Five9, Inc. (FIVN  -  Free Report) seems to be one such stock, which investors should retain if they are looking to reap long-term benefits. Though the stock is facing a few headwinds at the moment, these are transitory in nature. There is enough scope for this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company to rebound in the long run.In fact, Five9has gained 56% in the year-to-date period, outperforming the industry’s rally of 19%.Factors In Favor of Five9Five9 offers a virtual contact center cloud platform that acts as a hub for interaction between clients and customers. This facilitates contact center operations focused on inbound or outbound customer interactions within a single unified architecture. The company offers software products such as workforce management, speech recognition, predictive dialer and voice applications.The cloud-based contact center solution industry has been witnessing growth over the past several quarters as organizations are looking for ways to minimize costs and improve customer support. We believe that Five9 has been capitalizing on this opportunity, which is a tailwind.Moreover, the company’s consistent focus on expanding product portfolio will aid financial performance.The company has an expected EPS growth rate of 20%. Notably, the stock has delivered positive earnings surprises in the trailing four quarters with an average beat of 100%.In the last 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Five9’s current year witnessed upward revisions. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current year is now pegged at 1 cent compared with a loss of 2 cents projected 60 days ago.Risks PersistWe note that Five9 currently has a trailing 12-month Price/Book Value (P/B) ratio of 37.50. This level compares unfavorably with what the industry witnessed over the last year. The ratio is higher than the average level of 31.52. Hence, valuation looks slightly stretched from a P/B perspective.Furthermore, intensifying competition from small and large players like Cisco Systems (CSCO  -  Free Report) is likely to dent Five9’s first-quarter performance.Our TakeWe expect the aforementioned factors to help the company sustain strong momentum and stay afloat amid difficult times. Consequently, we suggest that investors hold on to the stock for the time being.A few better-ranked stocks worth considering are Applied Materials, Inc.

74,AMAT,"Per a Bloomberg report, Facebook Inc (FB  -  Free Report) is likely to be summoned by The Senate Intelligence Committee to testify regarding the Russian interference in U.S. Presidential election.Bloomberg quoted Senate Committee Chairman Richard Burr saying that, ""We’re in agreement on a Facebook public hearing. It’s just a question of when and potentially the scope.”Reportedly, Mark Warner, another senator from the panel, put focus on a Daily Beast report that claimed that Russians used Facebook’s platform to organize protests rallies including anti-immigrant protests in August 2016. Reports add that Warner is dismayed as Facebook chose not to reveal this information to the Senate. Per him, this is the “tip of the iceberg” and extensive probe will help to uncover a lot details.Facebook, Inc. Price Facebook, Inc. Price | Facebook, Inc. QuoteFacebook is in the eye of the storm ever since it revealed to Congress that it identified Russian accounts (about 470) spending nearly $100,000 in ads (over 3K) coinciding with the U.S. election (from June of 2015 to May of 2017). This has caused a massive uproar.A few days back, Facebook furnished extensive “detailed” records on Russian ad spending during U.S. Presidential elections to special counsel, Robert Mueller. This was in response to Mueller obtaining a search warrant against the tech giant. Per The Wall Street Journal, the furnished records include details of the accounts and the copies of ads and the targeted audience.There has been widespread speculation that Russia meddled with 2016 U.S. presidential elections that resulted in Donald Trump’s victory. To investigate this, the Department of Justice (DoJ) appointed Mueller, an ex FBI chief.Notably, Twitter is also likely to be summoned by the Senate over Russian involvement in the elections.Since the elections, social media companies, especially Facebook and Twitter, have been under fire for dissemination of fake news that allegedly influenced elections. These companies are battling extensive PR damage. Moreover, pressure from governments of various countries including France, Germany (which goes into election few days from now) and Britain to curb spread of fake news and extremist activities on their platform is mounting.Facebook has been tightening control over what is displayed on its platform by enabling third party verification. Facebook said it will also scrutinize ads that promote bogus stories for monetary gains. The company said that it will work with the entire news industry to improve its fact checking systems. Facebook made the “Trending” feature more automated to minimize human intervention. The company has done away with the need to write description for trending topics that required news curators to do the job. It also has deployed artificial intelligence to tackle terrorism.Zacks Rank and Share Price MovementFacebook carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Therefore, if you haven’t taken advantage of the share price appreciation yet, it’s time you add the stock to your portfolio.The company has performed extremely well so far this year and has the potential to carry on the momentum in the near term.Why an Attractive Pick?Share Price Appreciation: A glimpse of the company’s price trend reveals that the stock has had an impressive run on the bourse year to date.

The company outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, delivering a positive average earnings surprise of 23.1%.Strong Growth Prospects: The company’s Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 earnings of $4.62 reflects year-over-year growth of 7,602.2%. Moreover, earnings are expected to register 32.2% growth in 2018. The stock has long-term expected earnings per share growth rate of 10%.Growth Drivers: Micron offers both DRAM and NAND products. While DRAM chips are key components in PCs, NAND flash chips are crucial for portable electronic devices.Improving prices for DRAM and NAND chips make us confident about Micron’s growth. Per various sources, the prices for these specific chips have improved primarily due to a better product mix optimization and higher-than-expected demand for PCs, servers and mobiles.Mergers and acquisitions are actively expanding Micron's core business. Notably, the company acquired the remaining stake in Inotera in December and made the brand a wholly owned subsidiary in Taiwan.It is worth mentioning that Inotera will have some operational benefits, leading to efficient management of investment levels and cadence, followed by alignment with global manufacturing operations.Going forward, the acquisitions of Elpida and Rexchip (now known as Micron Memory Japan, Inc. and Micron Memory Taiwan Co., Ltd., respectively) will increase Micron’s traction in the memory market.Micron is positive about the product launches and growing demand, particularly that of SSD products. We also believe that any increase in prices will have a favorable impact on the company’s overall results. We anticipate these benefits to be a tailwind for the company, going forward.Other Stocks to ConsiderOther stocks worth considering in the broader technology sector include Activision Blizzard, Inc.

76,AMAT,"Chicago submitted its bid for Amazon.com, Inc.’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) second headquarter (Amazon HQ2) on Monday.Last month, Amazon announced plans for another headquarter in North America that can accommodate approximately 50,000 employees. It will spend $5 billion for it.The list of cities showing interest has been expanding since then. So far, American cities in the race include Chicago, IL; Baltimore, MD; Arlington, VA; Denver, CO; Dallas, TX; Kansas City, MO; Minnesota; Philadelphia, PA; Nashville, TN, Indianapolis, IN; San Antonio, TX; St. Louis, MO and Pittsburgh, PA.We take a look at what the Chicago has to offer as a potential Amazon HQ2 location.Amazon’s PreferenceAmazon prefers urban or suburban but metropolitan locations, home to more than 1 million people, offering a stable and business-friendly environment, real estate options and with resources to attract strong technical talent.Amazon.com, Inc. Revenue (TTM) Amazon.com, Inc. Revenue (TTM) | Amazon.com, Inc. QuoteThe location need not have to offer an urban or downtown campus, a layout resembling Amazon’s Seattle campus or a development-prepped site. Notably, Amazon has stressed on “communities that think big and creatively when considering locations and real estate options.”We observe that Amazon shares have gained 34.2% year to date, underperforming the 52.8% rally of the industry it belongs to.Chicago’s OfferingsAccording to Governor of Illinois, Bruce Rauner, “Chicago offers unparalleled potential for future growth for businesses of all sizes and is the ideal place for Amazon to build its HQ2.” “This bid will demonstrate to Amazon that Chicago has the talent, transportation and technology to help the company as it reaches new heights and continues to thrive for generations to come,” he added.We observe that Chicago has what it takes to meet Amazon’s criteria. The city has two international airports — O'Hare and Midway —with around 1,450 daily direct flights to more than 245 destinations.But factors that could really help Chicago leave other cities behind in the race are a functional mass transit system, a commercial real estate market and the ability to attract real talent through top universities. In terms of wages and real estate costs, Chicago is a low-cost alternative to several coastal cities.Amazon already has an association with Chicago. The company’s downtown Chicago office houses 200 employees and has been expanded recently to house 200 more. Its distribution centers are spread throughout the city and the state.To ConcludeNo matter which city Amazon picks, HQ2 will have a huge positive impact on its economy. Amazon in its press release notes that from 2010 to 2016, the company’s investments in Seattle have generated an economic impact of $38 billion in the city. That’s an additional $1.4 against each dollar invested in Seattle by Amazon.City and state heads are surely eyeing a repetition of Amazon’s economic impact on Seattle in their own areas and thus have started to gear up to grab the opportunity.Currently, cities and states are trying to attract technology companies as they bring in huge employment opportunities and other businesses, thus boosting the overall economy. They are ready to give away massive benefits mainly in the form of tax breaks as they know that economic development often outweighs loss in tax.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderAmazon has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).Better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector include Micron Technology, Inc.

78,AMAT,"After a considerable delay of more than two and a half years, Apple Inc (AAPL  -  Free Report) has received approval from Ireland’s High Court to build the proposed data center, per media reports.The Irish Court has rejected three appeals that claimed the construction would damage the environment. The data center will be located in rural area of western Ireland and will be powered by renewable energy.It is worth mentioning that Apple has publicly committed to powering its data centers with 100% renewable energy. Apple is one of the leading companies to have taken up climate change issues head on. Currently, the company sources 96% of its worldwide energy from renewable sources, while all its data centers run on 100% renewable energy.Apple Inc. Price Apple Inc. Price | Apple Inc. QuoteThe data center in Ireland will reportedly provide 300 temporary jobs (construction) and will employ 150 people, once functional.Per Reuters, the delay had made Apple irate and as a result, the company’s representatives had told the Irish Prime Minster Leo Varadkar that the company will need to think of future investments in the country.One in every 10 jobs created in the country comes from multinational corporations and thus Ireland cannot afford to be lackadaisical in its approach for giving approvals for investments like data centers. The government is already working on simplifying laws that will categorize data centers as strategic infrastructure to enable speeding up of the planning process, added Reuters further.In July 2017, Apple had announced that it was planning to spend $921 million to open a new data center in Denmark, which will commence operations in the second quarter of 2019.The planned facility will be located in Aabenraa and will mark Apple’s second renewable energy-powered data center in Denmark. The company’s first data center (announced in 2015 along with the Ireland data center) in the country is under construction and is expected to initiate operations later this year.Apple is also expanding its data center footprint in the United States to create more jobs. The company recently announced that it will be investing $1.3 billion in setting up a sprawling data center in Waukee, IA. Construction will begin in 2018 and is expected to conclude by 2020, supporting over 550 jobs.Zacks Rank & Stock Price MovementAt present, Apple carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

The strength is driven by cloud computing, big data, mobile devices and IoT.The company is doing well and expects to succeed in areas such as device architecture, process flow and advanced packaging technology inflections.The company also continues to see increased adoption rates for 3D NAND technology, FinFETs and multi-patterning. The company has undertaken cost-reduction activities and density scaling for 3D NAND and new memory technologies. All these factors could positively impact the top-line figure of the company.However, volatility in the PC market remains a major concern. The weakness in the PCs could offset the expansion in the 3D NAND, impacting the upcoming results.Also, the company faces significant competition in all its product and service categories in the semiconductor capital equipment market.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Lam Research is likely to beat estimates this quarter.

80,AMAT,"Industrial goods manufacturer, IDEX Corporation (IEX  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results after the closing bell on Oct 16. In the last reported quarter, adjusted earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2 cents. IDEX’s earnings track record has been quite healthy, having beaten estimates in three of the trailing four quarters with an average beat of 4%.Let's see how things are shaping up for the upcoming quarterly results.Key Factors to ConsiderWith operations across five continents, IDEX’s performance is exposed to the adverse impact of macroeconomic cycles in the United States and international markets. Rising dollar strength and unfavorable foreign currency movements are further likely to add to the woes and impact its bottom line.In addition, the company operates in a highly competitive industry. Maintaining and improving its competitive position entails continued investment in manufacturing, engineering, quality standards, and support and distribution networks. This involves huge recurring R&D expenses that increase its operating costs. This also reduces IDEX’s price control over its products, which often leads to loss of market share, decline in top-line growth and lower operating margin. The impending quarterly results are likely to witness these trends as well, affecting its bottom line.For the to-be-reported-quarter, IDEX’s revenues are likely to be affected by the volatility in the market as it procures substantial amount of raw materials and components from suppliers across the globe. This makes it susceptible to various operating risks, including the availability and prices for raw materials, curtailment or change in parts and components, interruptions in production by suppliers and prevailing price levels.However, IDEX is striving to counter the muted growth environment by improving productivity and conducting heavy restructuring initiatives across its portfolio. At the same time, it aims to exploit suitable acquisition opportunities to fuel its inorganic growth momentum. These acquisitions expand its geographic reach, fill technology gaps and strengthen its foothold in the existing markets along with expanding its product lines.The company also aims to increase its market exposure and improve sales mix by continually developing new products. With a flexible yet disciplined focus on expenses and productivity, it intends to optimize the cost structure, increase competitiveness and reallocate resources to improve profitability.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that IDEX is likely to beat earnings this quarter as it does not possess the key components. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here as you will see below:Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is pegged at -0.13%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.IDEX Corporation Price and EPS Surprise IDEX Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | IDEX Corporation QuoteZacks Rank: IDEX has a Zacks Rank #2. While this increases the predictive power of ESP, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise.Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing a negative estimate revisions momentum.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some companies that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Applied Materials, Inc.

81,AMAT,"The third-quarter 2017 earnings season is at an initial stage with just 26 S&P 500 members having reported quarterly results as of Oct 11, according to the latest Earnings Outlook.Total earnings of these companies are up 22.5% on a year-over-year basis on 9.4% higher revenues. The majority of the growth in Q3 is expected to come from the Technology, Conglomerates and Energy sectors.The technology space continues to be an investor favorite owing to its dynamic nature. Per the report, the sector’s total earnings are expected to grow 9.7% from the same period last year on 6.7% higher revenues.The optimism surrounding the technology sector is well reflected in its year-to-date performance. The sector has outperformed the S&P 500 in the aforesaid period. Notably, the Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLK) returned 24.8% in the year-to-date period compared with the S&P 500’s gain of 14%.Robust Technological Development – Key CatalystThe technology sector is benefiting from increasing demand for cloud-based platforms as well as growing adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) solutions, Augmented/Virtual reality devices, autonomous cars, advanced driver assisted systems (ADAS), Big Data and expanding usage of Internet of Things (IoT) related software.Moreover, rapid development of the 5G platform is likely to be the next catalyst.

According to a research report, Gartner projects IT spending to increase 2.4% in 2017 compared with 0.3% in 2016.However, shortage of key components like DRAM, SSD and LCD panels has been increasing PC prices leading to a decline in the PC shipments, which is a concern.How to Make the Right Pick?Given the existence of a number of industry players, finding the right stocks that have the potential to beat earnings could be a daunting task. Our proprietary methodology, however, makes it fairly simple for you.

82,AMAT,"Paycom Software, Inc. (PAYC  -  Free Report) is set to report third-quarter 2017 earnings results on Oct 31.In the last reported quarter, the company posted a positive earnings surprise of 30%. The company surpassed earnings estimates in the trailing four quarters, generating an average beat of 32.1%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Expect What?The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter is pegged at 19 cents, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 26.7%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales of $100 million indicates around 29.9% growth from the prior-year quarter.Factors at PlayPaycom Software provides cloud-based human capital management (HCM) software solution delivered as Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) with functionality and data analytics to manage the complete employment lifecycle, from recruitment to retirement. We expect higher recurring revenues and higher traction in cloud-based offerings to drive Paycom Software’s business across all segments in the to-be-reported quarter. Moreover, higher adoption of the company’s Affordable Care Act (“ACA”) dashboard application acts as a tailwind.Q2 Earnings HighlightThe company reported stellar second-quarter 2016 results, where both top and bottom line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. It also provided an encouraging third quarter and fiscal 2017 revenue guidance. Moreover, both the top line and the bottom line increased on a year-over-year basis.For third-quarter fiscal 2017, Paycom Software expects revenues in a range of $99-$101 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate was pegged at $99.5 million.  The company also updated fiscal 2017 guidance. It now anticipates revenues in the range of $429.5-$431.5 million (previously $426-$428 million). The Zacks Consensus Estimate was pegged at $429.2 million.Aided by these factors, in the last one year, its shares have surged 57.5%, outperforming the industry’s gain of 16.5%.HCM & Cloud-Based Solutions: Key CatalystsThe company’s sustained focus on investing in SaaS technology and mobile applications has been driving revenues. We believe that Paycom Software’s cloud-based solution has greater demand across a wide section of verticals. Larger companies have greater and more complex HCM needs: consequently Paycom Software’s solution is evolving to serve them.Growth of cloud computing has supported the company’s SaaS delivery model. We believe that with SaaS-based applications, Paycom Software is well-positioned to lead the market for advanced human capital management and payroll software solutions. These factors are likely to positively impact the to-be-reported quarter.Recurring Revenues & Client Base: Other Positive FactorsRevenue growth seems to be steady and was positively impacted by higher recurring revenues and higher traction in cloud-based offerings. In the last reported quarter recurring revenuesincreased 33% year over year. Its solid business model, diversified products and services, and strategic acquisitions have boosted top-line growth.The Zacks Consensus Estimates for recurring revenues is pegged at $99 million.Furthermore, Paycom is winning market share over the most critical client demand area of HCM, which in turn, supports growth. The HCM solution includes talent acquisition, time and labor management, payroll, talent management as well as human resources (“HR”) management applications. These offerings have been increasingly helping clients manage both permanent and temporary workforce. Notably continuous focus on client retention, on the basis of high client satisfaction, has aided the company to maintain its average annual revenue retention rate of 91% for all the said three years.We believe that, Paycom Software is likely to boost revenues by successfully cross-selling newer products to the existing client base, going forward.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that Paycom Software is likely to beat earnings because it has the right combination of two important ingredients.Zacks ESP: Paycom Software’s Earnings ESP is +4.46%. This is because the company’s Most Accurate estimate is 20 cents, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged lower at 19 cents. A favorable ESP serves as a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Paycom Software currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Note that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 has a significantly higher chance of beating earnings estimates. Conversely, Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement.The combination of Paycom Software’s Zacks Rank #3 and +4.46% ESP makes us reasonably optimistic of an earnings beat.Other Stocks with Favorable CombinationHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.53% and a Zacks Rank #1. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Applied Materials, Inc.

The company has a solid earnings surprise history, beating estimates twice in the trailing four quarters with a positive average earnings surprise of 183.3%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Key Factors to ConsiderVASCO is continuing with its pursuit to develop innovative products that significantly reduces the risk of losses due to fraud and data theft.

85,AMAT,"Shares of DST Systems Inc.  have been clocking solid returns in the past one year and has surged approximately 5.8%, outperforming the industry’s gain of 5.4%.To some investors, choosing the stock may appear to be a no-brainer because right after an earnings release, a company is almost always on investors' radar. So, the period following earnings releases is often marked by high market activity. Moreover, indicators of a stock's bullish run include continued uptrend in estimates and strong fundamentals.Upward Estimate RevisionsIn the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for DST Systems’ fiscal 2017 witnessed upward revisions. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2017 is currently pegged at $3.08 per share compared with $3.04 projected 30 days ago.Earnings DiscussionDST Systems reported stellar third-quarter 2017 results. The company’s non-GAAP earnings of 76 cents per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 73 cents. Total revenues during the quarter came in at $562.6 million, up 45.5% from the year-ago quarter. Excluding out-of-the-pocket reimbursements, consolidated operating revenues increased 43.6% year over year to $524.8 million, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $511 million. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to synergies from Boston Financial Data Services (""BFDS"") and International Financial Data Services U.K. (""IFDS U.K."") acquisitions.Other Driving FactorsWe believe that DST Systems’ business volume and massive scale of operation in Financial Services will attract new customers. Moreover, we expect steady contributions from acquisitions to support revenue growth. Continued share buybacks and dividend payments are the other encouraging factors.The company also has a strong business model. It generates recurring revenues and a good percentage of its business comes from long-term contracts with customers. The company has developed the fee structure on a per-account and per-transaction basis, which indicates the fixed and flexible portion of revenues with respect to each client. Financial services companies that use DST System’s software to service multiple such clients generate incremental revenues with each additional client and/or transaction. The model ensures a minimum revenue level even when there are limited transactions.Additionally, the long-term EPS growth rate is currently an impressive 10%, suggesting pretty good prospects for the long haul. The company also delivered positive earnings surprises in three of the trailing four quarters with an average beat of 6.4%.Bottom LineLooking at these positives, we believe that DST Systems is one technology stock that deserves a place in investors’ portfolio. Consequently, investing in this stock can yield returns in the short term.Zacks Rank & Other PicksCurrently, DST Systems carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Other top-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector include Applied Materials, Inc. (AMAT  -  Free Report), NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report) and Micron Technology, Inc. (MU  -  Free Report) . All the three stocks sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

86,AMAT,"Western Digital Corp. (WDC  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release fiscal first-quarter 2018 results on Oct 26. Notably, the company has a decent record of earnings surprises with an average positive surprise of 9.55% in the trailing four quarters. Last quarter, the company came up with a positive surprise of 3.53%.In fiscal fourth-quarter 2017, the company reported non GAAP earnings of $2.93 per share compared with $1.03 reported in the year-ago quarter. Revenues increased 38.5% year over year to $4.84 billion and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.80 billion. Both the top and bottom line figures were better than the guided range.Let’s take a look at the factors that are expected to influence the first-quarter 2018 earnings.Key Growth DriversWe believe Western Digital will benefit from positive synergies derived from the SanDisk acquisition. The latter’s product portfolio is aiding the company’s expansion in the solid state drive (SSD) market. This is also anticipated to provide Western Digital with a competitive advantage against peers like Seagate Technology (STX  -  Free Report).Further, the continuous enhancement of the company’s product suite is a positive. The development of the industry’s first 3D NAND technology with 96 layers of storage capability in June was significant. The company’s growing footprint in the automotive as well as the connected home and industrial categories is a major tailwind.Western Digital Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Western Digital Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Western Digital Corporation QuoteNotably, the company completed the acquisition of Upthere, an app-based cloud-storage startup during the quarter. The company also entered into a definitive agreement to buy Tegile Systems, a provider of flash-driven storage arrays for database. We believe these acquisitions will help the company in expanding its presence with a wider range of products and solutions.However, the ongoing legal tussle with Toshiba regarding the memory unit in Japan remains a concern. Nevertheless, strong demand for NAND flash memory chips is anticipated to be a key catalyst.Guidance & EstimatesFor fiscal first-quarter 2018, revenues are expected to be approximately $5.10 billion, which is slightly lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.12 billion.Management expects non-GAAP earnings to be in the range of $3.25–$3.35 per share. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.30 per share is in line with the mid-point of the guided range.Per the Zacks Consensus Estimate, non-computable unit shipments are anticipated to amount to $16.7 million, while the computable unit shipments are projected to total $19 million.Zacks Rank and Key PicksWestern Digital currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector include Applied Materials, Inc. (AMAT  -  Free Report) and NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report), both sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

87,AMAT,"Amazon.com (AMZN  -  Free Report) will report third-quarter 2017 earnings on Oct 26 after the bell.We expect the company’s earnings to be hurt (as usual) by continuous heavy investments in fulfillment centers, TV shows and movies, AWS, acquisitions, India expansion and what not. It’s looking for a second headquarter in North America and plans to invest $5 billion for it. Amazon’s global margins are likely to be under pressure at least for a few years.However, revenues are expected to improve on strong Prime Day’ 17 sales, the integration of Whole Foods, a solid loyalty system in Prime and the Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA) strategy.Amazon.com, Inc. Revenue (TTM) | Amazon.com, Inc. QuoteWe observe that Amazon shares have gained 29.2% year to date, underperforming the 47.9% rally of the industry it belongs to.Factors to ConsiderAWS: It's a multi-billion-dollar business and the cash cow for Amazon. It has millions of customers and generates much higher margins than retail. It is the key driver of Amazon’s profitability.We remain optimistic about the functionality; partner ecosystem and the experience AWS offers and believe this will lead to continued customer wins.  If AWS continues to witness the same kind of success, investors can hope for significant growth this time as well.Prime: Amazon keeps its retail business very hard to beat on price, choice, and convenience with the help of a solid loyalty system in Prime and its FBA strategy. The company continues to push advantages exclusively to Prime members, thus encouraging them to spend more on Amazon. It is focused on building video content, primarily for Prime subscribers because the growth prospects in that market are considerable.Prime is now widely available and generates increased sales for Amazon. Prime Now, the company’s super-fast delivery service, is expanding rapidly in the United StatesIoT: Alexa powered Echo devices are going great guns and help the company sell products and services. Alexa has already been integrated into a host of everyday devices for the digital home and there are agreements for more.The company is racing to build an ecosystem around Alexa to make sure that it stays way ahead of Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report) subsidiary Google's smart assistant, Apple’s Siri and Microsoft's Cortana.Grocery Push: Amazon has already gone the brick-and-mortar way with books and is treading the same path with other merchandise as well. Its acquisition of Whole Foods indicates that it is targeting the considerably large customer base that still prefers to shop at physical stores.Amazon Go, the no-queue-checkout-counter grocery store, is going to be a boon for customers who are too worn out to stand in long lines at physical cash counters or are baffled by complicated self-checking counters. It has the ability to completely shatter the traditional brick-and-mortar convenience store setup.International Expansion: The company has been expanding Prime internationally to strengthen its foothold in international markets and create a launch pad for its other business. It could complement the company’s current expansion efforts such as investments (in India) and acquisitions (like that of Souq.com).Guidance: In the third quarter, management expects revenues to include a $125 million or 40 bps negative FX impact and come in around $39.25–41.75 billion. Operating income is expected to come in at approximately ($400) million–$300 million.What Our Model SaysAmazon has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) and an Earnings ESP of -1,219.26%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.According to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or #3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive Earnings ESP. Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) or #5 are best avoided especially if they have a negative Earnings ESP.Bottom LineIf we delve deeper into Amazon’s key investment areas, we see a futuristic approach. Amazon’s long history of execution, growing focus on innovation, technological prowess and huge cash balance not only give it the flexibility to pursue growth in any area that exhibits true potential but also to create value for investors.Amazon has never hesitated to sacrifice margins to pursue its long-term objectives, bringing more customers under its umbrella and giving them reasons to stay.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some stocks that you may want to consider as our model shows these have the right combination of elements to deliver a positive earnings surprise:Applied Materials, Inc.

88,AMAT,"Seagate Technology PLC (STX  -  Free Report) reported impressive fiscal first-quarter 2018 results. Non-GAAP earnings per share came in at 96 cents, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 86 cents per share. However, the figure declined 3% on a year-over-year basis.Revenues of $2.63 billion also topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.56 billion but decreased 5.9% from the year-ago quarter. Nevertheless, both the top and bottom line figures witnessed a sequential improvement, primarily attributed to strong demand and adoption of Seagate’s storage drives.At the end of the quarter, the company participated in a Bain Capital led consortium. The consortium has entered into an agreement with Toshiba Corporation for the acquisition of Toshiba Memory Corporation. Seagate has committed $1.25 billion for the takeover, which is scheduled for March 2018.This participation will enable Seagate to enter into an agreement with Toshiba, per which the latter will provide Seagate with NAND supply, thereby helping in its innovation of hard disk drives (HDD), solid state drives (SSD) and hybrid solutions.Performance in DetailDuring the quarter, Seagate shipped a record 70.3 exabytes of HDD storage, with an average capacity of 1.9 terabytes per drive. The company shipped 27.2 exabytes for the enterprise HDD market, each with an average capacity of 3.9 terabytes.Notably, the advancement and accelerated growth of cloud storage technologies are tailwinds for Seagate’s performance. Management believes that the HDD product suite is ready to cater to the demands of the market.Nearline products’ average capacity per drive crossed 5.4 terabytes. Management noted that the company’s 10-terabyte helium nearline product was one of the top revenue generators in the quarter. Around 1 million units were shipped, which was thrice as much as in the previous quarter. Growth in the 12-terabyte helium nearline product line was also encouraging. Given the impressive customer feedback, the company expects to bank on the market adoption of these products.Within the edge and customer verticals, the notebook compute segment saw 37% year-over-year growth with exabytes increasing 75% from the year-ago quarter. Gaming business revenues were up 13% sequentially.Non-HDD segment revenues witnessed a 17% year-on-year increase and a 30% improvement sequentially to $242 million.Seagate Technology PLC Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Seagate Technology PLC Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Seagate Technology PLC QuoteMargin DetailsNon-GAAP gross margin was 29%. Non-GAAP operating expenses were down 17% on a year-over-year basis to $408 million. This decrease in expenses was primarily due to certain cost improvement initiatives.The company divested a major portion of its high performance computing assets, which is anticipated to result in a savings of approximately 20 million a year.Balance Sheet and Cash FlowSeagate ended the September quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $2.3 billion and 289 million ordinary shares outstanding. The company’s board has approved a quarterly dividend payment of 63 cents for the September quarter to be paid on Jan 3, 2018.During the quarter, cash flow from operations was $237 million and free cash flow was $113 million.GuidanceManagement anticipates, in an era of advancement of cloud solutions and growing cloud and silicon storage business segments, second-quarter revenues to increase 3% to 5% compared to the first quarter, backed by a strong growth in exabyte demand.Non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to decrease 2% to 3% from the prior quarter with further cost stringent approaches.ConclusionNotably, with the huge transformations in the storage industry mobile cloud is taking the center stage. This in turn has boosted the deployment of high-capacity mass storage products, which is beneficial for Seagate.The company’s efforts in the improvement of areal density with the ramping up of its heat assisted magnetic recording (HAMR) technology, which is expected be shipped in 2019, is yet another positive for the company.Zacks Rank and Key PicksSeagate currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector include Applied Materials, Inc.

92,AMAT,"Switzerland-based computer peripherals company, Logitech International SA (LOGI  -  Free Report) continued its impressive streak of earnings beat for the eighth consecutive quarter.On an adjusted basis, the company’s second-quarter fiscal 2018 earnings came in at 40 cents per share, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 36 cents by 11.1%. The impressive bottom-line performance can be attributed to robust sales growth across Asia-Pacific along with strong momentum in Gaming and Video Collaboration businesses.The company reported second-quarter fiscal 2018 GAAP earnings of 34 cents per share, which surged 21.4% year over year.Inside the HeadlinesNet sales for the quarter rose 12.4% year over year to $634.2 million, ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $630.2 million. Revenue growth was attributable to the solid growth recorded in Logitech’s Gaming, Video Collaboration businesses as well as Smart Home business categories. Notably, double-digit rise in sales was partially offset by a product transition in Mobile Speakers, which drove year-over-year top-line growth.Creativity and Productivity business comprises four sub-business lines — Keyboards and Combos, Pointing Devices, PC Webcams, and Tablet and Other Accessories. Of these, Pointing Devices remained flat. PC Webcams and Tablet and Other Accessories experienced an increase in sale of 13.2% and 49.5%, respectively. PC Webcams sales were driven by consistent growth in sales in the Americas and Asia Pacific, partially offset by decline in sales of EMEA region.Gaming surged 43.6% year over year to $ 113.7 million, on the back of strong growth in all three markets and launch of fresh products. Meanwhile, Video Collaboration grew 61% to $46.1 million, aided by broad-based growth in all three markets. In addition, the Music business, which comprises Mobile Speakers units and Audio-PC & Wearables, witnessed mixed performance. Audio PC & Wearables sales rose 1.5% to $63.2 million, largely offset by the drab performance of the Mobile Speaker segment, which fell 7% during second-quarter fiscal 2018.Additionally, sales under the smart home category witnessed growth of 55% to $18.3 million. The impressive performance was led by strong performance from the company’s voice-enabled Harmony Hub products.Non-GAAP operating margin contracted 10 basis points year over year to 11.4%, while non-GAAP operating income jumped 11.7% year over year to $72.4 million.Logitech International S.A. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Logitech International S.A. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Logitech International S.A. QuoteLiquidityAs on Sep 30, 2017, Logitech’s cash and cash equivalents were $398.8 million compared with $395.2 million as of Sep 30, 2016. However, the net cash provided by operating activities for the company came in at $68.4 million, a decline from the year-ago tally of $74.9 million.GuidanceConcurrent with second-quarter fiscal 2018 results, Logitech continues to project non-GAAP operating income in the range of $260-$270 million compared. Further, it continues to expect constant currency fiscal 2018 sales in the range of 10-12%.Our TakeLogitech remains optimistic that the steady traction of its product lines, as well as positive industry trends will continue to fuel growth, going forward. The broad-based growth in its retail business is a major positive and likely to continue, moving ahead. Moreover, the company’s diligent cost-cutting efforts add to its strength.However, the rising trend of smaller, mobile computing devices with touch interfaces and the declining demand in the company’s most profit-maximizing products like desktops and diverse porting tools can be a headwind in the near term. Moreover, the market where Logitech International operates is highly competitive. Strong competitors and new entrants in the company’s operating markets also remain a concern.Logitech currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks worth considering in the same space include Applied Materials, Inc.

93,AMAT,"VeriSign Inc. (VRSN  -  Free Report) is set to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 26.Last quarter, the company reported earnings of $1.05 per share, up 15.4% from the year-ago quarter and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1 per share. Notably, the company has beaten the Zack Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, delivering an average positive surprise of 5.52%.Revenues marginally increased year over year to $288.6 million from $286.5 million and came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $286.89 million as well.Shares of VeriSign have gained 41.9% year to date, slightly underperforming the 28.4% rally of the industry it belongs to.Domain Registration to Drive Growth VeriSign holds a prime position in the highly regulated .com and .net domain industry. The company is the exclusive registrar of the .com, .net and .name domains per its agreements with The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN).According to the company’s latest “The Domain Name Industry Brief”, domain name registrations across all top-level domains (TLDs) signal a positive trend, increasing 0.4% sequentially to approximately 331.9 million across TLDs at the end of the second quarter. Domain name registrations increased 6.7 million or 2.1% year over year.On a combined basis, .com and .net domain names improved 0.8% year over year to approximately 144.3 million in the second quarter. Further, new generic TLDs (ngTLD) represented 7.3% of total domain name registrations.We note that the company continues to benefit from strong demand in the United States as well as in international markets. Reportedly, in the last quarter, new .com and .net registrations were 9.2 million compared with 8.6 million in the year-ago quarter. VeriSign reported that .com continued to maintain its position as the largest TLD, followed by .cn (China) and .tk (Tokelau).Thus, strong gTLD growth, international expansion through IDNs and investments in intellectual properties will boost results in our view. We believe that increasing domain name registration coupled with price hikes for domain names will drive the top line.Moreover, VeriSign raised its domain name base growth rate guidance for 2017. The company anticipates the same to grow between 2% and 2.75%, up from its earlier forecast of 1% to 2.5%. For the third quarter, VeriSign projects domain name base registration to increase in the range of 0.8 million to 1.3 million.However, the negative impact of search engine adjustments on domain monetization and increasing operating expenses related to sales and marketing remain primary headwinds.VeriSign, Inc.

The stock surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 43.2%.What to Think?The company might witness a year-over-year increase in revenues and earnings in the to-be-reported quarter. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at a loss of 4 cents, which is narrower than the year-ago period loss of 9 cents. Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $46 million, up 31.4% from the year-ago quarter.Factors to Affect Q3 ResultsMINDBODY develops cloud-based business management software and payments platform for the wellness services industry. In the last reported quarter, MINDBODY’s sales grew 31% year over year, benefiting from 29% increase in Subscription and services revenues,and 37% increase in Payments revenues. Further, during the quarter, the company continued to focus on subscriber acquisition efforts which in turn helped it to contribute significant amounts of inventory and enabled rapid growth in consumer adoption and engagement.Notably, sales from Subscription and services revenues constituted about 59% of MINDBODY’s total revenues, which is the highest among all segments. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Subscription and services is pegged at $27.2 million. Payments revenues accounted for 40% of the total revenues in the last reported quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Payments revenues is pegged at $17.9 million.The company provides its services to over 59,000 businesses in over 130 countries worldwide. With such a huge client base, it is anticipated to post impressive earnings numbers in the third quarter. Significant investments in growth areas for improving implementation timelines, particularly for the web and mobile applications products, will boost profitability.Furthermore, the company recently, acquired Lymber Wellness, Inc. The buyout will help the company to integrate yield management technology into its platform and promote subscriber and consumer adoption. These strategic acquisitions and continuous efforts to enhance its software and payments platform are likely to be reflected in the to-be-reported quarterly results.MINDBODY, Inc.

96,AMAT,"Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL  -  Free Report) will report third-quarter 2017 earnings on Oct 26 after the closing bell.The surprise history has been decent in Alphabet’s case. The company missed estimates only once in the last four quarters and has an average four-quarter positive surprise of 5.06%.We expect the company to perform well driven by strength in paid clicks, strong advertising revenues, mobile search ads and increasing momentum in Other Bets segment.

As a result, revenues from mobile platform are expected to increase in the to-be-reported quarter.Other Bets Segment Gaining MomentumAlphabet broke up the segment in the March quarter of 2016. The segment includes Fiber, Verily, Calico, Nest and incubation activities in X Labs. Since this segment is a combination of a number of businesses that are in the pre-revenue stage, operating different models and serving diverse end markets, the results are likely to be soft in any given quarter. However, this segment is gaining momentum and has performed well in the second quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Other Bets segment for the upcoming quarter is pegged at $267 billion.Other FactorsThe increasing use of machine learning features in Google Maps, YouTube, Gmail and Google Photos will continue to drive top-line growth in the upcoming quarter.YouTube remains a strong contributor, benefiting from the increase in online video consumption.

99,AMAT,"Waste Management Inc. (WM  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results before the opening bell on Oct 26. In the last reported quarter, earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny. Over the trailing four quarters, it delivered a positive average earnings surprise of 0.3%, beating estimates only once.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Key Factors in the QuarterStringent government regulations are likely to contract Waste Management’s margins as compliance with such regulations increases operating costs. In order to develop or operate a landfill or any waste management unit, facility permits and other governmental approvals are necessary. These permits and approvals are often difficult to obtain, time consuming and costly and are likely to restrict its operations. All these might impact profitability in the quarter.The company expects volumes to be down due to lower national counts as it strives for improved margin growth and pricing. The pricing environment also remains challenging and highly competitive due to aggressive bidding by smaller competitors. Waste Management needs to improve margins on the recycling side through adjustment of rebates to reflect lower pricing and also needs to improve the quality of inbound material to increase profitability. Decline in average recycling commodity prices and recycling volumes also remain headwinds.However, Waste Management is executing well its initiatives to refocus on the core business activities and instill price and cost discipline to achieve better margins. The company further aims to focus on improving customer retention by providing better service and higher value solutions.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Waste Management is likely to beat earnings this quarter as it does not possess the key components.

This gives it an edge over competitors and allows it to grab a wider market through superior functionality and investor-oriented services. Moreover, the company is well on track with SNL Financial’s integration and anticipates generating synergies.The company’s strategic portfolio restructuring and focus on core business will continue to drive growth. This apart, strategic acquisitions and positive industry trends like surge of new high-yield bonds and leveraged loans, fuelled by tight interest-rate spreads, augur well.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for S&P Capital IQ revenues is currently pegged at $426 million, up from $414 million reported in the second quarter. Total revenues are expected to be $1,442 million compared with reported revenues of $1,439 million in the year-ago quarter. Operating profit for the S&P Dow Jones Indices is estimated to be $121 million compared with $120 million in the previous quarter while that for Commodities & Commercial markets is expected to be up from $191 million to $225 million.Other Key FactorsThe successful integration of SNL Financial is likely to complement the S&P Capital IQ and Platts businesses, which will help S&P Global avail cost cuts and revenue synergies. Moreover, it will enable global expansion on a greater scale especially within the banking and insurance sectors, while media and real estate areas are likely to emerge as new opportunities.Moreover, our proven model conclusively shows that S&P Global is likely to beat earnings this quarter as it possesses the key components.

In the last reported quarter, the company’s adjusted earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3 cents. Over the trailing four quarters, it delivered a negative average earnings surprise of 0.7%, beating estimates only once.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Key Factors in the QuarterDuring the quarter, Xerox collaborated with Innovation Lab to counter healthcare challenges. The collaboration intends to seek new products, ideas, and concepts that can be commercialized through the Innovation Lab by working in unison with physicians, employees, and industry partners. This is likely to augment Xerox’s revenues and strengthen its position in the market.Xerox is reprioritizing investments and accelerating its restructuring actions and services to improve revenues and margins. As part of the restructuring, it is executing a three-year strategic transformation program which targets incremental savings of $600 million across all segments. When combined with savings from cost streamlining actions currently in process, Xerox is attempting to realize cumulative cost reduction of $2.4 billion over the next three years.The company also remains committed to its five-plank strategy that is centered on portfolio management, global growth, cost transformation, operational excellence and analytics. With sustained investments to expand geographical footprint and build its services capabilities in areas that provide significant customer value, Xerox expects to reap benefits in the long run.However, advancements in IT have resulted in the replacement of the traditional means of sending and storing information with the digital media. As a result, Xerox is grappling with decreased demand for paper-related systems and products while its attempts to leverage the business process outsourcing market failed to lend growth momentum.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Xerox is likely to beat earnings this quarter as it does not possess the key components.

105,AMAT,"Koninklijke Philips N.V. (PHG  -  Free Report) reported modest third-quarter 2017 results, driven by robust sales growth particularly in China and in its Connected Care & Health Informatics businesses. The company also reiterated its full-year 2017 guidance.The company posted third-quarter net income of €423 million ($497 million), an increase of 10.4% compared with the prior-year quarter’s figure of €383 million. Increase of income from continuing operations drove the year-over-year improvement in operating income.Inside the HeadlinesTotal sales in the quarter came in at €4,148 million ($4,875 million), relatively flat (inching down 0.2%) from the year-ago tally. The year-over-year decline can primarily be attributed to fall in sales of Personal Health businesses and HealthTech Other segment, partially mitigated by impressive performances from Connected Care & Health Informatics businesses and Diagnosis & Treatment businesses.Philips’ adjusted earnings before interest, taxes and amortization (EBITA) – the company’s preferred measure of operational performance – rose 12.2% year over year to €532 million ($625.1 million), benefiting from higher volumes, procurement savings as well as cost productivity.Koninklijke Philips N.V. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Koninklijke Philips N.V. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Koninklijke Philips N.V. QuoteMeanwhile, net cash provided by operating activities came in at €295 million ($346.6 million) compared with year-ago quarter figure €259 million. The company’s comparable order intake rose 5% year over year, driven by strong growth in Connected Care & Health Informatics businesses.Segmental RevenuesDuring the reported quarter, Personal Health sales fell 0.8% year over year to €1,650 million ($1,938.8 million). This segment reported a 1% decline in nominal sales and a 5% hike in comparable sales. The upside in comparable sales came on the back of high-single digit growth in Health & Wellness as well as Sleep & Respiratory Care, while Domestic Appliances recorded growth in mid-single-digit. On a geographic basis, double-digit growth in Middle East & Turkey and India, high-single digit growth in China, bolstered revenues in the quarter.Diagnosis & Treatment revenues rose 0.2% in the quarter to €1,638 million ($1,924.7 million). While nominal sales were flat, comparable sales grew 2% for the quarter. Mid-single-digit growth in Image-Guided Therapy and low-single-digit growth in Ultrasound and Diagnostic Imaging drove this segment’s sales. On a geographic basis, double-digit growth in China, Latin America and India acted as catalysts.Connected Care & Health Informatics revenues inched up 1.2% in the quarter to €751 million ($882.5 million). On a nominal basis, segmental revenues climbed 1% year over year and comparable sales grew 8% for the quarter. Sales improvement was primarily driven by double-digit growth in Patient Care & Monitoring Solutions as well as mid-single digit growth in Healthcare Informatics.On a geographic basis, while growth geographies witnessed mid-single-digit growth, mature geographies posted a low-single-digit decline. Double-digit growth in China, Middle East & Turkey and Latin acted as catalysts.Revenues in the HealthTech & Other segment continued to show weakness, shrinking 7.7% to €108 million ($127 million). The decline in this segment can mainly be attributed to higher restructuring charges incurred during the quarter.With effect from this quarter, Philips is reporting results of Philips Lighting under discontinued operations.Liquidity & Share RepurchaseExiting the quarter on Sep 30, 2017, Philips’ cash and cash equivalents rose to €999 million ($1,180.2 million) from €1,859 million a year back. The company’s long-term debt fell to €4,441 million ($5,246.2 million) compared with €4,860 million a year ago.Diligent Cost-Savings ProgramsPhilips has been gaining significantly from its DfX program, along with other productivity and savings programs.

The company now is well on track to generate an impressive annual savings of €400 million.Notable Developments During the QuarterThe quarter was marked by a string of acquisitions which the company had identified over the past two years. Philips announced the acquisition of Health & Parenting to strengthen its offerings in pregnancy and parenting. Health & Parenting is a London-based developer of healthcare and family-related mobile applications for expectant and new parents.The company also inked an agreement to buy image-analysis software provider, TomTec Imaging Systems GmbH. This acquisition is likely to enhance the former’s image-guided therapy portfolio.Further, earlier this month, the company obtained the 510(k) clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for marketing its new eL18-4 transducer for ‘small parts’ assessment. The company is anticipated to launch the newest solution at the 16th World Federation for Ultrasound in Medicine and Biology (“WFUMB”) Congress in Taipei.Update on Lighting DealAt the end of the third-quarter 2017, Philips holds 41.27% of the issued and outstanding share capital of Philips Lighting shares. Philips aims to sale the business completely over the next few years.GuidanceBased on the present market scenario and accounting for the macroeconomic headwinds, Philips continues to project full-year sales growth of 4-6%. The company also anticipates its Adjusted EBITA margin to improve around 100 basis points this year.Our TakeIn the past couple of years, Philips has successfully evolved from a lighting company into a healthcare technology provider. Moreover, the company's transformation from a hardware-oriented to a software-driven business, with a higher-margin and recurring-revenue model, bodes well for investors. The company also believes that increased spending on healthcare and fitness will drive future growth.Further, the company is highly optimistic about the prospects of its Diagnosis & Treatment vertical on account of positive industry trends, with the Image-Guided Therapy and Ultrasound equipment segments acting as major profit churners. This apart, the company’s Connected Care & Health Informatics vertical is progressing well, and is experiencing strength in Patient Care & Monitoring Solutions.Though, healthcare markets hold solid prospects in the long run, lackluster performance in key end markets, including the Western Europe and North America are thwarting the growth momentum of the Dutch multinational. Also, higher restructuring and acquisition-related charges are proving to be a drag on the company’s financials.Philips currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Stocks to ConsiderSome stocks worth considering in the same space include Applied Materials, Inc. (AMAT  -  Free Report), Analog Devices, Inc. (ADI  -  Free Report) and Amphenol Corporation (APH  -  Free Report).

106,AMAT,"Iron Mountain Inc. (IRM  -  Free Report) is set to release third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 24.Last quarter, earnings of 55 cents per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 52 cents and increased 14.6% year over year. However, in the trailing four quarters, the company delivered an average negative surprise of 8.08%.Revenues of $949.8 million missed the consensus mark of $955.2 million but improved 7.5% year over year.The company attributed the year–over-year improvement in results to accretive Recall Holdings acquisition, transformation initiatives and continued strong performance of its storage rental business.Notably, shares of Iron Mountain have gained 26% year to date, significantly outperforming the industry’s 3.4% rally.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors to ConsiderIron Mountain’s strong product portfolio, increasing market share and promising international business are the primary growth catalysts.The company’s entry into the data center market is likely to be a growth driver. We note that it is investing a lot in setting up its data center business.In the month of July, the company acquired MAG Datacenters, which operates FORTRUST for $128 million. The acquisition is expected to bolster the company’s presence in the Western U.S data center market by adding 9 MW of existing capacity and enhancing opportunity for further expansion in the future.Last month, Iron Mountain unveiled the first of the four announced data centers in Northern Virginia. The company already has data centers in Boston, Denver, Kansas City and Western Pennsylvania. Combined with the data center facility in North Virginia, the company will have 30 megawatts of capacity by year end, per management.The company’s data center in Northern Virginia was also selected by Virtustream to expand its cloud footprint. Moreover, the company's recent announcement to acquire data centers in London and Singapore will help it gain ground in the international markets in our view.However, Iron Mountain’s Service revenues remain modest due to falling activity rates as stored records are becoming less active. Besides, forex fluctuations, fragmented nature of the industry and stiff competition continue to be overhangs. Further, the company’s highly-leveraged balance sheet remains a concern.Iron Mountain Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise Iron Mountain Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise | Iron Mountain Incorporated QuoteEarnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Iron Mountain is likely to beat on earnings this quarter.

The company has beaten the Zack Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, delivering an average positive surprise of 8.84%.Last quarter, the company reported earnings of 60 cents per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 55 cents but declined 16.7% year over year. However, revenues of $330.7 million beat the consensus mark of $325 million and rose almost 6.1% from the year-ago quarter.However, we note that shares of Netgear have declined 9.3% year to date, underperforming the industry‘s rally of 12.2%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors to ConsiderWe expect Netgear’s strong product portfolio, comprising offerings like its Nighthawk WiFi routers, Arlo home security products and Orbi WiFI systems, to boost the top line.In particular, we are positive about the company’s FastLane3 Technology, which apart from extending WiFi coverage will also enable higher speed. In the quarter, the company launched Nighthawk X6S and Orbi Pro solutions with the patented technology.We believe that Arlo and Orbi sales in the retail channel will primarily drive Netgear’s results. Geographically, North America continues to be its predominant market followed by the EMEA region.The company also expanded its product offerings in the Switch category by introducing 24-Port Gigabit PoE+ Smart Managed Pro Switch, 48-port Gigabit Smart Managed Plus Switch (GS750E) and 12-Port 10-Gigabit Ethernet Smart Managed Pro Switch (XS712Tv2).Moreover, Netgear is also doing well in the IP camera market. Its launch of “first wire-free, ONVIF compliant IP camera”, FlexPower is also likely to drive growth.However, the service provider business continues to pose challenges with the company streamlining the segment.

108,AMAT,"F5 Networks Inc. (FFIV  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Oct 25.The company is likely to report lower revenues in the quarter due to a volatile spending atmosphere and competitive threats. This in turn, is likely to result in lower earnings for the quarter.Last quarter, the company's adjusted earnings of $1.55 per share missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.59 per share. Moreover, F5 Networks’ revenues of $517.8 missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $525 million.Challenges for the CompanyCisco Systems (CSCO  -  Free Report) poses the most significant competitive threat to F5 Networks, given the dominance of the former in the overall networking market. Cisco has tremendous engineering and marketing resources at its disposal. Although F5 Networks’ technology leads in the networking market, Cisco could become more competitive if it invests aggressively. Additionally, Citrix Inc., Juniper Networks, Checkpoint Systems, and Barracuda Networks also have strong technology platforms that could pose significant competitive threat on improved execution.Notably, F5 Networks continues to acquire a large number of companies. While this improves revenue opportunities, business mix and profitability, it also adds to integration risks. Moreover, frequent acquisitions are a distraction for management, which could impact organic growth in the long run.A substantial portion of the company’s sales is derived from outside the United States. Notably, the company garnered approximately 43.6%, 42.7% and 43.1% of total revenues in currencies other than the U.S. dollar during fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. This exposes the company to exchange rate fluctuations and counterparty default risk. Consequently, an economic condition, which impacts foreign currency exchange rates, does result in transaction exposure, which leads to profit fluctuation.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Product revenues is currently pegged at $248 million, significantly down from $253 million reported in the year-ago quarter.F5 Networks, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise F5 Networks, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | F5 Networks, Inc.

109,AMAT,"Amphenol Corporation (APH  -  Free Report) is slated to release third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 25, before market open.Over the last month, the company’s shares yielded a return of 5.7%, outperforming 4.9% growth recorded by the industry.In fact, the company pulled off an average positive earnings surprise of 7.90% over the trailing four quarters.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors to PlayAmphenol Corporation believes its state-of-the-art technologies, efficient management workforce and diversified business expose will likely help boost the company’s top-line performance in the upcoming quarters. Notably, strategic sensor-business buyouts from Meggitt PLC (June 2017), Intelligente Sensorsysteme acquisition (June 2017) and Telect Incorporated buyout (July 2017) are anticipated to bolster the company’s revenues in the quarters ahead. Moreover, solid mobile devices, commercial air market and automotive market sales are projected to aid the company’s revenue growth trajectory, going forward.Amphenol Corporation anticipates to report revenues in the range of $1.70-$1.74 billion in third-quarter 2017 (estimating an year-over-year increment of 4-6%).Furthermore, elevated revenues, a lean and highly flexible cost structure, and greater operational efficacy are estimated to drive the company’s bottom-line performance in the quarters. Notably, Amphenol Corporation projects to report earnings in the range of 77-79 cents per share in the third quarter.However, Amphenol Corporation believes lower military market sales, and slightly lower IT and data communications sales might hurt the company’s top-line results.We believe rising average debt levels, if not checked, might further escalate the company’s interest expense going forward. In addition, sudden input price inflation, unfavorable foreign currency translation impact or any supply chain challenge might dent the company’s near-term results.Amphenol Corporation currently carries a favorable Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Notably, the company’s earnings per share (EPS) is predicted to be up 10.2% in the next three to five years. Zacks Consensus Estimate for the stock is currently pegged at 79 cents per share for third-quarter 2017.It should be noted that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are some stocks within the industry that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Applied Materials, Inc.

110,AMAT,"Expedia, Inc. (EXPE  -  Free Report) is set to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 26 after the bell. In the quarter, we expect strength in Core OTA, Trivago and Homeway segments to be offset by weakness in the Egencia business.We observe that shares of Expedia have gained 34.9% year to date, significantly underperforming the industry’s 50.7% rally.Core OTAIn the second quarter, this segment’s revenues were up 14.7% sequentially and 13.8% year over year to $2 billion. It is expected to perform well in the to-be-reported quarter as Expedia continues to see solid momentum in room night growth in all key regions. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for this segment’s revenue is currently pegged at $2.3 billion.Trivago Trivago revenues increased 21.1% sequentially and a massive 63.2% year over year to $328 million. Its stupendous growth is expected to continue in the to-be-reported quarter driven mainly by strong volumes and solid monetization. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for this segment’s revenues is currently pegged at 370 million.HomeAwayIn the second quarter, HomeAway revenues were $224 million, up 9.8% sequentially and 30.2% year over year. The to-be-reported quarter is expected to witness robust growth as well since HomeAway conversion rates are strong and have been increasing year over year.  Consistent increase in stayed room night and stayed property night is also expected to contribute to HomeAway’s growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for this segment’s revenues is currently pegged at $292 million.EgenciaIn the second quarter, Egencia was up 4.8% on a sequential basis and 8% on a year over year basis to $135 million. This segment is however expected to be lumpy and partially offset strong performance of other segments in the to-be-reported quarter due to the impact of the churn of Orbitz for Business customers during last year's migration.Also, Expedia’s plan to ramp-up sales organization in the Egencia business will impact margins in the near term.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for this segment’s revenues is currently pegged at $123 million.Expedia, Inc.

111,AMAT,"Nielsen Holdings plc (NLSN  -  Free Report) is set to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 25. Last quarter, the company delivered a negative earnings surprise of 24.24%.Notably, Nielsen missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, with an average negative surprise of 26.48%.Also, shares of Nielsen have lost 0.45% year to date, underperforming the industry’s 25.3% rally.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Watch Segment Strength to Drive RevenuesIn the second quarter, Watch business revenues of $821 million contributed 50% to the total top line and were up 10.3% on a year-over-year basis. This figure is expected to increase in the to-be-reported quarter driven by continued strength in Audience Measurement and Marketing Effectiveness. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Watch revenues is currently pegged at $845 million.Partnerships & Agreements to Boost ResultsNielsen has been partnering with big companies to extend its TV ratings service beyond the Nielsen Local TV Ratings Service. Recently, Nilesen announced that it will start crediting Facebook, Alphabet (GOOGL) owned YouTube and Hulu distributed video content through its Digital Content Ratings system launched in September last year. With the new move, both digital and TV publisher clients of Nielsen will be able to get a comprehensive view of the different ways their digital content is watched across these platforms. These partnerships will help Nielsen to expand its client base and boost its Watch segment revenues in the upcoming quarter.Weakness in the Buy Segment Could Hurt ResultsIn the second quarter, Buy business revenues of $823 million declined 3.4% year over year and 2% on a constant-currency basis. The figure is further expected to decrease in the upcoming quarter due to softness in the U.S. market. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Buy revenues is currently pegged at $798 million.Increased Investments Could Weigh On ProfitsIn the last quarter, the company’s diluted net earnings of 50 cents per share, missed the Zacks Consensus estimate by 16 cents. Nielsen has been making continuous investments to expand its client base and increase its international presence. Although these investments will increase the company’s top-line figures, it is likely to impact the company’s bottom line in the upcoming quarter.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Nielsen is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

112,AMAT,"A recent revelation by ProPublica has put Facebook (FB  -  Free Report) in a tough spot.ProPublica, a non-profit organization that takes up investigative journalism in public interest, has claimed that Facebook’s self-serving ad platform “enabled advertisers to direct their pitches to the news feeds of almost 2,300 people who expressed interest in the topics of “Jew hater,” “How to burn jews,” or, “History of ‘why jews ruin the world.”The outlet also claimed that it paid $30 to test if this was actually true. It paid the amount to target those groups with three promoted posts and much to its dismay, Facebook just took less than 15 minutes to approve these ads.Facebook, Inc. Price Facebook, Inc. Price | Facebook, Inc. QuoteThe development comes on the heels of Facebook’s revelation of Russian accounts spending nearly $100,000 in ads ahead of the U.S. elections. There has been widespread speculation that Russia indeed meddled with 2016 U.S Presidential elections resulting in Trump’s victory. Per the latest Business Insider report, Facebook is yet to ascertain the exact amount of ad purchases by Russian accounts in 2016. The service has been under fire for quite some time now, given the extensive dissemination of fake news on its platform. The victory of Donald Trump is widely credited to fake news circulation on social media.Last year, ProPublica had reportedly exposed that Facebook displayed housing ads that clearly debarred minorities like African Americans and Hispanic people.However, the news site added that it was likely to be an algorithm error rather than a human error as the self-servicing platform automatically started generating such categories based on what users stated about themselves.However, after ProPublica’s revelation, Facebook said it has removed the fields in question. Facebook further added that, “Our community standards strictly prohibit attacking people based on their protected characteristics, including religion, and we prohibit advertisers from discriminating against people based on religion and other attributes.”The company further added that “there are times where content is surfaced on our platform that violates our standards. We know we have more work to doso we’re also building new guardrails in our product and review processes to prevent other issues like this from happening in the future.”Facebook has now set up monetization eligibility standards to make it clear that creators and publishers, which meet its strict guidelines, will be eligible to earn money on its platform. Repeated failure to comply with these terms will result in removal of access to the company’s monetization features. This move is widely seen as Facebook’s efforts to address brand safety issues, which plagued Google’s YouTube earlier this year. This year in March, YouTube ran into trouble with advertisers as it was revealed that some ads ran before extremist videos, prompting advertisers to withdraw their ad spots, per media reports. Consequently, Google had to tighten its ad policy to lure advertisers back.Putting in place stringent measures like this is the need of the hour for Facebook as it launches its dedicated video viewing tab, Watch.Zacks Rank and Share Price MovementFacebook carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Notably, the company has outperformed the industry in the past year. Shares of Facebook have surged 33.2% compared with the industry’s 14.3% increase.Stocks to Consider   Better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector include Applied Materials (AMAT  -  Free Report) , Activision Blizzard (ATVI and FormFactor Inc (FORM  -  Free Report), all sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

113,AMAT,"On Sep 12, Guidewire Software, Inc. (GWRE  -  Free Report) was upgraded to a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Why the Upgrade?Guidewire posted impressive fiscal fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results, which were better than the  guided range.For the fourth-quarter, non-GAAP earnings were 59 cents per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 39 cents and increasing 51.3% year over year. Revenues for the quarter were $181.1 million, an increase of 28% from the year-ago quarter. The figure also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $168 million.ISCS, which the company acquired in February 2017 and later renamed as InsuranceNow, contributed $16.2 million in hosting revenues for fiscal 2017. This along with customer addition, higher service activities and certain advance payments from term licenses boosted the company’s top line. Shares of Guidewire have gained 60.2% year to date, significantly outperforming the industry’s 28% rally.Growth Catalysts in DetailManagement noted that nine new customers were added during the fourth quarter, with five for the company’s core offering InsuranceSuite and one for InsuranceNow. Moreover, 27 existing customers expanded their relationship with the company during the quarter.    Notably, while the integration of ISCS is going on, Guidewire’s other acquisitions have contributed to the company’s growth. The company’s product suite, which has been enriched by the acquisition of FirstBest, now called Guidewire Underwriting Management; EagleEye Analytics, now Guidewire Predictive Analytics and InsuranceNow is experiencing benefits from cross-selling of the products.Guidewire Software, Inc. Revenue (TTM) Guidewire Software, Inc. Revenue (TTM) | Guidewire Software, Inc. QuoteThe company benefitted particularly from $6.1 million of advance payment from term licenses in the fourth quarter. This will however have a negative impact on fiscal 2018 license revenues, growth and margins, as the costs related to the payment will be incurred in the following quarter.Guidewire is slowly shifting from a term license based model to a subscription based model. This will hamper the top line for some time as cloud based or subscription based revenues are a bit delayed compared to license based early payments. Margins are also anticipated to be affected by the investments for the cloud transition. However, we believe, this step will be beneficial for the company in the long run as the industry is moving toward cloud-based infrastructure at a steady pace. This is reflected in the company’s expectation of a rise of 20% to 30% in subscription sales in fiscal 2018 from 6% in fiscal 2017.Zacks Rank and Key PicksGuidewire sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Other stocks worth considering in the broader industry are Lam Research Corporation (LRCX  -  Free Report) and Applied Materials, Inc.

114,AMAT,"Apple Inc’s (AAPL  -  Free Report) eagerly awaited event went ahead as expected with the launch of Apple Watch Series 3, a new Apple 4 K TV and three new iPhone editions namely iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus and the mega edition, iPhone X (called iPhone “ten”).The event was held at Steve Jobs Theater at Apple’s new spaceship campus in Cupertino. The event began with a Steve Jobs voice over followed by CEO Tim Cook’s homage to the legend. Cook said it was only fitting that “Steve should open his theater.”iPhone X UnveiledThe mega edition was biggest highlight of the event and was unveiled towards the end of the event. Just like the rumors, the phone has end-to-end curved OLED display with a facial recognition technology that unlocks the phone as well as helps to make secure payments via Apple Pay.It supports wireless charging and is resistant to microscopic dust and water. It also has the A11 bionic chip. Apple added that with the new A11 bionic chip, augmented reality games and apps “reach a new level of fluidity and realism.”Apple Inc. Price Apple Inc. Price | Apple Inc. QuoteApple claims that it will not be easy to fool the Face ID technology though an “evil twin” could compromise the ID. The technology is powered by the TrueDepth camera that boasts a flood illuminator, infrared camera, dot projector, front camera and ambient light sensors. Machine learning enables Face ID to adjust with physical changes in facial appearance over time.The Home button has been done away with. Users will just have to swipe up to access the home screen.The iPhone X has 5.8” Super Retina Display with 2046×1125 resolution and 458 PPI. The camera is way better than the earlier iPhones. The iPhone X has 12 MP dual cameras with faster sensors and f/1.8 and f/2.4 apertures.Then there is also animoji, an app that deploys 3D technology to create emojis that imitate the users’ expression.The starting price of the phone is at $999. Preorders begin Oct 27 and phones will be available from Nov 3.Launch Delay A Concern?Here is our concern. The delay in launch of iPhone X somewhat confirms supply chain issues as has been widely reported. With the November launch, the sales won’t be included in this fiscal.Also, we believe the new iPhone is definitely an upgrade over its predecessors but doesn’t have exclusive features. Samsung phones already have this. Its price point is also a cause of concern for masses but won’t deter buyers who are looking to get their hands on the new phone to boost their status symbol. Also, support for AR apps is expected to prove a major draw.Per reports, sales in America are unlikely to be impacted but China sales could be affected as the $1000 price tag is double the average Chinese monthly salary.Moreover, the other two models release just a month and a half prior to iPhone X. Consumers can definitely hold their purchases for some more time and this could cannibalize iPhone 8 and 8 Plus sales, thereby impacting the current quarter’s sales.Let’s Have a Look at Other AnnouncementsiPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus: Apple’s iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus are the new generation of iPhones with an all new glass design. The glass design is further reinforced by internal laser welded steel. Apple has called it “the most durable glass ever in a smartphone”. It also supports wireless charging and is resistant to microscopic dust and water. The stereo speakers are 25% louder then iPhone 7.It comes with retina HD display (4.7” for 8 and 5.5” for 8 Plus) with iPad’s True Tone color display and 3D touch. The True Tone technology helps to adjust white balance to match the light in the surrounding environment. The new editions phones also carry A11 Bionic chips that have four efficiency cores that are 70% faster than A10 Fusion chips. It has two performance cores whose capacity has now enhanced 25%. It also carries Apple’s own designed three core GPU, which is up to 30% faster than A10 Fusion.Coming to the camera, as widely expected, there have been a number of developments. The new phones feature a 12 MP camera that has upgraded color filter and deeper pixels. The portrait mode is better with “dual cameras and new facial land marking” helping to create studio like dramatic lighting effect.The starting price of these phones is $699 and $799, respectively, for 64 GB version and they come in three different colors including a new gold finish. Preorders begin Sep 15 and the phones will be available from Sep 22.Apple Watch Series 3: Apple has taken a major leap forward with the new Watch series by integrating cellular connectivity. The new Watch (with watch OS4 operating system) will have a built-in LTE cellular connection, thereby eliminating the need to be connected to an iPhone. Users do not need a new number for getting cellular connection on their watches.Chief financial officer, Jeff Williams called it the “ultimate expression of Apple Watch.” Users can call, text as well as access GPS and third party applications like WeChat. Also, with integrated cellular and Apple Music, 40 million songs are available for streaming on your wrist, added Williams. And, yes, for the first time Siri can talk to Watch users now.All this has been made possible by the new dual core processor, which is 70% faster than its predecessor. To work around the problem of an antenna for the cellular, Apple has turned the display into a cellular antenna. It also has an electronic SIM and a barometric altimeter. Its battery life is over 18 hours.Apple will take orders (watch with cellular) from Sep 15 and the device will be available from Sep 22 in nine countries including the United States, United Kingdom, Japan, and Switzerland in partnership with 14 carriers initially.The non-cellular version will be available in 26 countries (China, Canada and Australia among others) post launch.The watch (with cellular connection), which costs $399 will be available in a variety of colors namely gold, aluminum, silver and space grey. Users will have a range of bands to choose from including the sport loop. Watch Series 3 without cellular is priced at $329. Series 1 price has been slashed to $249.As far as OS4 is concerned, it has a plethora of health benefit features including GymKit, smart activity coaching and new features for swimmers like auto set as well as a workout feature for high intensity interval training. Williams added that Apple’s heart rate monitor will now be on Watch face and there is a feature that will alert the user about an increase in heart rate when the person is in a state of rest. Apple wants its users to be aware of cardiac arrhythmia, a major cause of a stroke.Apple 4K TV: The new Apple TV has two new features called 4K resolution and High Dynamic Range (HDR) streaming capacity. User Interface has been revamped in the 4K TV. Users can now see all 4K content across leading studios on iTunes at the price of HD. 4K content from Netflix and Amazon will also be available on 4KTV.

In fact, AMETEK has been consistently introducing new and improved products that added to its vastly differentiated product pipeline. Some of the recent launches include Custom Cooling Systems, the new DC power supply and high-speed camera.The consistent product introductions by the company generate customer loyalty and facilitate market share gains, thereby boosting revenues. Evidently, products introduced over the last three years made up 24% of revenues. This indicates that the company is not only good at developing products but also at marketing them.Also, AMETEK supplements organic growth with strategic acquisitions. For this purpose, it generally looks for niche players that complement one of its many product lines or round out its portfolio.Recently, the company completed the acquisition of instrumentation provider, MOCON, Inc. for $30 per share in cash or a total value of about $182 million. The deal will compliment its existing gas analysis instrumentation business. MOCON’s products will provide opportunities to AMETEK to further expand into the growing food and pharmaceutical package testing market.Estimate revision trends for 2017 also remain favorable with 10 estimates moving north and none moving in the opposite direction in the last 60 days. Additionally, earnings estimates climbed 1.6% to $2.52 per share over the same time frame.HeadwindsNotably, AMETEK has underperformed the industry on a year-to-date basis. Shares of the company have gained 33.6% compared with the industry’s growth of 37.4% in the same time period.A major portion of AMETEK’s revenues is generated from operations outside the United States. Also, significant dollar strength and adverse foreign currency fluctuations erode the profitability of the company. Therefore, sales in 2016 suffered 1% from foreign currency headwinds.Furthermore, though acquisitions are a part of AMETEK’s growth strategy, unsuccessful execution and integration of new buyouts and an increase in acquisition costs due to stiff competition is likely to negatively impact its sales/margin performance. AMTEK, Inc.

116,AMAT,"The U.S. equity markets shrugged off initial fears and scaled near record highs as Hurricane Irma had a lesser-than-expected impact on Florida and worries about another North Korea missile test by the weekend ebbed. As investors regained their appetite for riskier bets like equities, courtesy of strengthening dollar and sell-off in global bond markets, ‘cash cow’ stocks that offer higher returns have come to the forefront.However, singling out cash-rich stocks alone does not make for a solid investment proposition unless they are backed by attractive efficiency ratios like return on equity (ROE). A high ROE ensures that the company is reinvesting its cash at a high rate of return.Why ROE?ROE = Net Income/Shareholders’ EquityROE helps investors distinguish between profit-generating companies from profit burners and is useful for determining the financial health of a company. In other words, this financial metric enables investors to identify stocks that diligently deploy cash for higher returns.Moreover, ROE is often used to compare the profitability of a company with other firms in the industry – the higher, the better. It measures how well a company is increasing its profits without investing new equity capital in the business and portrays management efficiency in rewarding shareholders with attractive risk-adjusted returns.Parameters Used for ScreeningIn order to shortlist stocks that are cash rich with high ROE, we have added Cash Flow greater than $1 billion and ROE greater than X-Industry as our primary screening parameters. In addition, we have taken a few other criteria into consideration to arrive at a winning strategy.Price/Cash Flow less than X-Industry: This metric measures how much investors pay for one dollar of free cash flow. A lower ratio indicates that investors need to pay less for a better cash flow generating stock.Return on Assets (ROA) greater than X-Industry: This metric determines how much profit a company earns for every dollar of asset, which includes cash, accounts receivable, property, equipment, inventory and furniture. The higher the ROA, the better it is for the company.5-Year EPS Historical Growth greater than X-Industry: This criterion indicates that continued earnings momentum has translated into solid cash strength.   Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Here are five of the 15 stocks that qualified the screen:Texas Instruments Incorporated (TXN  -  Free Report): Headquartered in Dallas, TX, Texas Instruments is an original equipment manufacturer of analog, mixed signal and digital signal processing integrated circuits. The company has a trailing four-quarter average earnings surprise of 8.4% and long-term earnings growth expectation of 9.6%.

118,AMAT,"Share price of Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation (CTSH  -  Free Report) rallied to a new 52-week high of $72.33, eventually closing a tad lower at $72.18 on Sep 11. Notably, its shares have gained 28.8% year to date, outperforming the industry’s 27% rally.What’s Backing the Rally?Cognizant’s domain expertise is a key catalyst. The company is consistently developing its capabilities to benefit from the ongoing digital transition, especially when it comes to integration of the new digital framework with legacy technology platforms.Moreover, acquisitions have been a key growth driver for Cognizant. The buyouts have not only led to an increase in new customers but also expanded its capabilities in the healthcare industry and enhanced its overall digital delivery capabilities.Recently, Cognizant announced the completion of its acquisition of TMG Health. TMG Health is a business process services provider to the Medicare Advantage, Medicare Part D and Managed Medicaid markets in the U.S. Reportedly, the integration of TMG Health and the company’s TriZetto platform reinforces its leading service provider position for the government-managed healthcare programs in U.S.Per management, merger with TMG Health will enable Cognizant to expand its healthcare offerings and thereby cater to growing demand from its payer clients. The company’s healthcare segment has a strong growth trajectory and this acquisition will thus prove to be significant revenue driver in our view.Strategies Paying OffCognizant has been witnessing continuous increase in revenues over the past several quarters, which signifies that its growth initiatives are in the right direction.

120,AMAT,"Apple Inc.’s (AAPL  -  Free Report) flagship offering, iPhone could surpass $1 trillion in sales by the end of 2018 bolstered by iPhone X, per a report by TheStreet, which quoted research firm Strategy Analytics.The revolutionary iPhone, released first in June 2007, had changed the world forever and catapulted Apple to new highs. Apple co-founder and the then CEO Steve Jobs had said that iPhone was a blend of three devices, namely, a ""widescreen iPod with touch controls"", a ""revolutionary mobile phone"" and a ""breakthrough Internet communicator"". The original iPhone was powered by an ARM-based 1176JZ (F)-S processor and had a PowerVR MBX Lite 3D graphics chip. It had a 1400mAH battery.Upon release, the phone received terrific response. The success of iPhone over the last decade is well chronicled. Reportedly, Apple has sold over 1.2 billion iPhones across the globe earning over $760 billion in revenues. Valuation Could Also Hit $1 TrillionSince the first iPhone release, Apple shares have skyrocketed compared with the industry to which it belongs. Over the last decade, Apple stock has returned 826% while the industry witnessed a rally of 387%.The new iPhone is widely considered to be a super cycle. The edition is expected to be far better than its predecessors with features like a glass body, a dual curved edge-to-edge OLED (organic light-emitting diode) display with wireless charging (USB-C), higher storage options and a far superior camera.There are also speculations that robust iPhone X sales will make Apple the first company to touch the $1 trillion valuation mark. Currently, Apple’s market cap is $834 billion. Its shares have increased about 36% year over year and hit a 52-week high of $165. Shares are currently trading at $161.50.Per a Fortune report, an analyst with Canaccord Genuity Michael Walkley said that if Apple can sell 46.5 million and 84 million units in the third and fourth quarters of 2017, it will represent a 5% gain from the same period last year. Consequently, he expects share price to hit $180. Apple shares need to add another $15 to reach the magical market cap figure, observe analysts.Apple Inc. Price and Consensus Apple Inc. Price and Consensus | Apple Inc. QuoteIs the Price Point an Impediment?However, it is the price point that has been considered by many as an impediment to sales. The new phone is likely to carry a price tag of more than $1000. Many analysts observe that consumers may not be willing to spend that much on a phone whose features aren’t exactly exclusive. For instance, Samsung phones have OLED display and wireless charging options.The debate over the exorbitant price has been raging on for some time now. iPhone 7 and 7 Plus editions with 256GB storage carry price tags of $849 and $969, respectively. So a price tag north of $1000 should not be considered unreasonable for a fully redesigned OLED iPhone 8.iPhone (4GB model) was priced at $499 way back in 2007, which was unheard of back then. Yet, Apple scored a home run with the device. The power of Apple’s fan base though cannot be undermined but with this edition, their loyalty will be tested strongly. Per a Reuters report, iPhone sales in the United States aren’t likely to be badly disrupted because of the price point. An analyst with Loup Ventures was quoted saying that four out of five consumers who have earlier bought a new iPhone are likely to buy iPhone X. Plus, discounts offered by carriers will also make the price tag affordable.However, the Reuters report adds that price point could dim iPhone X’s China prospects. The $1000 price tag is double the average Chinese monthly salary. Following the roaring response to iPhone 6, the next edition saw a much subdued response in Greater China, which is Apple’s third biggest market as it was widely perceived that the new edition does not have much new to offer compared with its predecessors, adds the report further.In the last reported quarter, sales declined 10% year over year to $8 billion. Over the past few quarters, Apple’s iPhone sales have been marred, especially in China, by increasing competition from cheaper handsets like Oppo and Vivo. With iPhone X, Apple is looking to reverse that trend.Reuters quoted Mo Jia, a Shanghai-based analyst at Canalys, “Apple really needs to launch a very innovative product this time around. However, the rising clout of local rivals would nevertheless make life tough for the U.S. firm, he said. It has its work cut out.""At present, Apple carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).                                 Stocks to ConsiderBetter-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector include Applied Materials (AMAT  -  Free Report) , Activision Blizzard (ATVI  -  Free Report) and FormFactor Inc (FORM  -  Free Report), all sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

121,AMAT,"Premium technology company, Pitney Bowes Inc. (PBI  -  Free Report), recently declared the renewal and extension of its global strategic partnership with HP Inc. (HPQ  -  Free Report). The two technology behemoths have delivered integrated print to mail solutions for high impact customer communications since 2009.The collaboration between these two companies has launched several industry-leading solutions, including the Pitney Bowes IntelliJet Printing Systems, which has driven revenues  and streamlined operations for users. This strategic partnership enables clients to deliver accurate, precise and personalized communications to their clients from a single solution provider by offering access to industry-leading technology.Recently, the company also announced that Renkim, a major player in the financial and mission-critical documents industry has bought two AcceleJet printing and finishing systems to streamline its print to mail workflow. The two new AcceleJet systems are going to replace seven legacy printers and are critical for the company’s redesigned floorplan and streamlined workflow.However, despite improving business trends and portfolio repositioning to drive growth, the shares of this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company have had a disappointing run on the bourse in the last six months. Its shares have declined 5.5%, against the industry’s gain of 3.3%.The fact remains that softness in the company’s North American mailing business has yet to subside completely. In the recently reported second-quarter 2017 results, the company’s Small and Medium Business Solutions revenues dipped 3% year over year to $436.4 million. Additionally, decline in recurring revenues and poor equipment sales proved to be a drag on the International Mailing Business. Uncertain global economic environment is anticipated to impact production mail and software businesses in the near term, consequently limiting growth momentum.Moreover, the company has been experiencing a surge in operating expenses due to ERP implementation in the United States and higher marketing expenses in relation to aggressive advertising and marketing strategies for strengthening brand value. The company anticipates marketing expense to be up on a year-over-year basis. Also, capital expenses associated with the ERP project remain a hindrance. Till the benefits of ERP materialize, the company expects to incur higher capital expenses that might exert pressure on margins.On the positive side, strong prospects of global e-commerce business, Shipping business and Digital Commerce Solutions are expected to be mitigate some of these headwinds for Pitney Bowes in the long haul.Stocks to Consider Some better-ranked stocks from the same space are Axcelis Technologies, Inc.

123,AMAT,"Apple Inc’s (AAPL  -  Free Report) much awaited mega edition iPhone will be called iPhone X while the other two editions will be called iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus, respectively.Per media reports, there has been a massive leak, most probably by a displeased employee, which has revealed too much information about the new phones and iOS 11.Noted Apple blogger, John Gruber in his post stated “Someone within Apple leaked the list of URLs to 9to5Mac and MacRumors. I'm nearly certain this wasn't a mistake, but rather a deliberate malicious act by a rogue Apple employee.""Apple Inc. Price Apple Inc. Price | Apple Inc. QuoteBBC has said that it has verified that the information was indeed provided by an anonymous source, to the above-mentioned two publications, by leaking the iOS 11's golden master (GM) code links. The links enabed data download from Apple's internal servers.Per sources, the leaks have revealed references to iPhone X that will have a new facial unlocking technology. There will be no home button to make room for a large screen.  The new phone will have a virtual home bar, which is expected to be operated by gesture controls.

124,AMAT,"It seems that the massive Seattle headquarters are not enough to support the continuously growing Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report). It is gearing up for a second headquarter in North America that can accommodate as many as 50,000 employees and spending $5 billion for it.Yesterday, the company announced plans for what it calls Amazon HQ2 and sought submission of response to its request for proposal (RFP). Amazon said that jobs at HQ2 will mostly be in software development with average annual compensation of $100,000 over 15 years.Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos stated, “We expect HQ2 to be a full equal to our Seattle headquarters.”We observe that Amazon shares have gained 28.8% year to date, underperforming the 46.7% rally of the industry it belongs to.Set Criteria Indicate Meaningful ExpansionAmazon prefers urban or suburban but metropolitan locations, home to more than 1 million people, offering a stable and business-friendly environment, real estate options and with resources to attract strong technical talent.The location need not have to offer an urban or downtown campus, a layout resembling Amazon’s Seattle campus or a development-prepped site. Notably, Amazon has stressed on “communities that think big and creatively when considering locations and real estate options.”The stated preferences indicate that a massive and more meaningful expansion is on its way. The expansion of headquarters straightway indicates expansion of global operations, which is actually happening and the company needs to support that from its core. The company is surely thinking several years down the road.Amazon is one of the world’s fastest growing companies with fingers in almost every pie. The company has been ramping up its efforts in both online and brick-and-mortar retail leveraging on its solid loyalty system in Prime and its Fulfillment By Amazon (FBA) strategy.Amazon.com, Inc. Net Income (TTM) Amazon.com, Inc. Net Income (TTM) | Amazon.com, Inc. QuoteAmazon Web Services (AWS) remains the cloud infrastructure leader and continues to grow on partners and consumers. The company is racing to build an ecosystem around Alexa. Alexa powered Echo devices are going great guns and help the company sell products and services.It has recently made two big acquisitions that of Whole Foods and Souq.com, accelerating its choice of buy option over build.Smoothened Relations with the White HouseAmazon founder and chairman Jeff Bezos and President-elect Donald Trump did not seem to have good relations during the presidential campaign. But things appear to be easing after the results as Bezos was among the leading technology industry executives to meet Trump.The President-elect has urged technology leaders to create and retain jobs within the United States. Since then. Amazon has frequently made announcements related to job creation in the United States.Cities Racing to Win AmazonToronto, Dallas, Houston, St. Louis, Kentucky and Miami are among the many that have expressed interest. We expect many more to come forward and the bidding to be fierce.Amazon has launched a special website where representatives of cities and regional economic development organizations can put up their responses to the proposal. The company wants to wind up the response acceptance process by October and final selection by 2018.Economic Development in FocusAmazon in its press release notes that from 2010 to 2016, the company’s investments in Seattle have generated an economic impact of $38 billion in the city. That’s an additional 1.4 dollars against each dollar invested in Seattle by Amazon.City and state heads are surely eyeing a repetition of Amazon’s economic impact on Seattle’s in their own areas and thus have started gearing up to grab the opportunity.Currently, cities and states are increasingly attracting technology companies as they bring in huge employment opportunities and attract other businesses, thus boosting the overall economy. They are ready to give away massive benefits mainly in the form of tax breaks in return as they know that economic development often outweighs loss in tax.Growth at the Cost of Margins?Amazon’s global margins are likely to be under pressure at least for a few years. Amazon continues to invest heavily on fulfillment centers, TV shows and movies, AWS, acquisitions, India expansion and what not. The proposed 5 billion investments on its second headquarters is just another example.Amazon has never hesitated to sacrifice margins to pursue its long-term objectives - bringing more customers under its umbrella and giving them reasons to stay. Since it generates significant cash from operations and holds a huge cash balance, management has the flexibility to pursue even more growth.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderAmazon has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).Better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector include Applied Materials, Inc.

125,AMAT,"If you are still holding on to shares of Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (HPE  -  Free Report) in your portfolio, it is time you dump them as chances of favorable returns in the near term appear bleak.Dropping Hewlett PackardEnterprise can maximize investor’s portfolio returns as it has witnessed a significant price decline in the past one year, and has seen negative earnings estimate revisions for the current quarter and year. Further, the company’s Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) only reflects its innate weakness.Although the entire industry to which Hewlett Packard Enterprise belongs to, has been underperforming, the stock is among the worst performers. During the year-to-date period, the stock has lost 43.3%, as compared with the industry’s decline of 20.1%.Let’s delve deeper and find out what is taking the company down.Why Hewlett Packard Enterprise Should be AvoidedFor the full year 2017, we have seen seven estimates moving south in the past 30 days. This trend has caused the consensus estimate to drift downward, going from $1.43 per share a month ago to current level of $1.40.Additionally, Hewlett PackardEnterprise has seen seven downward estimate revisions against only one revision in the opposite direction for the current quarter. This has led to the consensus estimate declining to 28 cents per share from 39 cents in the past 30 days.Notably, during second-quarter fiscal 2017, the company closed the spin-merger of its Enterprise Services business. Additionally, the company completed the pending spin-merger of its Software business in the fiscal third quarter.The company also issued a disappointing bottom-line guidance for fourth-quarter fiscal 2017. Hewlett Packard Enterprise expects non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of 26-30 cents (mid-point: 28 cents), which is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 41 cents.As the company concluded its spin-merger of the Software business in the recently reported quarter, it adjusted the outlook for fiscal 2017. Hewlett Packard Enterprise now anticipates non-GAAP earnings per share for fiscal 2017 in the range of $1.36-$1.40 (mid-point $1.38), down from $1.46-$1.56. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $1.46.Adding to the woes, the company posted an average negative earnings surprise of 0.58%.We remain slightly cautious about the company’s near-term prospects due to the three main challenges it is currently facing — heightened pressure from unfavorable currency exchange movements, elevated commodities pricing and some near-term execution issues. These headwinds are expected to thwart its overall performance in the near term.Also, macroeconomic challenges and tepid IT spending remain other concerns. Competition from International Business Machines (IBM  -  Free Report) and Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report) adds to its woes.So, it may not be a prudent decision to keep this stock in your portfolio anymore, at least if you don’t intend to wait for a long time.Stocks to ConsiderA better-ranked stock in the technology sector is Applied Materials, Inc. (AMAT  -  Free Report), sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

Average volume of shares traded in the last three months was roughly 8,745K.Notably, the company’s shares have returned 1.6% in the last two months following its second-quarter fiscal 2017 results.What is Driving eBay?eBay is one of the largest online retailers in the world. The company’s focus on improving buyers’ experience, opportunities in the fast-growing mobile space, international expansion and a strong balance sheet are likely to boost long-term growth.Notably, eBay is making a lot of efforts to expand its international footprint. Only recently, eBay expanded its partnership with MallforAfrica to further strengthen its cross border business. Created in 2011, MallforAfrica is a platform to help connect businesses with consumers in Africa.The deal will help eBay to increase its presence in Africa and open new revenue opportunities.  According to consulting firm McKinsey, digital sales revenue in Africa will top $75 billion by 2025. Given such impressive projected numbers in Africa, eBay is sure to gain from it.Also, eBay has been making continuous efforts to fuel growth in its Marketplaces business. It has re-platformed itself by building product catalogs on structured data, enhancing mobile platform, rolling out new browse inspired shopping journeys and strengthening its brand.Last month, eBay Inc. entered into a partnership with Facebook to offer daily deals on Facebook’s Mobile Marketplace. The deal will boost eBay’s Marketplace by offering its platform features to Facebook and getting access to the latter’s huge user base in return.Also, eBay struck a deal with Shopify in July.

128,AMAT,"Earnings growth and valuation multiples are indeed important for investors to determine a stock's ability to offer considerable returns. But these are also essential in determining whether a stock’s price performance is better than its peers or the industry average.If the stock’s performance is lacking that of the broader groups despite impressive earnings growth or valuation multiples, then something must be wrong.It’s always advisable to stay away from these stocks and bet on those that are outperforming their respective industries or benchmarks. This is because betting on a winner always increases the odds of winning.Then again, it is imperative that you determine whether or not an investment has relevant upside potential when considering stocks with significant relative price strength. Stocks delivering better than the S&P 500 over a period of one to three months at the least and having solid fundamentals indicate room for growth, and are the best ways to go about this strategy.Finally, it is important to find out whether analysts are optimistic about the upcoming earnings results of these companies.

You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter. Xilinx currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 and has an ESP of +0.22%.Xilinx, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Xilinx, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Xilinx, Inc. QuoteWhat’s Driving Better-Than-Expected Earnings?Xilinx is set to capitalize on the global trend of field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) replacing application-specified integrated circuits (ASICs). There are certain fundamental advantages of using FPGAs over low-cost ASICs. One of the basic reasons is the difficulty in getting suitable ASICs for design and the additional cost of re-certifying new ASIC-based designs.We expect FPGA products to drive the company’s revenues throughout fiscal 2018, aided by steady demand in communications industry, and continued strong adoption of its products in Automotive, ISM, Test and Aerospace and Defense markets. Moreover, design wins from other sectors such as wired communication, data center and industrial will add to revenues.Furthermore, FPGAs are widely used in third generation (3G) and fourth generation long-term evolution (4G LTE) network connections. These markets are strongly co-related with global GDP growth and spending behavior. Most of the emerging economies are seeing unprecedented demand for mobile devices like smartphones and tablets, and are also getting increasingly connected via the Internet. This has compelled these countries to heavily invest in Telecom & Wireless infrastructure. We believe higher wireless deployments across the world will lead to increased demand for Xilinx’s 28-nm, 20-nm and 16-nm nodes, thereby positively impacting its overall fiscal second-quarter results.Other Stocks With Favorable CombinationHere are some other companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Applied Materials, Inc.

132,AMAT,"The liquidity position is indicative of whether a company’s business is heading in the right direction. Favorable liquidity may help a company see strong business growth, which in turn may drive its price performance. Liquidity is a measure of a company’s capability of meeting its debt obligations by converting its assets into liquid cash and equivalents.However, one should exercise caution before investing in such stocks. While a high liquidity level may imply that the company is meeting its obligations at a faster rate compared to peers, it may also indicate that the company is failing to use its assets efficiently.Hence, one may consider the efficiency level of a company in addition to its liquidity to identify potential winners.Measures to Identify Liquid StocksLiquidity ratios like Current Ratio, Quick Ratio and Cash Ratio are primarily used to identify companies with strong liquidity.Current Ratio: It measures current assets relative to current liabilities. This ratio is used for measuring a company’s potential to meet both short- and long-term debt obligations. Thus, a current ratio – also known as working capital ratio – below 1 indicates that the company has more liabilities than assets. However, a high current ratio does not always indicate that the company is in good financial shape. It may also mean that the company has failed to utilize its assets significantly. Hence, a range of 1 to 3 is considered ideal.Quick Ratio: Unlike current ratio, quick ratio – also called “acid-test ratio"" or ""quick assets ratio"" – indicates a company’s ability to pay short-term obligations. It considers inventory excluding current assets relative to current liabilities. Like the current ratio, a quick ratio of greater than 1 is desirable.Cash Ratio: This is the most conservative ratio among the three, as it takes into account only cash and cash equivalents, and invested funds relative to current liabilities. It measures a company’s ability to pay its current debt obligations using the most liquid of assets. Though a cash ratio higher than 1 may point to sound financials, a high number may indicate inefficiency in using the cash.So, a ratio of greater than 1 is desirable at all times but may not always underline a company’s financial health.Screening ParametersIn order to pick the best of the lot, we have added asset utilization, which is a widely used measure of a company’s efficiency, as one of the screening criteria. Asset utilization is a ratio of total sales over the past 12 months to the last four-quarter average of total assets. Though this ratio varies across industries, companies with a ratio higher than their respective industries can be considered efficient.In order to ensure that these liquid and efficient stocks have solid growth potential, we have added our proprietary Growth Style Score to the screen.Current Ratio, Quick Ratio and Cash Ratio between 1 and 3 (While liquidity ratios of greater than 1 are desirable, significantly high ratios may indicate inefficiency.)Asset utilization greater than industry average (Higher asset utilization than the industry average indicates a company’s efficiency.)Zacks Rank equal to #1 (Only Strong Buy-rated stocks can get through. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.) Growth Style Score less than or equal to B(Back-tested results show that stocks with a Growth Style Score of ‘A’ or ‘B’ when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 handily beat other stocks.)These criteria have narrowed down the universe of over 7,700 stocks to only nine.Here are four of the nine stocks that qualified the screen:Headquartered in Santa Clara, CA, Applied Materials Inc. (AMAT  -  Free Report) is engaged in developing, manufacturing and marketing semiconductor wafer fabrication equipment and related spare parts for the semiconductor industry.

133,AMAT,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM  -  Free Report) reported third-quarter 2017 earnings of 57 cents per ADR, which exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny. Further, it increased 35.7% sequentially but decreased 3.4% year over year.Moreover, revenues decreased 3.2% year over year but increased 17.9% sequentially. The sequential increase was primarily driven by major mobile product launches and a healthy demand environment. The company also witnessed strength in automotive, IoT and high-performance computing, resulting in cryptocurrency mining. However, customers' continued inventory management impacted third-quarter revenues.Notably, shares of Taiwan Semiconductor have returned approximately 42.9% year to date, underperforming the industry’s gain of 44.4%.Quarter DetailsNorth America accounted for 64% of total revenues. Asia Pacific, China, EMEA (Europe, Middle East, and Africa) and Japan accounted for 10%, 11%, 8%, and 7% of total revenues, respectively.By application, Communication, Computer, Consumer and Industrial/Standard increased 10%, 46%, 15% and 13%, respectively.By technology, 10-nanometer (nm) process technology contributed 10% of total wafer revenues. The combined 16/20-nm contribution was 24% of total wafer revenues.Advanced technologies (28-nm and below) accounted for 57% of total wafer revenues. The company has increased 28-nm capacity to meet customer demand.N7 & N7+ DetailsManagement noted that the 7-nm product (including N7 and N7+ products) has gained significant traction within a short span of receiving technology qualification. Taiwan Semi expects to have more than 50 new N7 product tape-outs by the end of 2018. So far, N7 yield is wellahead of the company’s plan. Moreover, it continues to expect 10-nm to contribute to about 10% of wafer revenues this year.Taiwan Semi expects to have a very fast and smooth N7 ramp-up in 2018, with its yield better than the 16-nm. Management also noted that N7+ would be the most advanced foundry process in 2018. It anticipates offering EUV in second-half 2018 on N7+ and then full insertion in first-quarter 2019.MarginsPer the press release, gross margin was 49.9%, down 90 basis points (bps) sequentially and 80 bps year over year. The decrease was due to margin dilution from higher 10nm contribution, partially offset by a higher level of capacity utilization.Operating margin was 38.9%, flat sequentially but down 190 bps year over year.Fourth Quarter GuidanceFor fourth-quarter 2017, Taiwan Semi expects revenues to be in the range of $9.10-$9.20 billion. The guidance implies 10.0% sequential growth in revenues, driven by fast increase in the availability of 10-nm mobile customer products, partially offset by continuous inventory adjustments.Gross margin is anticipated to be between 48.0% and 50.0%, while operating margin is expected to be in the range of 37- 39%.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderCurrently, Taiwan Semiconductorcarries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A few other better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are Applied Materials, Inc. (AMAT  -  Free Report) and NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report), both sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), while ASML Holding (ASML  -  Free Report), holding a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

134,AMAT,"Diversified conglomerate United Technologies Corporation (UTX  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results before the opening bell on Oct 24. The company is likely to report lower revenues in the quarter due to a challenging macroeconomic environment.This, in turn, is likely to result in lower earnings for the quarter.Top-Line WoesThe financial performance of United Technologies depends largely on the conditions of the construction and aerospace industries. The company is also heavily dependent on the U.S. government’s budgetary allocation for defense. A reduction in capital spending for the commercial aviation or defense industries is likely to have a significant effect on the demand for its products.United Technologies Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  United Technologies Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | United Technologies Corporation QuoteUnited Technologies relies on suppliers, including third-party contract manufacturing and commodity markets to secure raw materials, parts, components and sub-systems. This exposes the company to market price volatility and availability risks. A disruption in deliveries from suppliers, capacity constraints, production disruptions, price changes, or decreased availability of raw materials or commodities is likely to have an adverse effect on its ability to meet delivery schedules and thereby increase operating costs. These headwinds look all the more potent with the strengthening of the U.S. dollar.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for UTC Climate Control and Security segment revenues is currently pegged at $4,566 million, significantly down from $4,712 million reported in the second quarter. Revenues from Otis and Pratt & Whitney are also expected to be sequentially low with respective estimates of $3,075 million and $3,661 million compared with reported revenues of $3,131 million and $4,070 million in the prior quarter.UTC Aerospace Systems’ revenues are likely to be $3,619 million compared with $3,640 million in the previous quarter.Other Key FactorsDuring the quarter, United Technologies inked a definitive agreement to acquire Iowa-based avionics firm, Rockwell Collins, Inc. The acquisition is expected to offer United Technologies a bigger clout in the industry and increase its bargaining power as it would emerge as one of the largest aircraft equipment manufacturers. The combined company would be better suited to meet the evolving global customer needs. With complementary products, the combination is likely to yield operating synergies through lower operating costs and more opportunities to cross sell the products. United Technologies expects the merger to be accretive to adjusted earnings per share after the first full year of combined operations with synergies to the tune of more than $500 million.However, our proven model does not conclusively show that United Technologies is likely to beat earnings this quarter as it does not possess the key components. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here as you will see below:Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is -0.24% with the former currently pegged at $1.68 and the latter at $1.69. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: United Technologies has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Strong Sell) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing a negative estimate revisions momentum.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some companies that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Applied Materials, Inc. (AMAT  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.19% and a Zacks Rank #1. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Franklin Resources, Inc. (BEN  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.56% and a Zacks Rank #2.KEMET Corporation (KEM  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +7.46% and a Zacks Rank #1.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

135,AMAT,"Rambus Inc. (RMBS  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 23.We believe licensing agreements, acquisition synergies, strategic deals and restructuring initiatives arelikelytodrive the company’s overall third-quarter results.Last quarter, the company's adjusted earnings of 14 cents beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny. The company has an excellent earnings surprise history, with an average positive surprise of 6.9% in the trailing four quarters.What to Expect?The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at 17 cents, which is above the year-ago period figure of 16 cents. We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate has remained nearly stable inthe past 30 days. Additionally, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of roughly $99 million, up 10% from the year-ago quarter.Factors to Influence Q3 ResultsRambus hassigned a patent licensing agreement with Taiwan-based company Winbond Electronics Corporation and hard disk drive (HDD) manufacturer, Western Digital Corp. (WDC  -  Free Report) for an undisclosed sum.Per the terms of the agreement, both the companies can use Rambus’ patented technology for five years. Rambus will receive royalty payments during the contract period. We believe this association will support Rambus’ fundamentals in the upcoming quarters.Additionally, licensing agreements, the result of successful monetization of the company’s patents, remains a recurring source of revenue.Going forward,Rambus recently inked a deal with eftpos, the Australian domestic debit network, to help users in Australia to secure transactions with Apple.Furthermore, the companyhas acquired certain serial link assets of Semtech Corporation’s Snowbush IP and Smart Card Software. These deals and acquisitions will boost the company’s top and bottom-line performance in the to-be-reported quarter, in our view. Further, it will enhance its product offerings.Let’s have a look at what our quantitative model predicts:According to our quantitative model, it cannot be conclusively predicted if Rambus will be able to beat earnings estimates in the third quarter. This is because it does not have the right combination of two main ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.  Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Rambus is 0.00%, as both the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 17 cents.Zacks Rank: Rambus carries a Zacks Rank of 3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. But we also need to have a positive ESP to be confident of a positive earnings surprise.Hence, the combination of Rambus's Zacks Rank #3 and Earnings ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult.Rambus, Inc.

136,AMAT,"NCR Corporation (NCR  -  Free Report) reported mixed results for third-quarter 2017. The company’s non-GAAP earnings (excluding restructuring, acquisition-related expenses and other one-time items) from continuing operations of 93 cents per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 90 cents and surged 6.9% year over year.Quarterly earnings also came toward the higher end of the company’s guided range of 88-93 cents. The robust bottom-line performancecan primarily be attributed toefficient cost management and a lower share count.Notably, the stock has outperformed the industry in the last year. NCR’s shares have returned 21.8% against the industry’s decline of 1.4%.RevenuesThe company’s revenues of $1.663 billion missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.683 billion and decreased a marginal 0.8% on a year-over-year basis. The softness in revenues during the quarter was primarily impacted by weakness in the ATM business.Per the company, “ATM orders continue to be negatively impacted by large customer delays in spending in North America, weakness in India, the Middle East and Africa, and the upcoming Windows 10 conversion.”The company’s product revenues came in at $657 million, down 7.2% from the year-ago-quarter. However, service revenues increased 3.8% year over year and came in at $1.006 billion.During second-quarter 2016, NCR modified reportable segments to reflect changes in its structure. The new reportable segments are Software, Services and Hardware segments.The company’s Software revenues on a reported basis were up 2% to $476 million. The increase was primarily due to a 5%, 6% and 3% increase in Cloud, Professional Services and Software maintenance revenues, respectively. Nonetheless, Software license was down 12%. Notably, net ACV during the quarter increased 37% and came in at $16 million in the quarter.Services revenues increased 3% to $609 million on a reported and constant currency basis. The increase was primarily due to hardware maintenance growth.Hardware revenues however decreased 6% year over year on a reported basis to $578 million.The segment revenues from ATM and SCO declined 16% and 24%, respectively, which negatively impacted the overall hardware revenues. However, revenues from POS surged 19%, while that of IPS remained flat on a year-over-year basis. The increase POS revenues were primarily owingto new products rollout and replacements. On a constant currency basis, Hardware revenues decreased 7%.MarginsNon-GAAP gross profit for the quarter decreased 1% and came in at $486 million, primarily due weakness in ATM business and unfavorable revenue mix. Further, the non-GAAP gross margin decreased 10 basis points (bps) to 29.2%, mainlydue to lower software license revenue and reduced hardware margins.Income from operations on a non-GAAP basis was $235 million, up from $230 million a year ago. Also, operating margin expanded 40 bps on a year-over-year basis, primarily due to strong cost control measures, lower employee compensation expenses as well as better productivity.Non-GAAP operating expenses during the quarter came in at $251 million, reflecting an increase from $261 million in the year-ago quarter.Non-GAAP net income from continuing operations was $143 million compared with $135 million in the year-ago quarter.Balance Sheet & Cash FlowThe ATM and POS manufacturer exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of approximately $405 million, up from $377 million in the previous quarter. Receivables were $1.41 billion compared with $1.32 billion in the previous quarter.However, NCR has a highly-leveraged balance sheet. The company ended the quarter with $2.98 billion of long-term debt in its book as compared with$3 billion reported in the previous quarter.In the third quarter, the company generated operating cash flow of $133 million and free cash flow was $18 million.The company did not repurchase any share in the quarter under review. However, during the nine months ended Sep 30, 2017, the company repurchased $350 million of its common stock.Disappointing GuidanceNCR reduced revenue and earnings outlook for 2017. Additionally, the fourth-quarter guidance was disappointing.For the year, the company now anticipates revenues in the range of $6.475-$6.525 billion, lower than previous guided range of $6.63-$6.75 billion. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at $6.68 billion. The lower-than-expected revenue guidance was primarily due to weakness in ATM market.Non-GAAP earnings per share are now anticipatedin the range of $3.10-$3.20, lower than the previous guided range of $3.32-$3.42 per share. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $3.37. The decrease in earnings per share was mainly due to lower ATM hardware and attached software licenses.The company now expects operating cash flow in the range of $745-$775 million (previous guidance $805-$830 million).  Moreover, free cash flow is now anticipated to be between $440 million and $470 million (previous guidance $500 million and $525 million). The decrease in the cash flow outlook was mainly due to effect of lower revenues.Coming to the fourth-quarter outlook, NCR expects revenues in the range of $1.74-$1.79 billion. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $1.93 billion.The company expects non-GAAP earnings per share for the third quarter in the range of 83-93 cents. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $1.11 per share.Our TakeNCR reported mixed third-quarter 2017 results wherein the bottom line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate while thetop line missed the same. Also, the company lowered fiscal 2017 outlook and provided disappointing fourth-quarter guidance. The main reason behind such a weak view was softness in ATM market.Hence, the lower-than-expected revenues during the quarter poor guidance impacted the share price movement. Shares of the company went down more than 10% in after-hours trading yesterday.Nonetheless, we expect NCR’s POS platform to be a tailwind. The demand for NCR’s POS solution is increasing among retailers and restaurant owners as it facilitates the automation of bill payment and accounting. As a result, managers get ample time for customer interaction, leading to increased productivity.Global research company RBR recently acknowledged NCR as the world’s #1 POS software provider for the retail and hospitality industries. The recognition reflects NCR’s portfolio strength as well as improving opportunities in the POS market. Moreover, continuous product launches and synergies from acquisitions are catalysts. Additionally, continuous deal wins will drive growth.However, competition from Diebold Inc. (DBD  -  Free Report) and HP Inc. (HPQ  -  Free Report), and a high debt burden remain concerns.Currently, NCR carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A better-ranked stock in the technology sector is Applied Materials, Inc.

137,AMAT,"Germany-based enterprise application software, SAP SE (SAP  -  Free Report) is slated to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 19.Last quarter, the company reported earnings of $1.03, reflecting a beat of 1%. Overall, SAP has a modest earnings surprise history, with an average positive surprise of 2.2% in the trailing four quarters.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlaySAP is poised to grow on the back of resilient Cloud and Software business, a strong business network spread over critical client demand areas, superior customer management along with growth of S/4HANA and other Cloud initiatives.Over the past few quarters, the company has recorded spectacular growth in S/4HANA and other Cloud initiatives, which in turn, has provided a boost to financials. During second-quarter 2017, the company gained 500 customers, of which 30% is entirely new. The company anticipates demand for S/4 HANA to surge, which will prove conducive to operating profit and bottom-line growth in the to-be reported quarter.SAP’s renewed focus on strengthening IoT foothold is also expected to boost the top line in the quarter under review, as it has resulted in significant client wins. With business enterprises leveraging state-of-the-art technology to outshine peers, we believe that SAP’s market leading portfolio will continue to witness increased demand, thus supplementing its financials.Moreover, SAP has been focusing on expanding cloud business to become one of the leading players in the category. The company has a competitive edge over its cloud competitors as its processes are designed to be industry-specific and can be customized to meet corresponding business requirements. Further, solid adoption of the company’s human capital management (‘HCM’) applications, led by SuccessFactors Employee Central, is expected to drive the results in the upcoming quarter.However, the fact remains that dull prospects of the global IT industry in recent quarters, along with flat customer spending projections are adversely affecting SAP’s performances. This apart, over the past few quarters, many of the company’s emerging markets have faced fiscal imbalances and general economic slowdowns, which adversely impacted purchasing power. Moreover, sluggishness in China might dent the IT spending in the country, which might reflect poorly on the upcoming quarterly results.Furthermore, the IT services industry is characterized by stiff competition from technology behemoths, which in turn may also dampen the third-quarter financials. This apart, currency fluctuations in many of its key markets are also likely to thwart sales for the upcoming results.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show an earnings beat for SAP this time around. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESPand a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

They will also possess the power to cancel or return orders.The service is not Prime exclusive but if parents are Prime members, the teens get select benefits at no additional cost. Amazon.com, Inc. Revenue (TTM) Amazon.com, Inc. Revenue (TTM) | Amazon.com, Inc. QuoteLooking for New MarketsOwing to Amazon’s increasing penetration rate, there is always a chance of Prime saturation in the United States. To counter this, Amazon is raising Prime perks, such as the recent one, and introducing it to new demographics.In June, Amazon launched a discounted monthly price for Prime members who receive government assistance. While the subscription usually costs $99 a year or $10.99 per month (for those who do not pay upfront), there is also a special price of $5.99 per month. The move is targeted at the lower income group.In April, the company launched Amazon Cash to push Prime to underbanked and unbanked customers and those who are reluctant to use cards for online shopping fearing cyber theft. It is a service that enables customers to add cash to their Amazon.com accounts using a barcode generated from its website.How Should Investors Look at Amazon Prime?Amazon’s retail business remains very hard to beat on price, choice and convenience, Prime and Fulfillment By Amazon (FBA).Prime memberships help in repeat sales of not just general merchandise but also media (books, music, video, etc). Prime members are much more loyal and spend double the amount spent by non-Prime members.So, if Amazon is able to replicate its domestic success with Prime internationally, investors could see far more growth.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderAmazon has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).Better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector include Micron Technology, Inc.

139,AMAT,"In a bid to popularize its virtual reality offerings among the masses, Facebook Inc (FB  -  Free Report) has unveiled a new cheaper VR headset – Oculus GO.  It carries a price tag of $199, much lower than Oculus Rift, which, at the time of its launch, carried a price tag of $599.It is to be noted that apart from Rift and GO, Facebook also has another headset named GEAR VR (priced at $129) that can be paired with all Samsung smartphones and works just like Oculus GO. However, GO is for people who don’t have a Samsung smartphone. For some time now, Oculus has been weighed down by numerous problems. Rift, despite being one of the most anticipated products, received mixed reviews from critics and users. Its hefty price tag was a dampener. In addition, the expensive $599 headset (with Touch controllers for another $200) requires a powerful $1000 PC to operate.Facebook, Inc. Price Facebook, Inc. Price | Facebook, Inc. QuoteThis makes the device affordable to only a handful of customers and is primarily targeted toward hardcore gamers. To change that and bring more consumers under its fold, Facebook is rethinking its pricing strategy, taking a leaf from Sony’s (SNE  -  Free Report) success story.Sony has seen great success with its virtual reality headgear, PS4 headset largely driven by its compatibility with a PS4 console and a relatively low price tag of $399. In June, the consumer electronics giant announced that it has sold over 60.4 million units of the console and over 1 million headsets. In contrast, per a research firm Canalys, Facebook has sold less than 400,000 units of Rift in last year.Facebook has now permanently slashed the price to $399. In March, Facebook had first slashed the price of the headset to $499 from $599 originally. Price of Touch controllers was trimmed to $100 from the original $200.Oculus was founded by Palmer Luckey and Brendan Iribe in 2012 and acquired by Facebook in 2014. Facebook’s ambitious AR/VR plans are being fueled by Oculus. The company’s CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, said that Facebook will spend over $3 billion over the next 10 years. Zuckerberg believes that VR will emerge as a major computing platform in the coming years.However, in February, Zuckerberg was quoted saying that the virtual reality efforts aren’t profitable now. However, he asked the investor community to be patient as the investments in VR will take some time to generate profits.At its Oculus Connect Annual conference, Mark Zuckerberg was quoted by media reports saying,“Some people think that VR is isolating and antisocial. I honestly think it’s the opposite. If you can’t think of any way that your reality can be better then you’re not thinking hard enough.” Zuckerberg has big ambitions as reflected in Facebook's target to bring a billion people to use VR in the near future.Apart from headsets, Facebook’s VR offering include Facebook Spaces. Spaces will enable users to connect with family and friends in an interactive virtual environment. Users can create their VR avatar and customize it to make it look like them. The app will not only help to create a virtual world but also keep users connected to reality by enabling Messenger calling.Recently, Spaces was in the news for all wrong reasons as Mark Zuckerberg chose his cartoonish avatar to take a virtual tour of disaster hit Puerto Rico. Hurricane Maria has wreaked havoc in this tiny Caribbean island and it is grappling with a crisis of mammoth proportions.Zacks Rank & Share Price MovementAt present, Facebook carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).  In the past one year, Facebook’s shares have generated return of 35.2% compared with the Zacks Internet Services industry’s gain of 20.7%.Stocks to Consider Better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector include Applied Materials (AMAT  -  Free Report), and Jabil Inc (JBL  -  Free Report).

140,AMAT,"Netflix Inc. (NFLX  -  Free Report) is set to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 16. The company has beaten the Zack Consensus Estimate thrice and missed it once in the past four quarters, delivering an average positive surprise of 28.6%.Last quarter, the company reported earnings of 15 cents per share, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 16 cents. However, revenues increased 32.3% year over year to $2.786 billion and beat the consensus estimate of $2.761 billion. Subscriber growth primarily helped Netflix generate significant revenues.Notably, shares of Netflix have gained 57.5% year to date, significantly outperforming the industry’s 12.6% rally.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderNetflix has been drawing strength from its growing portfolio of original content. The company has also been ramping up its efforts to boost regional programming. This is expected to expand its international presence as the domestic market approaches saturation.We believe the strength of its content portfolio will drive subscriber growth across the globe. Notably, apart from North America, the company has been doing really well in Latin America and Europe. Netflix is doing considerably well in India and Japan as well and has a lot of room for expansion in other Asian markets.The company’s growing subscriber base is indicative of the fact that audiences are happy with its content. This is further evident from the latest survey conducted by RBC Capital Markets lead Internet analyst Mark Mahaney. Per the survey, 36% of Netflix’s surveyed subscribers mentioned that “Netflix's content is improving over its already strong position.”Additionally, 67% of subscribers said that they were ""extremely"" or ""very"" satisfied with Netflix. In July, the company announced that it has 104 million subscribers globally. The company expects to have added 3.65 million subscribers in the international segment and 0.75 million subscribers in the domestic streaming segment in third-quarter 2017.Recently, Netflix won 20 Emmy Awards out of the 91 categories that it was nominated in, compared with nine awards and 54 nominations last year. The award wins reflect the growing popularity of Netflix’s original content. The acquisition of comic book publisher Millarworld in August will further help the company to improvise on its contents.However, investors need to watch out for high costs that accompany rapid international expansion and production of original content. The whopping budget of $6 million to be spent on original content this year might weigh on the bottom line. Also, stringent competition from established players like Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) Prime, Hulu and Time Warner’s HBO is a major headwind.Netflix, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Netflix, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Netflix, Inc. QuoteEarnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Netflix is likely to deliver a positive surprise this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here as you will see below:Zacks ESP: Netflix’s Earnings ESP is -0.02%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Netflix’s Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are a couple of companies that you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to deliver an earnings beat in their upcoming release:Applied Materials (AMAT  -  Free Report) with an Earnings ESP of +0.37% and a Zacks Rank #1.

141,AMAT,"Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report) has come up with the latest and the most advanced e-reader from the Kindle range, the all-new Kindle Oasis.The new e-reader comes with few hardware improvements and new features.Notably, Amazon has underperformed the industry on a year-to-date basis. Shares of the company have gained 32.7% compared with the industry’s growth of 53.2%.More Into The HeadlinesThe new version has many impressive features. It is the first waterproof Kindle device, which is protected against immersion in up to two meters of fresh water up to 60 minutes.Secondly, the new Oasis has Audible built in, which allows users to quickly switch from reading to listening a book on Bluetooth-enabled speakers or headphones. Currently, it has 250,000 audiobooks available for download. The new e-reader also comes with a great battery life. Its battery can last for up to six weeks and once discharged, it can be fully charged in less than two hours.With a huge seven-inch screen, the new Kindle version fits 30% more words per page than the earlier version.Much like the other devices in the range, Kindle Oasis flaunts features like the latest touch technology, enhanced page-turning experience and an X-Ray feature offering useful insight into books.Shipment & PricingPriced at $249.99 for the 8 GB model and $279.99 for the 32 GB model, the latest Kindle Oasis is available for preorders. Additionally, Kindle version with cellular connectivity too is available for $350. Amazon expects to start the shipment of the device starting Oct 31.However, the new model is way more expensive than the earlier ones. Currently, Amazon’s basic Kindle version is available for $80 while Kindle Paperwhite with high resolution display and adjustable front light is priced at $120.The latest Kindle Oasis’ elevated price is definitely a drag as many low-priced options are available in the market. Naturally, it might not necessarily attract dedicated e-readers who are keen on investing in a product with high screen quality, durability and battery life.To ConcludeAmazon, the world's largest Internet retailer has been constantly upgrading its e-book readers and the related app to benefit customers and maintain its position as the leading e-book seller. The company, with its Kindle upgrades, has strengthened its presence in the market.Although the e-book market has matured overtime, a report by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) revealed that the consumer e-books (excluding educational publications) market is poised to reach the £1 billion mark by 2018.However, if Amazon fails to upgrade its Kindle devices or maintain competitive pricing, it could witness a major decline in overall e-reader sales.Amazon.com, Inc.

142,AMAT,"Semiconductor company, Micron Technology, Inc. (MU  -  Free Report), upped the size of its recently-announced public offering deal from 1 billion shares to 1.2 billion shares.These offerings were made after the company registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). Subject to customary closing conditions, this underwritten public offering is anticipated to close on Oct 16, 2017.According to its filing with the SEC, the company has agreed to sell around 29.3 million shares of its common stock, worth approximately $1.19 billion. In addition to the public offering, the underwriters have been given a 30-day option to purchase an additional 4.4 million shares.Notably, shares of Micron have moved up 146.9% in the last one year, significantly outperforming the industry’s 43.4% rally.Proceeds from the OfferingThe profits from the stock sale are primarily planned to go toward growth efforts. Further, Micron intends to use $476 million of the net proceeds from this offering for the repayment of 7.500% senior secured notes of $438 million in aggregate principal amount (due in 2023) and also pay related fees and expenses.Additionally, the remaining proceeds would be used for general business purposes and repayment of outstanding debts. This public offering will help in diversifying the company's investment options. In fact, as part of the diversification strategy, it will allocate a chunk of the stockholders' equity in a variety of assets.Though a stock offering results in dilution of earnings, prudent investments in strategic assets are likely to help the company navigate through the challenging rate environment.The only underwriter for the offering is J.P. Morgan Securities LLC.Other PositivesThe enhanced capital deployment reflects Micron’s strong balance sheet as well asits confidence in long-term business prospects. During the fiscal 2017, the company generated operating cash flow of $8.153 billion.The company exited the fiscal fourth quarter with cash and short-term investments of $5.428 billion compared with $4.330 billion in the previous quarter. Based on this performance, Micron expects to spend more on research and development, capital expenditures and acquisitions, and at the same time devote more cash for stock repurchases.The only concern persisting is its liquidity, since Micron’s net cash position remains negative ($4.444 billion in the last reported quarter). Particularly so, since growth opportunities look limited in the near term, given the sluggish demand environment.In the stringent regulatory landscape, this offering is anticipated to further enhance the balance sheet as well as support future growth. Additionally, it will assist the company to bring down its cost of capital.Micron is positive about the product launches and growing demand, particularly that of SSD products. We also believe that any increase in prices will have a favorable impact on the overall results. We anticipate these benefits to be a tailwind for the company, going forward.However, after acquiring SanDisk, Western Digital Corporation (WDC  -  Free Report) has become a key player in the NAND space, which could intensify competition in the industry.Zacks Rank & Key PicksCurrently, Micron sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Some other top-ranked stocks worth considering in the technology sector are NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report) and Applied Materials, Inc. (AMAT  -  Free Report), both flaunting a Zacks Rank #1.

144,AMAT,"An article published on MarketWatch highlighted an analyst’s claims that chip inventories are at multi-year highs. This along with Qualcomm’s litigation case related to Korea Fair Trade Commission ruling weighed on the U.S. semiconductor sector on Sep 5.VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH  -  Free Report), PowerShares Dynamic Semiconductors ETF (PSI  -  Free Report) and iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF (SOXX  -  Free Report) lost in the range of 1.2% to 1.4% on the day. However, investors should note that this is a short-term or almost negligible blip as several positive factors are in play.Investors can very well use this dip as a buying opportunity to the broader semiconductor sector, relying on the below-mentioned factors:Upbeat Sales The Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) recently announced that global sales of semiconductors were $33.6 billion in Jul 2017, marking a year-over-year gain of 24% and a sequential rise of 3.1%. All the key geographies registered both year-over-year and month-over-month increases in July, and the Americas market were at the forefront with year-over-year growth of 36.1% and a sequential rise of 5.4% (read: Semiconductor ETFs to Roar Higher As Q2 Earnings Unfold).Usage of Semiconductor in Cryptocurrencies Bitcoin is on a tear this year. The digital currency has now more than quadrupled in value from around $997 at the start of the year. Bitcoins are ‘mined’ by using a greater amount of computer processing power. Creation and transactions in bitcoin are controlled through cryptography to keep transactions secure (read: Bitcoin Skyrockets, Race to First Cryptocurrency ETF Heats Up).Like bitcoin, Ether or etherum is also popular this year. Now, mining of cryptocurrencies needs the usage of semiconductors. A hardware known as an ASIC (Application-Specific Integrated Circuit) has been designed exclusively for mining bitcoin. This where semiconductor companies can gain traction.As per Bloomberg, there was a 10-fold rise from April to June in the Ethereum market which helped shares of Nvidia Corp. (NVDA  -  Free Report) and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD  -  Free Report) substantially. Barclays recently added that Nvidia is better placed than its competitors to cash in on the cryptocurrency rally.DRAM/NAND Supply/Demand DynamicsDRAM and NAND prices have improved primarily due to higher-than-expected demand for PCs. It is a really promising area for the semiconductor market.In the early phase of the year, HP Inc hinted that there may be a shortage of DRAM and Flash memory chips. Notably, NAND flash memory chips are also used in smartphones and tablets. With rising adoption of smartphones, especially in emerging markets, demand for NAND chips are self-explanatory.Value-Centric AreaIn any case, semiconductor is the value-centric traditional tech area that is likely to have an upper hand in an edgy investing environment. Moreover, the semiconductor space is consolidating rapidly with a number of deals announced lately.Favorable Zacks RanksThe Zacks Sector Rank is in the top 44%.

145,AMAT,"On Sep 6, Microchip Technology Inc. (MCHP  -  Free Report) was upgraded to a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Why the Upgrade?Microchip recently reaffirmed its second- quarter guidance on the back of successful execution of its strategic initiatives, optimization of manufacturing operations and a favorable macro environment.Management expects fiscal second-quarter 2018 net sales to be approximately $1.00 billion, which reflects growth of approximately 3% on a sequential basis and 14.6% on a year-over-year basis. Earnings are anticipated to be in the range of $1.33–$1.37 per share for the quarter.Notably, the company’s last reported quarter results were impressive. Adjusted earnings of $1.31 per share were up 56% year over year and 12.9% sequentially. The figure exceeded the company’s expectations. The top line also saw a massive improvement with a 15.2% surge from the year-ago quarter and 7.7% sequential growth to $972.1 million.Accelerating demand for the company’s products led to the better-than-expected results, which along with an encouraging guidance drove shares. Microchip stock has gained 36.8% year to date, substantially outperforming the 20.3% rally of the industry it belongs to.Growth CatalystsMicrochip’s microcontroller business is one of the key catalysts behind the company’s robust performance. Strong demand of 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit microcontrollers drove the 9.5% sequential and 18.1% year-on-year growth of the segment, which constituted 65.4% of the revenues. The company’s acquisition of Atmel in April 2016 has enriched its microcontroller product portfolio, which aids its bottom line.Additionally, new products such as PIC32MX1/2 XLP and MOST-based Intelligent Network Interface controllers are anticipated to expand its customer base.

146,AMAT,"Juniper Networks, Inc. (JNPR  -  Free Report) recently announced that it intends to acquire Cyphort, a software security company. The deal, which is subject to customary conditions, is expected to be wrapped up in a month.The acquisition is anticipated to expand the coverage of Juniper’s flagship security solution, Sky Advanced Threat Prevention. It will equip it with features that are in sync with cloud as well as on premises infrastructure.Cyphort is a provider of threat detection and security analytics. Its products are used by large to mid-size enterprises for enhancing their security metrics.

Revenue (TTM) Juniper Networks, Inc. Revenue (TTM) | Juniper Networks, Inc. QuoteWe believe that in a scenario where cyber-attacks like WannaCry and Petya caused major Internet outages in a span of a month, demand for cybersecurity solutions will increase manifold.

However, increasing competition from Cisco (CSCO  -  Free Report) post its acquisition of cyber-security solutions provider Sourcefire is a major headwind for Juniper.Nevertheless, Juniper’s enhanced security portfolio, the accelerated adoption of its cloud-based products (particularly in data center), growing demand for its switching product (the QFX line) and the recently unveiled Cloud-Grade networking that includes telemetry, automation and machine learning abilities, are anticipated to boost its top line in the near term.Zacks Rank and Key PicksJuniper Networks currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Better-ranked stocks in the broader tech space are Applied Optoelectronics, Inc.

147,AMAT,"Share price of Gogo Inc. (GOGO  -  Free Report) rallied to a new 52-week high of $14.28, eventually closing a tad lower at $14.23 on Sep 5. Notably, shares have gained 54.3% year to date, substantially outperforming the industry’s 10.4% decline. The outperformance can be attributed to high adoption rate of the company’s 2Ku technology.We note that the company has beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, delivering an average positive surprise of 4.62%. Long term earnings growth is currently pegged at 14%.Moreover, the company’s revenues have beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the past four quarters.Gogo reaffirmed its outlook for 2017. Revenues are projected to be in the range of $670–$695 million. Further, the company anticipates 2Ku installations of 450–550 aircraft, including approximately 150 in Commercial Aviation – Rest of World (CA-ROW).What’s Backing the Rally?Gogo’s Business Aviation (BA) business has been instrumental in driving the company’s top line. In the last reported quarter, BA service revenues grew 30% year over year to $42.2 million.Gogo’s 2Ku service has been a key growth driver. Lower bandwidth cost structure coupled with faster installation rate is helping the company to gain traction in the market. Further, the company in its last conference call stated that it launched 2Ku service on five new airlines in the quarter and plans to accelerate 2Ku installation post Labor Day. Reportedly, last month, the company’s 2Ku inflight connectivity solution was selected by Alaska Airlines for its entire Boeing and Airbus Fleet.Recently, the company’s onboard Internet connectivity services got a major push with the Federal Aviation Administration granting Supplemental Type Certification (STC) and Parts Manufacturer Approval (PMA) for the 4G dual-directional antennas that are to be used with Gogo AVANCE L5 – its new Wi-Fi inflight system.

Android One powers Xiaomi Mi A1, a new $234 (14,999 rupees) handset that was launched in the country yesterday.Google Global Director of Android Partner Programmes, Jon Gold told reporters that, ""I would not consider this a reboot... we have been working in this direction now for a couple of years just a little bit more quietly.""Alphabet shares have rallied 16.5% over the last year, outperforming the 12.7% gain of the industry it belongs to.A Strategic ChangeGoogle introduced the program in India in 2014 to make high-quality budget smartphones available to as many people as possible in developing economies. Under this initiative, Google designed the budget hardware while local companies like Micromax, Spice and Karbonn manufactured it. All devices were priced below $110 (7,000 rupees).But very few devices were launched leading to speculations that Google will do away with the program. The attempt was apparently a failure due to availability of phones with better specifications in that price range.However, Google appears to have solved this problem by shifting focus to a phone that is at a comparatively higher price point and loaded with nice specifications. The Mi A1 is Xiaomi’s first dual-rear camera phone that features 12 MP wide angle camera and a 12 MP telephoto camera.Alphabet Inc. Net Income (TTM) Alphabet Inc. Net Income (TTM) | Alphabet Inc.

150,AMAT,"Tech stocks exposed themselves to vulnerabilities of the trade conflict on Jun 27 whenPresident Donald Trump announced plans of a clampdown on foreign investments in American technology companies. Previously, the President chalked out plans reported earlier to stop firms with at least 25% Chinese ownership from taking over U.S. tech companies.Though the latest decision was perceived by investors as a little softer stance, it could not save tech stocks from slumping. Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLK  -  Free Report) was down 1.4% on Jun 27.Investors should note that the relationship between the United States and China has been in the spotlight since Trump’s election win in November 2016, as evident from the volley of verbal attacks made by Trump against China’s trade practices.Why China So Important to U.S. Tech SectorThe Chinese economy, the second largest in the world, but has been expanding at a much quicker clip than the United States. This emerging economy has aggressively been investing in U.S. companies, gradually emerging as a key origin of capital for the U.S. market.So, when both the United States and China enact a 25% tariff on each other’s $34 billion worth of goods from Jul 6, the investing world will definitely be bothered. And the tariff scenario may worsen as White House plans to enact tariffs on an extra $200 billion worth of Chinese goods, if China keeps retaliating.The pain for the tech sector is more because“semiconductor and semiconductor equipment companies have the highest revenue exposure to China at 52%” (per Morgan Stanley equity strategists). Tech Hardware & Equipment companies have about 14% sales exposure to China.Chipmaker Qualcomm (QCOM  -  Free Report) has 65% revenue exposure to China and Nvidia’s (NVDA  -  Free Report) sales exposure to China is 56%, per Goldman Sachs. Apart from these, some other tech and semiconductor companies, which have sales exposure to China in the range of 22% to 55%, include the likes of Intel (INTC  -  Free Report), Micron Technology (MU  -  Free Report) and Applied Materials (AMAT  -  Free Report). This clearly explains why the mood is especially somber in the semiconductor space. So, VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH  -  Free Report) was down more than 2.4% on Jun 27.Time for Small-Cap Tech Stocks?While these large-cap stocks are bearing high chances of getting hurt by the possible trade war, investors can take a look at small-cap technology stocks, which are more domestically focused and thus less vulnerable to souring trade relations.Stock PicksThe following tech stocks have a market cap of less than $1 billion.Xplore Technologies Corp (XPLR  -  Free Report)This Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company is in the business of developing integrating and marketing mobile wireless Tablet PC computing systems.

151,AMAT,"The Trump administration announced plans today for a stronger security review process of foreign investors acquiring American technologies that would rely on existing laws, taking a step back from previous gestures indicating it would specifically block Chinese investments.This move is perceived as more economically friendly to global investors who were concerned the U.S. Treasury was about to create a virtual blockade of firms with at least 25 percent Chinese ownership from buying U.S. companies with ""industrially significant technology.""“Such legislation will provide additional tools to combat the predatory investment practices that threaten our critical technology leadership, national security, and future economic prosperity,” Trump said in a statement.Instead of creating new executive powers, the Treasury Department recommended that Trump use the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), a 1980s law which already gives the executive branch the power to review foreign investments seen as a national security risk.Loose WH Lips Sink ChipsPart of the volatility for global stock markets the past few months has been due to the unpredictable rhetoric from the Administration. With no less than five voices besides Trump's -- including Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, US Trade liaison Robert Lighthizer and economic advisors Larry Kudlow and Peter Navarro -- all speaking to the media, many apparently ""official"" statements are later retracted or modified.In the end, any meaningful action on the Chinese threat to US intellectual property is probably a good thing. But it's the short-term uncertainty about how it evolves that has both investors and technology companies on edge.Caught in the middle of the White House ""America First"" agenda are a number of big US companies who complain that the tariffs penalize them for their globe-spanning supply chains. And the Semiconductor industry may be the most vulnerable right now.Global supply chains for Semiconductor manufacturing and equipment are probably some of the most complicated. Tariffs will definitely throw a wrench in the works.Chips are often designed and produced in the US, sent to China for packaging or testing and then returned back to the States. The chips would now be subject to tariffs on the return trip.Earlier this month, a spokesman for the Semiconductor Industry Association made their views clear...""Tariffs on semiconductors would harm, not help, U.S. semiconductor companies, their workers, and American consumers.""In the video that accompanies this article, I go over the last few week's of ""trade battle"" rhetoric that have led to a 9% sell-off in the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (SOX), and individual declines (from their June peaks) in these 5 popular investments...Lam Research (LRCX  -  Free Report): -17%Applied Materials (AMAT  -  Free Report): -14%These first 2 companies are wafer fabrication equipment (WFE) makers for the actual chip makers like Intel, Samsung, Micron and even NVIDIA.Micron (MU  -  Free Report): -13.5%NVIDIA (NVDA  -  Free Report): -11%Alibaba (BABA  -  Free Report): -11.5%Wait -- Alibaba isn't a chip stock. Why did I include them?Because I can't believe this ""Amazon of China"" is a victim in this trade war. I explain in the video with my thesis on why you buy BABA as the premier gateway to the world's largest middle class.The Threat of ""Made in China 2025""I also explain the motives of the Trump administration and what threat(s) in particular they are combating. This excerpt from a June 15 Wall Street Journal article gives some good background...White House officials said the goal of the tariff fight is to protect high-tech U.S. companies from pressure they face in China to transfer their technology to Chinese partners. Tariffs are necessary, the officials say, to force Beijing to change the way it does business.""We're going to stop, we hope, their transfer of technology -- their forced transfer of technology,"" U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said on Fox Business Network.What is ""Made in China 2025?"" It's their long-term strategic technology plan, issued by Chinese Premier Li Keqiang and his cabinet in May 2015, to comprehensively upgrade Chinese industry.The goals include increasing the domestic content of core materials to 40% by 2020 and 70% by 2025. The plan clearly focuses on high-tech fields including the pharmaceutical and semiconductor industries to which China has largely depended on US and European companies for advanced technology.The Council on Foreign Relations has said it believes the plan is a ""real existential threat to U.S. technological leadership.""And so it was no surprise when, on June 15, the Trump administration unveiled a lengthy tariff list mainly focused on the products included in the Made in 2025 plan, including IT and robotics related products.The War to Protect WFE -- And Its Costs Intel, Samsung, Micron and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) have always been big customers for WFE. “But Chinese chip makers are starting to write some large checks as well,"" according to Dan Gallagher of the Wall Street Journal.Applied Materials CFO Dan Durn in his company's quarterly earnings call last month confirmed this sentiment from their business...""China is emerging as a spender. Their strategic intent is clear, and the financial resources they have are clear.“But as Dan Gallagher wrote in his June 25 article Chip-Equipment Makers in Crosshairs of Trade War...“Wars are generally good news for arms dealers. In the burgeoning trade war with China, the semiconductor-equipment industry may turn out to be a notable exception.“To be sure, China isn't the only driver of growth for the chip-equipment sector. Strong spending in memory and process-node upgrades at the major chip makers are also fueling increased spending on equipment. But Krish Sankar of Cowen & Co. estimates that China accounted for about 14% of trailing 12-month revenue, on average, for the eight semiconductor-tool companies he covers.""That means the loss of future sales could be significantly more. War is hell.”While I have believed that we are in the midst of a Technology Super Cycle (email Ultimate@Zacks.com to get a free copy of my December 11, 2017 special report) driven by exponential data and memory demands, exponential mobile and connected/IoT device growth, artificial intelligence, and automation including ADAS vehicles, it looks like the ""war on China"" is throwing a big wrench in the works after all.But I still think it will set up terrific buying opportunities in all these companies as the pessimism peaks this summer. Here’s to a short battle with China instead of an all-out war.Disclosure: I own shares of NVDA, AMAT, MU, and BABA for the Zacks TAZR Trader portfolio.Kevin Cook is a Senior Stock Strategist for Zacks Investment Research where he runs the TAZR Trader service.

152,AMAT,"Recently, KLA-Tencor Corporation’s (KLAC  -  Free Report) rating has been downgraded by Needham’s analyst Y. Edwin Mok to “hold” from “buy”.This downgrade comes on the heels of lower customer spending on foundry products and memory pushouts. Moreover, KLA’s customer concentration poses a serious threat to its shipment growth.Following this announcement, the company’s share price declined 3.4% at market close on Jun 22.Coming to the price performance over the past 12 months, shares of KLA have returned 10.9%, outperforming the industry’s rally of 30.9%.Factors in DetailPer the analyst, the ongoing sluggish trend in customers’ investments on 7 nanometer (NM) and 5 NM foundry products is likely to persist throughout the second half of 2018. This poses a serious threat to the KLA’s shipments.Further, Samsung, one of the most important customers of KLA, has decided to postpone some of its 10 NM DRAM production and related equipment purchases. Notably, Samsung has accounted for more than 10% of KLA’s total revenues for three consecutive years since fiscal 2015.This is likely to impact the demand for KLA’s wafer equipments adversely. Its shipments in the third-quarter of calendar year 2018 will be hurt, which will further hinder the company from meeting its shipment expectations.Further, fall in wafer demand from major customers will hurt the fundamentals and profitability of the company. Consequently, restricted number of customers remains a major issue.Moreover, this decision of Samsung has resulted in share price declines of Lam Research (LRCX  -  Free Report) and Applied Materials (AMAT  -  Free Report).Further, the recent trend of transition from 2D NAND to 3D NAND remains negative for wafer demand since the latter requires less wafer and provides higher density.KLA’s Performance & Positive OutlookDespite of the cyclicality in consumer investment pattern and major transitions in the semiconductor industry, KLA managed to perform well in the third-quarter fiscal 2018.KLA reported revenues of $1.02 billion which improved 5% year over year. Product revenues came in $797.8 million, accounting for 78% of revenues. This can primarily be attributed to increased investments from memory and logic customers for next generation technology as well as capacity-related investments.Additionally, shipments were $1.041 billion, which went beyond the guidance of $945 million to $1.025 billion. Memory, foundry and logic contributed 78%, 13% and 9%, respectively.Moreover, we remain optimistic about the company’s positive outlook for fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 in which the company expects revenues between $1.02 billion and $1.08 billion, and shipments in the range of $1.01-1.09 billion.Memory shipments are anticipated in the range of 60-70% of the total shipments, foundry is likely to account for 24% while logic is expected to account for 8% o the shipments. Further, in foundry segment, KLA expects orders for the first wave of investment in 5 NM in the second half of 2018.Consequently, the positive business outlook, strong fundamentals and continued momentum in China are likely to aid the stock rebound in the upcoming quarters.KLA-Tencor Corporation Revenue (TTM) KLA-Tencor Corporation Revenue (TTM) | KLA-Tencor Corporation QuoteZacks Rank & Stock to ConsiderCurrently, KLA carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A better-ranked stock that can be considered in the broader technology sector is Micron Technology (MU  -  Free Report), sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

153,AMAT,"The trade tensions between the United States and China have hit a fever pitch. Both will now enact a 25% tariff on each other’s $34 billion worth of goods from Jul 6. The remaining $16 billion worth of goods will be under public review. But the situation may take an uglier turn as White House plans to enact tariffs on an extra $200 billion worth of Chinese goods, if China keeps retaliating.Per an article published on CNBC, the following sectors have the highest revenue exposure to China and are thus more susceptible to the trade war.Source: Thomson Reuters, Morgan Stanley Research EstimatesOn the basis of the above-mentioned chart, we dig a little deeper into these sectors amid tariff tensions.Semiconductor Per Morgan Stanley equity strategists, “semiconductor and semiconductor equipment companies have the highest revenue exposure to China at 52%” and are thus exposed to maximum risks on rising trade tensions (read: Apple's iPhone Order Cut Report May Hurt These ETFs).Chipmaker Qualcomm (QCOM  -  Free Report) has 65% revenue exposure to China and Nvidia’s (NVDA  -  Free Report) sales exposure to China is 56%, per Goldman Sachs. Apart from these, some other tech and semiconductor companies, which have sales exposure to China in the range of 22% to 55%, include the likes of Intel (INTC  -  Free Report), Micron Technology (MU  -  Free Report) and Applied Materials AMAT. This clearly explains why the mood is somber in the semiconductor space. So, VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH  -  Free Report) may face troubles.Energy It is a two-edged sword for energy companies. First, Donald Trump’s levy of a 25% tariff on steel imports and a 10% tariff on aluminum imports from China, Canada and Mexico became a pain for U.S. oil pipeline companies. This should push up raw material prices for pipeline operators.The article published on Reuters indicated that the U.S. pipeline industry is likely to suffer cost pressure from tariffs as the industry imports about 77% of its steel requirement, according to a 2017 study on the pipeline industry (read: Is $100-a-Barrel Oil Possible? ETFs in Focus).Major U.S. energy companies including Plains All American Pipeline (PAA, Hess Corp (HES  -  Free Report) and Kinder Morgan Inc (KMI  -  Free Report) are thus on the lookout for an exemption from steel-import tariffs, per Reuters. On the other hand, China proposed “25% levies on about $1 billion a month in U.S. oil imports in retaliation for U.S. tariffs.” Energy companies have about 14% exposure to China. So, Chinese energy tariff dealt another blow to the sector.ETFs that could come under pressure are Energy Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLE  -  Free Report) and Alerian MLP ETF (AMLP  -  Free Report).Tech Hardware & Equipment Tech companies that have extensive trade relations with China would be at high risk of falling prey to the trade war. In fact, Goldman Sachs has compiled a list of companies with considerable revenue exposure to China. These companies’ revenues are 14% exposed to China, per a CNBC article. SPDR S&P Technology Hardware ETF (XTH  -  Free Report) should thus be followed carefully.AutoBoth steel and aluminum are vital to the production of cars and trucks sold in America and would push up the sale prices of those vehicles considerably. Adding fuel to the ongoing trade tensions, the Trump administration has initiated a national security investigation into auto imports that may result in fresh tariffs (read: U.S. Auto Tariff Risk Put These ETFs and Stocks in Focus).U.S. auto companies earn about 12% revenues from China. With Beijing slamming tariffs on U.S. auto imports, First Trust NASDAQ Global Auto Index Fund (CARZ  -  Free Report) would come under pressure.Consumer ServicesAs tariff tensions heat up, inflation in the U.S. economy should perk up. Along with most market watchers, we too believe that companies will try to pass on some cost escalation to consumers. Moreover, higher inflation would give a boost to bond yields. This, in turn, might push up consumers’ borrowing costs and hurt iShares U.S. Consumer Services ETF (IYC  -  Free Report). In any case, U.S. consumer services have about 10% sales exposure to China. That is yet another risk to consumer funds.Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week. Get it free >>

154,AMAT,"The last few days have been downbeat for the semiconductor space. Three big semiconductor ETFs including VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF SMH, iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF SOXX and Invesco Dynamic Semiconductors ETF PSI lost about 2.8%, 2.7% and 2.8%, respectively, in the last ten days (as of Jun 20, 2018). This was against a 0.1% dip in the S&P 500-based fund (SPY  -  Free Report).The movement was more prominent for the asset-flow corner. The fund SMH saw about $720.7 million in assets gushing out from Jun 10 to Jun 16. The outflows were about ""45% of the total assets invested in the fund"", per etf.com. At present, the fund has about $632.0 million in assets.On the other hand, SOXX lost about $67.1 million in assets, SPDR S&P Semiconductor ETF (XSD  -  Free Report) saw an inflow of $7.6 million and PSI saw neither net inflow nor outflow.  Let’s delve a little deeper to find out what hurt SMH so bad.Tariff Tantrum: A Headwind for Semiconductors in General Such movements in semiconductors were due to President Donald Trump’s $50 billion levy on Chinese imports, which has been retaliated by a Chinese levy on an equal worth of goods, including U.S. crude and gasoline.Both will now enact a 25% tariff on each other’s $34 billion of goods from Jul 6. The remaining $16 billion worth of goods will be under public review. But the situation may take an ugly turn as White House plans to enact tariffs on an extra $200 billion worth of Chinese goods, if China keeps retaliating to U.S. tariffs(read: Time to Buy Defensive ETFs?).As the tariff tantrum has taken the global market in its grip, investors are busy assessing which segments will be at most risks. Here comes the semiconductor pain. Per Morgan Stanley equity strategists, “semiconductor and semiconductor equipment companies have the highest revenue exposure to China at 52%” and are thus exposed to maximum risks on rising trade tensions (read: Apple's iPhone Order Cut Report May Hurt These ETFs).Chipmaker Qualcomm (QCOM  -  Free Report) has 65% revenue exposure to China, and optical components manufacturer Lumentum LITE) has 23% exposure. Per Goldman Sachs, Nvidia (NVDA)’s sales exposure to China is 56%. Apart from these, some other tech and semiconductor companies, which have sales exposure to China in the range of 22% to 55%, include the likes of Intel (INTC  -  Free Report), Micron Technology (MU and Applied Materials (AMAT  -  Free Report). This clearly explains why the mood is somber in the semiconductor space.Why Asset Flow of SMH Was Especially HurtPer an article published on etf.com, both SMH and SOXX are liquid, but SMH has defeated SOXX in terms of average liquidity. Average daily trading volume of SOXX is more than 5.7 million shares while Average volume of SOXX is about 650,000 shares. Average daily volume of XSD and PSI are nearly 135,500 and 80,100 shares.Such solid liquidity encourages investors to track the tariff-related developments and “the day-in, day-out performance of the semiconductor sector” via SMH more than SOXX. Investors mainly targeted SMH to follow the downbeat performance in the semiconductor sector last week thanks to the vehicle’s greater efficacy on a short-term basis.Investors should note that higher average trading volumes result in a tighter bid/ask spread ratio and lower trading costs. So, when the broader semi-market recoils, there is high chance SMH will see solid inflows. Moreover, SMH (0.35%) has a lower expense ratio than SOXX (0.48%). This is another reason that can revive potential inflows in SMH in the long term.Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week. Get it free >>

155,AMAT,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for Applied Materials, Inc. (AMAT  -  Free Report). Shares have lost about 7.9% in that time frame.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is AMAT due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Recent EarningsApplied Materials reported robust fiscal second-quarter 2018 results, with both the top and bottom lines surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate.The company’s pro-forma earnings per share (EPS) of $1.22 beat the consensus mark by 9 cents and came in above the guided range of $1.10-$1.18 per share. Earnings were up 15% sequentially and 55% year over year.Revenues of $4.57 billion beat the consensus mark by $115 million and were above the guided range of $4.35-$4.55 billion, increasing 8.6% sequentially and 28.8% year over year. The revenue growth was backed by higher demand in most of the regions.Inflection-focused innovation strategy was the primary growth driver. The company continues to witness technological advancements in semiconductor and flat-panel display areas. 3D NAND, DRAM and patterning have led to significant market share gains.Applied Materials has well-differentiated products, and high market share in foundry and logic. It is significantly improving on its memory market share as well. Management expects robust double-digit growth in semiconductor, display and service businesses in 2018.Applied Materials remains strongly positioned in China, where it continues to witness robust growth in semiconductor and display.

156,AMAT,"One stock that might be an intriguing choice for investors right now is Applied Materials, Inc. (AMAT  -  Free Report). This is because this security in the Semiconductor Equipment - Wafer Fabrication space is seeing solid earnings estimate revision activity and is in great company from a Zacks Industry Rank perspective.This is important because, often times, a rising tide will lift all boats in an industry, as there can be broad trends taking place in a segment that are boosting securities across the board. This is arguably taking place in the Semiconductor Equipment - Wafer Fabrication space as it currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 30 out of more than 250 industries, suggesting it is well-positioned from this perspective, especially when compared to other segments out there.Meanwhile, Applied Materials is actually looking pretty good on its own too. The firm has seen solid earnings estimate revision activity over the past month, suggesting analysts are becoming a bit more bullish on the firm’s prospects in both the short and long term.Applied Materials, Inc.

157,AMAT,"In December, I wrote a special report for Zacks Confidential titled ""The Technology Super Cycle.""Today, in this article and the embedded video, I weave some excerpts of that report into my observations about Micron (MU  -  Free Report) and their recent Investor/Analyst Day that inspired research analyst Kevin Cassidy of investment bank Stifel Nicolaus to raise his price target on the stock to a Street-high $106.My summary idea of The Technology Super Cycle was this: Innovation is driving earnings growth in unseen productivity and efficiency that keeps inflation low and investment high.Every smart tech analyst on Wall Street is always looking for good ole' pc-driven technology to still be ""cyclical"" and inevitably peaking soon, and so they have been busy climbing over the top of each other to be the first to ""call the top"" quarter after quarter.But they've been wrong ever since the Goldman Sachs analyst downgraded Broadcom (AVGO) in October of 2014 at $70. And I've been buying stocks like that ever since, quarter after quarter. In fact, I led my Zacks followers in AVGO profits all the way to $250.Why So Many Miss the Exponential Revolution Trying to Pick the Top of the CycleWe are all aware on some level that technology innovation is changing our world, and the global economy, at ever faster rates. But have the impacts for technology investors become stretched, over-valued and about to decline?Both as citizens and investors we benefit from high tech: smartphones, apps, the cloud and HPC (high performance computing), semiconductor efficiency and software automation, biotechnology and even advanced energy tech like fracking.But we haven't really seen this powerful growth show up in the GDP of our 2% economy for the past 8 years or so.It's almost as if you could believe the pessimists who say that technology innovation is somehow hurting economic productivity by burdening us with systems that are complex to learn, susceptible to failure, and vulnerable to hacking. Or maybe they think that productivity only causes jobs to go overseas and profits and wages to go down.But in mid-November I offered a better answer to Zacks Ultimate members in our monthly ZU Strategy Session. In the ""Agree to Disagree"" segment, I challenged our Director of Research to a debate about whether ""This Time Is Different"" with respect to growth and equity valuations.My thesis: Technology was actually accelerating growth but we didn't see it in government data because productivity was also accelerating in ways uncaptured (or unpublicized) by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, thus changing both the numerator and the denominator of several derivative measurements.In more detail in my December report The Technology Super Cycle, I broke the ""problem"" down into two distinct and very important puzzles: productivity and inflation. Here's how I cracked the codes of these missing links...Missing Link #1: ProductivityAs I explained to investors over the past 10 years why we still needed to buy Tech and Biotech growth, there was one piece of the puzzle that I couldn't quite explain: if innovation was so high, why wasn't GDP higher?That's when I found the answer from Brian Wesbury in the summer of 2017: productivity, defined as Change in Outputs / Change in Inputs, has over 40% of the numerator dominated by Federal and State/Local government in the equation! Those areas do not produce productivity. Nor do their subsidies.In the video that accompanies this report, I share a wonderful bit of serendipity as Wesbury provided some great research ""artillery"" on the very same day I published my report, December 11, with his report “The Fallacy of Weak Productivity.” Missing Link #2: InflationWhile I felt lucky to have this great update from Wesbury on the day of my report, I also felt incredibly fortunate to discover an article by the chief economist of Vanguard two weeks ago (November 27, 2017) which completed my economic thought process about technological productivity.Dr. Joseph H. Davis titled his piece something very simple and provocative... The Federal Reserve versus Moore’s Law.In the piece, Dr. Davis further describes how semiconductor power, efficiency, and miniaturization keep shrinking the cost -- and increasing the productivity -- of everything. Here is an excerpt...“Moore’s Law is about more than smartphones, TVs, and Amazon Prime. Its knock-on effects restrain the need for higher prices in every corner of the economy, not just in high-tech products. Prices are a markup over marginal costs, and in an increasingly digitized world, that marginal cost inches closer to zero. That’s the story told by our analysis of detailed industry data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis.”Also in the video and my December report, I explain why NVIDIA (NVDA  -  Free Report) CEO Jensen Huang says we have entered a new super-charged version of Moore's Law with GPU chips that create massively parallel architecture for data processing. You can learn more in my video Get Your MPA In Deep Learning.Memory Creates the FutureMicron is an industry leader in innovative memory and storage solutions. Backed by nearly 40 years of technology leadership, their memory and storage solutions enable disruptive trends, including artificial intelligence, machine learning, and autonomous vehicles in key market segments like cloud, data center, networking, and mobile.This description from the company website helps put their business into the context of the larger technology world...The world is moving to a new economic model, where data is driving value creation in ways we had not imagined just a few years ago. Data is today’s new business currency, and memory and storage are emerging as strategic differentiators that will redefine how we extract value from data to learn, explore, communicate and experience.My top two Semiconductor recommendations in my December Technology Super Cycle report were NVIDIA and Lam Research (LRCX  -  Free Report) to capitalize on the former's leadership of burgeoning AI industries and the latter's command of the ""picks and shovels"" to create silicon gold with high-tech wafer fabrication equipment (WFE), along with peer Applied Materials (AMAT  -  Free Report).Lam and AMAT are highly-dependent on the cap-ex budgets of Micron, Samsung, and Intel and their demand for WFE exceeding $60 billion this year keeps these stocks attractive as both growth and value plays.So in late December, I was excited to hear Micron CEO Sanjay Mehrotra talk about similar themes. Here's what I wrote to my TAZR Trader members on December 20...I happened to catch the CEO of MU on Squawk Alley this morning, interviewed by the excellent Jon Fortt, and it was a clinic in not only the specifics of DRAM and NAND flash semis but also a wider commentary on my Tech Super Cycle. Here's the video link that you should watch if you consider yourself any kind of Semi investor...""We have barely seen the tip of the iceberg in Artificial Intelligence.""As long as Mehrotra and Co. keep executing at the heart of Technology and delivering superior growth, I'll keep listening to them.(end of TAZR excerpt)Micron Feeds the Mega Memory MonsterOn Monday May 21, Micron held an Investor/Analyst Day in New York where CEO Sanjay Mehrotra dropped a Godzilla-size 150-slide deck on Wall Street. Analysts will still be digesting it all this week. In fact, as I type this, Needham and Co. just raised their price target on MU shares from $76 to $100.In the video that accompanies this article, I go over the other two banks who've been competing this spring for the Street-high target on MU shares. More importantly, I explain the ""valuation"" conundrum that i-bank analysts have with a memory chip maker trading at 5 times when everyone is calling the top of the cycle.More importantly, I present several of Micron's slides from the presentation deck that sum up not only the growth prospects for MU but the wider implications for The Tech Super Cycle, including the $1.5 trillion market for “smart” cities.Finally, let me remind you about a little memory maker that I call Micron's ""lil' brother."" SMART Global Holdings (SGH  -  Free Report) is a $1 billion DRAM and NAND flash maker that serves several global markets, with a concentration in Brazil memory and mobile applications.The company is expected to deliver $1.4 billion in sales and $6.78 in EPS next fiscal year beginning September. Thus it trades much cheaper than Micron on a price-to-sales basis that make its slight P/E premium at nearly 7 times still very attractive.Speaking of Semi P/E multiples, you might want to also check out my article from last week: Do You Buy NVIDIA at This Valuation?Disclosure: I own shares of MU, NVDA, LRCX, and SGH for the Zacks TAZR Trader portfolio.Kevin Cook is a Senior Stock Strategist for Zacks Investment Research where he runs the TAZR Trader service.

158,AMAT,"Shares of Applied Materials (AMAT  -  Free Report) dipped recently on the back of weaker-than-expected guidance after the company reported its second-quarter financial results at the end of last week. However, the chipmaking equipment power posted strong overall results, and the stock looks like a great value at the moment.Recent ResultsApplied Materials reported adjusted Q2 earnings of $1.22 per share, which not only topped our Zacks Consensus Estimate by 9 cents but also marked a 54% surge from the year-ago period. Meanwhile, the company’s revenues climbed by 29% to $4.57 billion, also beating our consensus estimate.Investors reacted poorly to Applied Materials third-quarter guidance. The company now expects to post adjusted earnings in the range of $1.13 to $1.21 per share, which, at the time, came in at the low end of our Zacks estimate of $1.14 per share. The firm also called for revenues to fall between $4.33 billion and $4.53 billion, which came in line with our $4.45 billion estimate.Applied Materials’ updated Q3 guidance is not devastatingly low. And the recent stock price dip, coupled with strong overall growth projections has made AMAT stock look rather attractive.Recent Price MovementShares of Applied Materials are up roughly 11.7% over the last year, while the “Semiconductor Equipment - Wafer Fabrication” industry has surged nearly 30%. Year to date, AMAT stock has dipped 1.8% against its industry’s average climb of 8.6%. Applied Materials stock closed Monday at $50.00 per share or almost 20% below its 52-week high of $62.40 per share.With that said, AMAT stock is cheap at the moment based on its price alone, and also has a long way to go before it must face the added burden of having to jump into a new range. Furthermore, if we go back farther, investors will see that Applied Materials stock is on a stellar run. Applied Materials stock has skyrocketed 243.8% over the past five years, which outpaces its industry’s climb of 205%. Investors will also see that during the last three years, AMAT stock has soared 149%, against the S&P 500’s 28% gain. Clearly, the stock has performed insanely well over the last several years, and its recent dip just makes it a bit more attractive on the value end.ValuationComing into Tuesday, AMAT stock was trading at 10.9X forward 12-months earnings estimates, which marks a major discount compared the S&P 500’s 16.9X average. Diving a bit deeper, Applied Materials has traded well below its industry’s average over the last two years. This industry includes the likes of Lam Research (LRCX  -  Free Report), Advanced Energy Industries (AEIS  -  Free Report), and ASML Holding N.V. (ASML  -  Free Report). Applied Materials stock has traded as high as 17.4X over the past two years, with its median resting at 13.7X. The company is also currently trading almost directly in line with its two-year low, which it touched briefly last week. Over the last five years, the lowest AMAT stock has ever traded at was 10.6X forward 12-months earnings estimates—a figure it hit in late September of 2015.Therefore, looking back over the last several years, investors can say with some degree of confidence that AMAT stock is attractive at its current valuation, if not downright cheap.And a major reason that Applied Materials stock currently presents investors great value, on top of its recently declining stock price, is the company’s earnings outlook. Applied Materials is projected to see its adjusted earnings surge by nearly 35% this quarter, while its full-year EPS figure is expected to expand by nearly 41%.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

160,AMAT,"The Q3 earnings season is underway with major banks set to report this week. Earnings for the S&P 500 index are expected to grow 2.3% from the same period last year on 5% higher revenues, as per the latest Earnings Trends.However, earnings growth is on track to be the lowest this year after double-digit growth in each of the first two quarters and with high single-digit expected earnings growth in the last quarter. This is especially true as twin attacks by hurricanes Harvey and Irma have taken toll on many industries such as insurance, energy, airlines and autos. Per Moody's Analytics, the two storms may lead to $150-$200 billion in damages (read: Hurricanes Impact on Earnings ETFs?).While earnings estimates for Q3 have declined from 6.3% at the start of the period, the magnitude of negative revision is lower than the recent quarters. Of the 16 Zacks sectors, seven are likely to be contributors to earnings growth, with energy leading the way. Like the last reporting cycle, the energy sector has the strongest growth projection of 122.3% for Q3, primarily reflecting easier comparisons. This is followed by earnings growth of 16.1% for conglomerates, 9.7% for technology, 8.7% for industrial products, and 8.3% for construction.Given this, we have highlighted one ETF and one stock from some of these sectors that could make great plays as the Q3 earnings season unfolds. Each of these ETFs and stocks have a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). For stocks, we have added the extra flavor of a positive Earnings ESP.

161,AMAT,"Guidewire Software, Inc. (GWRE  -  Free Report) recently announced its intent to acquire Cyence for approximately $275 million, or $265 million net of $10 million cash on hand, which is subject to certain transaction-related adjustments.Cyence determines the economic impact of a cybercrime via a software platform that is built on cybersecurity related data science. We anticipate this acquisition to enrich Guidewire’s product portfolio, which is meant for Property and Casualty insurers.Given the growing rate of cybercrime related monetary losses, this is expected to be a valuable addition for Guidewire. Recently, in an article, IDG Communications quoted Cybersecurity Ventures stating that worldwide spending related to cybersecurity is projected to cross $1 trillion during 2017 to 2021. We believe the enhancement of the portfolio with cyber risk analytics solutions will be a positive for Guidewire in the long run.Shares of Guidewire have gained 59.2% year to date, outperforming the 27.3% rally of the industry it belongs to. Guidewire’s Inorganic Growth TrajectoryWe note that Guidewire’s acquisition strategy has boosted the company’s top line. The company’s acquisition of ISCS in February 2017, now called InsuranceNow, added around $16.2 million in hosting revenues in fiscal 2017.FirstBest (now called Guidewire Underwriting Management) and EagleEye Analytics (now known as Guidewire Predictive Analytics), which were acquired in 2016, and GuidewireNow (previously called ISCS) are a few prominent segments of the company.The cross-selling of the product suites has increased customer base and revenue generation. Guidewire’s customer base has expanded consistently as evident from the addition of nine new customers in fourth-quarter 2017.Guidewire Software, Inc. Revenue (TTM) Guidewire Software, Inc. Revenue (TTM) | Guidewire Software, Inc. QuoteOther Strategic Initiatives Guidewire is slowly shifting from the term-license based model to subscription base. This will be beneficial for the company in the long run as the majority of the enterprises are expected to lean toward cloud-based infrastructure going forward. The company expects subscription sales to rise to 20% to 30% in fiscal 2018 from 6% in fiscal 2017.Guidewire’s cloud deployment partner, Amazon’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) Web Services is also gaining momentum and this bodes well for it. According to Gartner, the global Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) market is expected to increase at a four-year CAGR of 18.4% over 2016–2020 time frame. This is also a positive for the company.However, the fact that its total addressable market (TAM) is limited only to the insurance sector is a headwind for the company in our view.

With these types of projects on the horizon and the consistent strength of its water meters, radios and software, the company anticipates municipal sales growth in the near future. Further, the company remains optimistic about long-awaited rebound in flow instrumentation, particularly in the oil and gas business.Badger Meter also anticipates that the continued strength of its core water meter business, led by the latest products and recovery in the flow instrumentation business, will stoke growth. Furthermore, it continues to see opportunities in the Middle East for ultrasonic water meters. Additionally, it is well positioned to gain from acceleration in large metering projects.During second-quarter 2017, Badger Meter acquired D-Flow Technology AB of Luleå, Sweden. The acquisition will help Badger Meter further enhance its successful E-Series Ultrasonic product line, lower production costs and provide a platform for further advancement of ultrasonic capabilities. Further acquisitions will drive the company’s growth.Notably, the company’s margin performance will be assisted by cost-reduction efforts made last year in the flow instrumentation area. Furthermore, in the municipal water markets, Badger Meter is maintaining strong pricing structure by not participating in low-margin opportunities. Also, its distribution consolidation strategy will drive margin in the near term.Also, the company’s cost-containment efforts and strong pricing structure continue to enhance competitive advantage, while driving profitable growth and improving returns.All these measures probably raised investors’ confidence and are anticipated to boost the company’s share price in the days ahead.In addition, positive estimate revisions reflect optimism in the company’s potential, as earnings growth is often an indication of robust prospects (and stock price gains) ahead.

164,AMAT,"Equinix Inc. (EQIX  -  Free Report), it seems, is set to expand its data center business across different regions. In a move to spread its European operations, the company recently completed the acquisition of an Istanbul-based data center from Zenium.The all-cash deal is valued at $93 million, and was signed and closed on Oct 6, 2017.The new data center, will be popularly known as IS2, and will help the company to meet growing demand for data center services in the region. The takeover will significantly expand Equinix’s presence in Turkey as well as Europe, where Zenium enjoys a significant presence. Istanbul data center acts as a bridge between Europe and Asia consequently addressing the increasing demand for colocation and interconnection services in Turkey.Per the definitive agreement, Equinix agreed to acquire three buildings and land from Zenium business. The IS2 data center will provide an area of approximately 1,500 square meters, with the provision to increase this to 12,000 square meters. This enables the company to proceed aggressively with its plan of developing data centers across different geographies.Equinix stock has gained 27.9% in the last one year, against a loss of 11% incurred by the industry it belongs to.Benefits of the AcquisitionThe addition of the aforementioned facilities will be beneficial for Equinix for a number of reasons. The deal will help the company expand its data center business in Turkey. Per International Monetary Fund, Turkey has the world's 17th largest nominal GDP and a population of around 80 million. Therefore, expanding its facility in the city will attract more enterprises to opt for Equinix’s data center services, leading to a revenue boost.According to the Global Interconnection Index, Europe is projected to increase 44% per annum reaching 1451 Tbps of installed capacity by 2020. Consequently, this deal will bode well for Equinix as the expansion of data centers will strengthen its portfolio in one of the major global trade hubs and financial centers.Additionally, Equinix believes that the buyout will help it support traffic growth between Europe, Latin America and Africa, which is anticipated to be driven by new submarine cable systems. Therefore, the company will be able to expand its interconnection capabilities across these three continents backed by this acquisition.Bottom LineAcquisitions have remained one of the key growth strategies for Equinix. Worldwide, the company owns 180 IBX data centers across 44 countries.The company remains positive on growing demand for data centers. To meet the growing demand for cloud services, the global interconnection and data center company is expanding its IBX data centers globally and gaining popularity among tech companies looking for data management. Therefore, the company anticipates its total addressable market for retail data centers to increase at a CAGR of 8% from 2013 to 2017 and reach $24.0 billion. Based on this projection, Equinix projects a revenue growth rate of 10% through 2017.Consequently, we believe that by acquiring Zenium data center, Equinix will be in a better position to capitalize on this opportunity. Moreover, the deal will help the company fortify its global footprint and bring in additional revenues.Nonetheless, we are concerned about the company’s growing debt burden, which will adversely affect the operating results as interest expense would flare up. Also, intensifying competition from the likes of AT&T (T  -  Free Report) and Verizon Communications (VZ  -  Free Report), as well as industry consolidation remain other near-term headwinds.Currently, Equinix carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A better-ranked stock in the same industry space is Applied Materials, Inc.

We believe the accelerated growth of the ADAS market has increased the adoption rate of the related applications provided by On Semiconductor, thereby improving its growth opportunity in the automotive market.Further improving end markets, less customer and product concentration have aided the company’s impressive performance.

169,AMAT,"Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report) plans to further expand its presence in the U.K. by opening another fulfillment center in Bolton, in the north west of England.For the last few years, the company has been spending heavily on its new fulfillment centers. These are important in order to provide the level of service customers have started expecting from Amazon.Notably, Amazon has underperformed the industry on a year-to-date basis. Shares of the company have gained 33.7% compared with the industry’s growth of 52.2%.More About the New FacilityThe new fulfillment center is expected to create 1,200 new full-time jobs, once the site gets operational in 2018.This new facility will focus on Amazon’s latest techniques where robots, vision systems and other high-end technologies will be used to speed up order deliveries.The online retailer has been increasing its investments to build and modernize fulfillment centers primarily to cut shipping costs and speed up delivery. Amazon, which already has 16 facilities in Britain, has been trying to increase its presence in the region. Since 2010, it has invested 6.4 billion pounds ($8.3 billion) in Britain to expand logistics, order filling, research and development and head office functions.In 2016, Amazon’s capital expenditure increased 51% on a year-over-year basis. A major part of it was utilized in the construction of 26 fulfillment centers and deployment of robotics technology inside them.Bottom LineFulfillment centers help Amazon in storage and shipping of products, besides handling returns quickly. In fact, these are important in order to provide the level of services customers expect from the company.Additionally, small retailers, who are unable to provide relatively cost-efficient shipping, are signing up for Amazon’s fulfillment services. Third parties also avail the company’s warehouses and shipping services. These, in turn, help the company boost revenues and drive expansion in the long haul.However, heavy investments in these arrangements (and several other initiatives) are keeping Amazon’s margins under pressure, thereby negatively impacting its bottom line. Also, Amazon’s retail business is currently facing stiff competition from Alibaba and eBay, among others.Amazon.com, Inc. Price and Consensus  Amazon.com, Inc. Price and Consensus | Amazon.com, Inc.

171,AMAT,"DST Systems Inc.  is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 earnings on Oct 20.We expect DST Systems to perform well driven by strength in its Financial Services segment and synergies from acquisitions. Continued share buybacks and dividend payments are the other encouraging factors.The company’s shares are moving in the upward direction of late. Notably, its shares have returned 7.4% in the past one month, outperforming the industry’s gain of just 2.5%.Financial Service Segment to Drive GrowthIn second-quarter 2017, DST Systems’ Domestic Financial Services operating revenues (excluding out-of-the-pocket reimbursements) rose 22.9% year over year and came in at $312 million. Benefits from businesses acquired from Boston Financial Data Services, Inc. (""BFDS"") in 2017 and increased revenues from organic growth along with positive market movement at ALPS positively impacted the segment.International Financial Services Segment increased from $31.2 million reported in the year-ago quarter to $231.1 million, primarily owing to synergies from International Financial Data Services Limited (""IFDS U.K."") acquisition.We believe that Financial Services’ revenues will grow in the upcoming quarters primarily backed by significant contributions from the acquisitions of, Kaufman, Red Rocks Capital, ALPS, IntelliSource, Subserveo and Finix.Important Developments of 2017DST Systems announced the completion of the acquisition of State Street's ownership interest in both BFDS and IFDS U.K. We believe that these acquisitions will be accretive to DST Systems’ earnings and will have a positive impact on the to-be-reported quarter.The company also has a strong business model. It generates recurring revenues and a good percentage of its business comes from long-term contracts with its customers. The company has developed the fee structure on a per-account and per-transaction basis, which indicates the fixed and flexible portion of revenues with respect to each client. Financial services companies that use DST System’s software to service multiple such clients generate incremental revenues with each additional client and/or transaction. The model ensures a minimum revenue level even when there are limited transactions.Meanwhile, persistent decline in registered accounts, ongoing consolidation in the U.S. financial services market and stiff competition from International Business Machines Corporation (IBM  -  Free Report) and Fiserv Inc. (FISV  -  Free Report) might put its fundamentals under pressure. Moreover, a high-debt burden remains a major concern.Currently, DST Systems carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

172,AMAT,"Global marketing and corporate communications firm Omnicom Group Inc. (OMC  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results before the opening bell on Oct 17. In the quarter, the company is likely to report flat revenues in North America, which accounts for more than half of the total corporate revenues.Whether this will hurt the bottom line of the company remains to be seen.Shrinking Ad BudgetsMarketing and media budgets usually have a positive correlation with the economy. However, media spending is currently trending in the opposite direction as continued uncertainty related to Trump’s proposed policy changes and taxes have led to a drastic reduction in advertising budgets and client spends. Moreover, there has been a marked shift in the recent years as media consumption patterns have evolved from traditional to digital media.Amid this backdrop, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues from the North American market in the to-be-reported quarter is currently pegged at $2,187 million compared with second-quarter revenues of approximately $2,176 million. Revenues from Europe and Latin America are also expected to be sequentially low with respective estimates of $933 million and $111 million compared with reported revenues of $1,013 million and $121 million in the prior quarter.In the present scenario, when the European economy is highly unpredictable particularly after the Brexit referendum, it becomes difficult for Omnicom to increase revenues and reduce costs. Brexit is also likely to result in higher tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade between the U.K. and the European Union, lowering the productivity of the company.Other Key FactorsStrengthening U.S. dollar is further likely to affect Omnicom's revenues. As the company expands its international operations, it highly exposes itself to risks from foreign exchange barriers and uncertainty from monetary devaluation. In addition, the company faces huge concentration risk as it relies on a few big clients for its businesses. The lacklustre top-line performance is expected to contribute to sequentially lower earnings in the impending quarterly results.Furthermore, our proven model does not conclusively show that Omnicom is likely to beat earnings this quarter as it does not possess the key components. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here as you will see below:Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is pegged at 0.00% as both stand at $1.10.

While this increases the predictive power of ESP, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise.Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing a negative estimate revisions momentum.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some companies that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Applied Materials, Inc.

173,AMAT,"Facebook Inc (FB  -  Free Report) COO Sheryl Sandberg in a sit down interview with news site Axios has expressed anger over how Facebook was misused by Russian factors to meddle with the 2016 elections and said that Facebook “owes an apology” to America.Reportedly, Sandberg further stated that Facebook is now more “determined” to prevent a recurrence in the future and in favor of making the Russian linked ad details public. However, she did not say when the company will do so.However, she refrained from answering questions, which required an explanation if there was any “overlap in targeting between Trump's campaign and fake accounts on Facebook.”Facebook, Inc. Price Facebook, Inc. Price | Facebook, Inc. QuoteLast month, Facebook revealed that it had identified Russian accounts spending nearly $100,000 in ads (over 3K), which coincided with the U.S. election (from June 2015 to May 2017). This caused a massive uproar and now the government machinery wants to impose stricter regulation on these social media companies.These ads were mostly targeted at divisions on grounds of politics and social norms and often touched upon sensitive topics like immigration and racial issues, gun rights as well as LGBT matters. Facebook added that about 10 million users have watched the Russia-backed ads.Facebook furnished extensive records on Russian ad spending during U.S. Presidential elections to special counsel, Robert Mueller and subsequently to the Congress.Sandberg’s interview is the first of its kind by a top level Facebook executive since the fiasco.Not just Facebook, even Twitter (TWTR  -  Free Report) and Google are also in the eye of the storm since the elections for dissemination of fake news that allegedly influenced elections. Twitter also revealed that it had found over 200 accounts related to Russian factors/bot network.These companies are battling extensive PR damage. Moreover, pressure from governments of various countries including France, Germany (which goes into election a few days from now) and Britain to curb the spread of fake ads/news and extremist activities on their platforms is mounting.The interview comes right before the House hearing where executives from Facebook, Twitter and Google are expected to testify, per media reports.Zacks Rank & Share Price MovementAt present, Facebook carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

174,AMAT,"Science Applications International Corp. (SAIC  -  Free Report) recently announced that it has been awarded a deal by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA).The contract entrusts the company with the responsibility of developing web applications and providing maintenance services to the Farm Service Agency (FSA). This end-to-end support service will be per the FSA-administered conservation-related programs that include Conservation Reserve Program.This award has a base performance period of one year and four one-year options. Pertaining to the fact that all the options are exercised, the contract has a valuation of $43 million. The primary performance is to be based out of Kansas City, MO.Per the terms of the contract, SAIC will provide the requisite operations related to Application Assessment and Authorization and Disaster Recovery services for the conservation programs supported by USDA FSA, which include preservation of wildlife habitat, reduction of soil erosion and protection of drinking water.SAIC’s Bottom Line DisappointsSAIC stock has gained 2% year to date, underperforming the 40.7% rally of the industry it belongs to.We note that though SAIC has won quite a few federal contracts, the low-margin deals have adversely impacted the profitability of the company. This has been reflected in investor confidence to an extent as evident from its share price performance.Its continuous support to federal civilian agencies and re-competed supply chain management contracts are the primary reasons for the EBITDA margin contraction of 130 basis points (bps) on a year-over-year basis to 6.5% in fiscal second-quarter 2018. Adjusted operating income margin contracted 120 bps to 5.5% in the same period.SCIENCE APPLICATIONS INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION Revenue (TTM) SCIENCE APPLICATIONS INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION Revenue (TTM) | SCIENCE APPLICATIONS INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION QuoteRecent Contract Wins and PartnershipsNevertheless, we believe the frequent contract wins will be beneficial for the company’s top line going forward.Some its latest deals include the $250 million blanket purchase agreement with the USDA for providing enterprise level security support and architecture services. Prior to that, SAIC received a $165 million information technology (IT) contract from the Commonwealth of Virginia to serve as a multisourcing service integrator (MSI).Notably, the company’s recent partnership with ST Kinetics and CMI Defence for the development of prototypes of combat vehicles to compete for an Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) contract is another positive.

178,AMAT,"The buzz surrounding Apple Inc’s (AAPL  -  Free Report) iPhone 8 is growing louder as we approach its big event to be held on Sep 12, 2017.Apple is expected to unveil the latest iPhone to mark its tenth anniversary. It will be a huge leap in terms of innovation with features likea glass body, a dual curved edge-to-edge OLED (organic light-emitting diode) display with wireless charging (USB-C) and higher storage options. The camera is likely to be far better than its predecessors.OLED display is being increasingly adopted as it comes with improved brightness, contrast and efficiency compared with LCD or Plasma displays. Television sets have long been equipped with OLED displays. Smartphones are also catching up fast.Per reports, the company has ordered nearly 100 million OLED screens from Samsung Electronics. Apple Inc. Price Apple Inc. Price | Apple Inc. QuoteThere are humongous expectations from the iPhone 8 cycle. However, it is the price point that is seen as a potential threat to iPhone 8’s sales. Reportedly, iPhone 8 could be priced more than $1,000 dollars.  Many analysts observe that consumers may not be willing to spend that much amount on a phone whose features aren’t exactly exclusive. For instance, Samsung phones have OLED display and wireless charging options.However, an analyst with Barclays observed that providing freebies with iPhone 8 could make the $1000 tag more reasonable. Per a survey conducted, Barclays’ analyst points out that if the average selling price (ASP) drops to $800 from $1000, users’ buying intention will double from 18% to 36%.Survey shows that if Apple could include a one-year free subscription to Apple Music and iCloud storage, which otherwise costs about $156, iPhone 8 sales may increase to 64 million in 2018. Currently, without the freebies, the sales figure is lower by 24 million.However, another analyst has observed that though the idea of providing freebies isn’t crazy but with Apple, it might simply not be possible.He argues that demand for a new iPhone has always been “off the charts”. A redesigned iPhone 8 will simply do not have dearth of buyers.More importantly, giving out freebies is just not Apple’s business model. It thrives on selling “premium products at premium prices”. Therefore, Apple bundling services to boost iPhone 8 is just not possible, adds the analyst.The debate over the exorbitant price has been raging on for some time now. iPhone 7 and 7 Plus editions with 256GB storage carry price tags of $849 and $969, respectively. So a price tag north of $1000 should not be considered unreasonable for a fully redesigned OLED iPhone 8.iPhone (4GB model) was priced at $499 way back in 2007, which was unheard of back then. Yet, Apple scored a home run with the device. The power of Apple’s fan base cannot be undermined.Zacks Rank and Share Price MovementAt present, Apple carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Notably, the company has outperformed the industry in the past one year.

179,AMAT,"Lam Research (LRCX  -  Free Report) shares have traded at a higher valuation than the S&P 500 and also the industry to which it belongs. But in 2016, the shares started widening this lead, a trend that has continued through 2017.  The company’s technological prowess is a given, which can generate solid growth. But given the sharp rise in prices (evident in the charts above), it makes sense to see if the shares are overvalued.   One thing to keep in mind in this respect is the general valuation of shares. The charts below illustrate that both the S&P 500 and the industry are trading close to their respective 52-week highs. So LRCX trading in the same range isn’t an anomaly.  P/EThe forward 12 months price-to-earnings ratio for LRCX is currently 13.04 compared to the S&P 500 average of 18.24 and the X industry average of 16.91. Highs and lows are also lower. The median P/E is also lower at 13.73. Moreover, the trend lines indicate that LRCX is clearly undervalued both with respect to the S&P 500 and the industry.  P/SThe trailing 12 months price to sales ratio tells a slightly different story. The P/S ratio for LRCX is currently 3.86, which is higher than the S&P 500’s 3.15 but much lower than the X industry’s 6.25. The median of 3.34 is slightly ahead of the S&P 500’s 3.04 but well below the industry’s 5.78. The highs and lows also indicate that LRCX is overvalued with respect to the S&P 500 but undervalued with respect to the industry.  How About Its Peers?Lam Research’s closest competitor is Applied Materials (AMAT  -  Free Report) so let’s consider that first. Historically, AMAT has traded well below its 52-week high, but the current level of demand has changed that. So it is also trading at around its 52-week high. AMAT’s current P/E is lower than LRCX but the median is same. Both the high of 16.50 and the low of 12.37 exceed Lam’s. This indicates a similar valuation for the two peers.   LRCX also compares favorably with ASML Holding NV (ASML  -  Free Report), another semiconductor equipment maker. ASML, which is also trading very close to its 52-week high, has a current P/E of 26.68 and median P/E of 26.63, both of which are significantly higher than LRCX. The price to sales ratio tells a similar tale.   ConclusionFrom the above, we can conclude that Lam Research, which carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) is undervalued. You can see the the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. Applied Materials also has a Zacks Rank #1 while ASML is ranked #2 (Buy).More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone! It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

181,AMAT,"Apple Inc (AAPL  -  Free Report) has sent out invitations to the media for a big event to be held on Sep 12, 2017 at the Steve Jobs Theater at its new headquarters located at Cupertino, CA, per reports.Apple usually holds a big event in September to reveal its latest offerings, which start retailing a week after the event.However, for a long time now, there has been tremendous buzz about this year’s event as Apple is expected to unveil the tenth anniversary iPhone edition along with Phone 7S and iPhone 7S Plus, which are updates to its iPhone 7 and 7 Plus editions unveiled last year.Apple Inc. Price Apple Inc. Price | Apple Inc. QuoteNicknamed as iPhone 8, Apple’s mega edition phone has caught the fancy of one and all. Apple is likely to make a big innovation leap with iPhone 8. It is rumored to have features like a glass body, a dual curved edge-to-edge OLED (organic light-emitting diode) display with wireless charging (USB-C) and higher storage options. The camera is likely to be far better than its predecessors.Reportedly, iPhone 8 will be the first of its kind to support OLED display. Per reports, the company has ordered nearly 100 million OLED screens from Samsung Electronics. OLED display is being increasingly adopted as it comes with improved brightness, contrast and efficiency compared with LCD or Plasma displays. Television sets have long been equipped with OLED displays. Smartphones are also catching up fast.Expectations regarding the upcoming iPhone 8 are humongous. The revolutionary iPhone, first released in June 2007 had changed the world forever. The iPhone was the first phone to have a touch screen and was a ""breakthrough internet device"".Upon release, the phone received terrific response. Following that, the success of iPhone over the last decade is well chronicled. Apple has sold over a billion iPhones across the globe. However, over the past few quarters, Apple’s iPhone sales have been marred by increasing competition from cheaper handsets like Oppo and Vivo.With iPhone 8, Apple’s fortunes in China are expected to get a boost. A survey conducted by Maxim Group in May indicated ""significant pent-up demand"" for iPhone 8 in China.

183,AMAT,"Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report) is facing an antitrust complaint in China. Per Reuters, local developers have accused the iPhone maker of charging exorbitant fees and removing apps from its local store without proper clarification. The complaint is now being reviewed by China’s State Administration for Industry and Commerce (SAIC).Like many other U.S.-based companies, China has been a tough nut to crack for Apple as well. The country is the second largest iPhone market. However, strict regulations have often played havoc with its operations.Per New York Times, last year, the State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television “asserted its authority” and shut down Apple’s iTunes Movies and iBooks services after being in operations for not even seven months.Moreover, competition from local players such as Huawei and Oppo is also hindering growth prospects. Additionally, in a bid to promote domestic manufacturers, the Chinese government has created an increasingly challenging regulatory environment for foreign companies to operate.Notably, in the last reported quarter, Apple revenues declined around 10% year over year in the Greater China region to $8 billion. The regulatory issues faced by the company in the region can aggravate the problem further.Apple Inc. Revenue (TTM) Apple Inc. Revenue (TTM) | Apple Inc. QuoteHowever, the company remains optimistic about the long-term growth prospects of the region, especially given the hype surrounding iPhone 8, which is rumored to be launched in Sep 2017. A survey conducted by Maxim Group in May indicates a ""significant pent-up demand"" for iPhone 8 in China. Per Maxim Group, iPhone sales in China will increase 170% year over year to 80.7 million units in fiscal 2018.Notably, shares of Apple have gained 40.7% year to date, slightly outperforming the industry’s 39.9% rally.Notable Moves In ChinaApple has stepped up investment in the country to woo the government in a bid to protect its business interests. The company's optimism regarding the region is further evident from its recent appointment of Isabel Ge Mahe to the newly created post of vice president and managing director of Greater China to “provide leadership and coordination across Apple’s China-based team.”Recently, the company collaborated with local internet services companies to establish its first data center in China that will ensure compliance with the country's newly implemented cyber-security regulations.New York Times reported last month that Apple had taken off virtual private networks (VPN) applications from its China App Store that were used to breach the Great Firewall. Last year, the company had even removed a news app by New York Times following a request by the Chinese government. Such moves from Apple definitely show its cooperation with the Chinese government with respect to Internet censorship.Earlier last year, the company had invested $1 billion in the ride-hailing company, Didi Chuxing (DIDI). Moreover, in March, it announced plans to build two R&D centers in Shanghai and Suzhou, Jiangsu province. It established two R&D centers in Beijing and Shenzhen last year.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderApple has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector include Applied Materials (AMAT  -  Free Report), Activision Blizzard (ATVI  -  Free Report) and Applied Optoelectronics (AAOI  -  Free Report), all sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

184,AMAT,"Liquidity primarily indicates a company’s capability to meet debt obligations by converting assets into liquid cash and equivalents. These stocks have always been in demand due to their potential to provide maximum returns.However, one should exercise caution before investing in such stocks. While a high liquidity level may imply that the company is meeting its obligations at a faster rate compared to peers, it may also indicate that the company is failing to use its assets efficiently.Hence, one may consider the efficiency level of a company in addition to its liquidity to identify potential winners.Measures to Identify Liquid StocksLiquidity ratios like Current Ratio, Quick Ratio and Cash Ratio are primarily used to identify companies with strong liquidity.Current Ratio: It measures current assets relative to current liabilities. This ratio is used for measuring a company’s potential to meet both short- and long-term debt obligations. Thus, a current ratio – also known as working capital ratio – below 1 indicates that the company has more liabilities than assets. However, a high current ratio does not always indicate that the company is in good financial shape. It may also mean that the company has failed to utilize its assets significantly. Hence, a range of 1 to 3 is considered ideal.Quick Ratio: Unlike current ratio, quick ratio – also called “acid-test ratio"" or ""quick assets ratio"" – indicates a company’s ability to pay short-term obligations. It considers inventory excluding current assets relative to current liabilities. Like the current ratio, a quick ratio of greater than 1 is desirable.Cash Ratio: This is the most conservative ratio among the three, as it takes into account only cash and cash equivalents, and invested funds relative to current liabilities. It measures a company’s ability to pay its current debt obligations using the most liquid of assets. Though a cash ratio higher than 1 may point to sound financials, a high number may indicate inefficiency in using the cash.So, a ratio of greater than 1 is desirable at all times but may not always underline a company’s financial health.Screening ParametersIn order to pick the best of the lot, we have added asset utilization, which is a widely used measure of a company’s efficiency, as one of the screening criteria. Asset utilization is a ratio of total sales over the past 12 months to the last four-quarter average of total assets. Though this ratio varies across industries, companies with a ratio higher than their respective industries can be considered efficient.In order to ensure that these liquid and efficient stocks have solid growth potential, we have added our proprietary Growth Style Score to the screen.Current Ratio, Quick Ratio and Cash Ratio between 1 and 3 (While liquidity ratios of greater than 1 are desirable, significantly high ratios may indicate inefficiency.)Asset utilization greater than industry average (Higher asset utilization than the industry average indicates a company’s efficiency.)Zacks Rank equal to #1 (Only Strong Buy-rated stocks can get through.

190,AMAT,"Share price of Seagate Technology PLC (STX  -  Free Report) dropped to a new 52-week low of $30.60 yesterday, eventually closing a tad bit higher at $31.01.The underperformance can be attributed to the company’s disappointing fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results. Non-GAAP earnings plunged 41% on a sequential basis, primarily due to a 10% decline in revenues. Revenues amounted to $2.41 billion, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.55 billion.We note that this pulled down current year earnings estimates over the last 30 days. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2018 declined 18.04% to $3.86 over the last 30 days. For fiscal 2019, the consensus estimate declined 11.9% to $4.07.Seagate has lost 16.4% of its value year to date against 11.6% growth of its industry.What’s Dragging it Down?The decline in the top line was primarily due to sluggish revenues from enterprise storage customers. This includes traditional OEM nearline and mission critical demand, China CSP nearline demand, and the company’s own Cloud Storage Systems business.Moreover, certain intra quarter channel inventory management issues affected the surveillance and NAS markets. Revenues fell 5% short from expectations and management attributed this to the above mentioned factors.Seagate Technology PLC Revenue (TTM) Seagate Technology PLC Revenue (TTM) | Seagate Technology PLC QuoteAdditionally, due to operational issues in the Cloud Systems and Silicon Group (CSSG) division and unfavorable enterprise and surveillance HDD portfolio mix, margins were under pressure. Management also noted that the company is not heading toward achieving the previous guidance of non-GAAP earnings per share of $4.50 for 2017.We believe, all these coupled with intensifying competition in the market post the merger of Western Digital (WDC  -  Free Report) and SanDisk are headwinds for the company. Further, declining demand in the PC market as evident from Gartner and IDC’s recently released worldwide PC shipments data is a major concern for Seagate.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderSeagate has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Applied Materials, Inc.

192,AMAT,"Earlier this month, 3D Systems Corporation (DDD  -  Free Report) reported second-quarter fiscal 2017 results with another huge earnings miss – its second after the last quarter’s staggering miss. The company continues to grapple with the headwinds that have marred its performance over one and a half years. We anticipate that rise in operating expenses, among other factors, will continue to thwart growth in the short run. In light of weaker-than-expected results, management trimmed the full-year 2017 guidance.Mirroring these headwinds, the stock has had a dismal performance on the bourse.  Over three months, 3D Systems has lost 44.5% in stark contrast to the industry’s average gain of 1.9%. Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 earnings has moved south over a couple of months, from 52 cents to 45 cents, on the back of five downward estimate revisions versus none higher.Read on to find the major factors curbing the Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) company’s growth and why it may be prudent to avoid the stock at the moment.Factors at PlayConcurrent with the second-quarter 2017 earnings release, 3D Systemsreduced its guidance for 2017. 3D Systems now anticipates revenues in the range of $643–$671 million (earlier projection: $643–$684 million), reflecting year-over-year growth of 2-6%. Management also reduced the guidance for non-GAAP earnings to around 46 cents per share from the previous estimate of 51-55 cents.Over the past few quarters, the company has been experiencing unfavourablebroader market conditions that have badly hit its financial performance. Macroeconomic factors such as economic slowdown, inflation, currency fluctuations, commodity prices and credit availability have negatively impacted the company’s performance.Lower revenues from professional printers have been a pressing concern for the company in the recent past. In the last reported quarter, the company’s Printer revenues were down 14% to $28 million, while on-demand manufacturing decreased 5% to $26 million. The decline was primarily due to continued challenging market conditions that affected customers' capital investment cycles. Moreover, in the second quarter, gross margin contracted 30 basis points on a year-over-year basis to 50.6%.Moreover, 3D Systems continues to incur high research & development (R&D) and acquisition costs. Going forward, the company believes investment in IT and go-to-market initiatives will result in higher expenses, thus restricting near-term operating income growth. During the second quarter, the company’s operating expenses flared up 4% to $87.5 million, as R&D expense rose 17% year over year, mainly on account of a rise in focused investments in production application solutions, metals and materials. Such costs will continue to take a toll on the company’s financial health in the near term.The company operates in a highly competitive industry with its chief competitors being firms that manufacture or use machines to make models, prototypes and small-volume to medium-volume manufacturing parts. A few of its competitors may have substantially greater financial, marketing, manufacturing, distribution and other resources. Intensifying competition for experienced and qualified personnel in the industry also adds to the company’s challenges.Stocks to Consider Some better-ranked stocks are Lam Research Corporation (LRCX  -  Free Report), Applied Materials, Inc. (AMAT  -  Free Report) and Arista Networks, Inc. (ANET  -  Free Report), each carrying Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

193,AMAT,"Agilent Technologies’ (A  -  Free Report) fiscal third-quarter 2017 earnings per share of 59 cents beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 7 cents. Earnings were up 20.4% year over year.Following the strong fiscal third-quarter results, share price has increased 4.16% in the after-hours trading. Also, the company’s shares have surged 35.5% year to date, outperforming the industry’s gain of 31.3%.During the quarter, the company closed the acquisition of U.K.-based Cobalt Light Systems, which might allow Agilent to strengthen its presence in the high-growth Raman spectroscopy market. The deal complements Agilent’s own product expansion efforts with a promise to help it offer better services to its pharmaceutical and biopharma customers.We also remain positive on Agilent’s broad-based portfolio and increased focus on segments with higher growth potential. Further, the company continues to introduce high-margin products.RevenuesAgilent’s fiscal third-quarter 2017 revenues of $1.11 billion inched up 1.1% sequentially and 6.7% year over year. Revenues were slightly above the management’s guided range of $1.06–$1.08 billion and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.08 billion.Revenue growth was supported by double-digit growth in Chemical & Energy business and strength in Pharma. China remained strong in the quarter. Also, better-than-expected growth in Europe contributed to the upside.Revenues by SegmentAgilent now has three reporting segments — Life Sciences & Applied Markets Group (LSAG), Agilent Cross Lab Group (ACG) and Diagnostics and Genomics Group (DGG). Its Electronic Measurement Group (EMG) segment was spun off as Keysight Technologies, an independent publicly traded company. Agilent also exited the Nuclear Magnetic Resonance business after failing to meet growth and profitability goals. The company divested or shut down underperforming units to streamline operations.In the reported quarter, LSAG was the largest contributor and accounted for $531 million or 47% of total revenue, reflecting an increase of 5% year over year. This was driven by strong performances in the chemical and energy, pharma and environmental markets.Revenues from ACG came in at $386 million or 35% of total revenue, reflecting a rise of 7% year over year. Both services and consumables witnessed growth across all geographical regions.Revenues from DGG came in at $197 million or remaining 18% of total revenue. The segment was up 9% year over year, driven by strength in pharma, diagnostic and clinical end-markets. All businesses under this group (Dako, Genomics and Nucleic Acid Solutions) performed well.MarginsThe pro forma gross margin for the quarter was 53.5%, down 22 basis points (bps) sequentially and 81 bps year over year.Operating expenses (research & development and selling, general & administrative expenses) in the quarter were $395 million, 0.3% lower than the year-ago quarter. As a result, operating margin was 18.0% versus 14.0% in the year-ago quarter.Net IncomeAgilent generated pro forma net income of $191 million (59 cents per share) compared with $160 million (49 cents) in the year-ago quarter. Our pro forma estimate excludes acquisition-related costs, restructuring charges, amortization of intangibles and other one-time items as well as tax adjustments.With these above-mentioned items included, GAAP net income was $175 million (54 cents per share) compared with $124 million (38 cents) in the year-ago quarter.Balance SheetExiting the fiscal third quarter, inventories were $566 million, up from $548 in the prior quarter. Agilent’s long-term debt was $1.80 billion at the end of the quarter. Cash and cash equivalents were $2.56 billion compared with $2.39 billion in the prior quarter.Net cash provided by operating activities was $228 million and capital expenditure, $43 million.In the reported quarter, the company paid $42 million in dividends. There was no share repurchase activity in the time frame.GuidanceAgilent provided guidance for fiscal fourth quarter.Agilent expects revenues between $1.15 billion and $1.17 billion, and non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of 60–62 cents for the fiscal fourth quarter. Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $1.14 billion and earnings of 59 cents per share.For fiscal 2017, Agilent increased its revenue and earnings expectations.The company now projects revenues in the range of $4.435-$4.455 billion versus the preceding guidance of $4.36–$4.38 billion. Also, non-GAAP earnings per share are now expected in the range of $2.29-$2.31 versus the previous guidance of $2.15–$2.21.Analysts polled by Zacks expect earnings of $2.22 per share and revenues to the tune of $4.39 billion.Agilent Technologies, Inc.

195,AMAT,"Applied Materials, Inc. (AMAT  -  Free Report) is set to report fiscal third-quarter 2017 results on Aug 17.  Last quarter, it posted a positive earnings surprise of 3.95%.The company’s surprise history has been pretty impressive. It beat estimates in each of the last four quarters at an average of 3.35%.Coming to share price movement, Applied Materials’ shares have returned 33.5% year to date, underperforming the industry’s gain of 34.3%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors at PlayApplied Materials reported strong fiscal second-quarter results, with both the top and the bottom lines coming ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Applied Materials has a solid product line and management has stepped up investments to prepare for the ongoing transition to larger wafer sizes and smaller process nodes. The ramp up in FinFET, 3D NAND and new display technology will likely be the catalysts.Moreover, the company remains strongly positioned in China where it continues to see strong growth in semiconductor orders. Growing investments from Chinese domestic manufacturers will continue to be the main catalysts.There is also scope for share gains on the Display side of the business. New display technologies like OLED are opening up new market opportunities for Applied Materials. The available market opportunity is now more than 10 times that of traditional LCD.Developing trends in mobility, connectivity, video and wearable devices are fueling growth in the industry. This, in turn, is expediting advancement in mobile processors, solid-state storage and interactive displays.The company has focused its structure and talent around key areas of value creation. It plans to align its product portfolio in a way that it generates the best returns for clients.All these factors will likely lead the company to report decent results in the upcoming quarter. However, increasing competition, high fixed-cost structure and customer concentration remain major concerns.Applied Materials, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Applied Materials, Inc.

196,AMAT,"The equity markets remained relatively skittish over the last few days as a range of geopolitical issues took center stage. These included constant conflict between the U.S. and North Korea regarding nuclear arsenal and prolonged standoff between China and India over sovereignty. As sublime tensions continue to raise an element of caution, investors are on the lookout for ‘cash cow’ stocks that will offer high returns.However, singling out cash-rich stocks alone does not make for a solid investment proposition unless they are backed by attractive efficiency ratios like return on equity (ROE). A high ROE ensures that the company is reinvesting its cash at a high rate of return.Why ROE?ROE = Net Income/Shareholders’ EquityROE helps investors distinguish between profit-generating companies from profit burners and is useful for determining the financial health of a company. In other words, this financial metric enables investors to identify stocks that diligently deploy cash for higher returns.Moreover, ROE is often used to compare the profitability of a company with other firms in the industry – the higher, the better. It measures how well a company is increasing its profits without investing new equity capital in the business and portrays management efficiency in rewarding shareholders with attractive risk-adjusted returns.Parameters Used for ScreeningIn order to shortlist stocks that are cash rich with high ROE, we have added Cash Flow greater than $1 billion and ROE greater than X-Industry as our primary screening parameters. In addition, we have taken a few other criteria into consideration to arrive at a winning strategy.Price/Cash Flow less than X-Industry: This metric measures how much investors pay for one dollar of free cash flow. A lower ratio indicates that investors need to pay less for a better cash flow generating stock.Return on Assets (ROA) greater than X-Industry: This metric determines how much profit a company earns for every dollar of asset, which includes cash, accounts receivable, property, equipment, inventory and furniture. The higher the ROA, the better it is for the company.5-Year EPS Historical Growth greater than X-Industry: This criterion indicates that continued earnings momentum has translated into solid cash strength.   Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Here are five of the 20 stocks that qualified the screen:Broadcom Limited (AVGO  -  Free Report): Broadcom is a premier designer, developer and global supplier of a broad range of semiconductor devices with a focus on complex digital and mixed signal complementary metal oxide semiconductor based devices and analog III-V based products.

199,AMAT,"Deere & Company (DE  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter fiscal 2018 results on May 18, before the market opens.In the last reported quarter, Deere posted earnings of $1.31 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by around 13%. Moreover, the company’s earnings surpassed estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, recording an average positive earnings surprise of 17.25%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Deere & Company Price and EPS Surprise  Deere & Company Price and EPS Surprise | Deere & Company Quote Key Factors to ConsiderFor the fiscal second quarter, Deere expects sales to be up 30-40% year over year. The forecast includes a positive foreign-currency translation impact of about 4%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter’s sales is pegged at $9.75 billion, reflecting year-over-year growth of 34%. This upbeat projection reflects Deere’s strong order activity.In addition, Deere stated that the Wirtgen acquisition will contribute about 16% to net sales for the quarter to be reported. Moreover, higher demand for large equipment and the positivity in agriculture-related government-sponsored finance programs supports the sales outlook for the fiscal second quarter.Our Consensus Estimates indicate that net sales of Deere’s Agriculture and Turf equipment segment will reach $6.73 billion in the fiscal second quarter, rising around 16% year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Construction & Forestry equipment sales is pegged at $2.58 billion for the quarter, reflecting year-over-year jump of 76%. The estimate for the Financial Services segment’s sales is $806 million, reflecting year-over-year increase of 13%.Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings per share is pegged at $3.33 for the fiscal second quarter, indicating remarkable year-over-year growth of 34%. Improved operational performance resulting from disciplined cost management, and continued investment in innovative technology and solutions will drive the company’s performance.However, China's response in retaliation to Trump's tariff plans by proposing duties on key U.S. imports, including soybeans, planes, cars, beef and chemicals remains a concern for Deere. The tit-for-tat retaliatory policies are feared to hit U.S. farm exports and in turn, escalate the troubles of farm-equipment makers like Deere. Further, elevated expenses will impact its results.Share Price PerformanceThe company’s price performance has been impressive over the past year. Its shares have rallied 28% in a year’s time, outperforming the industry’s gain of 24%. Currently, Deere carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Stocks Worth a LookHere are a few stocks worth considering as these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Analog Devices, Inc.

203,AMAT,"I last wrote about Lam Research (LRCX  -  Free Report) as Bull of the Day in late January after another terrific earnings report. But shares sold off after the beat-and-raise quarter on fears about demand for their wafer fabrication equipment (WFE) from big memory chip makers like Micron (MU  -  Free Report). Here's what I wrote back then... Always Looking for the Semi Cycle Top The negative market reaction in Lam shares immediately following earnings is a bit of a puzzle. Until, that is, you think about the traditional fear in this industry: Technology investors are still prone to seeing a very cyclical industry with brief periods of boom followed by busts.But this isn't the 1990s and we aren't talking about desktop computers driving demand.This is the age of mobile, datacenters, automotive innovations, robotics and automation, and artificial intelligence. These areas are not slowing down and should provide investors enough visibility that they might think twice and give my Technology Super Cycle thesis the benefit of the doubt.(The link above is to my special report for Zacks Confidential from December. Just scroll down to the 3rd report from 12/11/17)But one of the big fears for Lam is that memory chip supply will saturate demand in 2019. Since supplying equipment to make DRAM and 3D NAND flash is about two-thirds of Lam's business, investors are probably somewhat justified in wondering if this is ""as good as it gets"" and the big double-digit growth rates we are accustomed to will drop hard and fast in the next year.(end of my January 25 article excerpts)For these reasons, I was an eager buyer of Lam shares into the February correction, even scooping some under $163. And other smart investor joined me on the stock's March rally to new all-time highs above $220.But the volatility and doubt returned to the semiconductor industry and shares whipped back and forth across the $200 mark into and after the company's Q3 earnings report (FY18 ending in June).Another Big Beat and RaiseOn April 17, Lam Research reported Q3 EPS of $4.79, $0.43 better than the Zacks consensus estimate of $4.36, for a 10% beat. Revenue for the quarter came in at $2.89 billion, on shipments of $3.13 billion, versus the consensus estimate of $2.86 billion.The company gave solid guidance for Q4 with revenues in a range of $2.95-$3.25 billion, versus the consensus of $2.93 billion. They saw Q4 non-GAAP EPS of $4.80-$5.20 versus the consensus of $4.67.But there a fly in the ointment that caused investors once again to sell shares. This time it was concern about company guidance for lower shipments of $3 billion in the current June quarter, vs the record quarter they just delivered.Within two days, LRCX shares dropped back 10% from $210 pre-earnings to $190. But several investment banks and their analysts saw this as a typical overreaction.Evercore ISI analyst CJ Muse reiterated his Outperform rating and $300 price target, noting that beyond the beat and raise, gross margins came in at 46.8%, better than the consensus of 46.0%. And the June quarter GMs were guided to 47.5% at the midpoint, above consensus of 46.5%.Goldman Sachs analyst Toshiya Hari said to buy Lam Research on any weakness given his positive view on semiconductor industry capex, Lam's strong competitive position in Etch and Deposition equipment. Hari reiterated his $252 price target on shares.Stifel analyst Patrick Ho recommended investors use the post-earnings pullback in LRCX shares as an opportunity to buy. He acknowledged the shipment outlook and commentary that may have emboldened bears who think we are at the peak of the cycle, particularly on the memory front. However, he remains ""steadfast"" in the view that the market is not at or near an overcapacity situation and consequently raised his price target on the company to $295.Needham analyst Edwin Mok reiterated his Buy rating on Lam after the company after the company reported a solid F3Q18, provided June quarter guidance above consensus, but also offered disappointing shipment guidance that will likely pressure the stock.The analyst conceded ""While we underestimated the magnitude of a NAND moderation, we believe the overall fundamental picture for WFE and for LRCX specifically remains healthy. Despite the lowered CY2H18 shipments outlook, its solid momentum continues to support this narrative of out-performance. We expect the shares to see some near-term volatility, but see any pullback as long-term buying opportunity"". Mok reiterated his price target of $270.JPMorgan analyst Harlan Sur raised his price target on LRCX to $275 from $260 saying that despite investor fears of peak spending in the first half of this year, the stock's setup is favorable for continued robust spending into next year. He maintains his view that memory makers remain disciplined in adding capacity. The analyst continues to see ""significant upside"" from current levels in shares of Lam and keeps an Overweight rating on the name.At Deutsche Bank, analyst Sidney Ho raised his price target on LRCX to $260 from $250. He explained that the lack of an increase in full year WFE estimates and the forecast for its shipments to decline half-over-half in the second half likely disappointed higher buy-side expectations. The analyst believes, however, that the company's second half of 2018 has been de-risked. Ho reiterated his Buy rating on Lam Research.The Technology Super CycleEven the company CEO felt compelled to clarify what investors thought they heard on the conference call. Speaking later on CNBC, Lam Research CEO Martin Anstice said the company's guidance implies 'solid' year-over-year growth. Anstice said overall secular and cyclical demand trends are strong, which is ""getting lost in translation"" amid the ""ebbs and flows"" of short-term trends.In January, CEO Anstice said that ""semiconductor innovation is contributing increased value in a data-driven economy and we believe that trend is quite fundamental, exciting and sustainable."" This sounds exactly like the outlook of my December 11 special report for Zacks Confidential, The Technology Super Cycle, where I recommended LRCX shares under $185 and NVIDIA (NVDA  -  Free Report) under $195.Value in Chips? The recent 2018 Barron's Roundtable had as one of its stock-pickers Scott Black, founder of Delphi Management and an old-school value guy. Here's what he said about why you own the Lam...""It is a powerhouse in semiconductor capital equipment, and its products are used primarily in front-end wafer processing, which is becoming a $50 billion business. Lam has a 56%-57% market share in wafer etch, and about a 40% share in vapor deposition. It wants to gain another four percentage points in both through 2019."" Black also addressed Lam's cash position noting the company has $22 a share in net cash with over 70% (approximately $2.8 billion) trapped overseas. ""Exclude that and the stock sells for 11.6 times earnings. It is a giveaway. The average company sells for 19 times earnings, and LAM isn't an average company."" Black describes Lam as having the ""wind at its back"" across multiple industries experiencing strong demand, from memory and flash to the cloud and IoT. And he thinks these growth areas provide positive earnings visibility going out two years.Taiwan Semi Gives a ""Bad Apple"" Read-ThroughTwo days after Lam's report, Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) hosted its scheduled Q1 earnings conference call and gave 2Q revenue guidance significantly below consensus expectations. At the midpoint of the $7.9 billion guide, the company expects to come in 9% lower than the $8.7B consensus. The short-fall is driven by continued demand weakness from a ""very high-end smartphone"" customer -- and all signs point to Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report). TSM now expects 2018 revenue to grow +10% year-over-year in USD, down from its prior expectation of +10-15% y/y, driven by the continued weakness in mobile applications as well as uncertainty in cryptocurrency demand. This news not only impacted AAPL but also the whole Semi complex -- the SOX dropped 4.3% on 4/19 -- and, in particular, WFE players like LRCX and Applied Materials (AMAT  -  Free Report) who supply equipment to TSM.Rising Estimates and Price TargetsOther investment banks to raise their LRCX price target were...Credit Suisse: PT to $278B. Riley & Co: PT to $285KeyCorp: PT to $283But it's the magnitude and agreement of analyst EPS estimate revisions that make a stock like LRCX a Zacks #1 Rank, quarter after quarter.And after all the noise, analysts kept their word and raised earnings estimates in the past 2 weeks causing FY2018 EPS to move from $16.76 to $17.54, representing over 75% growth.Revenues are now projected for FY2018 to cross $11 billion, for 38% growth.The problem is that few are sticking their necks out very far on next year's profit haul, with the FY2019 consensus only rising from $16.50 to $17.50, for essentially flat annual growth. And this is probably what has investors most concerned.While the analysts wait for better visibility on the semi industry, say from the quarterly report of peer AMAT in a few weeks, I will continue to be the shares are undervalued given its solid double-digit growth in a still-strong technology cycle.Disclosure: I own shares of LRCX, MU, and NVDA for the Zacks TAZR Trader portfolio.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

205,AMAT,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd TSM hit the entire technology industry hard after the company reported Q1 results on Apr 19 before market open. The world’s biggest contract chipmaker, cut its full-year revenue target to the low end of its prior guidance of 10-15% thanks to “softer demand for smartphones and uncertainty in cryptocurrency mining market.”Management noted that ‘the China market started to pickup in smartphones, but TSMC’s smartphone segment, which is very high end, was softer.” The company’s revenue forecast target for the second quarter came in the range of $7.8 billion to $7.9 billion, falling shy of analysts’ expectation of $8.8 billion.Notably, TSMC is the world's largest semiconductor foundry company, which makes chips for tech biggies like Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) (renowned for smartphones) and Nvidia (NVDA  -  Free Report) (beneficiary of the cryptocurrency rally).TSMC mentioned that there were order cuts from the current Apple iPhone X processor. Management also indicated that continuous feeble demand from the high-end mobile sector may adversely impact the second-quarter 2018 results of Taiwan Semiconductor in spite of strength in cryptocurrency mining.JPMorgan Chase & Co. analyst Gokul Hariharan estimated that Taiwan Semiconductor’s Apple-oriented revenues may decline about 50%in the second quarter after a 30% decrease in the first quarter. TSMC shares plunged about 5.6% on Apr 19 and 1.5% on Apr 20 while Apple shares lost more than 2.8% and 4.1%, respectively.Other Evidence of Softening Smartphone DemandIMF said that the smartphone-driven tech cycle probably had topped in late 2015. And now saturation in demandin developed markets and lengthening of upgrade cycles are weighing on overall smartphone sales.On a year-over-year basis, Apple logged a decline (5%) in iPhone salesin the fourth quarter of 2017 and Samsung saw a unit decline of 3.6%.

206,AMAT,"Shares of several major semiconductor industry stocks were down in early morning trading Wednesday after the latest quarterly earnings reports from equipment suppliers ASML Holding (ASML  -  Free Report) and Lam Research (LRCX  -  Free Report) caused hesitation.Nevertheless, there were plenty of positives to take away from both of these reports. Lam Research surpassed estimates on the top and bottom lines, reporting total revenue growth of 34.2% on 19% higher shipments.Dutch equipment maker ASML also posted earnings and revenue beats. The firm also notched net sales growth of 35.7% and adjusted earnings growth of 12.3%. However, ASML said it expects gross profit margin to slip to about 43% in the second quarter from 48.7% in the first quarter.Lam Research investors might also be concerned about slumping margins. The company said non-GAAP gross margin for the March quarter was down about 80 basis points from the previous quarter to 46.8%, and it expects that figure to fall in the range of 46.5% to 48.5% for the current quarter.Lam also mentioned that it expects shipments to be between $2.85 billion and $3.15 billion in the quarter, which is slightly sluggish compared to the $3.13 billion in shipments witnessed during the March period.Overall, Lam Research guided for adjusted earnings in the range of $4.80 to $5.20 per share and revenue of $2.95 to $3.25 billion—both of which exceeded our previous consensus estimates.Still, both LRCX and ASML were met with volatility on Wednesday morning. Lam Research opened lower and quickly dipped to an intraday low of $196.50 per share, down about 7.5% from Tuesday’s close. ASML shares slumped as much as $9.70, or 4.6%, in early trading hours.Analysts were quick to declare Lam Research’s post-earnings selloff a buying opportunity, with teams from Evercore ISI, Stifel, and B. Riley FBR all maintaining bullish stances.“At or near $200, we are buyers all day long,” Evercore said in a note. “Put simply, the cost of adding each new memory bit is rising significantly across both DRAM and NAND, which should sustain elevated WFE for years to come.”Stifel elaborated further, saying Lam Research’s shipments outlook “could embolden bears who believe we are at the 'peak' of the cycle and in particular, on the memory front, where there are concerns on oversupply and overcapacity,” but reiterated its buy rating for the stock.But mixed reactions to the reports were enough to inspire selling throughout the semiconductor space early Wednesday morning. Shares of Micron (MU  -  Free Report) opened lower before surging back to Tuesday’s close, Texas Instruments (TXN  -  Free Report) was down as much as 1%, and Applied Materials (AMAT  -  Free Report) dipped nearly 5%.Overall, the iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF (SOXX  -  Free Report) slumped $25.77, or 1.9%, to a mid-morning low of $1331.95 per share. However, the fund bounced of this daily low around 10:30 am EST.Want more market analysis from this author?

207,AMAT,"Netflix’s (NFLX  -  Free Report) first-quarter 2018 earnings and revenues breezed past the Zacks Consensus Estimate.The results were driven by a solid increase in streaming revenues (recording highest growth in the company’s history) on the back of robust addition in paid subscribers and rise in subscription charges.The attractiveness of Netflix’s diverse content portfolio is evident from the fact that subscriber addition remained unaffected despite a hike in subscription prices.

208,AMAT,"Micron (MU  -  Free Report) delivered another exceptional quarter of record revenue and profits on March 22 and analysts responded with further boosts to their estimates for coming quarters.The upward EPS estimate revisions weren't especially dramatic in the past few weeks, with the current fiscal year (ending August) only rising 3.4% from $10.63 to $10.99.But that's because the analysts were already busy before the company's report moving the consensus from $10.13 to $10.63 on Micron's updated guidance for fiscal Q2 released on February 5.My colleague Tracey Ryniec, editor of the Zacks Value Investor where she's owned MU shares since March of 2017 at $29, wrote on Feb 9 about the company's update that offered promises for another terrific quarter. And here were the goods...Fiscal Q2 2018 HighlightsRevenues of $7.35 billion, up 58 percent compared with the same period last yearGAAP net income of $3.31 billion, or $2.67 per diluted shareNon-GAAP net income of $3.50 billion, or $2.82 per diluted shareOperating cash flow of $4.35 billion, compared with $1.77 billion for the same period last year ""Micron executed exceptionally well in the second quarter, delivering record results and strong free cash flow driven by broad-based demand for our memory and storage solutions. Our performance was accentuated by an ongoing shift to high-value solutions as we grew sales to our cloud, mobile and automotive customers and set new records for SSDs and graphics memory,"" said Micron President and CEO Sanjay Mehrotra. ""Secular technology trends are driving robust demand for memory and storage, and Micron is well-positioned to address these growing opportunities.""Extreme Value, Concerns About SupplyWhile the outlook for this fiscal year is no doubt fantastic -- that $10.99 EPS represents 121.6% growth while the top line comes in at $29.16 billion for a whopping 43.5% sales advance -- next fiscal year isn't as bright.Full-year 2019 EPS (starting in September) has risen 13.7% from $8.67 to $9.86 in the past 60 days. But that represents a decline of 10% year-over-year on the bottom line.What's the problem? It basically revolves around supply. Many experienced semiconductor analysts have seen this part of the cycle before where memory becomes abundant and prices drop.But currently, the story is just the opposite for Micron. They can't keep up with demand for DRAM and NAND flash products.The alternative bearish view is that customers will cancel orders that can't be filled.Either way, the analysts aren't willing to stick their necks out on next year's prospects, no matter how cheap the stock looks.Memory suppliers typically trade with value P/Es in the single digits and Micron is currently trading at just 5 times current estimates, even into next year.Memory Creates the FutureUntil analysts have a firmer grasp on the supply and demand outlook for next year, let's just focus on the business outlook according to the company.Micron is an industry leader in innovative memory and storage solutions. Backed by nearly 40 years of technology leadership, their memory and storage solutions enable disruptive trends, including artificial intelligence, machine learning, and autonomous vehicles in key market segments like cloud, data center, networking, and mobile.This description from the company website helps put their business into the context of the larger technology world...The world is moving to a new economic model, where data is driving value creation in ways we had not imagined just a few years ago. Data is today’s new business currency, and memory and storage are emerging as strategic differentiators that will redefine how we extract value from data to learn, explore, communicate and experience.You may have noticed that this Technology/Semiconductor cycle seems longer and more robust than those before mobile, before the cloud, before the ramp in automation and AI.In November I did a subscriber-only video presentation for Zacks Ultimate members where I debated our Director of Research Sheraz Mian on the merits of the idea that ""This Time is Different."" I argued in the affirmative and called the current rally a function of The Technology Super Cycle. That link will take you to my December Zacks Confidential, a full written report on the phenomenon.My top two Semiconductor recommendations at the time were NVIDIA (NVDA  -  Free Report) and Lam Research (LRCX  -  Free Report) to capitalize on the former's leadership of burgeoning AI industries and the latter's command of the ""picks and shovels"" to create silicon gold with high-tech wafer fabrication equipment (WFE), along with peer Applied Materials (AMAT  -  Free Report).So in late December, I was excited to hear Micron CEO Sanjay Mehrotra talk about similar themes. Here's what I wrote to my TAZR Trader members on December 20...I happened to catch the CEO of MU on Squawk Alley this morning, interviewed by the excellent Jon Fortt, and it was a clinic in not only the specifics of DRAM and NAND flash semis but also a wider commentary on my Tech Super Cycle. Here's the video link that you should watch if you consider yourself any kind of Semi investor... ""We have barely seen the tip of the iceberg in Artificial Intelligence.""As long as Mehrotra and Co. keep executing at the heart of Technology and delivering superior growth, I'll keep listening to them.Disclosure: I own shares of MU, NVDA, and AMAT for the Zacks TAZR Trader portfolio.Breaking News: Cryptocurrencies Now Bigger than VisaThe total market cap of all cryptos recently surpassed $700 billion – more than a 3,800% increase in the previous 12 months.

210,AMAT,"Atlassian Corporation Plc (TEAM  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter fiscal 2018 earnings on Apr 19. The question lingering on investors’ minds is if this company, engaged in designing, developing, licensing and maintenance of software, and provisioning of software hosting services, is capable of delivering a positive surprise or not.Notably, the stock outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 21.87%. Last quarter, the company came up with a positive earnings surprise of 8.3%.What the Zacks Model SaysAccording to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive Earnings ESP. Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) are best avoided.Atlassian has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. This indicates that the company is unlikely to beat estimates. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third quarter is pegged at 8 cents per share, flat on a year-over-year basis. Revenues are estimated to be around $218.24 million, indicating a 36.5% increase on a year-over-year basis.Atlassian Corporation PLC Price and EPS Surprise Atlassian Corporation PLC Price and EPS Surprise | Atlassian Corporation PLC QuoteFactors Driving ResultsThe company’s continuous client wins on the back of a diverse product portfolio is a positive. Notably, its client base reached 89,000 by the end of fiscal 2017.

Trello assisted Atlassian in dealing with clients across business teams in legal, human resource, finance, marketing and sales. The client base also increased by 13,000 paid customers on a net basis.However, surging expenses continue to be a drag on its margins and the bottom line.

Moreover, revenues and earnings recorded year-over-year improvement.The company reported earnings per share of 26 cents for the quarter, which topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 25 cents and also came ahead of the year-ago bottom-line figure of 24 cents per share.Quarter DetailsRevenues increased 9.2% year over year to $2,805 million and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2,774 million. In terms of constant currency, revenues were up 6.4%.Top-line growth can be attributed to lucrative client wins and impressive traction of new high growth services and software business.

Notably, the company’s operating margin increased 40 basis points (bps) sequentially to 24.7% with forex as a tailwind. Additionally, “reduction in on-site mix and other expenses” was a positive. Nevertheless, the company’s announcement of compensation revision of around 85% of the workforce effective Apr 1, with a higher variable pay and incentives has offset the gains partly.However, management sounded positive about the lower attrition rate of the high performers that came down to 9.4% compared with 14.1% in the previous quarter.LiquidityAs of Mar 31, 2018, Infosys had cash and cash equivalents of $3,041 million compared with $3,226 million recorded in the previous quarter.Infosys Limited Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Infosys Limited Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Infosys Limited QuoteRecent AnnouncementsIn the quarter, the company successfully signed the Advance Pricing Agreement (“APA”) with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”).

212,AMAT,"Shares of Advanced Energy Industries Inc. (AEIS  -  Free Report) have gained almost 9.7% over the past two weeks. However, looking at a longer period, the stock has declined 1.6% year to date versus the Zacks Semiconductor Wafer Fabrication industry’s rally of 13%.  Can the stock keep the recent price momentum alive and catch up to the industry rally soon?There is actually no major fundamental headwind that could stop the stock from moving higher. In fact, the potential benefits from rising demand in the semiconductor end-market might help the stock gain traction.Moreover, Advanced Energy’s prudent capital deployment, which includes strategic buyouts and share repurchases ($70 million remaining under the current program as of Dec 31, 2017), should keep supporting its bottom-line. Advanced Energy Industries, Inc. Price and Consensus  Advanced Energy Industries, Inc. Price and Consensus | Advanced Energy Industries, Inc. Quote The only factor that could affect Advanced Energy’s growth profile is its customer concentration. Two large Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) — Applied Materials (AMAT  -  Free Report) and Lam Research (LRCX  -  Free Report) — accounted for 33.5% and 23.1% of 2017 sales, respectively.However, this is a risk to its business model and unlikely to have any bearing on the forces that could drive the stock higher in the near term. After all, these two customers don’t appear to have any tangible issues with Advanced Energy’s services so far.Positive Growth ProjectionsInterestingly, estimates for the company’s current quarter and current year earnings have moved higher over the past three months, depicting analysts’ optimism over its earnings growth.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its full-year 2018 earnings of $5.21 per share represents a year-over-year increase of 9.2%. For the next quarterly report, the company’s earnings is expected to grow 26.9% over the year-ago quarter to $1.32 per share.The earnings growth is expected to come on the back of solid sales. The consensus sales expectations for the first quarter and full year 2018 are $187.7 million and $741.8 million, representing year-over-year growth of 25.7% and 10.6%, respectively.        Continuing Semi-Demand to Drive Top LineAdvanced Energy is a leading supplier of power subsystems to the semiconductor end-market. Management now targets sales of $1 billion, which it expects to reach over the next three-years, driven by continuing organic growth as well as solid contributions from acquisitions ($150-$200 million over the same time frame).The demand for Advanced Energy’s solutions is being driven by increasing investments in complex 3D NAND devices, DRAM and logic. Notably, Semiconductor Capital Equipment sales (68.8% of total sales) surged 41.5% to $461.7 million in 2017. The company commenced shipping of its next generation solid-state match during the fourth quarter.Moreover, Advanced Energy’s top-line is expected to benefit from improving dollar content per stack, as NAND manufacturers focuses on adding more layers. The additional layers are also driving demand for the company’s power control modules. Also, continuing adoption of the company’s plasma-based processes is expected to drive segment growth.Non-Semi Business Grows on International Customer Win It is also encouraging to note that Advanced Energy’s non-semi business outperformed management expectations in 2017.Industrial Capital Equipment sales (17.4% of total sales) soared almost 39% year over year to $117 million. The acquisition of Excelsys (completed in July 2017) expanded the company’s product offerings in specialty power business and market share.Moreover, Global Support (13.8% of total sales) increased 26.3% to $92.4 million. The company’s strategy of offering engineered service products drove this growth.Increasing international customer base and new design win present significant growth opportunity for Advanced Energy’s non-semi business.

213,AMAT,"The United States and its allies have launched target missiles on Syria, dragging the benchmarks down in the final hours of trading on Apr 13. Such escalating tensions, however, shouldn’t dampen investors’ spirits for long.After all, mounting military tensions, historically, has had no effect on markets but on humans. In fact, markets in crisis have usually recovered quickly. Keeping this in mind, investing in solid growth stocks doesn’t seem to be a bad proposition.Syria Air StrikesWestern powers had carried out missile attacks at the heart of Syria’s chemical weapons facilities. The United States, France and Britain launched 105 cruise missiles on three chemical weapon facilities, including a development center in Damascus’ Barzeh region and two installations near Homs. The strike was carried out after Syrian President Bashar al-Assad had sanctioned a chemical weapon attack on civilians in Damascus.This retaliation was the biggest by any Western force against Assad and his superpower ally Russia. However, the Western countries did mention that the strikes were limited to Syria’s chemical weapon facilities and not aimed at Assad. Nevertheless, such targeted military strikes against the Syrian government have dented investors’ sentiment of late.Investors Shouldn’t PanicInvestors should not fear a missile strike on Syria as such attacks have limited impact on the stock market, especially over the long run. Jeffrey Kleintop, the chief global investment strategist at Charles Schwab & Co, said that immediately after a military strike, markets tend to lose around 0.3%, but there is nothing earth-shattering about it. Such movements happen during every normal trading session almost.In fact, post-crisis lows open up good buying opportunities, per an analysis conducted by Ned Davis Research. After major geopolitical crisis in the past century, they have found that the market rebound has been so solid that within six months it stands higher than where it was before the catastrophe.Ned Davis Research analyzed that the Dow Jones Industrial Average on average fell 3.2% after any crisis, yet by six months, the blue-chip index manages to recover from the lows. In fact, it scales higher in 12 months’ time. If the Sep 11, 2011 attack is to be considered, the index tanked 17.5% five trading sessions later. But, it bounced back in less than two months and was higher than where it had been on Sep 10.Trump has tweeted that attacks on Syria were “mission accomplished.” This also suggests that the President won’t be carrying out attacks that may raise risks of a broader conflict, involving Russia.Time for Traders to Cheer UpThe American Association of Individual Investors (AAII), in the meantime, showed that bearish sentiments in the market jumped 6.1 percentage points to 42.8%. The Syrian crisis and China’s trade surplus with the U.S. improving, thereby, adding fuel to the ongoing trade conflict added to the bearish sentiments.However, the AAII survey is always used as a contrarian indicator, boosting traders’ confidence when the readings get scary. And why not? As investor sentiments are now decidedly bearish, the market has neared a bottom, which means it has only one way to go, that’s upward.5 Top WinnersWith the markets expected to scale north after a crisis, investing in sound growth stocks seems judicious. We have, thus, selected five such stocks that flaunt a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and a Growth Style Score of A or B.

214,AMAT,"Agilent Technologies (A  -  Free Report)) is an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) of a broad portfolio of test and measurement products serving multiple end markets. The company’s portfolio and increased focus on segments with higher growth potential is a big positive. The company also enjoys a robust presence in the health care market.A few recent developments bode well for the company’s growth.One such development is the FDA’s approval for a cancer diagnostic, PD-L1 IHC 28-8 pharmDx. The test will be used in cases of urothelial carcinoma (“UC”) and squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (“SCCHN”).The PDL1 IHC 28-8 pharmDx test has already been approved for melanoma as well as non-squamous, non-small-cell lung cancer (“NSCLC”). It has now been approved for UC and SCCHN patients too. The test enables physicians in the United States to identify UC and SCCHN patients, who still have disease progression on or after platinum-based chemotherapy and are most likely to benefit from treatment with Opdivo.We are encouraged by the company’s efforts to develop new assays for cancer treatment.The new assay will help Agilent to cash in on the fast-growing health care cancer-diagnostics segment.Also, Agilent has an impressive record of returning cash to its shareholders through share buybacks and regular dividend payouts. In the fiscal third quarter, Agilent did not repurchase any share but paid out $42 million as dividends.Moreover, the recently acquired Cobalt Light Systems will allow Agilent to strengthen its presence in the high-growth Raman spectroscopy market. The deal complements Agilent’s own product expansion efforts, with a promise to offer better services to its pharmaceutical and biopharma customers.An OutperformerA look at the company’s price trend reveals that the stock has had an impressive run on the bourse year to date. Agilent has gained 46.2%, significantly outperforming the industry’s gain of 43.7%.Northward Estimate RevisionsFor the current fiscal year 2017, 10 estimates have moved north over the past 60 days against no southward revisions, reflecting analysts’ confidence in the company. Over the same period, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 4.5%.Strong Growth ProspectsThe company’s Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2017 earnings of $2.32 reflects year-over-year growth of 17.02%. Moreover, earnings are expected to register 11.83% growth in 2018. The stock has long-term expected earnings per share growth rate of 9.8%.Agilent Technologies, Inc. Price and Consensus  Agilent Technologies, Inc. Price and Consensus | Agilent Technologies, Inc. QuoteZacks Rank & Other Stocks to ConsiderCurrently, Agilent has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Other top-ranked in the broader technology sector are Applied Materials, Inc. (AMAT  -  Free Report), sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), and NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report) and ASML Holding N.V. (ASML  -  Free Report), holding a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

215,AMAT,"Micron Technology, Inc. (MU  -  Free Report), a semiconductor company, plans to offer an underwriting public offering of $1 billion common shares to enhance liquidity. The company’s shares rose 2.5% in yesterday’s trading session.Further, Micron anticipates the underwriters to be provided with a 30-day option to purchase up to additional $150 million common shares to cover any over-allotments. The offering is subject to customary closing conditions.Micron intends to use $476 million of the net proceeds from this offering for the repayment of 7.500% senior secured notes of $438 million in aggregate principal amount (due in 2023) and also pay related fees and expenses. Additionally, the remaining proceeds would be used for general business purposes and repayment of outstanding debts.The only underwriter for the offering is J.P. Morgan Securities LLC. Notably, shares of Micron have moved up 150.2% in the last one year, significantly outperforming the industry’s 41.5% rally.The enhanced capital deployment reflects Micron’s strong balance sheet as well as its confidence in long-term business prospects. During the fiscal 2017, the company generated operating cash flow of $8.153 billion.The company exited the fiscal fourth quarter with cash and short-term investments of $5.428 billion compared with $4.330 billion in the previous quarter. Based on this performance, Micron expects to spend more on research and development, capital expenditures and acquisitions, and at the same time devote more cash for stock repurchases.The only concern persisting is its liquidity, since Micron’s net cash position remains negative ($4.444 billion in the last reported quarter). Particularly so, since growth opportunities look limited in the near term, given the sluggish demand environment.In the stringent regulatory landscape, this offering is expected to further enhance the balance sheet as well as support future growth. Additionally, it will assist the company to bring down its cost of capital.Bottom LineIt is worth mentioning that the acquisition of Inotera in December 2016 will have some operational benefits, leading to efficient management of investment levels and cadence, followed by alignment with global manufacturing operations.Micron is positive about the product launches and growing demand, particularly that of SSD products. We also believe that any increase in prices will have a favorable impact on the company’s overall results. We anticipate these benefits to be a tailwind for the company, going forward.However, after acquiring SanDisk, Western Digital Corporation (WDC  -  Free Report) has become a key player in the NAND space, which could intensify competition in the industry.Currently, Micron sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Some other top-ranked stocks worth considering in the technology sector are NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report) and Applied Materials, Inc. (AMAT  -  Free Report), both flaunting a Zacks Rank #1.

218,AMAT,"Science Applications International Corp. (SAIC  -  Free Report) recently announced that it has partnered with ST Kinetics and CMI Defence for the development of prototypes of combat vehicles.The partnership will enable Science Applications to compete for an Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) contract that requires a lightweight, mobile and lethal combat vehicle. The company plans to develop the requisite vehicle combining ST Kinetics’ Next Generation Armored Fighting Vehicle (NGAFV) and CMI Defence’s Cockerill Series 3105 turret, which is currently in production.The vehicle will be in compliance with the specifications of the U.S. Army per the Mobile Protected Firepower (MPF) program. We believe that if Science Applications manages to win this contract, it will be another feather in its cap.The stock has gained 1.5% year to date, underperforming the 39.7% rally of the industry it belongs to. Recent Deal Wins Science Applications’ frequent contract wins is expected to benefit top-line going forward.In September, the company was awarded a $250 million blanket purchase agreement by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) for providing enterprise level security support and architecture services.Prior to that, Science Applications received a $165 million information technology (IT) contract from the Commonwealth of Virginia to serve as a multisourcing service integrator (MSI). In the last quarter (second-quarter fiscal 2018), the company won a contract worth $621 million (if all options are exercised) from the General Services Administration (GSA) Federal Systems Integration and Management Center (FEDSIM). Moreover, the GSA, on behalf of the Army Software Engineering Directorate (SED), awarded another contract worth $404 million (if all options are exercised).The company also won contracts from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) GSFC Omnibus Multidisciplinary Engineering Services, U.S. Navy - Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command (SPAWAR), NASA Joint Operations, and National Institute of Mental Health.SCIENCE APPLICATIONS INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION Revenue (TTM) SCIENCE APPLICATIONS INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION Revenue (TTM) | SCIENCE APPLICATIONS INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION QuoteLow-Margin Contracts Hurting ProfitabilityHowever, we note that these low-margin deals are negatively impacting the company’s bottom line.Adjusted EBITDA margin contracted 130 basis points (bps) on a year-over-year basis to 6.5% in the last reported quarter.  Adjusted operating income margin contracted 120 bps to 5.5% in the same period.These declines were primarily attributed to programs supporting federal civilian agencies, lower profitability on re-competed supply chain management contracts and higher severance and facility expense.Zacks Rank and Key Picks Science Applications currently has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).Better-ranked stocks in the broader technology space include Applied Materials, Inc.

219,AMAT,"Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL  -  Free Report) has received Federal Communications Commission’s (FCC) nod to fly giant balloons over Irma and Maria affected Puerto Rico to bring back wireless service in the island.According to FCC, on Friday, 83% of the island’s cell sites were conked out, only slightly down from 84.6% the day before.Per a Wired report, the tech giant has got approval for 30 balloons in Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands for up to six months.We observe that Alphabet has gained 25.4% year to date, outperforming the S&P 500’s rally of 13.7%.Project Loon at Rescue (Again)Project Loon is Alphabet’s Internet project that utilizes high-altitude balloons to offer affordable Internet access around the globe to people without any access. These balloons have the capability to travel approximately 12 miles above the Earth. Using software algorithms, Project Loon sets the destination of the balloons depending on the wind.Alphabet Inc. Revenue (TTM) Alphabet Inc. Revenue (TTM) | Alphabet Inc. QuoteSo, if all goes per plan, Project Loon is expected to help replace several out-of-service cell phone towers to provide voice and data services using frequencies of local carriers.Alphabet served Peru earlier this year with Loon providing emergency internet service following heavy flooding.Our TakeAlphabet is already mired in legal troubles practically across all continents. These have earned it a bad name on privacy concerns, anti-competitive concerns, patent infringements, tax theft and what have you.

220,AMAT,"Shares of Intuit Inc.’s (INTU  -  Free Report) have been on the rise following its splendid fourth-quarter 2017 results. The indicators of a stock’s bullish run include a rise in its share price and strong fundamentals.Rising Share PriceIntuithas been clocking solid returns on a year-over-year basis and has surged approximately 33.3%, outperforming the industry’s gain of 29.1%.Earnings DiscussionThe tax-preparation related software maker reported splendid fourth-quarter results, along with providing an overwhelming first-quarter and fiscal 2018 guidance. Intuit’s fourth-quarter results not only fared better than our estimates, but also marked a significant year-over-year improvement, primarily owing to better-than-expected growth in QuickBooks Online and ecosystem along with new and improved products.Other Driving FactorsWe are positive about Intuit’s growing SMB exposure and believe that its strategic acquisitions will boost the segment. Increased adoption of its cloud-based services and products is another positive.In a move to focus more on its core tax and accounting businesses, Intuit divested three businesses last year, namely Quicken, QuickBase and Demandforce. We believe that the company’s initiatives have provided it the much needed funds to invest in and focus more on the fast-growing online businesses. The company looks forward to add more recurring revenues within its Consumer Tax and Small Business segments, capitalizing on the ongoing shift toward digital solutions. Notably, the company’s cloud-based accounting software QuickBooks Online subscriber base surged 58% year over year in fiscal 2017 to 2.38 million. Intuit’s efforts to convert itself into a cloud-based tax and accounting solution provider are encouraging.According to a study by non-profit association CompTIA released in September 2016, over 90% of the companies surveyed utilized some form of cloud computing. Of these, only 6% have been using such solutions for five years. In contrast, 23% of the companies have been using such solutions for a period of less than a year. This indicates that the cloud market has huge growth potential. Furthermore, according to Gartner, Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) spending is estimated to increase at a four-year compound annual growth rate (CAGR) (2016–2020) of 37%. With its SaaS-based QuickBooks and Online Tax applications, we think that Intuit is well-poised to lead the market.Additionally, the long-term EPS growth rate is currently an impressive 14.6%, suggesting pretty good prospects for the long haul. The company also delivered positive earnings surprises in the trailing four quarters with an average beat of 32.5%.Bottom LineLooking at these catalysts, we believe that Intuit is one technology stock that deserves a place in investors’ portfolio. Consequently, investing in this stock can yield returns in the short term.Zacks Rank & Other Key PicksCurrently, Intuit carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Other top-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector include Applied Materials, Inc. (AMAT  -  Free Report) , NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report) and Micron Technology, Inc. (MU  -  Free Report). All the three stocks sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

Moreover, the company’s earnings are projected to be up 15.7% in the next three to five years.Why Should You Grab the Stock?MKS Instruments has a well-balanced technology portfolio and intends to boost its market share on the back of solid customer relationships. Semiconductor, electronic thin film, life & health sciences, research & defense, and process & industrial technologies are the major advanced and booming business domains of the company.  The company’s second-quarter 2017 earnings and revenues surpassed the year-ago tallies by 95.8% and 47.5% respectively. This upside stemmed from the robust semiconductor and other advanced markets’ sales. Premium technologies of MKS Instruments (such as the Green Idle Mode technology) and state-of-the-art products (like the EtherCAT pressure control product line) help solve complex end-user problems, in turn, strengthening the company’s customer relationships. The company believes these positives, as well as sturdy sales generated from the life sciences, general industrial and research end markets will likely drive its top- and bottom-line performance in the quarters ahead.Moreover, MKS Instruments intends to boost its financial fundamentals through strategic inorganic moves. For instance, the Newport Corporation acquisition (completed in April 2016) is driving the company’s top and bottom lines, by reinforcing its presence in the Life Sciences, Semiconductor, Research and Industrial markets. On the back of this buyout, the company anticipates generating $40 million cost synergies by the end of 2017.In addition, on Apr 3, 2017, MKS Instruments successfully divested its Data Analytics Solutions business to Sartorius Stedim Biotech. MKS Data Analytics Solutions offers a premium solution to end users, named Umetrics Suite. The company secured after-tax gain of $72 million cash from the spin-off process and intends to fund productive capital investment programs with the proceeds.MKS Instruments has also implemented a new financial strategy aimed at reducing interest expenses and deleveraging its balance sheet over the long term. Earlier this July, the company noted that it has successfully accomplished the third repricing of secured term loan and thereby trimmed the interest expense of its term loan by 50 basis points (from LIBOR plus 2.75% to LIBOR plus 2.25%). Notably, via two consecutive prepayments, MKS Instruments reduced its principle owing amount from $780 million to $523 million.The company projects to report earnings within $1.32-$1.56 per share and revenues within $450-$490 million in third-quarter 2017.Other Stocks to ConsiderOther top-ranked stocks in the same space are listed below:Applied Materials, Inc.

225,AMAT,"Reportedly, Snap Inc (SNAP  -  Free Report) CEO Evan Spiegel has said that the company has sold over 150,000 Snapchat Spectacles since the specs debuted almost a year back.Speaking at the Vanity Fair’s New Establishment Summit in California, Spiegel was quoted by media reports saying that the sales number exceeded internal expectations of 100,000. He also added that the specs underscored the company’s efforts to increase its presence in hardware products. Snap has always marketed itself as a camera company.Spiegel said, “Our view is that hardware is going to be an important vehicle for delivering our customer experience, maybe in a decade. But if we believe it's going to be important in a decade, we don't want to be starting a decade from now."" The company is already working on second generation specs that support augmented reality.Snap Inc. Price Snap Inc. Price | Snap Inc. QuotePer media reports, Snap recently restructured its hardware division with the layoff of a dozen employees and named Mark Randall chief of the hardware division. Ex-chief Steve Horowitz has been shifted to a different position at Snap.Spiegel’s hardware ambitions are well reflected in his bold move to compare Spectacles with Apple’s iPod. Snapchat Specs outsold 143,000 units of iPod sold in its first year, way back in 2002. iPod has been a revolutionary product that changed the music industry landscape and went on to sell 300 million units in its lifespan.Snap also said that the company collaborated with artist Jeff Koons to unveil an art platform that uses augmented reality (AR). The platform allows users to view art installations held at specific locations and provides them with proper directions.Per reports, Spiegel also said that he faltered at selling his long-term vision to investors and underscored the need of better communication with the investor community. He understood that the investor community was wary of Snap’s future because of stiffening competition but he said, “I think those are kind of normal fears for any start-up – and the really successful companies just grow through that. And that's why we've just tried to stay focused on the business this year and execute and deliver results.""The company has been facing severe competition from Facebook’s Instagram, which has 800 million users. Further, Instagram Stories, a copy of Snapchat’s feature of the same name, was recently reported to have crossed 250 million users, substantially outperforming Snapchat’s 173 million.Notably, shares of Snap have declined 40.7% since its listing date of Mar 2, 2017 against 8.3% growth of its industry.Recently, research firm eMarketer once again slashed the 2017 U.S. ad revenue estimates for Snap from $770 million to $642.5 million. The market research firm had earlier in March slashed the domestic ad revenue forecast from $805 million to $770 million.Currently, Snap has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

226,AMAT,"“Seller Flex” is reportedly Amazon.com, Inc.’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) new delivery service where the company itself will pick up packages from third-party merchant warehouses and deliver them to customers, a function currently handled by its long-time partners United Parcel Service (UPS  -  Free Report) and FedEx (FDX  -  Free Report).It sounds like a new service but the retail giant started testing it two years back in India and this year in West Coast states, per a Bloomberg report. A broader rollout is expected in 2018.We observe that Amazon shares have gained 30.8% year to date, underperforming the 51.3% rally of the industry it belongs to.The couriers could still be in use but Amazon will take the final decision regarding how a package is sent rather than leaving it up to the seller.So basically, the company is increasing its own control and reducing reliance on courier partners and third-party merchants in the process of delivering products.But Why?It appears that Amazon is seeking greater flexibility and tighter control over its inventory management and supply chain. This will help it reduce congestion of its own warehouses (by avoiding merchandise of outside sellers), make deliveries quicker and impress shoppers by better managing last mile deliveries and last-minute holiday orders.So, shoppers can expect more items qualifying for the two-day shipping program and far more growth for Amazon.Amazon.com, Inc. Revenue (TTM) Amazon.com, Inc. Revenue (TTM) | Amazon.com, Inc. QuoteShould its Courier Partners Hit the Panic Button?Well, we believe yes, supposing that they have read the company they have partnered with for so long. Amazon has never hesitated in doing what it believes could bring more customers under its umbrella and giving them reasons to stay. That’s part of its long-term plan and a huge cash balance and technological prowess back its implementation.While Amazon may not immediately do away with its courier partners, it is certainly reducing reliance on them and building alternatives/supplements by developing its own global logistics.And What’s Beyond That?Just as what Amazon did with its online retail platform and AWS that is offering the same platforms it built to handle its own business as a service.We all know that Amazon has been pushing its own logistics in recent years through investments in fulfillment centers, trucks and containers and its Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA) service has been doing well. It has also bought some planes and self-designed drones that are in the works.So, if on a fine day, Amazon starts offering its logistics to outside parties, it should not come as a surprise.Zacks Rank and a Better PickAmazon has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).A better pick from the broader technology space would be Applied Materials (AMAT  -  Free Report), sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

227,AMAT,"Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report) and Ohio State University recently collaborated to offer 10.5-inch, 256GB iPad Pro with Apple Pencil and Smart Keyboard tools to first-year undergraduate students starting next fall.The university also announced the creation of an iOS design laboratory at the Columbus campus. The design laboratory will be instrumental in developing coding skills of students.  The students will also get a chance to learn mobile application building in Swift programming language. Training for Swift coding is expected to begin in the spring semester.Per an Ohio State spokesman, Chris Davey, given the scale of the partnership, Apple will provide the iPads at a discounted rate to the university. Both sides are close to finalizing the deal. The university will spend more than $10 million funded through its “administrative efficiency program”, adds the report.Increasing iPad SalesIn the last reported quarter, Apple sold 11.4 million iPads up 15% year over year. Revenues of $5 billion were up 2% from the prior-year quarter. The results were mainly driven by a 32% year-over-year sales increase in the U.S. education market. Apart from the U.S., Japan, China, Germany and France also showed double-digit growth.Notably, shares of Apple have gained 34.2% year to date, slightly outperforming the industry’s 33.4% rally.The company believes that the new iPad Pro launched in June with its ProMotion technology is the most effective tool for teaching purposes. Moreover, the company’s app development training initiative in Swift programming language will enable students to enhance their coding skills and place them better in a highly competitive job market.The company reported in the last quarter that iPad and Swift Playgrounds have been adopted by more than 1.2 million students across all age groups.Apple Inc. Revenue (TTM) Apple Inc. Revenue (TTM) | Apple Inc. QuotePer market research company NPD, in June, Apple registered a 55% share of the U.S. table market, up from 46% in the year-ago period. Moreover, tablets that priced over $200 captured a whopping 89% share of the market. Customer satisfaction rate is also extremely high for all iPad models.iPad is also gaining traction among schools driven by the wide range of multimedia features of the education specific iOS applications.

228,AMAT,"At times, it is prudent to hold on to certain stocks that have enough potential but are weighed down by tough market conditions.Paychex Inc. (PAYX  -  Free Report) seems to be one such stock, which investors should hold on to if they are looking to reap long-term benefits. Though the stock is facing a few headwinds at the moment, these are transitory in nature. There is enough scope for this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company to rebound in the long run.Notably, the stock has returned 9.9% in the last three months, outperforming 7.3% growth recorded by the industry.Growth DriversThere were a plenty of reasons behind the company’s upsurge, which includes a better-than-expected first-quarter result and upbeat fiscal 2018 guidance.The company reported non-GAAP earnings per share of 62 cents, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a couple of cents and grew 11% year over year. The upside mainly stemmed from higher revenues and efficient cost management.Paychex reported total revenues (including interest on funds held for clients) of $816.8 million, up 4% year over year. Excluding interest on funds held for its clients, total services revenues (Payroll service and Human Resource Services) ascended 4% year over year to $803.1 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate was pegged at $816 million.Buoyed by splendid fiscal first-quarter results, the company raised revenue outlook. The company now anticipates total revenues to jump 6%, up from the previous estimate of 5%. This translates to revenues of $3.34 billion, which is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.31 billion.Human Resource Services revenues are now projected to grow in the range of 12-14%, up from 8-10% projected earlier.All other guidance provided during fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results remained unchanged. Non-GAAP earnings per share are estimated to be up in the range of 7-8%, which comes to $2.35-$2.38. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at $2.37.Going forward, Paychex’s investments in product development, technology and focus on building its sales force to support revenue growth boost optimism. We also believe the company’s expansion initiatives, such as joint ventures and acquisitions, are likely to support its long-term growth strategy.Product launches are likely to be the other growth drivers. Further, Paychex’s focus on small and mid-sized businesses looking for HR solutions could provide growth opportunities.Additionally, its continuous share buybacks bode well for investors. The company has an expected EPS growth rate of 7.8%. Notably, the stock has delivered positive earnings surprises in the trailing four quarters with an average beat of 2.2%.Risks PersistHowever, unfavorable interest rates and competition from Automatic Data Processing (ADP  -  Free Report) and Insperity (NSP  -  Free Report) remain key concerns.Our TakeWe expect the aforementioned factors to help the company sustain strong momentum and stay afloat amid difficult times.

229,AMAT,"Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report) has acquired Body Labs, a startup that develops AI, computer vision and body-modelling based 3D body shapes and motion for various industries.Though financial details are unavailable, TechCrunch has reported that the deal could be worth $50 million to $70 million.Let’s take a look at the potential usage options.Fashion: Body Lab’s SOMA Shape API enables prediction and measurement of 3D body shapes using a single image. So, this could be used by Amazon to develop custom apparel and better sizing recommendations.Amazon could enable shoppers to virtually try out clothes using their selfies to reduce returns. Notably, a recent prime exclusive service called Amazon Wardrobe allows customers to buy everything they like and return what doesn’t fit. Naturally, Amazon could run the service cheaper if it manages to shrink returns.We observe that Amazon shares have gained 27.6% year to date, underperforming the 49.3% rally of the industry it belongs to.  Amazon’s Echo Look device and Body Lab’s SOMA human-aware AI-based Mosh mobile app seems to be a good fit for each other. While Echo Look allows users to take photos and short videos as they try out different dresses and display them in their smartphones, Mosh can add 3D effects to a photo based on a person’s pose.So, by integrating Mosh with Echo Look, Amazon could encourage people to shoot more photos and videos and build on its own record of size and fits in the process. That makes sense given Amazon is increasingly pushing its private level fashion brands in recent years.Amazon.com, Inc. Net Income (TTM) Amazon.com, Inc. Net Income (TTM) | Amazon.com, Inc. QuoteGaming: As a retailer of gaming products, Amazon has been sprucing up its capabilities over the past few years. To this end, it has acquired companies like Twitch, Double Helix Games, CryEngine and most recently GameSparks.The company has launched a free, cross-platform 3D game engine called Lumberyard that developers can use to make games, leveraging the compute and storage capabilities of AWS and the Twitch fan base. It also offers a managed service to deploy and manage game servers for multiplayer games called Gamelift.Amazon has now the opportunity to useBody labs’ SOMA AI technology in these gaming endeavors. This in turn could boost AWS revenues by enabling it to host more gaming content. Body Lab’s technology could also be used to accelerate Amazon’s AR/VR endeavors, going forward.Suddenly Very Acquisitive So far this year, Amazon has already made the second-largest number of acquisitions since 1998 and we can easily expect more.Amazon is gradually choosing the buy option over build, which, along with the other positives, ensures revenue generation in the right way without wasting any time in building its own infrastructure.To Conclude Amazon’s global margins are likely to be under pressure at least for a few years given that it continues to invest aggressively in fulfillment centers, TV shows and movies, AWS, acquisitions, expansion in India and what not.Amazon has never hesitated to sacrifice margins to pursue its long-term objectives of bringing more customers under its umbrella and giving them reasons to stay. A huge cash balance and technological prowess boost the company’s remarkable risk-taking ability.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderAmazon has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).Better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector include Micron Technology, Inc.

Just a couple of days ago, ViaSat released disappointing earnings numbers for first-quarter of fiscal 2018. The company’s shares too have trended badly, having fallen 19.1% over the past one year, much worse than the industry’s average decline of 2.9%. Escalating research and development costs, and costs related to the ViaSat-2 service launch activities badly affected profits. However, fundamentals of the business look quite strong. New contract awards for the company (up 31.4% to $441.8 million) grew sharply in the fiscal first quarter, driving impressive backlog, and highlighting strong demand for both products and services.ViaSat’s Government Systems business has been outstanding, and has been gaining even greater momentum, which should reflect well on the quarters to come.The segment reported impressive revenue growth of 25.8% year over year in the fiscal first quarter, driven by an expanding service base and strong momentum in tactical datalink products, government mobility platforms and satellite communications solutions. Splendid growth in revenues drove record operating profit (up 82% year over year) and Adjusted EBITDA (up 51% year over year) for the quarter.In-flight connectivity is also sustaining robust growth momentum. ViaSat is already connecting nearly 3 million devices a month on its existing fleet of 568 aircraft. The Commercial Air business will likely prove to be a key profit driver in the quarters to come.ViaSat maintains a leading position in the satellite and wireless communications market. The company has garnered enough economics of scale and scope to serve vast emerging markets in South America, Africa, the Middle East and Western Asia. ViaSat-2 services are expected to begin in fourth-quarter fiscal 2018.ViaSat, Inc. Price and Consensus ViaSat, Inc. Price and Consensus | ViaSat, Inc. QuoteThe company successfully rolled out ViaSat-2 satellite in June. ViaSat-2, touted to have twice the bandwidth and seven times more broadband coverage, is a massive improvement over ViaSat-1.Some other features which make it more powerful than ViaSat-1 include high-capacity connectivity, smaller gateway antenna and twice as many gateways. ViaSat believes that these advanced smaller gateways can help it place the latest satellites in proximity of popular internet access points, delivering greater network reliability and security.Lately, ViaSat’s earnings have suffered quite a lot due to R&D expenses, but per the company, total R&D investments are set to peak this fiscal year. The primary drivers are the ViaSat-3 payload, pre-flight development and testing, and commercial in-flight connectivity, STCs and line-fit activity. This indicates that we can see more pressure on profits in the upcoming quarters. Also, the costs related to the ViaSat-2 service launch activities and preparations for the large-scale in-flight Wi-Fi ramp are expected to further burden the bottom line.Also, stiff competition in the industry proves to be a major growth deterrent for the company, particularly for its satellite services segment.

232,AMAT,"Earlier this month premium global eCommerce solutions provider, Pitney Bowes Inc. (PBI  -  Free Report), reported its second-quarter 2017 results, which came in below expectations. The company reverted to its dismal earnings miss trend after posting a solitary earnings beat last quarter. Further, investors were miffed as the company tweaked its full-year 2017 guidance.Year to date, the stock has lost 13.9%, in stark contrast to the industry’s average positive gain of 21.6%.Also, analysts are showing no favor toward the stock as the Zacks Consensus Estimate for full-year 2017 earnings has gone down from $1.75 to $1.72. Given its array of problems, we believe that Pitney Bowes investors are in for an even bumpier ride. Let’s take a deeper look at factors plaguing the company.Lingering Softness in Mailing BusinessProlonged weakness in the company’s North American mailing business is proving to be a significant drag on the top line. During the second quarter of 2017, Small and Medium Business (“SMB”) Solutions revenues dipped 3% year over year to $436.4 million. The tepid performance was due to softness in the North American Mailing business (down 1%) and International Mailing Business (down 11%).This segment continues to suffer from lower recurring revenue streams and rental revenues. Additionally, a waning recurring revenues trajectory and poor equipment sales are making matters worse. Uncertain global economic environment is expected to impact production mail and software businesses in the near term, thereby limiting the company’s growth momentum.Precipitous Decline in Software SalesThough Pitney Bowes adopted multiple measures to boost profits at the software segment, its taking much longer than expected for the results to show. In general, licensed software businesses are always susceptible to swings based on large transactions. Given the scale of Pitney Bowes’ business, it remains vulnerable to those swings.Currently, the company is focusing on driving growth by penetrating into new areas. However, this has put the margin performance under pressure in the short run.Escalating CostsPitney Bowes has been experiencing a surge in its operating expenses on account of ERP implementation in the U.S. and higher marketing expenses in relation to aggressive advertising and marketing strategies for strengthening brand value. The company expects marketing expenses to be up on a year-over-year basis.In addition, it expects incremental marketing expense in the ERP program, related to digital capabilities enhancement, for entire 2017. Also, capital expenses associated with the ERP project remain a drag. Til the benefits of ERP materialize, the Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company is expected to incur higher capital expenses that might exert pressure on margins.Stocks to ConsiderSome stocks in the broader sector include Applied Optoelectronics, Inc. (AAOI  -  Free Report), Red Hat, Inc. (RHT  -  Free Report) and Applied Materials, Inc. (AMAT  -  Free Report). While Applied Materials sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Red Hat and Applied Materials hold a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Applied Optoelectronics has a whopping average earnings surprise of 21.0% for the trailing four quarters, beating estimates all through.Red Hat, Inc. has a robust earnings surprise history, with an average positive surprise of 11.1%, driven by consecutive earnings beats over the trailing four quarters.With four back-to-back beats, Applied Materials has an average positive surprise of 3.5% for the trailing four quarters.One Simple Trading IdeaSince 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year.

234,AMAT,"ViaSat Inc.’s  first-quarter fiscal 2018 non-GAAP earnings came in at 4 cents, down drastically from the figure of 23 cents recorded in the year-ago quarter. Despite posting record first-quarter revenues, ViaSat’s profits were hurt by escalating research and development costs, and costs related to the ViaSat-2 service launch activities.On a GAAP basis, the company actually swung to a net loss of 16 cents per share, in stark contrast to earnings of 4 cents recorded in the year-ago period.Inside the HeadlinesThe company posted revenues of $380 million in the fiscal first quarter, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $387 million. However, revenues rose 4.7% compared to the prior-year quarter tally, and were at a record high for the fiscal first quarter. Terrific growth in government business drove top-line growth, which was somewhat offset by contraction in Commercial Networks revenues.New contract awards (up 31.4% to $441.8 million) grew sharply in the quarter, driving impressive backlog, and highlighting strong demand for both products and services.Segment wise, Satellite Services revenues were nearly flat (down 0.1% year over year) at $152.2 million. The segment witnessed strong revenue growth in commercial air, along with higher consumer broadband revenues. Particularly, growth of Average Revenue per User (ARPU) in ViaSat's residential broadband internet business grew 11% year over year.Commercial Networks revenues continued to be strained, plunging 31% on a year-over-year basis to $45.2 million, dragged bylower fixed terminal sales for Australia's nbn satellite broadband service.This segment continues to witness an increase in research and development investment (up 67% year over year) associated with internal development of the ViaSat-3 project and expansion of next-gen mobility solutions.On the other hand, Government Systems reported impressive revenues of $182.6 million, up 25.8% year over year, driven by an expanding service base and strong momentum in tactical datalink products, government mobility platforms and satellite communications solutions. Impressive growth in revenues drove record operating profit (up 82% year over year) and Adjusted EBITDA (up 51% year over year) for the quarter.During the quarter, sales backlog climbed 18.9% year over year to a record $1,085.8 million, driven largely by a robust backlog at Government Systems segment.However, adjusted EBIDTA plunged 23.7% from the comparable quarter last year to $61.2 million, dragged by start-up costs associated with the ViaSat-2 network, and planned rapid growth in in-flight connectivity based on installing existing backlog.ViaSat, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise ViaSat, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | ViaSat, Inc. QuoteQuarterly HighlightsThe company launched ViaSat-2 satellite in the quarter successfully. ViaSat-2, touted to have twice the bandwidth and seven times more broadband coverage, is a massive improvement over ViaSat-1.Some other features which make it more powerful than ViaSat-1 include high-capacity connectivity, smaller gateway antenna and twice as many gateways. ViaSat believes that these advanced smaller gateways can help it place the latest satellites in proximity of popular internet access points, delivering greater network reliability and security.ViaSat maintains a leading position in the satellite and wireless communications market. The company has garnered enough economics of scale and scope to serve vast emerging markets in South America, Africa, the Middle East and Western Asia. ViaSat-2 services are expected to begin in fourth-quarter fiscal 2018.The company has also been investing in the next generation of ViaSat-3 class satellites — which will provide even more bandwidth globally from satellites slated to launch starting in 2019.LiquidityViaSat exited the fiscal year with cash and cash equivalents of $160.6 million compared with $130.1 million as of Mar 31, 2017. The company also generated record levels of operating cash flow in the fiscal first quarter, which hit $153.7 million.To ConcludeViaSat posted mixed results for the quarter, but set multiple records. Strong backlog levels, robust prospects of core government business and significant demand for higher speeds of broadband connectivity in residential, in-flight, and government markets are likely to accelerate the company’s growth momentum. In addition, the just-launched ViaSat-2 satellite is likely to help the company fortify its foothold in new geographic markets.Despite these positives, escalating research and development costs remain a major concern for this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company in the near term. Further, the company’s satellite services segment is highly affected by seasonality of demand due to traditional retail selling periods.Despite such headwinds, increasing adoption of satellite networking, in-flight Wi-Fi services in commercial aircraft data links and encryption-product based businesses are expected to drive the company’s long-term growth. We also believe the collaboration with Eutelsat is a strategic fit for ViaSat to embark on a global expansion drive.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the broader sector include Lam Research Corporation (LRCX  -  Free Report), Advanced Energy Industries, Inc.

238,AMAT,"Nikon Corporation’s (NINOY  -  Free Report) first-quarter fiscal 2018 earnings declined significantly over the comparable quarter last fiscal, as the company generated a net profit of ¥8.9 billion ($80.7 million) compared with profit of¥14.7 billion last year. Earnings per share came in at¥22.37, down 39.7% year over year.Operating income too decreased 31.1% year over year to ¥12.4 billion ($65.1 million).Inside the HeadlinesIn the quarter, Nikon’s net sales inched up 0.6% year over year to ¥170.3 billion ($1.5 billion). The top line was positively impacted by increase in unit sales from FPD and Semiconductor lithography, which was somewhat offset by soft digital camera sales, change in product mix of new DSLRs and delayed budget execution by governments.Sales for the Precision Equipment Business climbed 6.6% year over year to ¥55.2 billion ($500.7 million).The unit enjoyed remarkable growth in the FPD Lithography System field, which benefited from the broad-based strength in capital investments. However, operating income at the segment fell to ¥13.1 billion compared to ¥14.8 billion in the prior-year quarter due to lower unit sales in the FPD Lithography System field.However, the Imaging Products Business witnessed a steady decline in both sales and profits, as the top line edged down 0.8% over first-quarter fiscal 2017 to ¥90.9 billion ($824.6 million). The unit saw a turnaround in the shrinking digital camera market, as the compact digital camera market improved year over year. Operating income at the segment also fell to ¥7.6 billion, down 24.8% from ¥10.1 billion in the year-ago period, due to adverse product mix.The Instruments Business displayed nearly flat growth, with the top line coming in at ¥13.5 billion ($122.5 million), up from sales of ¥13.4 billion recorded last quarter. The microscope-related field’s performance was weak due to delayed budget execution by the U.S. and China governments and other factors, and adverse foreign currency translation impact further hampered revenues. However, in the industrial metrology field, the company recorded improved sales in the U.S. and Asia. The segment recorded an operating loss of ¥2.4 billion compared with a loss of ¥1.2 billion in the prior fiscal quarter, due to higher upfront investments and expenses related to sales expansion initiatives.The new Medical Business posted sales of ¥4.7 billion ($42.6 million) in the quarter, up from ¥4.2 billion recorded in the year-ago period. Optos Plc's retinal diagnostic imaging equipment exhibited solid performance in North America, which drove revenues.This segment also recorded an operating loss of ¥1.1 billion, slightly wider than the ¥0.6-billion loss in the prior-year quarter, hurt by upfront investments.Lastly, the Other Businesses segment net sales grew 9.4% year over year at ¥5.8 billion ($52.6 million).Liquidity & Cash FlowAs of Jun 30, 2017, Nikon’s cash and cash equivalents were ¥309.2 billion ($2.8 billion), down from ¥319.1 billion recorded on Mar 31, 2017.Long-term liabilities (which include Bonds and Long-term loans) totaled ¥137.7 billion ($1.2 billion), marginally down from ¥138.3 billion a year ago.Nikon Corp. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Nikon Corp. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Nikon Corp. QuoteRestructuring PlanIn third-quarter fiscal 2017, Nikon unveiled a plan to undertake company-wide structural reform, as it seeks to enhance its operational profitability and create value.The restructuring will help Nikon shift from a strategy pursuing revenue growth to one pursuing profit improvement.The restructuring was prompted by the fact that Nikon has not been able to derive value from its existing businesses. The company’s Semiconductor Lithography Business Imaging Product business is still not profitable, while the Imaging Product Business has been grappling with a shrinking market and foreign exchange headwinds.In light of the above, Nikon planned to discontinue the current ""Medium-Term Management Plan Update."" Instead, it has initiated a company-wide restructuring to help shift to a strategy which pursues profit growth instead of revenue growth.The plan includes reassessment of the strategy of the Semiconductor Lithography and Imaging Product Businesses. Additionally, Nikon intends to optimize manufacturing, sales and R&D on a global basis and streamline & optimize its workforce. As part of the initiative, Nikon stated it will be declaring a voluntary retirement program for about 1,000 employees.Extraordinary losses due to the restructuring came to about ¥49.8 billion and were booked in the fiscal year ending Mar 31, 2017.GuidanceThe company sees a gradual recovery trend in its end markets as both the U.S. and Europe enjoy steady personal consumption, after much turmoil in the aftermath of the UK’s decision to exit from the EU, as well as the U.S. presidential election. Japan’s capital investment and personal consumption also seem to be on the road to recovery.Incorporating the present market scenario, Nikon reiterated its forecast for fiscal 2018. The company expects net sales to come at around ¥700 billion. Also, the guidance for operating profits is about ¥45 billion.Nikon anticipates strong capital investments in the semiconductor-related field, which will drive growth in the Precision Equipment Business. Sales in the Imaging Products Business are likely to be better than the earlier projections, led by an increase in unit sales of digital cameras and interchangeable lenses. The instruments businessis also contending with deferred government budget spending and restrained investments, which might mar sales.Our TakeNikon has been suffering in recent times as its chip-making equipment business has been underperforming, as it struggles with slowing demand and stiff competition with overseas rivals. Further, adverse foreign exchange impact and supply disruptions caused by the Kumamoto earthquakes in Apr 2016 further dented operations for this company.In order to drive growth, the Japanese precision instrument maker aims to downsize low-profitable operations and instead focus resources on medical equipment and other promising businesses.Nikon’s growth blueprint is based on four initiatives — a merger & acquisition program, research & development program, human resource program and cost-reduction program.Nikon is focusing on expansion in two new segments, namely Medical and Instruments business. Also, the company is undertaking a number of initiatives to stabilize the key financials of its core business areas – including Precision Equipment and Imaging Products. In addition, Nikon’s strategic acquisitions and investments to build its medical business is anticipated to help it reap significant benefits over the long run.Nikon currently flaunts a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Other Stocks to ConsiderOther top-ranked stocks include Lam Research Corporation (LRCX  -  Free Report), Applied Materials, Inc. (AMAT  -  Free Report) and Advanced Energy Industries, Inc. (AEIS  -  Free Report). While Lam Research sports a Zacks Rank #1, Applied Materials and KLA-Tencor carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

The company surpassed estimates thrice over the trailing four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 11.3%.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

239,AMAT,"In second-quarter 2017, Pitney Bowes (PBI  -  Free Report) reverted to its dismal earnings miss trend after posting a solitary earnings beat last quarter. The company’s adjusted earnings of 33 cents per share missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 36 cents. Also, on a year-over-year basis, adjusted earnings fell 15.4%.On a GAAP basis, the company reported earnings per share of 26 cents, down 7.1% compared with the year-ago figure. A rise in total costs, along with a drab revenue performance proved to be a drag on the earnings performance.Inside the HeadlinesTotal revenue in the quarter was $821.4 million, down 1.7% year over year on a reported basis. Revenues were flat, when adjusted for currency impact.Two of the company’s three segments, namely, Small and Medium Business (“SMB”) and Enterprise Business Solutions (“EBS”), declined year over year, proving a drag on the top-line performance.On a reported basis, Small and Medium Business (“SMB”) Solutions revenues dipped 3% year over year to $436.4 million. The tepid performance was due to softness in the North American Mailing business (down 1%) and International Mailing Business (down 11%). Lower recurring revenue streams and rental revenues led to the lackluster performance of the North American Mailing business. Additionally, decline in recurring revenues and poor equipment sales proved to be a drag on the International Mailing Business.Enterprise Business Solutions (“EBS”) revenues were down 4% year over year to $204.0 million. While Presort Services (up 2%) drove top-line growth of this segment, it was more than offset by the drab performance of the production mail business (down 11%). Lower sorter equipment sales and support service revenues weighed down on sales of the production mail business. Higher “Standard Class” mail volumes drove sales of this segment.Digital Commerce Solutions reported 4% year-over-year growth in sales to $180.9 million, supported by strong Global e-commerce business (up 14%), and slightly offset by decline of Software business (down 4%). Robust volumes in the UK outbound marketplace and growth in domestic shipping volumes acted as tailwinds for the Global e-commerce business. Lower license revenues played a spoilsport for Software solutions sales.Pitney Bowes Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Pitney Bowes Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Pitney Bowes Inc. QuoteLiquidity and Cash FlowAs of Jun 30, 2017, free cash flow was $18.4 million compared with $85.9 million as of Jun 30, 2016.As of Jun 30, 2017, the company’s cash and cash equivalents totaled $840.6 million compared with $764.5 million at the end of Dec 31, 2016. Long-term debt as of Mar 31, 2017, was $2,543.5 million, down from $2,750.4 million as of Dec 31, 2016.GuidanceThe company tweaked its guidance for full-year 2017. Currently, it expects 2017 adjusted earnings per share to lie in the range $1.70–$1.78 compared with the earlier guided range of $1.70–$1.85. Revenues, on a reported basis, are expected to see flat to 1% growth year over year compared with the previous guidance of 2% decline to 1% growth. Further, the company revised its free cash flow for 2017 to be in the range of $400-$430 million compared with the earlier range of $400–$460 million.On a positive note, Pitney Bowes believes that new products and digital capabilities of SMB, expansion of the Presort Services network and robust increase in e-commerce volume will act as major catalysts, raising the top line for full-year 2017. Moreover, the company’s focus on operational excellence will help it trim to costs and expenses, thus supplementing growth.Our TakePitney Bowes reported dismal second-quarter 2017 results, with both top- and bottom-line misses. The company’s restructuring actions were not sufficient to cushion it against the broader macroeconomic concerns, which have plagued its financials for quite some time now. Though the global ecommerce business continues to be a major profit churner, the prolonged softness in the SMB business remains a major concern.In addition, escalating marketing expenses in relation to the ERP implementation program is likely to act as an overhang. Also, the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company expects incremental marketing expense in the ERP program, related to digital capabilities enhancement for entire 2017. We believe capital expenses associated with the ERP project will continue to inflate costs, thus hindering growth.Stocks to ConsiderSome stocks in the broader sector include Applied Optoelectronics, Inc. (AAOI  -  Free Report), Red Hat, Inc. (RHT  -  Free Report) and Applied Materials, Inc. (AMAT  -  Free Report).

241,AMAT,"Investors always try to hit the jackpot while picking stocks. But striking the right chord each time is not easy unless you are blessed with Midas touch.When it comes to the investment market, experts consider value style as one of the most effective approaches. In value investing, investors pick stocks that are cheap but fundamentally sound. So, the chance of outperformance is high when the market moves higher.There are different valuation metrics to determine a stock’s inherent strength but a random selection of ratios cannot serve your purpose if you want a realistic assessment of a company’s financial position. For this, we would suggest considering Price to Cash Flow (or P/CF) as one of the key metrics. This metric evaluates the market price of a stock relative to the amount of cash flow that the company is generating on a per-share basis – the lower the number, the better.Price to Cash Flow Reveals Financial Health Questions may arise as to why we are considering the Price to Cash Flow valuation metric, when the most widely used metric is Price/Earnings (or P/E). Well, what makes P/CF stand out is that operating cash flow adds back non-cash charges such as depreciation and amortization to net income, truly reflecting the financial health of a company.Analysts caution that a company’s earnings are subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation. On the other hand, cash flow is reliable. It is net cash flow that reveals how much money a company is actually generating and how effectively management is putting the same to use.A positive cash flow indicates an increase in the company’s liquid assets. This gives the company the means to settle debt, shell out for its expenses, reinvest in its business, endure downturns and finally pay back its shareholders. On the other hand, a negative cash flow implies a decline in the company’s liquidity, which in turn lowers its flexibility to support these moves.What’s the Optimum Strategy?However, an investment decision solely based on the P/CF metric may not fetch the desired results. To identify stocks that are trading at a discount, you should expand your search criteria and take into account price-to-book, price-to-earnings and price-to-sales ratios. Adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a Value Score of “A” or “B” to your search criteria should give you even better results as they eliminate the chance of falling into a value trap.Here are the parameters for selecting true value stocks:P/CF less than or equal to X-Industry Median.Price greater than or equal to 5: The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.Average 20-Day Volume greater than 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.P/E using (F1) less than or equal to X-Industry Median: This parameter shortlists stocks that are trading at a discount or are equal to its peers.P/B less than or equal to X-Industry Median: A lower P/B compared with the industry average implies that there is enough room for the stock to gain.P/S less than or equal to X-Industry Median: The P/S ratio determines how a stock price compares to the company’s sales — the lower the ratio the more attractive the stock is.PEG less than 1: The ratio is used to determine a stock's value by taking the company's earnings growth into account. PEG ratio portrays a more complete picture than the P/E ratio. A value of less than 1 indicates that the stock is undervalued and that investors need to pay less for a stock that has robust earnings growth prospect.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Value Score of less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a Style Score of ‘A’ or ‘B’ when combined with Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential. Here are four of the nine stocks that qualified the screening:Vishay Intertechnology, Inc.

248,AMAT,"The Q2 earnings season is off to a flying start, courtesy of broad-based performance across most sectors. Although earnings growth is trending lower than in comparable periods, total earnings are likely to be on par or even better than the all-time high achieved in fourth-quarter 2016. It appears that the equity markets have dispelled the recent skepticism about President Trump’s ability to deliver on his pro-growth promises.     As investors employ a wait-and-see approach in a classic example of “backing and filling” in the market, they could benefit from ‘cash cow’ stocks that garner higher returns.However, singling out cash-rich stocks alone does not make for a solid investment proposition unless they are backed by attractive efficiency ratios like return on equity (ROE). A high ROE ensures that the company is reinvesting its cash at a high rate of return.ROE: A Key MetricROE = Net Income/Shareholders’ EquityROE helps investors distinguish between profit-generating companies from profit burners and is useful for determining the financial health of a company. In other words, this financial metric enables investors to identify stocks that diligently deploy cash for higher returns.Moreover, ROE is often used to compare the profitability of a company with other firms in the industry – the higher, the better. It measures how well a company is increasing its profits without investing new equity capital in the business and portrays management efficiency in rewarding shareholders with attractive risk-adjusted returns.Screening ParametersIn order to shortlist stocks that are cash rich with high ROE, we have added Cash Flow greater than $1 billion and ROE greater than X-Industry as our primary screening parameters. In addition, we have taken a few other criteria into consideration to arrive at a winning strategy.Price/Cash Flow less than X-Industry: This metric measures how much investors pay for one dollar of free cash flow. A lower ratio indicates that investors need to pay less for a better cash flow generating stock.Return on Assets (ROA) greater than X-Industry: This metric determines how much profit a company earns for every dollar of asset, which includes cash, accounts receivable, property, equipment, inventory and furniture. The higher the ROA, the better it is for the company.5-Year EPS Historical Growth greater than X-Industry: This criterion indicates that continued earnings momentum has translated into solid cash strength.   Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Here are five of the 28 stocks that qualified the screen:Broadcom Limited (AVGO  -  Free Report): Broadcom is a premier designer, developer and global supplier of a broad range of semiconductor devices with a focus on complex digital and mixed signal complementary metal oxide semiconductor based devices and analog III-V based products.

249,AMAT,"The Trump administration’s failure to push through a new healthcare law has possibly sandbagged hopes of policy measures boosting stocks in the near future. In fact, investors now have little confidence left in the President’s pre-poll promises and are starting to bank on fundamental concerns when evaluating investment options. Needless to say, earnings performance and the state of the economy feature at the top of a list of such factors.Meanwhile, market watchers now believe that a falling dollar is just the tonic markets need. The decline in the greenback could provide equities with fresh upside by boosting earnings of commodity-centric and multinational companies. In a volatile scenario, investing in stocks of this nature, which are large enough to be included in the S&P 500, makes for a profitable option.Policy Paralysis Fells DollarThe dollar’s recent set of declines has provided analysts with an opportunity to determine whether it could have a positive effect on corporate earnings. To understand the gravity of the situation, one need to look no further than the U.S. Dollar Index, which is down 8% year to date. In comparison, the S&P 500% has already gained 10.3% over the same period.Immediately after Trump’s surprise victory, the dollar soared on hopes that the President’s growth-oriented and industry-friendly policies would boost the economy and earnings. However, repeated failures at pushing through policy proposals have left investors somewhat disenchanted. With little headway made on tax reforms, fiscal stimulus measures and a new healthcare law, the so called “Trump Trade” has experienced a reversal, leading to the greenback’s decline.Falling Dollar to Boost EarningsInstead, investors have chosen to focus on the state of the economy, the reluctance of the Fed to raise rates and a likely strong second quarter earnings season. And a clutch of analysts now feel that a softer dollar is just the tonic earnings need.While earnings felt the heat of a soaring dollar last year, a decline could be extremely beneficial this time around. Additionally, this phenomenon illustrates how expectations about the extent to which the Fed could hike rates have undergone a change.A fall in the dollar usually has a positive impact on the price of commodities. This is why companies which stand to gain handsomely from the dollar’s decline are those whose businesses are commodity centric or multinationals with significant overseas exposure. According to analysts at Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report), S&P 500 earnings could increase by 0.5% for every 1% decline in the dollar.The financial major explained that this factor impacts earnings on a rolling basis and its effects could become apparent in the second half of the year.  By this logic, an 8% decline in the dollar’s value by the end of the current year could boost 2018 earnings by 4%. If, as Morgan Stanley projects, the dollar declines by an additional 5%, earnings could grow by around 6.5%Our ChoicesCorporate earnings are likely to receive a welcome boost from the plunge in the dollar’s value. This is likely to be especially beneficial to those companies which deal in commodities or those with primarily multinational operations.Adding stocks of companies with a high percentage of overseas sales, according to Strategas Research Partners, and which make up the S&P 500 looks like a smart option at this juncture. We have narrowed down our search to the following stocks based on a good Zacks Rank and other relevant metrics.Micron Technology, Inc.

250,AMAT,"Investors seeking strong returns may allocate their assets in stocks with favorable liquidity positions. Liquidity is an important yardstick that indicates a company’s capability to meet debt obligations by converting assets into cash.A company with a favorable liquidity position has the potential to provide higher returns as liquidity drives growth. However, one should be cautious before investing in liquid stocks. While a high liquidity level may mean that the company is meeting its obligations at a faster rate compared to others in its domain, it may also indicate that the company is failing to use its assets efficiently.Hence, one should consider the efficiency level of a company in addition to its liquidity to identify potential winners as this combination is indicative of underlying financial strength.Measures to Identify Liquid StocksCurrent Ratio: It measures current assets relative to current liabilities. This ratio is used for measuring a company’s potential to meet both short- and long-term debt obligations. Thus, a current ratio — also known as working capital ratio — below 1 indicates that the company has more liabilities than assets. However, a high current ratio does not always indicate that the company is in good financial shape. It may also mean that the company has failed to utilize its assets significantly. Hence, a range of 1 to 3 is considered ideal.Quick Ratio: Unlike current ratio, quick ratio – also called “acid-test ratio"" or ""quick assets ratio"" – indicates a company’s ability to pay short-term obligations. It considers inventory excluding current assets relative to current liabilities. Like the current ratio, a quick ratio of greater than 1 is desirable.Cash Ratio: This is the most conservative ratio among the three, as it takes into account only cash and cash equivalents, and invested funds relative to current liabilities. It measures a company’s ability to meet its current debt obligations using the most liquid of assets. Though a cash ratio higher than 1 may point to sound financials, a high number may indicate inefficiency in cash utilization.So, a ratio greater than 1 is desirable at all times but may not always appropriately represent a company’s financial condition.Screening ParametersIn order to pick the best of the lot, we have added asset utilization, which is a widely used measure of a company’s efficiency, as one of the screening criteria. Asset utilization is the ratio of total sales over the past 12 months to the last four-quarter average of total assets. Though this ratio varies across industries, companies with a ratio higher than their respective industries can be considered efficient.In order to ensure that these liquid and efficient stocks have solid growth potential, we have added our proprietary Growth Style Score to the screen.Current Ratio, Quick Ratio and Cash Ratio between 1 and 3 (While liquidity ratios of greater than 1 are desirable, significantly high ratios may indicate inefficiency.)Asset utilization greater than industry average (Higher asset utilization than the industry average indicates a company’s efficiency.)Zacks Rank equal to #1 (Only Strong Buy-rated stocks can get through). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. Growth Style Score less than or equal to B (Back-tested results show that stocks with a Growth Style Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 handily beat other stocks.)These criteria have narrowed down the universe of over 7,700 stocks to only seven.Here are four of the seven stocks that qualified the screen:Headquartered in Santa Clara, CA, Applied Materials Inc. (AMAT  -  Free Report) is engaged in developing, manufacturing and marketing semiconductor wafer fabrication equipment and related spare parts for the semiconductor industry. The company has a Growth Score of A and an average four-quarter positive earnings surprise of 4.76%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 earnings increased by a couple of cents to $4.41 per share over the last 30 days.San Leandro, CA-based TriNet Group Inc. (TNET  -  Free Report) is a provider of a comprehensive human resources solution for small to medium-sized businesses. The company offers payroll, tax administration, risk protection, performance management, compensation consulting, and employee benefit plans. The company has a Growth Score of A and delivered an average four-quarter positive earnings surprise of 63.77%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2018 earnings remained stable at $2.59 over the last 30 days.Based in Northfield, IL, Stepan Company (SCL  -  Free Report) is a producer and seller of specialty and intermediate chemicals to other manufacturers for use in various end products worldwide. The company has a Growth Score of B and delivered an average four-quarter positive earnings surprise of 15.7%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2018 earnings remained stable at $5.17 over the last 30 days.Dublin, Ireland-based Allegion plc (ALLE  -  Free Report) produces and sells electronic as well as mechanical security solutions and products worldwide.

251,AMAT,"Facebook, Inc. (FB  -  Free Report) is still recovering from the damage wreaked by the Cambridge Analytica data scandal. It had affected around 87 million users and allegedly influenced the 2016 U.S. presidential elections.Notably, the European Union (EU) had defamed Facebook regarding the data breach fiasco and expressed its interest in initiating an investigation on Mar 20, right after the news went viral. It seems that EU is still sticking to its ground and is unimpressed with Mark Zuckerberg’s sorry image.Per CNBC, EU is planning to intensify the investigation process related to “harvesting of personal information.” The Working Party 29, which takes care of the data-protection authorities of the EU nations, will reportedly form a Social Media Working Group aimed at creating unified strategies for further investigation.Furthermore, a new law related to data privacy called General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is expected to come into existence in the EU on May 25. Per the latest introduction, Europeans will have the rights of knowing which of their personal data businesses are collecting and will have the right to delete those if need be.This law, once implemented, might impact companies which generate most of the revenues from advertisements which, in turn, need a huge amount of personal data for correct targeting of customers.For the social media giant, Facebook, which generated around 98% of its revenues in 2017 from advertisements, this implementation might be a huge drag on its top-line growth. Meanwhile, Facebook’s stock has been hit badly by the alleged data misuse scandal. The company’s shares have lost around 5% since the news surfaced on Mar 19.Facebook Continues to StriveApart from just being apologetic, Facebook is actually adhering to its word of maintaining data privacy as stated in the apology statements.Facebook recently removed more than 270 accounts and pages operated by the Russian organization, Internet Research Agency (IRA), which were aimed at influencing the 2016 U.S. presidential election. The company also announced that only authorized advertisers will be able to post political ads going forward, which will be labeled as “Political Ad” bearing “paid for by” information.Furthermore, Facebook suspended two more data analytics companies, namely CubeYou and AggregateIQ, over unauthorized handling of user data. It is also investing in artificial intelligence (AI), and recruiting more people for handling data security and content.To ConcludeWe believe Facebook’s efforts to plug security loopholes as well as limit fake news will eventually boost trustworthiness. Sequoia Fund’s investment for a minority stake in the company amidst this scenario is a testament to the fact.However, we are apprehensive about this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) stock’s near-term performance as the eroded brand image will take some time to shine again.Key PicksInvestors interested in the broader technology sector can consider some better-ranked stocks like Paycom Software (PAYC  -  Free Report), Western Digital Corp.

256,AMAT,"The U.S. and China might be closer to resolving their trade issues after President Xi Jinping noted that his country will look to further open the Chinese economy to outsiders. There are no guarantees just yet, but markets seem to be a bit less jittery recently. This means now might be a good time to buy back in on the industry that drove indexes to historic heights.Trade war turmoil and interest-related concerns led the market and some of the best-performing stocks to sink over the last few months, exemplified by major losses from Facebook (FB  -  Free Report) and other technology industry powers. However, Facebook’s dive is based mostly on company-specific problems related to its recent data breach scandal. Meanwhile, many tech stocks still boast strong fundamentals that could see them continue to surge as the market calms.With that said, let’s take a look at three of these stocks that currently present pre-selloff positivity when you dig into some of their current metrics.1.     Applied Materials (AMAT  -  Free Report)Applied Materials operates within an industry—memory and data storage—that is only going to grow as the IoT and connected devices ecosystem expands. Shares of this wafer fabrication firm are still up more than 43% over the last year in spite of AMAT’s nearly month-long downturn. Applied Materials’ outlook also remains strong, with our Current Zacks Consensus Estimates calling for revenues to climb 25.5% to reach $4.45 billion this quarter. The company’s bottom line expansion is expected to be even better at 43%.AMAT is also currently trading with a Forward P/E of 12.2, which marks a substantial discount to its industry’s 16.1 average. Investors should be excited to see that they can buy AMAT at a cheaper earnings multiple than many of its peers, while still expecting big year-over-year top and bottom line growth. Lastly, Applied Materials is currently a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) that has earned a ton of upward earnings estimate revisions recently.2.       Western Digital (WDC  -  Free Report)A few years ago, Western Digital saw its stock price plummet. Today, the data storage solutions firm that helped kick off the computer storage industry looks ready to grow. WDC is currently a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and is projected to see it quarterly revenues climb by more than 6% to reach $4.93 billion.Western Digital’s downturn might have forced management to focus more heavily on earnings, which is demonstrated by WDC’s current quarterly and full-year EPS growth projections of 36.4% and 52%, respectively. Western Digital is also currently trading at 7.6x forward earnings, which marks a major discount against the “Computer- Storage Devices” industry’s average Forward P/E of 11.7. Investors might consider buying WDC ahead of its upcoming quarterly earnings report as it is currently trading well below its 52-week high. This means a better price could be hard to come by for some time.3.       Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report)Amazon needs no introduction these days as Jeff Bezos’ company seemingly enters a new sector of the economy every other day. Despite its size and strength, AMZN saw its stock price tumble nearly 10% over the last month. Yet while President Donald Trump’s Twitter (TWTR) attacks against Amazon may persist, the company’s revenues are expected to surge 40.4% this quarter to reach $50.16 billion.Furthermore, the recent selloff makes Amazon’s stock price look rather inexpensive considering that the company is expected to expand its bottom line by nearly 87% this year. Amazon is also currently a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) that can afford to spend money to enter new growth industries, such as fintech, while its AWS cloud business stabilizes its earnings.5 Medical Stocks to Buy NowZacks names 5 companies poised to ride a medical breakthrough that is targeting cures for leukemia, AIDS, muscular dystrophy, hemophilia, and other conditions.New products in this field are already generating substantial revenue and even more wondrous treatments are in the pipeline.

259,AMAT,"Investors in Applied Materials, Inc. (AMAT  -  Free Report) need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Apr 13, 2018 $45.00 Put had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Applied Materials shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Applied Materials is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) in the Semiconductor Equipment - Wafer Fabrication industry that ranks in the Top 7% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, seven analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while none have dropped their estimates. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from $1.00 per share to $1.13 in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Applied Materials right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options? Each week, our very own Dave Bartosiak gives his top options trades.

260,AMAT,"On Apr 10, shares of Seagate Technology Inc. (STX  -  Free Report) rallied about 5.4% to $59.35 per share on the heels of a rating upgrade from Morgan Stanley.Analyst Katy Huberty upgraded Seagate from “equal weight” to “overweight,” with a $72 price target. Huberty stated, ""We believe accelerating IT budget and data storage growth in the Data Era are underappreciated by investors.""The upgrade follows an increased interest in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning. Exponential growth in stored data, Nearline’s rapid adoption, stable HDD pricing environment and low inventory levels are positives. We believe this could be a potential long-term growth driver for Seagate, making the stock a lucrative opportunity for investors who want to capitalize on this shift in the storage industry.Strong Demand for HDD: Key CatalystHDD requirement is growing due to strong demand for high-capacity mass-storage solutions. Per management, in the second quarter of fiscal 2018, 10-terabyte helium nearline product was one of the major top-line drivers. 12-terabyte helium product is also gaining favor among users. High customer satisfaction is likely to boost the market adoption of these products.Further, stabilization of the PC market per the latest report from Gartner and IDC bodes well for memory shipments, particularly HDDs. According to IDC, worldwide PC shipment has shown signs of growth in the fourth quarter of 2017, during which shipments grew 0.7% on a year-over-year basis to 70.6 million units.Seagate also expects its exabyte shipments to be around 88 exabytes, which reflects drive shipments to be around 40 million and average capacity per drive to be approximately 2.2 terabytes. The company has experienced exabyte growth in all end markets that include PC compute, consumer, surveillance, gaming, and NAS markets.Other PositivesNotably, the shares of this second largest manufacturer of HDDs have returned 22.8% year over year, substantially outperforming the industry’s rally of 19.4%.Additionally, advancement of cloud storage technologies in the industry is a tailwind. This has led to an increase in the deployment of high capacity mass storage products, which bodes well for Seagate.Moreover, the company’s long-term agreement with Toshiba for NAND chips supply will help it to expand product portfolio rapidly. Further, Seagate’s effort to improve areal density with the ramp up of heat assisted magnetic recording (“HAMR”) technology is expected to be shipped in 2019. This is likely to drive revenues in 2019.These factors are expected to keep Seagate’s earnings per share (EPS) on a growth trajectory, which is currently projected at 15.6%. Notably, the company topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in three of the trailing four quarters.Currently, Seagate is a Zacks #3 (Hold) Ranked stock with a VGM score of A.Stocks to ConsiderFew better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are Western Digital Corporation (WDC  -  Free Report), Applied Materials, Inc.

Total cloud revenues (16% of total revenue compared with 13% in the year-ago quarter) advanced 32% to $1.57 billion.Moreover, total cloud and on-premise software revenues increased 8% to $7.98 billion. We believe that the company’s growing cloud market share will continue to drive top-line growth in the foreseeable future.We also believe that the company’s partnership with e-commerce vendor, Fanatics, will facilitate better management of their sports merchandise on Oracle Marketing Cloud.Going forward, partnerships with Salesforce, Microsoft and NetSuite along with the recent acquisition of TOA Technologies will provide a significant boost to Oracle’s cloud-computing endeavors.However, management provided soft outlook for the cloud business, which will remain an overhang on the shares in the near term. Further, higher investments on Infrastructure as a Service (""IaaS"") platform will affect gross margin expansion in the near term.Notably, Oracle has returned 1.6% in the past year, underperforming the industry’s rally of 28.9%.Zacks Rank & Key PicksOracle currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are Applied Materials, Inc.

263,AMAT,"The PowerShares Dynamic Semiconductors Portfolio (PSI  -  Free Report) made its debut on 06/23/2005, and is a smart beta exchange traded fund that provides broad exposure to the Technology ETFs category of the U.S. equity market.What Are Smart Beta ETFs?The ETF industry has traditionally been dominated by products based on market capitalization weighted indexes that are designed to represent the market or a particular segment of the market.A good option for investors who believe in market efficiency, market cap weighted indexes offer a low-cost, convenient, and transparent way of replicating market returns.On the other hand, some investors who believe that it is possible to beat the market by superior stock selection opt to invest in another class of funds that track non-cap weighted strategies--popularly known as smart beta.This kind of index follows this same mindset, as it attempts to pick stocks that have better chances of risk-return performance; non-cap weighted strategies base selection on certain fundamental characteristics, or a mix of such characteristics.Methodologies like equal-weighting, one of the simplest options out there, fundamental weighting, and volatility/momentum based weighting are all choices offered to investors in this space, but not all of them can deliver superior returns.Fund Sponsor & IndexBecause the fund has amassed over $332.22 M, this makes it one of the average sized ETFs in the Technology ETFs. PSI is managed by Invesco Powershares. Before fees and expenses, PSI seeks to match the performance of the Dynamic Semiconductor Intellidex Index.The index is comprised of stocks of semiconductor companies. The Index is designed to provide capital appreciation by thoroughly evaluating companies based on a variety of investment merit criteria, including fundamental growth, stock valuation, investment timeliness and risk factors.Cost & Other ExpensesFor ETF investors, expense ratios are an important factor when considering a fund's return; in the long-term, cheaper funds actually have the ability to outperform their more expensive cousins if all other things remain the same.Annual operating expenses for PSI are 0.63%, which makes it on par with most peer products in the space.PSI's 12-month trailing dividend yield is 0.21%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsIt is important to delve into an ETF's holdings before investing despite the many upsides to these kinds of funds like diversified exposure, which minimizes single stock risk. And, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.This ETF has heaviest allocation in the Information Technology sector - about 100% of the portfolio.Taking into account individual holdings, Micron Technology Inc (MU  -  Free Report) accounts for about 6.33% of the fund's total assets, followed by Intel Corp (INTC  -  Free Report) and Applied Materials Inc (AMAT  -  Free Report).The top 10 holdings account for about 45.21% of total assets under management.Performance and RiskThe fund's year-to-date return has added roughly 0.50%, and it's up approximately 23.06% in the last one year (as of 04/10/2018). PSI has traded between $39.72 and $57.37 in the past 52-week period.The ETF has a beta of 1.24 and standard deviation of 22.60% for the trailing three-year period, making it a high choice in the space. With about 30 holdings, it has more concentrated exposure than peers.AlternativesPowerShares Dynamic Semiconductors Portfolio is an excellent option for investors seeking to outperform the Technology ETFs segment of the market. There are other ETFs in the space which investors could consider as well.VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH  -  Free Report) tracks MVIS US Listed Semiconductor 25 Index and the iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF (SOXX  -  Free Report) tracks PHLX SOX Semiconductor Sector Index. VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF has $1.32 B in assets, iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF has $1.57 B. SMH has an expense ratio of 0.35% and SOXX charges 0.48%.Investors looking for cheaper and lower-risk options should consider traditional market cap weighted ETFs that aim to match the returns of the Technology ETFs.Bottom LineTo learn more about this product and other ETFs, screen for products that match your investment objectives and read articles on latest developments in the ETF investing universe, please visit Zacks ETF Center.

265,AMAT,"ON Semiconductor Corporation (ON  -  Free Report) is an original equipment manufacturer (“OEM”) of a broad range of discrete and embedded semiconductor components. Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock have gained 55.1% in the past year, substantially outperforming the industry’s rally of 28.4%.The momentum can be attributed to expanding product portfolio and collaborations.Factors Aiding ON SemiON Semi boasts strong product line and diversified customer base. Better-than-expected demand for CMOS image sensors, ADAS, power management products, wireless charging, mixed signal ASICs and sensor interface products are positives.The company is focusing on IoT division.

Under the agreement, ConvenientPower will develop, design and market in-vehicle wireless charging solutions, making use of ON Semi’s NCV6500 power management controller.This collaboration in automotive wireless charging solution is anticipated to enhance ON Semi’s product portfolio and strengthen foothold in the automotive market.Per Technavio, the global wireless charger market is anticipated to witness CAGR of more than 33% in the period 2016-2020, which will greatly benefit the company.Further, ON Semi has a very well diversified business. The company generates a significant percentage of revenues from each of the computing, consumer, industrial, communications and automotive markets. This mitigates the impact of seasonality typical of any of the markets, resulting in balanced growth through the year. Moreover, this diversity also helps the company to offset any weakness in a particular market by growth in others.Risks RemainDespite stellar last quarter results, investors remain disappointed by the company’s guidance. Also, the company faces significant competition in all of the served markets. Additionally, leveraged balance sheet remains a concern.We note that On Semi currently has a trailing 12 month P/E ratio of 20.19. This level compares unfavorably to some extent with what the industry saw over the last year. The ratio is higher than the average level of 17.65 and is toward its higher end of the valuation range over this period. Hence, valuation looks slightly stretched from a P/E perspective.Bottom LineThe company has a long-term EPS growth rate of 12.2%.Banking on these positives, we believe that ON Semi is one technology stock that investors should retain in their portfolio.Stocks to ConsiderFew better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report), Applied Materials, Inc.

267,AMAT,"Intel Corporation (INTC  -  Free Report) is divesting its software firm Wind River Systems Inc. to alternative asset fund manager TPG. The financial term of the deal were kept under wraps.Notably, the world’s largest chip maker had bought Wind River Systems for $884 million in 2009 with the aim of stepping out of the traditional semiconductor market and expanding into the consumer electronics space.Wind River is the global leader in Device Software Optimization (“DSO”). The buyout enabled Intel to possess Wind River’s expertise in running device software with greater reliability, at faster speed and lower cost. The acquisition also aided the chipmaker to expand beyond the computing end market to embedded systems for mobile phones, smart phones and networking equipment.According to Tom Lantzsch, Intel’s Internet of Things Group senior vice president, “This move is designed to sharpen our focus on growth opportunities that align to Intel’s data-centric strategy.”The news comes approximately a year after Intel concluded the sale of its majority stake in Intel Security division McAfee unit to TPG for $4.2 billion.Intel has outperformed the industry over the past year. While the industry grew just 21.1%, the stock returned 27.4%.Growth ProspectsWe believe that the completion of the divestiture will help Intel to focus on fast growing businesses like data center, memory, Internet of Things (IoT) and autonomous car technology. The majority stake sale will free up resources for the company, which it intends to invest on these rapidly growing businesses.Intel’s data center business and cloud have been registering significant growth. The company has made significant advancement in this area as well and it is now offering more integrated solutions that will likely be competitive on a cost per watt basis.The company’s investments in field programmable gate array (FPGA) for acceleration (dramatically increases performances at very low power) and memory to reduce latency and increase speeds are helping it develop custom solutions for big players.Moreover, Intel’s acquisition of MobilEye now enables it to offer almost anything related to self-driving vehicles — cameras, in-car networking, sensor-chips, roadway mapping, cloud software, machine learning and data management.Additionally, the company has also been a long-time supplier to Alphabet’s (GOOGL  -  Free Report) Waymo division. Further, its partnerships with BMW, Nissan, Volkswagen AG, and Ferrari is likely to boost sales of processing chips, sensor-chips, cloud software and many more, which will drive top-line growth.Zacks Rank & Key PicksIntel carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Few better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector include Applied Materials, Inc. (AMAT  -  Free Report) and NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report), both sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).  You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Applied Materials and NVIDIA have a long-term expected EPS growth rate of 13.26% and 10.25%, respectively.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

268,AMAT,"The first quarter of 2018 was a bumpy ride for the technology sector, thanks to the slew of bad news, which includes the Russian hacking of computers at the 2018 Olympics, data misuse scandal at Facebook (FB  -  Free Report), and the first casualty by a driverless car. This has come as a massive blow to the share prices of tech heavyweights, including Facebook, Apple and Alphabet, dragging the entire sector down.However, in the technology sector, semiconductors remained the most stable industry. During first-quarter 2018, iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF (SOXX  -  Free Report) gained 6.1% as against the Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF’s (XLK  -  Free Report) return of just 2.3%.The semiconductor industry has been benefiting from the rising demand for chips used in cloud-based platforms, Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools, Augmented/Virtual (AR/VR) reality devices, autonomous cars, advanced driver assisted systems (ADAS), as well as Internet of Things (IoT) related software and hardware.Higher demand for chips, sensors, RFID, etc has been driving the top-line growth of various well known semiconductor companies. This, in turn, is boosting investors’ confidence as reflected in the companies’ share-price movement.Additionally, the U.S. chip-equipment makers’ earnings and cash flow are likely to get further boost from Trump’s business-friendly tax-cut policies. The tax reform will make semiconductors repatriate significant amount of cash held abroad and eventually drive after-tax earnings. Chip makers can also use this extra cash for research and development, and mergers & acquisition activities.Therefore, it is wise for investors to have some semiconductor stocks in their portfolio which have potentials to provide better returns in highly volatile situations.Micron: One of the Best ChoicesMicron Technology, Inc. (MU  -  Free Report) turned out to be one of the best performers in the semiconductor industry in the first quarter of 2018. The company’s shares have appreciated nearly 26.8% during the period, a much better performance than the iShares PHLX Semiconductor and Technology Select Sector SPDR ETFs.The outperformance can be primarily attributed to Micron’s robust revenue and earnings growth, as well as expanding margins. We note that the company posted positive earnings surprise of 8% in the trailing four quarters.We believe the company will continue its stellar growth performance in the quarters ahead. The optimism surrounding the stock comes from the fact that the DRAM market is still witnessing a huge demand-supply gap which is escalating prices.It should also be noted that as Micron generates nearly 70% of its revenues by selling DRAM products,the company is the biggest beneficiary of this supply shortage. In the last reported quarter, sales from DRAM products witnessed a whopping 76% year-over-year increase.Micron, which sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), has also witnessed significant earnings estimate revision in the last 30 days. The EPS estimate for the current quarter moved up 4% (11 cents) to $2.84 per share during the same period.3 Other Stocks in FocusApart from Micron, there are few other semiconductor stocks that have the potential to outperform in the current quarter. These stocks sport a Zacks Rank #1 or #2 (Buy), and have witnessed significant estimate revisions.Another semiconductor stock which is in our list of favorites is NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report). Although recent developments like suspension of test drives for all its driverless vehicles and a likely sluggish demand from cryptocurrency miners has dented stock price, we believe they have least impact on the company’s financial performance.Although tests have been suspended, vehicle makers will continue to invest in making driverless cars safer. This keeps the demand for NVIDIA’s chips unaffected. Moreover, sales generated from cryptocurrency miners contribute a meager part to the company’s overall revenues, therefore any slowdown in demand will have no material impact.Furthermore, last month Uber’s driverless vehicle test incident has once again pressed the need for safer technologies, which NVIDIA is capable of offering. The company recently unveiled the Constellation driving simulator which enables companies to test self-driving systems in a virtual environment.Although NVIDIA doesn’t expect the new simulator to fully replace real-world testing of self-driving cars, the number of trials will likely come down, significantly. We believe the latest simulator will enhance NVIDIA’s competitive position in the self-driving car market space, particularly against chip makers, like Intel and Advance Micro Devices.NVIDIA flaunts a Zacks Rank of 1 and has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, the average positive surprise being 40.8%. The company has witnessed sharp upward estimate revision in the past 60 days. The EPS estimate for the current quarter increased 51.5% (51 cents) to $1.50 per share during the same time frame. The stock rallied 19.7% in the first quarter. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The next stock in our radar is Applied Materials, Inc. (AMAT  -  Free Report). Applied Materials’ market share has gained significantly with its strength in 3D NAND and DRAM. Management expects increasing DRAM and logic spending in 2018. The prevailing demand-supply gap for DRAM will continue to benefit the company throughout this year.This Zacks #2 Ranked company has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the preceding four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 4.8%. The EPS estimate for the current quarter increased 13% (13 cents) to $1.13 per share during the same time frame. The stock has gained 8.8% in the first quarter.Our next pick is Lam Research Corporation (LRCX  -  Free Report). The company is anticipated to benefit from the improving WFE market, elevated demand for server DRAM and increased adoption rates of 3D NAND technology in the near future. This is driven by cloud computing, big data, mobile devices and IoT. The company has undertaken cost-reduction activities, and density scaling for 3D NAND and new memory technologies.The company, which carries a Zacks Rank of 2, outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate over the past four quarters with an average positive surprise of 9.2%. The stock has ascended 10.3% in the first quarter.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

269,AMAT,"Logitech International SA (LOGI  -  Free Report) continues its impressive streak of earnings beats for the seventh consecutive quarter. The company reported its first-quarter fiscal 2018 adjusted earnings (including stock-based compensation expense adjustments) of 22 cents per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 17 cents by 29.1%.On a non-GAAP basis, the company’s earnings per share came in at 24 cents, up 20.0% year over year. Remarkable year-over-year rise in the bottom line was driven by strong top-line performance. Also, Logitech's concerted efforts to drive cost efficiency proved conducive to overall earnings and profitability growth.Net sales for the quarter rose an impressive 10.0% year over year to $529.9 million, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $521 million. Double-digit rise in sales across most of the product lines in all the three geographies, namely, Americas, EMEA, and Asia, drove year-over-year top-line growth.Segment-Wise PerformanceCreativity and Productivity business comprises four sub-business lines – Keyboards and Combos, Pointing Devices, PC Webcams, and Tablet and Other Accessories. Of these, Keyboards and Combos remained flat as high sales in the Americas and the EMEA region was offset by decline in sales in the Asia-Pacific region. Pointing Devices sales were up 5% to $122.1 million, driven by solid demand for mouse and the recently introduced Spotlight presentation device.Greater proliferation of personal broadcasting mediums, including video blogging, proved conducive to sales growth of PC webcams. Encouragingly, the Tablet and Other Accessories segment witnessed a rebound as sales grew 67% to $23.2 million. Rapid market traction of the newly introduced products including, Slim Combo Case for the iPad Pro and Rugged Combo family of products, drove sales of the tablet segment.Gaming surged 38% year over year to $77.7 million, driven by double-digit growth from all three regions. On the other hand, Video Collaboration grew 49% to $35.6 million on the back of double-digit increase from all three regions. Rising demand from companies, both large and small, for video-enabling huddle rooms and conference rooms drove sales growth of this segment.The Music business, which comprises Mobile Speakers units and Audio-PC & Wearables, witnessed mixed performance. Mobile Speaker sales rose 10% to $62.9 million, led by impressive market traction of Ultimate Ears and Wonderboom product lines. However, this was largely offset by the drab performance of the Audio PC & Wearables segment, which fell 11% during the first quarter of fiscal 2018, driven by the Jaybird buyout.In addition, sales under the Home Control category increased 47% to $16.5 million, driven by continued demand for smart home products. Integration of voice assistants (such as Alexa and Google Assistant) into Harmony Hub proved conducive to the sales performance of this segment.During the first quarter of fiscal 2018, Logitech generated record non-GAAP gross margin growth, up 140 basis points (bps) to 37.0% year over year. Cost savings across all product lines drove the gross margin improvement. Non-GAAP operating margin for the company expanded a remarkable 20 bps year over year to 8.1%, as non-GAAP operating income jumped 13.8% year over year to $43.0 million on top-line strength. Though higher gross margins boosted operating income, higher investments offset some of this improvement.Logitech International S.A. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Logitech International S.A. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Logitech International S.A. QuoteLiquidityAs on Jun 30, 2017, Logitech’s cash and cash equivalents were $527.6 million compared with $547.5 million as of Mar 31, 2017.Guidance RaisedConcurrent with the first-quarter fiscal 2018 results, Logitech raised its full-year 2018 guidance. Currently, it expects non-GAAP operating income in the range of $260–$270 million compared with the earlier guided range of $250–$260 million. Also, it now anticipates constant currency fiscal 2018 sales in the range of 10–12%, compared with the earlier projection of high single-digit growth.The upward revision is mainly attributable to the recent Astro Gaming buyout. This acquisition will enable Logitech to explore the console gaming market and help accelerate long-term growth of its gaming business.To ConcludeLogitech entered fiscal 2018 on a robust note, with both healthy top and bottom-line beats. The raised guidance is likely to go down well with investors. The all-pervasive increase of its retail business is a major positive and is likely to continue, going forward. Also, the Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company’s diligent cost-cutting efforts add to its strength. Logitech remains optimistic that the steady traction of its product lines, as well as positive industry trends will continue to fuel growth.We believe that the thriving cloud-based video-conferencing services, strategic product launches and restructuring actions will continue to be growth drivers. The company has been able to leverage its software and go-to-market capabilities to drive market share gains. In addition, the Astro buyout catches the eye as it is expected to be slightly dilutive to the bottom line in the first year, due to integration expenses and investments.Other Stocks to ConsiderSome other stocks in the broader sector include Applied Optoelectronics, Inc.

270,AMAT,"Koninklijke Philips N.V. (PHG  -  Free Report) reported optimistic second-quarter 2017 results, driven by robust sales growth and higher income from continued operations, and also reiterated its full-year 2017 guidance.The Dutch electronics giant reported second-quarter net income from continuing operations of €161 million ($177 million), up 36.4% from the prior-year quarter’s figure of €118 million. Earnings were driven by strong sales growth, lower financial expenses and improved operational performance. The year-earlier figure had been hurt by taxes linked to the company’s efforts to divest the lighting business.The company posted second-quarter 2017 net income of €0.27 (29.7 cents) per share, as against earnings of €0.46 recorded in the year-ago quarter. Earnings were hurt due to lower income from discontinued operations, higher restructuring and acquisition-related costs.Investors cheered the solid results, with shares of the company rising 3.8% at one point in pre-market trading following the release.Koninklijke Philips N.V. Price and Consensus  Koninklijke Philips N.V. Price and Consensus | Koninklijke Philips N.V. QuoteInside the HeadlinesTotal revenue in the quarter came in at €4,294 million ($4721.8 million), up 3.9% from the year-ago tally. Top-line improvement came on the back of impressive HealthTech portfolio sales.Philips’ adjusted earnings before interest, taxes and amortization (EBITA) – the company’s preferred measure of operational performance – jumped 14.6% year over year to €439 million ($482.7 million), benefiting from cost-productivity programs and higher volumes.On the other hand, net cash flow generated from operating activities came in at €73 million ($80.3 million) compared with net cash flow of €177 million witnessed in the prior-year quarter.The company’s comparable order intake rose 8% year over year, driven by strong growth in Diagnosis & Treatment and Connected Care & Health Informatics businesses.Segmental RevenuesIn the reported quarter, Personal Health sales rose 6% year over year to €1,761 million ($1,936.4 million). This segment recorded a 6% hike in comparable sales. Double-digit growth in Health & Wellness, high-single-digit growth in Personal Care and mid-single-digit growth in Sleep & Respiratory Care drove this segment’s top line.Diagnosis & Treatment revenues increased 4.4% in the quarter to €1,671 million ($1,837.5 million). Comparable sales grew 3% for the quarter. Mid-single-digit growth in Ultrasound and Image-Guided Therapy proved conducive to growth.Connected Care & Health Informatics revenues were almost flat year over year at €768 million ($844.5 million). On a comparable basis, sales inched up 1%. Sales improvement came mainly on the back of low-single-digit growth in Patient Care & Monitoring Solutions.However, sales decline in Healthcare Informatics, Solutions & Services proved to be a drag for the segment.Revenues in the HealthTech & Other segment continued to be weak and fell 8.6% year over year to €92 million ($101.2 million). Lower royalty income due to foreseen expiration of licenses marred the sales of this segment.With effect from this quarter, Philips is reporting results of Philips Lighting under discontinued operations.Liquidity & Share RepurchaseExiting the quarter on Mar 31, 2017, Philips’ cash and cash equivalents rose to €2,220 million ($2,535.8 million) from €1,926 million a year back. The company’s long-term debt fell to €2,599 million ($2,968.8 million) compared with €5,269 million a year ago.During fourth-quarter 2016, the company completed its three-year EUR 1.5 billion share buyback program. Philips will launch a share buyback program for €15 billion in third-quarter 2017, to be executed over a span of two years.Diligent Cost-Savings ProgramsPhilips has been strongly benefiting from three of its comprehensive performance improvement and change-initiative programs – namely Accelerate, End2End productivity, and Design for Excellence – implemented earlier. These programs have been designed to maximize the value potential of the company, and accelerate growth by leveraging on innovation and operational execution.Thanks to these initiatives, in 2016, the company achieved €269 million of gross savings in overhead costs, €418 million of gross savings in procurement and €204 million of productivity savings from the End2End program. In second-quarter 2017, cost savings on overhead and procurement led to a remarkable increase in margins, saving about €109 million.The company now aims to enhance its performance further and targets to deliver 4–6% comparable sales growth, and adjusted EBITA margin expansion of around 100 basis points per year.AcquisitionsThe quarter was marked by a string of acquisitions which the company had identified over the past two years. Philips signed an agreement to acquire Spectranetics to strengthen its Diagnosis & Treatment businesses. Spectranetics is a provider of vascular intervention and lead management solutions. Philips also acquired CardioProlific, a US-based company that develops catheter-based thrombectomy technology for the treatment of peripheral vascular disease. Both these acquisitions will complement Philips’ portfolio of image-guided therapy devices.Philips also inked an agreement to buy U.S.-based medical device company, Electrical Geodesics, Inc. This acquisition will likely enhance the former’s imaging technologies and advanced informatics portfolio, used in neurological applications.The company penned an agreement to buy Respiratory Technologies, which provides an innovative airway clearance solution for patients with chronic respiratory conditions.Furthermore, subsequent to the quarter, Philips acquired image-analysis software provider TomTec Imaging Systems. TomTec specializes in diagnostic ultrasound that helps healthcare personnel to increase efficiency and diagnostic quality. Along with CardioProlific and Spectranetics, TomTec will likely be conducive to Philips’ image-guided therapy portfolio as well.Earlier this month, Philips also acquired the UK-based Health & Parenting, a London-based developer of healthcare and family-related mobile applications for expectant and new parents, in order to strengthen its Personal Health businesses.Update on Lighting DealPhilips had successfully offloaded a major stake in its lighting business – Lumileds – as it inked an agreement to sell an 80.1% stake in Lumileds to NY-based private-equity firm, Apollo Global Management LLC in early February this year. This fresh deal, which values the whole unit at $2 billion, closed in second-quarter 2017. Also, Philips sold 22.25 million shares of Philips Lighting.As a result of these transactions, its shareholding in Philips Lighting has decreased to 41.2%. Hence, the company is reporting Philips Lighting as part of Discontinued Operations.OutlookPhilips continues to project full-year sales growth of 4–6% and anticipates gaining momentum in the second half of the year, boosted by a strong order book.While the company expects an uncertain climate in the U.S. and continued volatility in its markets, Philips is enjoying robust orders in China and India, as well as Europe.Our TakePhilips’ second-quarter results were quite consistent, with growth in both top- and bottom-line performance. The company’s cost-saving programs have been producing tangible results, thus supplementing its strength. It further believes that increased spending on healthcare and fitness will act as a long-term growth driver, even in the face of continued volatility in the markets in which the company operates.Philips is presently focusing on key opportunities in population health management, while improving its enterprise-wide solutions for health systems and collaborating with health care organizations, to fortify the company’s foothold in the healthcare industry. Its numerous acquisitions should also prove accretive to its top line in the quarters ahead, and help strengthen its foothold in the end markets.Moreover, offloading of the lighting business is a major positive and will likely help this company allocate its resources in core business areas to stoke growth, moving ahead.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderPhilips presently holds a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Some better-ranked stocks in the same space include Lam Research Corporation (LRCX  -  Free Report), Applied Materials, Inc. (AMAT  -  Free Report) and KLA-Tencor Corporation (KLAC  -  Free Report).

271,AMAT,"The goal of many retail investors today is to be the first to catch the next big trend in growth investments. Historically, big tech companies, and recently, cryptocurrencies, have taken the investing world by storm, making it increasingly difficult to see through to the light that is subtle stocks with strong steady growth.Semiconductor equipment, an industry many retail investors have never looked into, may provide the answer for those looking for a strong growth option.Applied Materials (AMAT  -  Free Report), ­­­a major wafer fabrication company, is taking the charge, and “B” grades for Growth and Momentum based on our Style Scores system show just how strong this company is. These factors, and the company’s strong record, combine to give Applied Materials an “A” overall VGM grade.Now that we’ve shown you that Applied Materials is a well-rounded option, we can dive into why this could be the need-to-know pick for those seeking strong growth options.Fundamentals   Most growth investors base their financial decisions on proven growth and momentum in previous quarters and years, as well as the promise of strong future growth.For those who like to see proven results, Applied Material’s share prices have jumped from $53.04 to $58.47, or 10.2%, in the past 12 weeks. With it stock price having moved up 320% from where it was five years ago, it is easy to see why this steadily surging tech company appeals to investors looking for strong momentum.To appease those on the other side of the coin, Applied Materials boasts a current-quarter earnings growth estimate of 43% and a current-year growth estimate of 35.5%.Looking into its revenue stream and sales estimates, we continue to see strong signs of growth in the short and long run. Sales estimates for the current quarter are calling for growth of 25.5%, with next quarter estimates projecting 18.6% growth and full-year estimates calling for 19.6% improvement.If this isn’t enough to convince you that the company is growing steadily and will continue to do so, one should consider that EPS growth for the next three to five years is expected to come in at an annualized rate 13.3%, a strong statistic for those seeking long-term investments.Combine this with the company’s surprisingly low P/E ratio of 12.0 compared to the industry average 16.5, and we have a simultaneous great deal, something that is not usually seen with such growth options.Meanwhile, earnings estimate revisions have been unanimously positive for the current and next quarter, with only one negative revision for the current year out of the seven total, showing strong analyst sentiment.These factors help to push Applied Materials to a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), and make it an option or growth investors to seriously consider.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion.

272,AMAT,"Are you still holding shares of Castlight Health Inc. (CSLT  -  Free Report) and waiting for a miracle to take the stock higher in the near term? If yes, then you might end up losing more money as chances of a turnaround appear bleak in the near term. This is apparent from the stock’s decline of 8% in the past year. Moreover, the industry which it belongs to grew 33.8% in the same time frame.Shares of the company also went down 5.5%, yesterday. Let’s delve deeper and try to find out what is taking this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company down the hill.The sharp decline in share price can primarily be attributed to dismal earnings surprise history. Evidently, fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 marked the company’s 10th straight bottom-line loss. The company reported a loss of 4 cents per share in the last quarter, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Non-GAAP gross margin also contracted 710 basis points (bps) from the year-ago quarter to 67.7%. Further, the company continues to invest heavily on research & development. Non-GAAP research & development expenses and general & administrative expenses expanded 690 bps and 100 bps, respectively, to 34.3% and 14.2%.Outlook Remains BleakCastlight also provided not so encouraging guidance.For 2018, the company forecasts revenues between $150 million and $155 million. The Zacks Consensus estimates is pegged at $153 million. Non-GAAP loss is expected between 11 cents and 15 cents per share.The company anticipates first-quarter 2018 revenues to decline by about $1 million sequentially. Moreover, gross margin is expected to contract sequentially as company’s investments increases. Operating loss is projected to increase due to revenue seasonality.Management expects to report break-even in fourth-quarter 2018. The company’s higher level of investments on research & development is anticipated to continue, as it focuses on expanding offerings globally.Moreover, adoption of ASC 606 is projected to negatively impact revenues in 2018. The company also expects cost of revenues and operating expense to be slightly lower in the year owing to adoption of the accounting standard.Downward Estimate RevisionLet’s look at Castlight’ earnings estimate revisions in order to get a clear picture of what analysts are thinking about the company. Over the last 60 days, six fiscal 2018 estimates were revised downward with no northward revisions, resulting in the Zacks Consensus Estimate widening from a loss of 9 cents to a loss of 12 cents per share.Moreover, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2019 has declined by 75% to 1 cent, over 60 days.So it may not be a good decision to retain this stock in your portfolio anymore, at least if you don't intend to wait for a long time.Stocks to ConsiderFew better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector include Applied Materials, Inc.

273,AMAT,"The liquidity of a stock is an important yardstick that many investors tend to ignore. It primarily indicates a company’s capability to meet debt obligations by converting its assets into liquid cash and equivalents. Liquid stocks have always been in demand due to their potential to provide maximum returns.However, one should be cautious before investing in liquid stocks. While a high liquidity level may mean that the company is meeting its obligations at a faster rate compared to others in its domain, it may also indicate that the company is failing to use its assets efficiently.Hence, one should consider the efficiency level of a company in addition to its liquidity to identify potential winners as this combination is indicative of underlying financial strength.Measures to Identify Liquid StocksCurrent Ratio: It measures current assets relative to current liabilities. This ratio is used for measuring a company’s potential to meet both short- and long-term debt obligations. Thus, a current ratio — also known as working capital ratio — below 1 indicates that the company has more liabilities than assets. However, a high current ratio does not always indicate that the company is in good financial shape. It may also mean that the company has failed to utilize its assets significantly. Hence, a range of 1 to 3 is considered ideal.Quick Ratio: Unlike current ratio, quick ratio – also called “acid-test ratio"" or ""quick assets ratio"" – indicates a company’s ability to pay short-term obligations. It considers inventory excluding current assets relative to current liabilities. Like the current ratio, a quick ratio of greater than 1 is desirable.Cash Ratio: This is the most conservative ratio among the three, as it takes into account only cash and cash equivalents, and invested funds relative to current liabilities. It measures a company’s ability to meet its current debt obligations using the most liquid of assets. Though a cash ratio higher than 1 may point to sound financials, a high number may indicate inefficiency in cash utilization.So, a ratio greater than 1 is desirable at all times but may not always appropriately represent a company’s financial condition.Screening ParametersIn order to pick the best of the lot, we have added asset utilization, which is a widely used measure of a company’s efficiency, as one of the screening criteria. Asset utilization is the ratio of total sales over the past 12 months to the last four-quarter average of total assets. Though this ratio varies across industries, companies with a ratio higher than their respective industries can be considered efficient.In order to ensure that these liquid and efficient stocks have solid growth potential, we have added our proprietary Growth Style Score to the screen.Current Ratio, Quick Ratio and Cash Ratio between 1 and 3 (While liquidity ratios of greater than 1 are desirable, significantly high ratios may indicate inefficiency.)Asset utilization greater than industry average (Higher asset utilization than the industry average indicates a company’s efficiency.)Zacks Rank equal to #1 (Only Strong Buy-rated stocks can get through). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Growth Style Score less than or equal to B (Back-tested results show that stocks with a Growth Style Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 handily beat other stocks.)These criteria have narrowed down the universe of over 7,700 stocks to only eight.Here are four of the eight stocks that qualified the screen:Watertown, MA-based athenahealth Inc (ATHN  -  Free Report), through its cloud-based network athenaNet, provides services that manage the administrative duties of medical providers.

274,AMAT,"In volatile markets, investors look for both growth and income in their portfolios. This can be achieved by zeroing in on companies that not only pay dividends but also have been consistently increasing their payout.  Why Dividend Growth?Stocks that have a history of enhancing shareholder returns through consistent dividend hikes make an investor’s portfolio immune to large swings in stock prices in turbulent times, and thus act as a hedge against economic or political uncertainty. Simultaneously, these offer outsized payouts or sizable yields on a regular basis irrespective of the market direction.Additionally, these stocks have superior fundamentals that make dividend growth a quality and promising investment for the long term. These include a sustainable business model, a long track of profitability, rising cash flows, good liquidity, a strong balance sheet and some value characteristics. Further, a history of strong dividend growth indicates that dividend increase is likely in the future.Moreover, a history of dividend growth year over year leads to a healthy portfolio with greater scope of capital appreciation as opposed to simple dividend paying stocks or those with high yields. Although these stocks do not necessarily have the highest yields, they have outperformed for a longer period than the broader stock market or any other dividend-paying stock.As a result, picking dividend growth stocks appears as a winning strategy when some other parameters are also included.5-Year Historical Dividend Growth greater than zero: This selects stocks with a solid dividend growth history.5-Year Historical Sales Growth greater than zero: This represents stocks with a strong record of growing revenues.5-Year Historical EPS Growth greater than zero: This represents stocks with a solid earnings growth history.Next 3–5 Year EPS Growth Rate greater than zero: This represents the rate at which a company’s earnings are expected to grow. Improving earnings should help companies sustain dividend payments.Price/Cash Flow less than M-Industry: A ratio less than M-industry indicates that the stock is undervalued in that industry and that an investor needs to pay less for better cash flow generated by the company.52-Week Price Change greater than S&P 500 (Market Weight): This ensures that the stock appreciated more than the S&P 500 over the past year.Top Zacks Rank: Stocks having a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and 2 (Buy) generally outperform their peers in all types of market environment.Growth Score of B or better: Our research shows that stocks with a Growth Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential.Here are five of the 11 stocks that fit the bill:Delaware-based Chemours Company (CC  -  Free Report) provides performance chemicals in North America, the Asia Pacific, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and Latin America. The company has seen positive earnings estimate revision of 7 cents over the past 30 days for this year and has an expected earnings growth rate of 40.58%.

275,AMAT,"If you are still holding on to shares of Cadence Design Systems, Inc. (CDNS  -  Free Report) in your portfolio, it is time you dump them as chances of favorable returns in the near term appear bleak.Dropping Cadence can maximize investor’s portfolio returns as it has witnessed a significant price decline in the past year. Further, the company’s Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) only highlights its innate weakness.Cadencehas gained just 18% of its value year over year, underperforming 23.4% growth of its industry.Let’s delve deeper and find out what is taking this company down.Why Should Cadence be Avoided?Cadence provided not so encouraging first-quarter guidance. For first-quarter 2018, the company expects total revenues to be in the range of $500-$510 million and non-GAAP earnings in the range of 36-38 cents per share. The Zacks Consensus Estimates for revenues and earnings are pegged at $505.8 million and 38 cents, respectively.For 2018, revenues are anticipated to be in the range of $2.015-$2.055 billion. Non-GAAP earnings are guided in the range of $1.50-$1.60 per share. The Zacks Consensus Estimates for revenues and earnings are pegged at $2.05 billion and $1.57 per share, respectively.Cadence faces stiff competition from other EDA companies like ANSYS and Siemens AG (post the acquisition of Mentor Graphics). Intensifying competition negatively impacts pricing power, which keeps margins under pressure.The company generates a significant portion of its revenues from the International market. Consequently, we expect adverse foreign currency exchange rates to impede revenue growth in the near term due to fluctuation in the U.S. dollar against the Japanese Yen, Euro and other foreign currencies.Acquisitions have also negatively impacted its balance sheet, as high indebtedness adds to the risk of investing in the company. As of Dec 30, 2017, the company had total debt of $644.4 million. We also note the high level of goodwill and intangible assets, which totaled $944.8 million or almost 39.1% of total assets at the end of fourth-quarter 2017.So, it may not be a good decision to retain this stock in your portfolio anymore, at least if you don’t intend to wait for a long time.Stocks to ConsiderFew better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector include Applied Materials, Inc.

276,AMAT,"Western Digital Corp. (WDC  -  Free Report) appears a promising pick at the moment driven by stellar second-quarter 2018 results, strong product portfolio strength and expanding partner base. Moreover, it has been a favorite with investors, courtesy of its rising share price and strong fundamentals.The companyhas been witnessing upward estimate revisions, reflecting analysts’ optimism. The stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings being revised 1.1% upward, over the last 60 days. Consequently, the stock sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Itsshares have returned 12.2% over the three months, substantially outperforming the 0.6% rally of the industry.Notably, the companyhas a number of other aspects that make it an lucrative investment option.5 Reasons Why Western Digitalis an Attractive PickUpbeat Q2 Results: Western Digital delivered second-quarter fiscal 2018 non-GAAP earnings of $3.95 per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 14 cents and soared 71.7% from the year-ago quarter.Revenues also increased 9.2% year over year to $5.34 billion and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.29 billion. The strong top-line growth reflected healthy demand in the company’s end-markets for high capacity enterprise hard drives and flash-based products.Stock Looks Undervalued: From a valuation perspective, the stock looks very attractive as it currently trades significantly lower than the industry average based on a forward earnings estimate, which signifies a huge upward potential. Western Digitalcurrently trades at a forward P/E of 6.61x compared with the industry group average of 7.50x.Positive Earnings Surprise History: Western Digitalhas an impressive earnings surprise history. The company outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, recording a positive average earnings surprise of 6.4%.Strong Hold in SSD storage market: Western Digital has been expanding into the SSD storage market due to the decline in the PC market. SSDs are faster and more energy efficient than traditional hard drives. The secular growth of digital data, modest improvement in the TAM and higher demand for storage will remain the catalysts for storage in general and especially for SSDs. This persuaded TechNavio to project enterprise SSD market to grow at a CAGR of 17% during 2016-2020. The SSD segment’s growth potential is a major positive for Western Digital because this could mitigate the losses stemming from the secular decline in the PC market, which does not necessarily use SSDs.Active on the Acquisition Front: The acquisition of SanDisk has opened new avenues of growth for Western Digital and will help it boost market traction in the newer storage technology — SSD. The merger will lead to economies of scale, lower costs, greater market reach and acquisitions of new technologies, among other synergies.The Amplidata, sTec, Inc., Velobit, Inc. Arkeia Software Solutions and Virident Systems Inc. acquisitions have not only strengthened its small-to-medium sized business solutions but also expanded its SSD product portfolio. Moreover, the company’s strong cash balance of $6.27 billion and positive operating cash flow of $1.18 billion at the end of second-quarter fiscal 2018 enabled it to expand through acquisitions. These strategic takeovers are expected to provide the company with a competitive edge.Other Key PicksSome other top-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector include Applied Materials, Inc. (AMAT  -  Free Report), NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report) and Seagate Technology PLC (STX  -  Free Report), all sporting a Zacks Rank #1.Applied Materials, NVIDIA and Seagate Technology have a long-term expected EPS growth rate of 13.26%, 10.25% and 15.6%, respectively.Can Hackers Put Money INTO Your Portfolio?Earlier this month, credit bureau Equifax announced a massive data breach affecting 2 out of every 3 Americans.

277,AMAT,"Investors have been on the edge since Trump’s tariff talks had sparked trade war fears between the United States and China. As tensions gradually eased with both sides practicing restraint, the market took a breather and recovered from the early jolt when the news had first gone public.As investors employ a wait-and-see approach in a classic example of “backing and filling” in the market, they could benefit from ‘cash cow’ stocks that rake in higher returns.However, singling out cash-rich stocks alone does not make for a solid investment proposition unless they are backed by attractive efficiency ratios like return on equity (ROE). A high ROE ensures that the company is reinvesting its cash at a high rate of return.Why ROE?ROE = Net Income/Shareholders’ EquityROE helps investors distinguish profit-generating companies from profit burners and is useful in determining the financial health of a company. In other words, this financial metric enables investors to identify stocks that diligently deploy cash for higher returns.Moreover, ROE is often used to compare the profitability of a company with other firms in the industry — the higher, the better. It measures how well a company is multiplying its profits without investing new equity capital and portrays management’s efficiency in rewarding shareholders with attractive risk-adjusted returns.Screening ParametersIn order to shortlist stocks that are cash rich with high ROE, we have added Cash Flow greater than $1 billion and ROE greater than X-Industry as our primary screening parameters. In addition, we have taken a few other criteria into consideration to arrive at a winning strategy.Price/Cash Flow less than X-Industry: This metric measures how much investors pay for one dollar of free cash flow. A lower ratio indicates that investors need to pay less for a better cash flow generating stock.Return on Assets (ROA) greater than X-Industry: This metric determines how much profit a company earns for every dollar of asset, which includes cash, accounts receivable, property, equipment, inventory and furniture. The higher the ROA, the better it is for the company.5-Year EPS Historical Growth greater than X-Industry: This criterion indicates that continued earnings momentum has translated into solid cash strength.   Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Here are five of the 19 stocks that qualified the screen:Facebook, Inc. (FB  -  Free Report): Headquartered in Menlo Park, CA, Facebook helps in creating and fostering social networks through its web-based portal.

278,AMAT,"GrubHub Inc. (GRUB  -  Free Report) is set to release fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 8.Last quarter, earnings of 28 cents per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate and increased 21.7% year over year. The company has a mixed record of earning surprises in the trailing four quarters, delivering an average positive surprise of 8.33%.Revenues of $163 million beat the consensus mark of $159 million and improved 32% from the year-ago period.Notably, shares of GrubHub have gained 68.3% in the past year, significantly outperforming the industry’s 45.7% rally.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayGrubHub diverse restaurant base, broader marketing reach and continuous improvement in products are helping it gain new diners. This was evident in the third quarter as Active Diners increased 28% year over year to 9.81 million. Management stated that this was the highest rate of organic diner growth in the last 1.5 years.For the fourth quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Active Diners is pegged at 11.9 million, indicating a 45.1% increase from the figure reported in the prior-year quarter.GrubHub’s expansion outside the Tier 1 market is a positive. The company’s restaurant network has expanded 60% in the last 12 months (as of the end of third-quarter 2017), with significant growth coming from Tier 2 and Tier 3 markets. GrubHub’s delivery is available in around 80 markets in more than 800 cities.We believe that GrubHub’s partnerships with the likes of Groupon, Yelp (YELP  -  Free Report) and The Cheesecake Factory will continue to drive the customer base. GrubHub’s recently completed acquisitions of Eat24, OrderUp and Boston-based Foodler have broadened its portfolio of restaurants.The addition of Eat24 strengthens the company’s position across Tier 1 markets and almost doubles business in a large number of Tier 2 markets. Management stated the acquisition helped it gain new customers in markets like Miami, San Diego, Seattle, Las Vegas, Dallas and Houston.We anticipate the aforementioned factors to have aided the company in attracting diners to try GrubHub services in the fourth quarter, thereby contributing to revenues.However, increasing expenses might keep margins under pressure.GrubHub Inc.

279,AMAT,"Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. (BR  -  Free Report) is slated to release second-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Feb 8. Investors are keenly awaiting the earnings report of this technology-based outsourcing solutions provider to the financial services industry  to see if it succeeds in delivering a positive surprise.Notably, Broadridge has an impressive earnings surprise history. In the trailing four quarters, the stock surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate on three occasions and matched the same once, delivering an average positive surprise of 12.8%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.What the Zacks Model UnveilsAccording to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive Earnings ESP. The Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) are best avoided. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Broadridge has a Zacks Rank #2 and its Earnings ESP is +1.45%. Therefore, the company is likely to deliver a positive surprise this quarter.What to Expect?The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter earnings is pegged at 58 cents per share. This indicates a year-over-year increase of 48.7%. Additionally, analysts polled by Zacks project revenues of roughly $953.7 million, indicating 6.9% growth from the year-ago quarter actual figure.Factors to ConsiderNotably, the company continues to supplement internal growth with strategic acquisitions. During the quarter, the company acquired Summit Financial Disclosure, a provider of financial document management solutions. The acquisition is anticipated to enrich the company’s offerings related to “corporate disclosure lifecycle”.     Additionally, the company also acquired Morningstar, Inc.’s 15(c) board consulting services business. The acquisition is anticipated to strengthen Broadridge’s ability to provide a comprehensive source for financial data required for the fulfillment of governance related responsibilities by the board of directors of mutual funds.Moreover, in a bid to offer an innovative digital experience across financial services and other industries, the company expanded its strategic alliance with Amazon.com’s (AMZN) Amazon Web Services (AWS) in December 2017. The collaboration effort will help to build a new solution that can store documents and data in a repository.Furthermore, the company enhanced its client base with some prominent additions in the soon to-be-reported quarter. Earthport, a financial services firm, adopted “Broadridge's hosted service for Foreign Exchange and Cash Management processing”.    Beta Capital Wealth Management chose the company’s solutions for a “comprehensive front to back office technology and operations solution.”Broadridge also completed a blockchain-based pilot project along with Natixis and Societe Generale aimed at optimizing the efficiency of “bilateral repurchase, or repo agreements.”We believe all these initiatives and the strong business model of the company, a good percentage of which comes from recurring revenues are tailwinds that will help the company to deliver an impressive performance in the quarter under discussion.Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc.

Bookings from Kim Kardashian: Hollywood increased 6% sequentially.However, due to end of the MBL season, management anticipates TAP Sports Baseball to decline at an increasing rate in the soon-to-be-reported quarter, as observed in the prior years as well. Kim Kardashian: Hollywood is also not faring well when compared on a year-over-year basis.Unfortunately, Glu’s other celebrity titles like Cooking Dash and Restaurant Dash: Gordon Ramsay is also losing popularity.Therefore, the company’s latest shift toward developing a social networking app called The Swift Life for popular pop star Taylor Swift is prudent in our view. The app launched in December will enable the company to gain the support of the wide fan base of the singer. However, we don’t expect a significant contribution from it in the soon-to-be-reported quarter.Moreover, rising competition from established players like Electronic Arts (EA  -  Free Report) and Activision Blizzard (ATVI  -  Free Report) remains a concern. Furthermore, we anticipate significant investment in the research and development of new game titles to be a potential headwind for the company and put pressure on margins.Glu Mobile Inc.

281,AMAT,"Twitter (TWTR  -  Free Report) is set to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 8. The company beat the Zack Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, delivering an average positive surprise of 152.50%.However, in the last reported quarter, the top and the bottom lines declined 4.2% and 23%, respectively on a year-over-year basis. Notably, both the figures have been showing a declining trend over the last few quarters, which is a concern.Sluggish user growth coupled and declining revenues remain headwinds. However, the company’s focus on boosting user growth rate and engagement levels is a positive.Notably, shares of Twitter have gained 40.3% in the past year, outperforming the industry’s 25.6% rally.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors at PlayLackluster user growth remains the primary concern for investors. In third-quarter 2017, Twitter reported adjusted monthly average users (MAUs) of 330 million, up 1.2% sequentially and 4% on a year-over-year basis.For the fourth quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for MAUs is pegged at 332 million, indicating a 0.6% sequential increase and 4% increase from the figure reported in the prior-year quarter.We note that Twitter has been taking a lot of initiatives to combat all odds including curbing the widespread bullying on its platform. The company rolled out a 280-character limit for tweets earlier in November, doubling it from the legacy 140 limit.It also took various other measures to make tweeting easier and more expressive for people, and to keep the platform clear of malpractices.Twitter’s focus on improving the live video feature is expected to drive user engagement. The company streamed 830 live events in the last quarter and secured 30 new live partnerships.Moreover, Twitter’s revenues are highly dependent on the international market. In the last reported quarter, the company earned nearly 43.7% of its revenues from international markets. International revenues increased 6% year over year in the third quarter while U.S. revenues decreased 11%.Therefore, the company’s launch of Twitter Lite application on Android devices in 24 countries across Africa, Asia, Europe, the Middle East and Latin America is prudent in our view.However, with such a small user base, Twitter falls way behind other social media services like Facebook (FB  -  Free Report), which has around 2.13 billion MAUs. Given such a huge user base, advertisers are more likely to opt for it as it presents a much larger canvas for them. The social media giant reported its quarterly earnings recently, wherein its Advertising revenues soared 48.1% year over year to $12.78 billion.Though Twitter’s ad engagements continue to grow, it is the cost per ad engagement metric that remains an area of concern. It was down 54% in the third quarter of 2017, given the shift to auto-play video, which has lower cost per view compared to click-to-play.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Twitter’s fourth-quarter revenues is pegged at $690 million while ad revenues are expected to be around $592 million, representing a respective decline of 3.8% and 7.2% from the figures reported in the fourth quarter of 2016.Twitter, Inc.

The slower-than-expected room night growth could hurt this segment. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for this segment’s revenue is currently pegged at $1.9 billion.TrivagoTrivago revenues increased 3% sequentially and 22.5% year over year to $338 million. Its growth is expected to be impacted in the to-be-reported quarter primarily due to weak volumes and lower monetization.

It is expected to perform well in the to-be-reported quarter driven by the ramp up of Egencia's sales force and increased client acquisitions.

283,AMAT,"NCR Corporation (NCR  -  Free Report) is slated to release its fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 8. The question lingering on investors’ minds is whether this consumer transaction technology provider will be able to deliver a positive surprise.Notably, NCR has an impressive earnings surprise history. In the trailing four quarters, the company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate on all the occasions, with an average positive earnings surprise of 8.9%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.What the Zacks Model SaysAccording to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive Earnings ESP. The Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) are best avoided. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.NCR has a Zacks Rank #3 and its Earnings ESP is +2.62%. Therefore, the company is likely to deliver a positive surprise this quarter.What to Expect?The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth quarter earnings is pegged at 86 cents per share. Additionally, analysts polled by Zacks project revenues of roughly $1.74 billion.Factors to ConsiderThe company enriched its product portfolio during the quarter with the launch of a mobile point-of-sale (POS) solution called Ring Up by NCR Silver, whose payment processing is powered by Worldpay. This POS solution is targeted at U.S. based micro businesses. The company also launched a new “end-to-end mobile payment solution” in the month of October.Additionally, the company, in partnership with Samsung Electronics America, launched NCR Silver Quantum, “all-in-one point-of-sale (POS) commerce station featuring an integrated payment device with mobile wallet acceptance capability.”Notably, during the quarter, the company announced that its digital transformation platform will be enriched by “an 800-store chain customer”. Moreover, a prominent supermarket chain in Israel, named Bitan Wines Group, is looking to install NCR FastLane SelfServ Checkouts. Arizona based Tucson Federal Credit has implemented NCR’s Interactive Teller software for the betterment of customer experience at different branch locations.Furthermore, the company is also looking for growth opportunities via expansion of its channel program. Lastly, the company completed divestment of the remaining IPS assets to Turbon Group of Companies. We believe the completion of the transaction is a testament to the fact that NCR is focusing on growth in the software and services sector.However, we remain cautious about the weakness in the ATM business as large customers across North America, India, the Middle East and Africa delayed their spending.NCR Corporation Price and EPS Surprise NCR Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | NCR Corporation QuoteOther Stocks to ConsiderHere are a couple of companies which, per our model, also have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter: NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +6.87% and a Zacks Rank of 2.

Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Pitney Bowes Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Pitney Bowes Inc. QuoteAs for the segments, on a reported basis, Small and Medium Business (“SMB”) Solutions revenues dipped 5% year over year to $ 441.4 million. The tepid performance was due to softness in the North American Mailing business (down 6%). Decline in recurring revenue streams, partially mitigated by solid performance of the new SendPro C-Series product proved to be a drag on the North American Mailing business. In addition, lower equipment sales had an adverse impact on the International Mailing Business.Enterprise Business Solutions (“EBS”) revenues increased 9.9% year over year to $255.9 million. Decent performance form Presort Services (up 8%) and the Enterprise business (up 10%) drove top-line growth of this segment. Higher equipment sales driven by higher print and sorter equipment placements bolstered performance of the production mail business.Digital Commerce Solutionsreported a whopping 86% year-over-year growth in sales to $351.6 million, on the back of strong Global e-commerce (up 169%). Impressive performance in both cross border retail and marketplace volumes along with domestic shipping acted as tailwinds for the Global e-commerce business.Notably, revenues in the Global e-commerce business included revenues from Newgistics. However, soft performance from the Software Solutions business(down 3%)due tolower license and service revenues partially offset top-line growth of this segment.Liquidity and Cash FlowExiting the quarter on Dec 31, 2017, free cash flow was $145.5 million compared with $164.2 million as of Dec 31, 2016.As of Dec 31, 2017, the company’s cash and cash equivalents totaled $1,009 million compared with $764.5 million at the end of Dec 31, 2016.

It expects earnings per share to lie in the range of $1.40-$1.55. Revenues, on a reported basis, are expected to grow in the range of 9-13% year over year.On a positive note, Pitney Bowes believes that new products and digital capabilities of SMB, expansion of the Presort Services network and robust e-commerce volume growth will act as major catalysts, stoking top-line growth for full-year 2018. Moreover, the company’s focus on operational excellence will help it trim costs and expenses, consequently supplementing growth.Our TakePitney Bowes’ concerted efforts to transform its business have started to yield results as is evident from growth across most business lines. The transformation initiatives and introduction of new products have boosted performance. Moreover, the company continues to enhance and optimize new enterprise business platform to boost profitability which bodes well, going forward.Further, the Global Ecommerce business continues to be one of the strongest catalysts of the company. In less than five years, Global Ecommerce has grown from $20 million business to a worth of over $400 million. This apart, Pitney Bowes expects service performance to improve in the second half of the year driven by revenue growth and cost reduction measures.However, continued softness in the mailing business is likely to affect Pitney Bowes’ growth momentum, going forward.

Schrems persistent efforts at safeguarding the privacy rights of European citizens led to the ban of Safe Harbor agreement two years back which then stated that U.S privacy laws were “adequate” to protect the right of the European citizens.Per Reuters, this time around Schrems expects the top court to work in favor of European citizens and also work on making laws sterner, at par with what the Facebook’s U.S. users enjoy.Meanwhile, reportedly, Facebook spokesperson has said thatEurope’s top court must take in to consideration the “extensive evidence demonstrating the robust protections in place under standard contractual clauses and US law, before it makes any decision that may endanger the transfer of data across the Atlantic and around the globe.”The ruling by ECJ can have a tremendous impact on many companies whichtransfer data from Eurpe to U.S on a daily basis.Zacks Rank and Share Price MovementFacebook carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

It provides an intuitive, customer-friendly experience for quick and easy access to data. The collaboration reflects growing demand for Veeva’s solutions among major life sciences and pharmaceutical companies.The life sciences industry has been quite slow in adopting cloud-based software as compared with other industries.

The cost-effectiveness of cloud-based applications over in-premise applications is attracting life science companies.

In the last reported quarter, the company posted adjusted profit of 7 cents per share against a loss of 7 cents per share in the year-ago quarter.Notably, most recently the company announced positive revisions to its third-quarter 2017 guidance.

298,AMAT,"Per Facebook Inc (FB  -  Free Report), about 10 million users have watched the Russian backed ads, allegedly aimed at influencing the 2016 Presidential elections outcome. The revelation was made a few hours after the social media giant furnished extensive details about 3K plus Russian backed ads (not made public yet) on its platform to the Congress.In the blog post, Facebook’s vice president of Policy and Communications, Elliot Schrage stated that these ads were mostly targeted at divisions on grounds of politics and social norms and often touched upon on sensitive topics like immigration and racial issues, gun rights as well as LGBT matters.Schrage also said that nearly 44% of the total ad impressions were before the U.S. election whereas the same spiked to 56% post elections.Also, notably, the company said that there are chances that nearly 25% of the ads were never seen by anyone because the advertising auctions are designed to ""reach people based on relevance.""Facebook, Inc. Price Facebook, Inc. Price | Facebook, Inc. QuoteThe company also added that there could be more such undetected ads. “We’re still looking for abuse and bad actors on our platform — our internal investigation continues. We hope that by cooperating with Congress, the Special Counsel and our industry partners, we will help keep bad actors off our platform” stated Facebook.Nonetheless, Schrage in his blog post has underscored that “We understand more about how our service was abused and we will continue to investigate to learn all we can. We know that our experience is only a small piece of a much larger puzzle. Congress and the Special Counsel are best placed to put these pieces together because they have much broader investigative power to obtain information from other sources.”Facebook is in the eye of the storm ever since it revealed to the Congress that it has identified Russian accounts spending nearly $100,000 in ads (over 3K), which coincided with the U.S. election (from June 2015 to May 2017). This has caused a massive uproar.The recent disclosures are now particularly concerning as it reflects that the Russian meddling continued after the elections as well. With an investment of just $100,000, the alleged Russian factors could reach an audience this huge, adds CNN.However, Schrage added that Facebook is now upping it ante to ward off such incidents in the future. Facebook will employ about 1000 people to review ads. Plus, it will authenticate the background of advertisers and make ad details more transparent.Since the elections, social media companies, especially Facebook and Twitter (TWTR  -  Free Report), have been under fire for dissemination of fake news that allegedly influenced elections. Twitter recently revealed that it had found over 200 accounts related to Russian factors/bot network.These companies are battling extensive PR damage. Moreover, pressure from governments of various countries including France, Germany (which goes into election a few days from now) and Britain to curb the spread of fake ads/news and extremist activities on their platform is mounting.In the past few months, Facebook has been tightening control over what is displayed on its platform by enabling third party verification. Facebook said it will also scrutinize ads that promote bogus stories for monetary gains. The company said that it will work with the entire news industry to improve its fact checking systems. Facebook made the “Trending” feature more automated to minimize human intervention. The company has done away with the need to write description for trending topics that required news curators to do the job. It has also deployed artificial intelligence to tackle terrorism.Zacks Rank and Share Price MovementFacebook carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

299,AMAT,"The U.S. equity market maintained a steady momentum, rebuffing geopolitical threats related to North Korean missile tests and deadly terrorist attacks in the home soil in Las Vegas. As investors reposed their faith in riskier bets like equities, courtesy of strengthening dollar and sell-off in global bond markets, ‘cash cow’ stocks that offer higher returns have been sought after.However, singling out cash-rich stocks alone does not make for a solid investment proposition unless they are backed by attractive efficiency ratios like return on equity (ROE). A high ROE ensures that the company is reinvesting its cash at a high rate of return.ROE: A Key MetricROE = Net Income/Shareholders’ EquityROE helps investors distinguish profit-generating companies from profit burners and is useful in determining the financial health of a company. In other words, this financial metric enables investors to identify stocks that diligently deploy cash for higher returns.Moreover, ROE is often used to compare the profitability of a company with other firms in the industry – the higher, the better. It measures how well a company is multiplying its profits without investing new equity capital and portrays management efficiency in rewarding shareholders with attractive risk-adjusted returns.Screening ParametersIn order to shortlist stocks that are cash rich with high ROE, we have added Cash Flow greater than $1 billion and ROE greater than X-Industry as our primary screening parameters. In addition, we have taken a few other criteria into consideration to arrive at a winning strategy.Price/Cash Flow less than X-Industry: This metric measures how much investors pay for one dollar of free cash flow. A lower ratio indicates that investors need to pay less for a better cash flow generating stock.Return on Assets (ROA) greater than X-Industry: This metric determines how much profit a company earns for every dollar of asset, which includes cash, accounts receivable, property, equipment, inventory and furniture. The higher the ROA, the better it is for the company.5-Year EPS Historical Growth greater than X-Industry: This criterion indicates that continued earnings momentum has translated into solid cash strength.   Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Here are five of the 20 stocks that qualified the screen:Texas Instruments Incorporated (TXN  -  Free Report): Headquartered in Dallas, TX, Texas Instruments is an original equipment manufacturer of analog, mixed signal and digital signal processing integrated circuits.

300,AMAT,"Accenture plc (ACN  -  Free Report) recently unveiled Accenture Cloud Suite for Oracle Corp. (ORCL  -  Free Report) to make cloud-based solutions available through Accenture Oracle Business Group. This alliance will further strengthen the longstanding partnership. However, financial aspects of the deal were not disclosed. The move is part of the company’s strategy for an improved and innovative cloud ecosystem.Accenture’s customers will now be able to manage and access Oracle’s Cloud services using Accenture Cloud Suite, which is highly secure, has dedicated connectivity, high reliability and offers an enhanced end-user experience. With this launch,Accenture will offer solutions that will help to bridge the gap between cloud-to-cloud, cloud-to-on-premises, and cloud-to-custom architectures and solutions.Formed in April2015, Accenture Oracle Business Group has been developed on Oracle’s Public Cloud Platform. It helps enterprises extend software-as-a-service (SaaS), Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) and platform-as-a-service (PaaS) applications as well as migrate from existing on-premise applications to the cloud. The launch of this Cloud Suite will enable users to better manage digital assets on Oracle Public Cloud and help reduce risk.The partnership not only provides a secure connection for Oracle’s business customers but also enables Accenture’s customers to access the services of a major cloud provider. Together, these companies can help global enterprise consumers accelerate their journey to the cloud. Users can benefit from the enhanced performance, favorable cost, reliable security and innovation offered by the partnership.The launch of Accenture Cloud Suite reflects its constant commitment to help clients achieve value through Oracle’s cloud solutions. This will solidify Accenture’s position as the first managed services provider for Oracle’s cloud portfolio and will allow both the companies to compete effectively with local cloud-based software providers.Accenture currently has over 54,000 skilled Oracle consultants worldwide. Moreover, as Oracle is one of the largest providers of cloud-based applications and software, it becomes necessary for Accenture to enhancecapabilities in delivering Oracle-based business solutions.Cloud ProspectsThe overall growth expectation for the public cloud computing services market is very bullish. According to Gartner, the worldwide public cloud services market was projected to grow 18% through 2016 to $246.8 billion in 2017. This figure will increase to $383.3 billion by 2020.Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) is projected to be the highest growth service driven by improvement in platform-as-a-service (PaaS) along with themassive adoption of artificial intelligence (AI), analytics and the Internet of Things (IoT). IaaS is projected to grow from $25.29 billion in 2016 to $71.55 billion in 2020.The exponential growth in the amount of data, complexity of data formats and the need to scale resources at regular intervals compelled several companies to turn to cloud computing vendors. Consequently, considering the growing need for cloud-based applications and software, we expect Accenture’s investments in this space to boost long-term growth.Price Performance Accenture stock has gained 15.6% year to date, outperforming the 13.9% rally of the industry it belongs to.Bottom LineThe company’s long-term prospects look promising, driven by sustained focus on innovative product roll outs, consistent investments in enhancing digital and marketing capabilities, along with major acquisitions.

302,AMAT,"Facebook Inc (FB  -  Free Report) has decided to drop the proposed creation of Class C shares, which could have helped CEO Mark Zuckerberg to hold his sway over the company. Facebook’s sudden plan to discard the creation of Class C shares reportedly comes under tremendous investor pressure.Last year, during its first-quarter 2016 results, Facebook had proposed the creation of publicly listed but non-voting new Class C shares. Facebook, at present, has a double class structure. The Class C shares will have the same economic rights as Class A and Class B shares. Notably, Class B shares have 10 times the voting rights of Class A shares. Class B shares aren’t traded and are held mostly by Facebook executives.The idea behind the creation of this new class of shares was to allow Zuckerberg to have control over the company while continuing his charitable work. In December 2015, following the birth of their first daughter, Zuckerberg had said that he and his wife plan to give 99% of their Facebook shares, valued at $45 billion then, over their entire lifetime, to the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative LLC, a limited liability company for betterment of the society.However, a certain section of investors filed a class action lawsuit against Zuckerberg’s proposal. These investors reportedly argued that the new class structure could potentially cause huge losses for them (running into billions of dollars) if the new Class C shares started trading. The trial was scheduled to begin in a few days at Delaware’s Chancery Court. The case will now probably to be dismissed.In a blog post, Zuckerberg said that, “I shared a proposal announced by Facebook's board of directors to create a new class of Facebook stock. The idea was that it would allow me to keep voting control of Facebook so we can continue to build for the long term, but also allow Priscilla and me to fund the work we're doing through the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative. At the time, I felt that this reclassification was the best way to do both of these things.”He went on to add that in the last 18 months, Facebook’s robust performance has helped the stock to grow “to a point” that he can easily continue his charitable work as well as keep hold of his voting control for the next two decades and therefore a reclassification is not necessary anymore. He added that he was selling nearly 35 to 75 million shares over the next one and a half years for philanthropic purposes.Facebook is under fire ever since the disclosure that Russians used the platform to meddle with the 2016 Presidential elections. Facebook is now furnishing details of nearly 3K ads to congressional investigators. Zuckerberg in a Live video broadcast also said that to create transparency for political ads on its platform, it will now make it mandatory for advertisers to disclose their identities.Not just this, arecent revelation by ProPublica also put Facebook in a tough spot. Per ProPublica, Facebook helped advertises target anti-Jew groups. An algorithm error rather than a human error was the cause added ProPublica. Post this revelation, Facebook said that it has removed the fields in question.After facing fire, Facebook has taken proactive measures to fight bogus ads on its platform. In his live broadcast on Sep 21, 2017, Zuckerberg added that the company will also hire additional 250 election integrity employees and partners with election commissions across the globe. Facebook will now increase the information shared with other tech companies as well cyber security specialists to ensure safety and security on the platform.Facebook’s proactive measures look good. Such measures are the need of the hour as Facebook’s top line mostly comprises ad revenues. Last year, Facebook generated over $27.6 billion in revenues with ad revenues of $26.9 billion.Zacks Rank and Share Price MovementFacebook carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Notably, the company has outperformed the industry in the past year.

304,AMAT,"Apple Inc (AAPL  -  Free Report) has acknowledged that its latest Apple Watch OS 3 Series has issues with cellular connectivity and assured that its engineers are working on the problem and the fix will be “soon” available with the future software release. Shares were down over 1.6% yesterday.Apple’s comments came after several prominent reviewers lambasted the Watch for its repeated failure to connect to LTE. Apple had touted the built-in cellular as the USP of the Watch.Lauren Goode of The Verge said that she persistently faced troubles connecting to cellular network. After having her first review unit replaced by a second unit by Apple, the problems remained. The “untethered” experience was intermittent. Plus, Watch seemed to connect to random wi-fi signals. Plus, Siri didn’t work smoothly. She was able to make calls manually via Watch but the battery drain was quick.Apple Inc. Price Apple Inc. Price | Apple Inc. QuoteApple addressed these problems by saying, “that when Apple Watch Series 3 joins unauthenticated Wi-Fi networks without connectivity, it may at times prevent the watch from using cellular. We are investigating a fix for a future software release.”The Wall Street Journal also pointed out similar problems with connection and a quick draining battery.Though New York Times’ Brian Chen was relatively more positive about the Watch, he was perturbed by the fact that people will have to shell $10 for cellular connection even after paying $399 for the Watch. TechCrunch analyst echoed similar sentiments and said that though the Watch was good but given the issues with LTE connectivity now, it is but obvious there will be “serious deliberation” as far as buying is concerned as there will another $10 required to pay for cellular connection. .Apple Watch OS 3 was said to be the “ultimate expression of Apple Watch” by the company’s chief financial officer, Jeff Williams. Powered by a new dual core processor, which is 70% faster than its predecessor, users can call, text as well as access GPS and third party applications like WeChat. Also, with integrated cellular and Apple Music, 40 million songs are available for streaming on your wrist, added Williams.Apple Watch was launched in April 2015. Since then, the company has already become one of the leading players in the wearables market. Apple Watch sales were up 50% in the third quarter of fiscal 2017. Though a small fraction of the top line currently, Watch indicates Apple’s efforts to reduce dependence on iPhone. IPhone revenues constitute the major chunk of Apple’s revenues.Apple began taking pre orders (watch with cellular) from Sep 15 and the device will be available from Sep 22 in nine countries including the United States, United Kingdom, Japan, and Switzerland in partnership with 14 carriers initially.The watch which costs $399 will be available in a variety of colors namely gold, aluminum, silver and space grey.

305,AMAT,"At times, it is prudent to hold on to certain stocks that have enough potential but are weighed down by tough market conditions.Check Point Software Technologies Ltd. (CHKP  -  Free Report) seems to be one such stock, which investors should hold on to if they are looking to reap long-term benefits. Though the stock is facing a few headwinds at the moment, these are transitory in nature. There is enough scope for this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company to rebound in the long run.In fact, Check Pointstock has gained 46.3% in the last one year, outperforming the industry’s rally of 14.9%.Factors In Favor of Check PointWe believe that Check Point Software will continue to benefit from strong demand for cybersecurity solutions. Notably, the financial well-being, brand image and reputation of enterprises and governments are always exposed to the risk of cyber threats. Consequently, cybersecurity has become a mission-critical, high-profile requirement.With rapid technological advancement, organizations are increasingly adopting the “bring your own device” (BYOD) policy to enhance employee productivity with anytime/anywhere access. This trend, in turn, calls for stricter data security measures.Per IDC’s new report, corporate spending on threat intelligence security services will reach $1.4 billion in 2018 from an estimated $905.5 million in 2014. Another research firm, MarketsandMarkets, projected that the global threat intelligence security market will touch approximately $5.86 billion by 2020 from $3.0 billion in 2015, representing a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 14.3%. These predictions bode well for Check Point.Furthermore, the rapid adoption of Check Point’s data center appliances and the continuous enhancements in data center product lines are expected to provide adequate support to revenue growth. The company’s focus on enhancing mobile capabilities will enable it to tap greater larger opportunities. Moreover, the company’s strategy of growing through acquisitions is praiseworthy.Additionally, its continuous share buybacks bode well for investors. The company has an expected EPS growth rate of 9.8%. Notably, the stock has delivered positive earnings surprises in the trailing four quarters with an average beat of 6.6%.Risks PersistCheck Point faces competition from numerous big and small companies in the security application market. As Internet threats and attacks increase, stiff competition will follow suit. Moreover, we believe that its dominance could be challenged by new entrants.Further, changing customer spending behavior, an uncertain economic environment and currency fluctuations add to the woes.Our TakeWe expect the aforementioned factors to help the company sustain strong momentum and stay afloat amid difficult times. Consequently, we suggest that investors hold on to the stock for the time being.Zacks Rank & Key PicksCurrently, Check Point carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks worth considering are Applied Materials, Inc.

309,AMAT,"Qorvo, Inc. (QRVO  -  Free Report) recently announced its intent to initiate a workforce downsizing with a view to improve its cost structure. Triad Business Journal quoted Qorvo representative, Brent Dietz, who stated that the company’s Greensboro operations will be impacted by this decision. However, the extent of the impact has not yet been specified.Additionally, Qorvo also mentioned that as a step toward expanding its presence in the defense market, the company has partnered with Veterans Trading Company (VTC), an end-to-end supply chain service provider that serves the government contract community.Management expects this channel partnership to optimize efficiency of operations related to Qorvo’s government customers.Notably, the almost concurrent announcements of downsizing and expanding via partnership reflect the company’s strategic initiatives toward improving overall growth. We believe these steps will definitely provide the company’s shares a considerable momentum in the near term.Shares of Qorvo have gained 41% on a year-to-date basis, outperforming the industry’s rally of 38.3%.Infrastructure and Defense - A Key CatalystInfrastructure and Defense (IDP) is a key catalyst for Qorvo. Segment revenues grew 22% year over year to $184 million in the last quarter, driven by improving demand from high-growth markets. The company noted that customer demand for high-powered Bulk Acoustic Wave (BAW) for the 3.5 gigahertz band for 5G massive Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) antennas remained strong in the reported quarter.The defense business was strong in the quarter as reflected in the 25% surge in GaN and BAW revenues. Multiyear defense contracts supporting programs like F-15, 16 and F-35 also aided growth. Revenues from the largest defense customer more than doubled on a year-over-year basis. In such a scenario, the partnership with VTC seems to be perfectly timed and is anticipated to boost revenue generation from the defense segment going ahead.Qorvo, Inc. Revenue (TTM) Qorvo, Inc.

310,AMAT,"Investors may consider allocating their assets in stocks with favorable liquidity positions for big returns. Liquidity indicates a company’s capability of meeting debt obligations by converting assets into liquid cash and equivalents.However, one should exercise caution before investing in such stocks. While a high liquidity level may imply that the company is meeting its obligations at a faster rate compared to peers, it may also indicate that the company is failing to use its assets efficiently.Hence, one may consider the efficiency level of a company in addition to its liquidity to identify potential winners.Measures to Identify Liquid StocksLiquidity ratios like Current Ratio, Quick Ratio and Cash Ratio are primarily used to identify companies with strong liquidity.Current Ratio: It measures current assets relative to current liabilities. This ratio is used for measuring a company’s potential to meet both short- and long-term debt obligations. Thus, a current ratio – also known as working capital ratio – below 1 indicates that the company has more liabilities than assets. However, a high current ratio does not always indicate that the company is in good financial shape. It may also mean that the company has failed to utilize its assets significantly. Hence, a range of 1 to 3 is considered ideal.Quick Ratio: Unlike current ratio, quick ratio – also called “acid-test ratio"" or ""quick assets ratio"" – indicates a company’s ability to pay short-term obligations. It considers inventory excluding current assets relative to current liabilities. Like the current ratio, a quick ratio of greater than 1 is desirable.Cash Ratio: This is the most conservative ratio among the three, as it takes into account only cash and cash equivalents, and invested funds relative to current liabilities. It measures a company’s ability to meet its current debt obligations using the most liquid of assets. Though a cash ratio higher than 1 may point to sound financials, a high number may indicate inefficiency in using the cash.So, a ratio of greater than 1 is desirable at all times but may not always underline a company’s financial health.Screening ParametersIn order to pick the best of the lot, we have added asset utilization, which is a widely used measure of a company’s efficiency, as one of the screening criteria. Asset utilization is a ratio of total sales over the past 12 months to the last four-quarter average of total assets. Though this ratio varies across industries, companies with a ratio higher than their respective industries can be considered efficient.In order to ensure that these liquid and efficient stocks have solid growth potential, we have added our proprietary Growth Style Score to the screen.Current Ratio, Quick Ratio and Cash Ratio between 1 and 3 (While liquidity ratios of greater than 1 are desirable, significantly high ratios may indicate inefficiency.)Asset utilization greater than industry average (Higher asset utilization than the industry average indicates a company’s efficiency.)Zacks Rank equal to #1 (Only Strong Buy-rated stocks can get through.

The figure also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 5 cents per share.Revenues increased 33.8% year over year to $1.480 billion and exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.407 billion. However, sequentially revenues were down 9.9%.The year-over-year increase was primarily driven by robust performance of the company’s product portfolio comprising Ryzen CPU, EPYC and Radeon Vega GPUs.SegmentsAdvanced Micro has two reportable segments — Computing and Graphics (focused on the traditional PC market) and Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom (focusing on adjacent high-growth opportunities).Computing and GraphicsComputing and Graphics segment revenues witnessed year-over-year increase of 60% to $958 million. Growth can be attributed to accelerated sales of Radeon graphics and Ryzen desktop processors.Operating income for this segment was $85 million against a loss of $21 million in fourth-quarter 2016, primarily driven by higher revenues.Client computing revenues recorded strong double-digit growth from the year-ago quarter driven by solid demand for the expanded Ryzen processor family in the desktop market during the holiday season.During the quarter, the company launched Ryzen mobile processors with Radeon Vega graphics. Notably, the company’s Ryzen PRO-based offerings have already been adopted by prominent commercial PC providers including Dell, Lenovo, Acer and HP. The availability of Ryzen Threadripper processors has enabled AMD to re-enter the high-end desktop market.The company delivered robust growth in graphics during the quarter driven by strength across its graphics product portfolio. The company’s release of Vega-based GPUs and increasing demand for its Polaris products in both gaming and blockchain industries led to improved revenues. Launched during the quarter, Radeon RX Vega family of GPUs aimed at gaming enthusiasts has performed better than previous Radeon GPUs.Adding to the positives, Apple recently launched the new iMac Pro, powered by AMD’s Radeon Pro Vega product.Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-CustomSegment revenues amounted to $522 million, up 3% year over year but down 37% sequentially. Lack of a $31 million licensing gain in fourth quarter last year and higher costs (research & development expenses) brought down operating income for the segment from $47 million to $19 million for the quarter.The sequential decrease in revenues was primarily due to seasonally lower semi-custom SoC revenue. However, higher server revenues drove year-over-year growth.The ramping up of EPYC datacenter processors sale to cloud and OEM customers has bolstered server revenues. Management remains optimistic about this product with companies like Tencent and JD.com planning to deploy the company’s EPYC processors. Baidu and Microsoft also announced plans of deploying EPYC based products in their hyperscale environment, which is another positive for AMD.The company achieved record Graphics Processor Units (GPUs) revenues on the back of improved average selling price (ASP) and higher unit shipments compared with the year-ago quarter.Additionally, AMD started the shipment of AMD EPYC processor-powered HPE ProLiant DL385 Gen10 server to the high-end content creation market during the quarter.Notably, the company entered into a partnership with Baidu during the quarter to deploy AMD EPYC single-socket platformsin Baidu datacenters.The company is working with Qualcomm to integrate its Snapdragon LTE modem solution in Ryzen mobile processors. The partnership will help AMD address the needs of high performance consumers as well as enterprise notebook platforms.MarginsGross margin increased 300 basis points (bps) to 35% year over year backed by a proper product mix in the Computing and Graphics segment and IP-related revenues. Management noted that ramping up of high performance products will continue to have a positive impact on margins.Non-GAAP operating margin during the quarter came in at 6.9% compared with 2.4% reported in the year-ago quarter. The year-over-year expansion was primarily owing to higher operating income from the Computing and Graphics segment driven by higher revenue.Adjusted EBITDA amounted to $142 million compared with $60 million in the year-ago quarter.Balance Sheet & Cash FlowAMD ended the fourth quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $1.185 billion compared with $879 million in the previous quarter. Total debt (including current portion) amounted to $1.395 billion. Free cash flow was $339 million.Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.

315,AMAT,"Koninklijke Philips N.V. (PHG  -  Free Report) reported decent fourth-quarter 2017 results, driven by robust sales growth, particularly in Personal Health and Diagnosis & Treatment businesses.The Dutch electronics giant posted fourth-quarter net income of €899 million ($1,058.8 million), an increase of 40.5% compared with the prior-year quarter’s figure of €640 million. The bottom line benefited from lower financial expenses, despite negligible sales growth.The company’s net income in the fourth quarter included net income related to Philips Lighting’s business, all of which is reported in discontinued operations.Inside the HeadlinesTotal revenues in the quarter came in at €5,303 million ($6,245.9 million), relatively flat (down 0.1%) from the year-ago tally. The year-over-year decline can primarily be attributed to fall in sales of Connected Care & Health Informatics businesses and HealthTech Other segment. This was partially mitigated by impressive performances from Personal Health and Diagnosis & Treatment businesses. The company, however, registered a 5% comparable year-over-year sales growth.For full-year 2017, the company recorded sales of €17,780 million ($20,941.3 million), advanced 2.1% from the year-ago tally.Koninklijke Philips N.V. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Koninklijke Philips N.V. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Koninklijke Philips N.V. QuotePhilips’ adjusted earnings before interest, taxes and amortization (EBITA) — the company’s preferred measure of operational performance — increased 9% year over year to €884 million ($1,041.2 million) benefiting from higher volumes, procurement savings and other cost productivity.Meanwhile, net cash flow generated from operating activities came in at €1,202 million ($1,415.7 million) compared with net cash flow of €758 million in the prior-year quarter. The company’s comparable order intake rose 7% year over year, driven by strong growth in Diagnosis & Treatment businesses.Segmental RevenuesIn the fourth quarter, Personal Health sales increased 0.7% year over year to €2,181 million ($2,568.7 million). This segment reported growth of 1% in nominal sales and hike of 6% in comparable sales. The upside in comparable sales was driven by high-single digit growth in Health & Wellness as well as Sleep & Respiratory Care, while Domestic Appliances and Personal Care recorded growth in mid-single digit. On a geographic basis, double-digit growth in Asia Pacific and India, high-single digit growth in Central & Eastern Europe and China, bolstered revenues in the quarter.Diagnosis & Treatmentrevenues rose 3% in the quarter to €2,092 million ($2,463.9 million). While nominal sales reported growth of 3%, comparable sales grew 6% for the quarter. High-single digit growth in Ultrasound and mid-single digit growth in Image-Guided Therapy and Diagnostic Imaging drove this segment’s sales. On a geographic basis, double-digit growth in China, Middle East and Turkey as well as high-single digit growth in North America acted as catalysts.Connected Care & Health Informaticsrevenues were down 4.5% in the quarter to €912 million ($1,074.2 million). On a nominal basis, segmental revenues declined 5% year over year, while comparable sales grew 2% for the quarter. Comparable sales growth was primarily driven by high-single digit growth in Healthcare Informatics as well as low-single-digit growth in Patient Care & Monitoring Solutions.On a geographic basis, while mid-single digit growth was posted mature geographies, mid-single-digit decline was witnessed in growth geographies. Double-digit growth in India and high-single digit growth in North America proved conducive to sales, which was somewhat offset by double-digit decline in Middle East & Turkey and Africa.Revenues in the HealthTech & Other segment continued to show weakness, shrinking 22.2% to €119 million ($140.1 million). The decline in this segment can mainly be attributed to lower royalty income during the quarter.Since the third quarter of 2017, Philips has been reporting results of Philips Lighting under discontinued operations.Liquidity & Share RepurchaseExiting the quarter on Dec 31, 2017, Philips’ cash and cash equivalents declined to €1,939 million ($2,322.7 million) from €2,334 million a year back. The company’s long-term debt rose to €4,044 million ($4,844.3 million) compared with €4,021 million a year ago.Diligent Cost-Savings ProgramsPhilips has been gaining significantly from its DfX program, along with other productivity and savings programs. These programs have been designed to maximize the value potential of the company, while accelerating growth by leveraging on innovation and operational execution.During the reported quarter, the company achieved procurement savings of €81 million, driven by the DfX program, while other productivity programs also resulted in a savings of €52 million. Overall, the company generated an impressive annual savings of €483 million, higher than the targeted savings of €400 million.Notable Developments During the QuarterDuring the reported quarter, Philips announced the acquisition of VitalHealth that would complement Philips Wellcentive’s solution including health informatics and patient engagement programs. VitalHealth is a leading supplier of cloud-based population health management solutions for the delivery of personalized care outside the hospitals.Moreover, the company obtained the 510(k) clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for marketing its new eL18-4 transducer for ‘small parts’ assessment. The company is anticipated to launch the newest solution at the 16th World Federation for Ultrasound in Medicine and Biology Congress in Taipei.Update on Lighting DealAt the end of fourth-quarter 2017, Philips held 29.01% of the issued share capital of Philips Lighting shares. Philips aims to sell the business completely over the next few years.GuidanceBased on the present market scenario and combining with the company’s strong order book, Philips projects full-year sales growth of 4-6%. The company also anticipates its Adjusted EBITA margin to improve around 100 basis points this year.Our TakeIn the past couple of years, Philips has successfully morphed from a lighting company into a healthcare technology provider. Further, the company's transformation from a hardware-oriented to a software-driven business, with a higher-margin and recurring-revenue model is impressive. The company also believes that increased spending on healthcare and fitness will act as a long-term growth driver, going forward.Moreover, the company remains optimistic about the prospects of its Diagnosis & Treatment vertical on account of positive industry trends as Image-Guided Therapy and Ultrasound equipment sales are acting as major profit churners. Further, the company’s ardent lookout for strategic acquisitions has enabled it to strengthen core business. This apart, the company is strongly benefiting from three of its comprehensive performance improvement and change-initiative programs — namely Accelerate, End2End productivity, and Design for Excellence — implemented earlier, consequently acting as a key driver of growth.Philips currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Other Stocks to Consider Some other stocks worth considering in the same space include Aspen Technology, Inc.

318,AMAT,"Microsoft Corp.’s (MSFT  -  Free Report) cloud computing service — Azure — has been the major catalyst in recent times. We note that strong Office 365 and Windows 10 adoption are other growth drivers. The company is set to report second-quarter 2018 results on Jan 31.Click here to know how the company’s overall Q2 performance is expected to be.Microsoft Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Microsoft Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Microsoft Corporation QuoteSegments to Aid Microsoft’s GrowthMicrosoft operates under three primary business segments: Productivity & Business Processes, Intelligent Cloud, and More Personal Computing.The Productivity & Business Processes unit includes the company’s Office, Office 365, LinkedIn, and Dynamics CRM businesses. Last quarter, revenues from this segment jumped 28% (up 28% at cc) on a year-over-year basis to $8.24 billion.We note that strong Office 365 is another catalyst. The launch of a plethora of products — Microsoft Teams in Office 365 for Education, Microsoft 365, Microsoft Relationship Sales solution and ISV Cloud Embed — is expected to drive installed base.Productivity and Business Processes revenues are expected between $8.75 billion and $8.95 billion in the to-be-reported quarter. Office 365 commercial growth will continue to outpace the transactional decline. Management expects a more moderate rate of growth in Office consumer business. Dynamics revenue is anticipated to grow double digit, driven by the ongoing shift to Dynamics 365. LinkedIn revenues are projected to be $1.2 billion.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues for the Productivity and Business Processes segment is currently pegged at $8.877 billion, up 20.3% year over year.Microsoft’s Intelligent Cloud unit contains its server and enterprise products, including Azure. The segment reported revenues of $6.92 billion, up 13.5% (13% at cc) year over year. Microsoft noted that Azure premium revenues grew triple digits for the 13th consecutive quarter.Adoption remains strong as evident from the growing customer base. Azure has been selected by the likes of Costco, Symantec, Bank of America Corporation, TD Bank and Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation.Data center expansion continues with Azure now in 42 regions globally, more than any other cloud provider. Microsoft’s acquisition of Avere Systems, a start-up specializing in data storage systems, will help strengthen and increase the utilization of its Azure public cloud. The company’s cloud services are a major contributor to its revenue stream. Per the company’s first-quarter fiscal 2018 results, server product and cloud services revenues went up 17% year over year, with Azure revenues soaring 89%.We believe that robust adoption of Azure will continue to drive Microsoft’s top-line in the soon-to-be reported quarter.Microsoft is also gaining from its increasing traction in blockchain technology. Its collaboration with Bank Hapoalim for the use of blockchain technology for digital bank guarantees is aiding Azure to penetrate the cloud market.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues for the Intelligent Cloud segment is currently pegged at $7.501 billion, up 9.3% year.The More Personal Computing segment includes Windows, Gaming, Devices, and Search businesses. Revenues were almost flat year over year at $9.38 billion. Excluding phone business, revenues grew 3% (same at cc). Windows 10 Commercial monthly active devices grew 90% year over year.Microsoft continues to add features to Windows 10 that makes it more attractive for consumers as well as enterprises.Over the past several years, global demand for personal computers and related software has plummeted. This put Microsoft in a tricky situation; the company known for its innovative Windows operating system now needed to rebrand itself as a tech leader that could adapt to the times.In many ways, Microsoft has done just that. For one, the company moved to a “freemium” model with Windows 10, offering the new OS as a free upgrade and focusing on the monetization of compatible apps and services.Recently, the company released updates for Windows to prevent malware attacks from exploiting Meltdown Vulnerability in Intel x86-64 processors. This software update is part of a series of updates that will shield against the newly discovered processor bug in Intel, AMD and ARM chipsets.Microsoft is also one of the largest providers of gaming hardware. The Xbox One X has a wide adoption rate as evident from its early sales figures. It has been outperforming Sony’s PS4 Pro by a significant margin. Moreover, high product adoption rates as well as robust performance from its surface line of devices are driving the top line.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues for the More Personal Computing segment is currently pegged at $12.01 billion, up 1.6% year.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderMicrosoft carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector include Applied Materials, Inc.

319,AMAT,"By their very nature, growth investors are primarily focused on finding companies whose earnings and revenue are expected grow at a rate that outpaces the market. This investment strategy comes with its fair share of risks, but it also brings the exciting possibility of outsized returns—an end goal that every investor desires.Over the past several years, Wall Street’s most exciting growth stocks have emerged from the technology sector. From industry innovators like Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) and Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report) to exciting foreign stocks such as Alibaba (BABA  -  Free Report), tech-focused growth investors have been rewarded with massive profits recently.Strong earnings and impressive sales imply that the technology sector’s hot streak could continue throughout 2018—despite recent market-wide volatility. That means that growth investors searching for the next great market-beating stock might want to keep their focus on tech companies.Luckily, we can pair the proven Zacks Rank with our innovative Style Scores system, which includes a “Growth” category, to find strong growth tech stocks. Investors should note that our Growth category values earnings and sales growth, as well as improvements to a company’s financial statements—including strong cash flows and great return on equity.With all of this said, check out these three tech stocks for growth investors to consider now:1. AppFolio, Inc. (APPF  -  Free Report)AppFolio offers cloud-based software solutions for the property management and legal industries.

This fiscal year, current estimates are calling for earnings growth of 66% and net sales growth of 27%. The company is also improving its cash position, generating quadruple-digit cash flow growth and operating with a net margin of nearly 9%.The firm has also proven to be an efficient one, with Return on Equity of 16% crushing its industry average. AppFolio should be able to use this, and its solid margins, to capitalize on its new business opportunities. APPF has also displayed the strength of small caps recently, adding about 32% over the past two months. 2. Twitter, Inc. (TWTR  -  Free Report)Twitter operates one of the world’s most popular social media websites, but thanks to a number of new initiatives—including a shift to live, original content and a renewed focus on profitability—the stock is now popping up on our growth screens.

The company is also witnessing cash flow growth of more than 95% currently.Meanwhile, Twitter has a number of new partnerships—with many notable media companies and sports organizations—that it should be able to leverage in an internet industry that has increasingly rewarded original content. 3. eGain Corporation (EGAN  -  Free Report)eGain provides web customer interaction, social customer interaction, and contact center applications.

320,AMAT,"Voxeljet AG (VJET  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Mar 29.The company has a dismal earnings surprise history, having missed estimates in the trailing four quarters, recording an average negative surprise of 42.2%. The company reported a negative earnings surprise of 50% in the last reported quarter.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayOver the past few quarters, Voxeljet has been suffering from a decline in order backlog on account of delayed customer adoption rates. For instance, the company’s total backlogs dropped 41% in third-quarter 2017, compared with its level at the end of 2016. Further, depressed oil prices, which have caused investment deferrals by clients, affected the company’s oil and gas extraction equipment business in the recent past. Moreover, of late, some of the company’s key customers have encountered supply chain redesign issues which may further delay investments, going forward.The company has also been experiencing a rise in operating expenses due to higher expenses for the preparation of several financing activities, higher personnel expenses and higher expenses for materials related to various projects. These factors could be a drag on margins and is likely to put pressure on the overall bottom-line performance in the upcoming quarter as well.On the positive side, revenues from the company’s System segment (including sales of 3D printers) showed signs of improvement in third-quarter 2017, the 3D printing industry is yet to fully stabilize. Notably, for the first nine months of 2017, the company’s System segment’s (including sales of 3D printers) revenues declined 8.9% to €8.4 million from €9.1 million in the year-ago period. These apart, other headwinds, including economic slowdown, inflation, currency fluctuations and commodity prices vagaries, have also marred the performance of most players in the industry. We expect Voxeljet’s fourth-quarter 2017 results to be adversely affected by these factors.However, increase in the demand of 3D printing equipment in the United States and higher demand for products in China are positives. Impressive market traction of Phenolic Direct Binding process is anticipated to be one of the major catalysts for the quarter. Additionally, the company’s large-scale service centers worldwide, including the subsidiaries in China and India are expected to prove conductive for the fourth quarter and beyond.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show an earnings beat for Voxeljet this time around. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP for the company is -21.74% as the Most Accurate estimate of a loss of 14 cents is pegged lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 12 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.voxeljet AG Price and EPS Surprise voxeljet AG Price and EPS Surprise | voxeljet AG QuoteZacks Rank: Voxeljet has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). This, combined with the company’s negative ESP, makes surprise prediction difficult.Notably, we caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some companies that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Mellanox Technologies, Ltd. (MLNX  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +7.06% and a Zacks Rank #1. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Applied Materials, Inc.

321,AMAT,"Shares of Lam Research (LRCX  -  Free Report) surged over 3% on Wednesday as part of a run that has seen the company’s stock price climb nearly 19% in the last 12 weeks alone. The wafer fabrication equipment company has consistently impressed shareholders over the last year, so let’s take a look at why Lam looks poised to continue its current run of success.Recent NewsLam manufactures products that are essential to the semiconductor industry and help fuel the information age. The company recently highlighted some of the biggest factors that are set to contribute to its growth at its 2018 investors meeting.Lam noted that 67 zettabytes—equal to 67 trillion gigabytes—of data will be generated by 2020. “We are literally just scratching the surface of what is possible in the world of data,” Lam CEO Martin Anstice said at the conference. “We believe that the fundamental future of Lam Research is inextricably linked to the rising importance of a data economy.”Lam also recently unveiled a plan to return at least 50% of free cash flow to stockholders over the next five years. Starting in the June quarter, Lam will also increase its quarterly dividend by 120% to $1.10 per share.On top of those initiatives, Lam announced an additional $2 billion share repurchase program, which brings its total authorization to $4 billion since Nov. 2017. The Fremont, California-based company hopes to execute this plan over the next 12 to 18 months.Growth Fundamentals Lam is expected to see its current-quarter earnings skyrocket by nearly 56% to $4.36 per share, based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimates. The tech firm is also expected to see its quarterly revenues surge over 32% to reach $2.85 billion.The company’s full-year earnings are expected to skyrocket by nearly 68% to reach $16.74 per share, while Lam’s full-year sales are projected to jump by 35% to hit $10.85 billion.Looking even further down the road, Lam is expected to see its EPS figure expand at an annualized rate of 14.9% over the next three to five years.Investors will also be happy to note that the company has experienced a slew of estimate revisions recently, with 100% agreement to the upside for both its current quarter and full year.Solid ValueShares of Lam have skyrocketed over 76% in the last year and surged 13% in the last month, yet its stock price currently rests below its 52-week high. Despite this climb, Lam is also currently trading at 13.1x forward earnings, which falls slightly below the “Semiconductor Equipment - Wafer Fabrication” industry’s average P/E of 13.5.  Lam has also consistently traded at a discount to its larger peer group, which includes Applied Material (AMAT  -  Free Report), during this same time frame.Bottom Line Lam is currently a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and sports a “B” grade for Value in our Style Scores system. The company is also projected to grow both its top and bottom lines at sizable rates this year. Meanwhile, the stock looks undervalued at its current level, leaving plenty of room for profits.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers.

322,AMAT,"Applied Materials, Inc. (AMAT  -  Free Report) is currently one of the top-performing stocks in the technology sector, and an increase in share price and strong fundamentals signal it’s bull run. Therefore, if you haven’t taken advantage of the share price appreciation yet, it’s time you add the stock to your portfolio.The company has performed extremely well this year and has potential to carry on the momentum in the near term.Why an Attractive Pick?Share Price Appreciation: A glimpse of the company’s price trend shows that the stock had an impressive run on the bourses over the last year. Applied has returned 53.5%, comparing favorably with the S&P 500’s market gain of 15.9%. Solid Rank & VGM Score: Applied sports a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and has a VGM Score of B. Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 offer the best investment opportunities. Thus, the company appears to be a compelling investment proposition at the moment.Northward Estimate Revisions: Seven estimates for the current year have moved north over the past 60 days against one southward revision, reflecting analysts’ confidence in the stock. Over the same period, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 8%. Also, for fiscal 2019, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has inched up 5% over the same time frame to $4.55.Positive Earnings Surprise History: Applied has an impressive earnings surprise history. The company outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 4.76%.Strong Growth Prospects: The company’s Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2018 earnings of $4.39 reflects year-over-year growth of 35.1%. Moreover, earnings are expected to register 3.6% growth in fiscal 2019. The stock has a long term expected earnings per share growth rate of 12%.Growth Drivers: Applied continues to witness technological advancements in semiconductor and display areas. The rising demand for semiconductors and displays aided by the emergence of Internet of Things (IoT), big data and artificial intelligence, cloud infrastructure, virtual reality and smart vehicles, is a tailwind.Further, the company is well positioned for NAND supply that is required for the growing data storage market. Applied Materials’ market share has gained significantly with its strength in 3D NAND, DRAM and patterning. Management expects increasing DRAM and logic spending in 2018. It is significantly improving its memory market share as well.In the most recent quarter, Applied Materials witnessed adjusted earnings of $1.06 per share, up 59% from the year-ago period. Total quarterly revenues came in at $4.2 billion, improving more than 28% year over year. Also, the company provided an improving outlook. Management expects robust double-digit growth in semiconductor, display and service businesses in 2018. It expects wafer fab equipment (WFE) market’s combined spending in 2018 and 2019 to reach around $100 billion.We believe that Applied Materials is in a great position to grow sustainably and profitably based on its strong pipeline of enabling technologies, supported by expanding opportunities on the semiconductor, service and display fronts.Applied Materials, Inc.

324,AMAT,"Oracle Corporation (ORCL  -  Free Report) delivered modest third-quarter fiscal 2018 results. Non-GAAP earnings of 83 cents per share comfortably beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 72 cents. However, revenues of $9.776 billion came almost in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate figure of $9.771 billion.Earnings increased 20.3% from the year-ago quarter. This can primarily be attributed to 6% (2% in constant currency) growth in revenues that was higher than management’s guidance of 2-4%.Oracle’s top-line growth benefited from the ongoing cloud-based momentum. Total cloud revenues (16% of total revenue compared with 13% in the year-ago quarter) advanced 32% (29% in constant currency) to $1.57 billion.Moreover, total cloud and on-premise software revenues increased 8% (4% in constant currency) to $7.98 billion. We believe that the company’s growing cloud market share will continue to drive top-line growth in the foreseeable future.Shares Decline on Soft OutlookShares were down 7.2% in after-hour trading following the results. In the past year, the company’s shares have gained just 15.8%, underperforming the industry’s growth of 37.9%.The decline stemmed from the soft cloud outlook. Cloud revenues including Software as a service (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) are expected to grow between 19% and 23% (17-21% in constant currency), much lower than 32% (29% in constant currency)  reported in the last quarter.Cloud Drove Solid Top LineCloud SaaS revenues advanced a significant 33% (31% in constant currency) year over year to $1.151 billion. Cloud PaaS and IaaS revenues surged 28% (24% in constant currency) to $415 million.On-premise software revenues (66% of total revenues compared with 67% in the year-ago quarter) increased 4% (flat at constant currency) to $6.4 billion reflecting continued higher attachment rates of software support and renewal rates.Management stated that Fusion ERP and Fusion HCM soared 65%. Further, the next-generation autonomous database launched by Oracle, which is supported by machine learning, is now fully available and is a key catalyst for the company. Management believes that the new database will improve Oracle’s competitive position in the cloud against Amazon Web Services (“AWS”).Software license updates and product support revenues were almost $5.027 billion, up 6% (1% in constant currency). On a combined basis, on-premise support and SaaS revenues were up 8%.Total hardware revenues slipped 3% (down 7% at constant currency) year over year to $994 million. Services revenues decreased 2% (6% at constant currency) to $796 million.Operating DetailsCloud Software as a service margin came in at 67% as compared with 65% reported in the year-ago quarter. Cloud PaaS and IaaS margin came in at 35% as compared with 46% reported in the year-ago quarter.Non-GAAP operating expenses, as percentage of revenues, decreased 140 basis points (bps) to 56.1%. The decline was due to lower hardware, Software license updates and product support and research & development expenses, which were down 10%, 17% and 2%, respectively.As a result, non-GAAP operating margin expanded 100 bps from the year-ago quarter to 44%.Balance Sheet & Cash FlowAs of Feb 28, 2018, Oracle had cash & cash equivalents and marketable securities of $70.45 billion, down from $71.58 billion sequentially.

325,AMAT,"Investors in Applied Materials, Inc. (AMAT  -  Free Report) need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Mar 23, 2018 $40.00 Put had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Applied Materials shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Applied Materials is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) in the Semiconductor Equipment - Wafer Fabrication industry that ranks in the Top 2% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, seven analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while none have dropped their estimates. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from $1.00 per share to $1.13 in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Applied Materials right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options? Each week, our very own Dave Bartosiak gives his top options trades.

329,AMAT,"Texas Instruments (TXN  -  Free Report) or TI recently announced a hike in dividend along with a share repurchase program. This time, the company plans to raise the quarterly dividend by 12 cents to 62 cents per share. This translates into a 24% increase from the prior dividend of 50 cents. The new dividend will be paid on Nov 13, 2017, to stockholders of record as of Oct 31, contingent upon a formal declaration by the board of directors at its regular meeting in October.    Moreover, Texas Instruments approved a share repurchase program worth $6.0 billion, in addition to approximately $4.8 billion already available. TI’s Cash position TI’s strong balance sheet and cash flows provide financial flexibility for further dividend, share repurchases and strategic acquisitions.  Cash and cash equivalents were $3.0 billion at the end of second-quarter 2017. TI exited the quarter with $3.1 billion in long-term debt and $499 million in short-term debt.  Also, the company generated $917 million in cash from operations, spending $151 million on capex, $650 million on share repurchases and $498 million on cash dividends. Texas Instruments is one of the few chip making companies that returns a significant amount of cash to its investors. Over the trailing 12 months, the company returned $4.1 billion of cash through a combination of dividends and stock repurchases. Bottom Line Texas Instruments is one of the largest suppliers of analog and digital signal processing integrated circuits. The company’s compelling product line-up, increasing differentiation in its business and low-cost 300-mm capacity should drive earnings over the long term.  Also, the company’s margins should continue to expand because of the secular strength in the auto and industrial markets, a stronger mix of analog and embedded processing products, benefits of restructuring actions and more 300mm capacity coming online. Moreover, the semiconductor giant is poised to gain from the growing market for Internet of Things.  We believe the increase in dividend and share buyback indicates that the company is confident about its steady cash flows. However, increasing competition from Analog Devices (ADI  -  Free Report), NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report) and Applied Materials Inc. (AMAT  -  Free Report) remains a concern.      Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?  Here's another stock idea to consider.

330,AMAT,"Texas Instruments Incorporated (TXN  -  Free Report) or TI yesterday took the wraps off its first educational robot designed for middle and high school students.Known as TI-Innovator Rover, the company claims it to be the first-of-its-kind calculator-controlled robotic car. The machine will have a wider rollout in the United States and Canada this fall and in Europe early next year.We observe that Texas Instruments stock has gained 14.1% year to date, underperforming the 18.8% rally of the industry it belongs to.How Does It Work?Students can write programs on Rover’s graphing calculator based on which it moves and draws things. The basic idea is to help students learn science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) subjects in an easy, interesting, enjoyable and interactive way.The machine helps students individually or collaboratively explore various STEM topics and concepts and efficiently work on basic as well as advanced STEM, coding and robotics projects. Even students less accustomed to coding and robotics, can use Rover through basic programs. It has been built particularly for classroom use.President of TI Education Technology, Peter Balyta stated, ""Given the sheer joy we have seen on students' faces as they learned to code during our testing phase, we are excited to see how Rover will inspire more young minds through an introduction to robotics.""Texas Instruments Incorporated Net Income (TTM) Texas Instruments Incorporated Net Income (TTM) | Texas Instruments Incorporated QuoteOur TakeTI’s robotic subsystem aims at building new capacities and features for robots used in industrial, medical, logistics and service applications. The latest move appears to be a part of this effort. The company leverages on its expertise in analog and embedded products and systems in the process. The move is evidence of Texas Instruments’ R&D investments in several high-margin, high-growth areas of the analog and embedded processing markets. This is gradually increasing its exposure to industrial and automotive markets and increasing dollar content at customers, while reducing exposure to volatile consumer/computing markets.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderTexas Instruments carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

331,AMAT,"Liquidity indicates a company’s capability of meeting debt obligations by converting assets into liquid cash and equivalents. Companies with a favorable liquidity position have always been in demand as they are believed to have the potential to boost portfolio returns.However, one should exercise caution before investing in such stocks. While a high liquidity level may imply that the company is meeting its obligations at a faster rate compared to peers, it may also indicate that the company is failing to use its assets efficiently.Hence, one may consider the efficiency level of a company in addition to its liquidity to identify potential winners.Measures to Identify Liquid StocksLiquidity ratios like Current Ratio, Quick Ratio and Cash Ratio are primarily used to identify companies with strong liquidity.Current Ratio: It measures current assets relative to current liabilities. This ratio is used for measuring a company’s potential to meet both short- and long-term debt obligations. Thus, a current ratio – also known as working capital ratio – below 1 indicates that the company has more liabilities than assets. However, a high current ratio does not always indicate that the company is in good financial shape. It may also mean that the company has failed to utilize its assets significantly. Hence, a range of 1 to 3 is considered ideal.Quick Ratio: Unlike current ratio, quick ratio – also called “acid-test ratio"" or ""quick assets ratio"" – indicates a company’s ability to pay short-term obligations. It considers inventory excluding current assets relative to current liabilities. Like the current ratio, a quick ratio of greater than 1 is desirable.Cash Ratio: This is the most conservative ratio among the three, as it takes into account only cash and cash equivalents, and invested funds relative to current liabilities. It measures a company’s ability to pay its current debt obligations using the most liquid of assets. Though a cash ratio higher than 1 may point to sound financials, a high number may indicate inefficiency in using the cash.So, a ratio of greater than 1 is desirable at all times but may not always underline a company’s financial health.Screening ParametersIn order to pick the best of the lot, we have added asset utilization, which is a widely used measure of a company’s efficiency, as one of the screening criteria. Asset utilization is a ratio of total sales over the past 12 months to the last four-quarter average of total assets. Though this ratio varies across industries, companies with a ratio higher than their respective industries can be considered efficient.In order to ensure that these liquid and efficient stocks have solid growth potential, we have added our proprietary Growth Style Score to the screen.Current Ratio, Quick Ratio and Cash Ratio between 1 and 3 (While liquidity ratios of greater than 1 are desirable, significantly high ratios may indicate inefficiency.)Asset utilization greater than industry average (Higher asset utilization than the industry average indicates a company’s efficiency.)Zacks Rank equal to #1 (Only Strong Buy-rated stocks can get through. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.)  Growth Style Score less than or equal to B (Back-tested results show that stocks with a Growth Style Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 handily beat other stocks.)These criteria have narrowed down the universe of over 7,700 stocks to only eight.Here are four of the eight stocks that qualified the screen:Goleta, CA-based AppFolio Inc. (APPF  -  Free Report) offers cloud-based software solutions for property management and legal industries.

332,AMAT,"International Business Machines Corp. (IBM  -  Free Report) is strengthening its presence in the blockchain market at a steady pace.After being part of multi-industrial blockchain deals in food supply, fintech, banking, and insurance sectors, the company has now struck a deal in the automotive industry. The new partnership is with automobile manufacturer, ZF Friedrichshafen.Leading Swiss bank, UBS is also part of the project for the development of the blockchain framework for “Car eWallet”. The system will be based on hyperledger technology.Car-eWallet is a blockchain based electronic payment and charging system for electronic cars. In January 2017, UBS, ZF and a German energy company Innogy first came together for the development and deployment of the project, and IBM is the newest partner on board.We believe growth of the blockchain segment along with the rapid adoption of IBM’s artificial intelligence platform Watson will help the company perform better in the near term. Shares of IBM have lost 9.5% year to date, underperforming the industry’s decline of 8.8%.Outcome of the CollaborationBesides making payments and charging easy, Car eWallet makes the parking process smoother and can also authorize vehicle usage by third parties, when it is parked. It can also collect fees for the service. It has a unique feature that makes buying and selling of used cars easy as well. Paying tolls is also taken care of by the system.All these features when combined with the unbreachable distributed ledger of blockchain technology will lead to the creation of a secure wallet. We believe, as the world is fast moving toward advanced driver assistance system (ADAS), Car eWallet is bound to win market share.International Business Machines Corporation Revenue (TTM) International Business Machines Corporation Revenue (TTM) | International Business Machines Corporation QuoteBlockchain Gaining TractionNotably, blockchain technology is witnessing rapid adoption across industries due to secured storage and transmission of data through a decentralized database. Since the system is accessible by all the parties of the transaction, any alteration in the data is almost impossible. This makes the system extremely safe. With double counting and hacking being at bay, the possibility of monetary losses is low.We believe all these features bode well for the technology. MarketsandMarkets predicts that the blockchain market is estimated to reach $2.31 billion by 2021 from $210.2 million in 2016 at a CAGR of 61.5%.Apart from IBM, Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report) is also advancing as a key player of the industry, as evident from its recent collaboration with Hapoalim. It recently unveiled its flagship Coco framework for faster and secure blockchain based operations. However, the blockchain market is currently dominated by IBM and with this new collaboration, it is diversifying further.Zacks Rank and Key PicksIBM has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Better-ranked stocks in the broader industry include Lam Research Corporation (LRCX  -  Free Report) and Applied Materials, Inc.

333,AMAT,"International Business Machines Corp. (IBM  -  Free Report) recently shipped its first z14 mainframe from its Poughkeepsie factory based in New York. This model was unveiled in July 2017 when its entire series of mainframes were renamed as IBM Z.Per IBM, the most prominent feature of the newest member of the series is 100% data encryption, ensuring high security. Other key features include real time insights that are beneficial for machine learning and a strong cloud platform. The system is also compatible with blockchain technology.IBM z14 can support 12 billion encrypted transactions each day, almost equivalent to 400 Cyber Mondays. With this specification, the company believes that the new mainframe will find widespread acceptance in the financial, government, retail, travel and transport industries, where the number of transactions is much higher and data safety necessary.Shares of IBM have lost 9.5% year to date, underperforming the industry’s decline of 8.8%. We believe, with the recent advancements made by IBM in cloud, blockchain and its artificial intelligence platform Watson, the launch of a mainframe compatible with all the three segments is a positive for the company. These will help shares rebound going forward.Evolution of MainframeMainframe computers were primarily meant for huge amount of critical data processing for large organizations. With the evolution of technology mainframes, the underlying infrastructure was also upgraded. Though public, private and hybrid clouds have become popular; these huge computers are still in demand for their capability of handling high workloads and the fact that it can be integrated into an existing ecosystem.IBM almost had a monopoly in the mainframe segment for quite some time. Though IBM still dominates the market, other players like Fujitsu and Unisys (UIS  -  Free Report) have entered the fray. Mainframes have an intrinsic role in the digital transformation of enterprises, more so because of their high computing power.Effect of Mainframe Segment on IBM’s FinancialsIn a recent report by Gartner, the CPU segment mostly comprised of mainframes witnessed year-over-year decline of 29.5% in the second quarter of 2017.However, IBM’s management expects the shipments of z14 mainframes to have a positive impact on second-half 2017 results. This is anticipated to have a positive impact on overall revenues generated by the mainframe market.International Business Machines Corporation Revenue (TTM) International Business Machines Corporation Revenue (TTM) | International Business Machines Corporation QuoteZDNet quoted Ross Mauri, general manager of IBM Z, who said that IBM adds around 5 o 15 customers in this segment per quarter. Per IBM, z14, which has been co-designed with clients’ insights, is expected to witness high adoption rate.We believe that with the impending implementation of Europe’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in May 2018, the shipment of z14, whose core advertising point is data encryption, is perfectly timed.Zacks Rank and Key PicksIBM currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Better-ranked stocks in the broader industry include Lam Research Corporation (LRCX  -  Free Report) and Applied Materials, Inc.

334,AMAT,"Facebook Inc (FB  -  Free Report) has set up monetization eligibility standards to make it clear that creators and publishers, which meet its strict guidelines, will be eligible to earn money on its platform. The social media giant called it part of its efforts to improve products/experience for all its users and creators/advertisers by bringing more “clarity” and “transparency''.Per Facebook, creator/publishers have to abide by its Community Standards, Payment Terms and Page Terms. Repeated failure to comply with these terms will result into removal of access to the company’s monetization features. In the blog post, Facebook stated, “Creators and publishers must have an authentic, established presence on Facebook — they are who they represent themselves to be, and have had a profile or Page on Facebook for at least one month. Additionally, some of our features like Ad Breaks require a sufficient follower base, something that could extend to other features over time.""     Facebook, Inc. Price Facebook, Inc. Price | Facebook, Inc. QuoteThe company further added, “Those who share content that repeatedly violates our Content Guidelines for Monetization, share clickbait or sensationalism, or post misinformation and false news may be ineligible or may lose their eligibility to monetize.”This move is widely seen as Facebook’s efforts to avoid brand safety issues, which plagued Google’s YouTube earlier this year.This year in March, YouTube ran into trouble with advertisers as it was reported that some ads ran before some extremist videos, prompting advertisers to withdraw their ad spots, per media reports. Consequently, Google had to tighten its ad policy to lure advertisers back.Per a Bloomberg report, the recent uproar caused by Facebook’s revelation of Russian accounts spending nearly $100,000 in ads ahead of the U.S. election has mounted advertisers' concerns. Already, advertisers have been wary as the service has been under fire for quite some time now given the extensive dissemination of fake news on its platform. The victory of Donald Trump is widely credited to fake news circulation on social media. Plus, there has been widespread speculation that Russia indeed meddled with 2016 U.S Presidential elections resulting in Trump’s victory.Putting in place stringent measures like this is the need of the hour for Facebook as it launches its dedicated video viewing tab, Watch. The company is currently testing in-stream video ad breaks with publishers creating content for Watch.Zacks Rank and Share Price MovementFacebook carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Notably, the company has outperformed the industry in the past year. Shares of Facebook have surged 35.4% compared with the industry’s 16.8% increase.Stocks to Consider                                                                             Better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector include Applied Materials (AMAT  -  Free Report) , Activision Blizzard (ATVI  -  Free Report) and FormFactor Inc (FORM  -  Free Report), all sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

335,AMAT,"On Sep 14, we issued an updated research report on Mexican telecom behemoth, America Movil SAB (AMX  -  Free Report).The price performance of the company has been encouraging for the last six months. The stock price increased 38.8% compared with the industry’s gain of 3.7% over the same time period.  This Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company, recently received regulatory approval from Argentina's National Communications Agency (Enacom) to enter into the pay-TV market of that country. Notably, the company has established both wireless and wireline operators in Argentina.Furthermore, America Movil has been steadily enriching its spectrum portfolio for the last couple of years. Lately, it acquired 60 MHz of wireless spectrum (airwave) in the 2.5 GHz band from Grupo MVS. In May, Mexican telecom regulator, Federal Telecommunications Institute, approved this deal. However, the financial terms are yet to be disclosed. Going forward, we believe this buyout will enhance the company’s high-speed data service.Meanwhile, this telecom behemoth’s continuous participation in spectrum auctions for the deployment of 4G LTE services and expansion of 3G footprints looks impressive. It launched also fourth-generation mobile services in 11 cities across Mexico and introduced LTE services in Brazil where it currently covers 18 cities.Moreover, America Movil’s wireless wing Telcel entered into a wireless roaming agreement with AT&T Inc. (T  -  Free Report) for its Mexican users lately. It should be note that Telcel is the undisputed leader in the Mexican wireless market with substantial market share.Key PicksInvestors interested in the broader Computer and Technology sector may consider better-ranked stocks like Arista Networks, Inc.

336,AMAT,"Xilinx Inc.’s (XLNX  -  Free Report) shares have added about 3% in yesterday’s trading session, outperforming the market.In the year-to-date period, its shares have advanced 10.9%, outperforming the industry’s gain of 7.7%.Before we discuss how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent fundamentals and trends in order to get a better understanding of the important drivers.Growth DriversXilinx’s ongoing transition from FPGA provider to an all programmable devices producer is helping it gain market share. The company’s expanding product portfolio, which includes the Zynq RFSoC platform, is aiding it against intense competition from the likes of Intel (INTC).  Zynq portfolio, which is implemented in both the 28-nm and 16-nm node, is growth catalyst.The company also started sampling of the 16-nm RFSoC Silicon In-house family of product, which offers a superior architectural solution to 5G wireless with integrated RF-class analog technology. The product helps in reducing power consumption (50% to 75%) and footprint reduction for future 5G deployments, cable and wireless backhaul applications.Further, management is optimistic over the demand of Amazon’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) FPGA-as-a-Service (the cloud service is supported by Xilinx’s Ultrascale+ FPGAs) that targets the traditional hardware FPGA designers. Xilinx believes that Amazon’s deployment of SDAccel and SDSoC products will boost competitive position against other SoC providers.Most recently, the company announced that its software defined development environment, SDAccel, is now available on Amazon Web Services (AWS) for use with Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) F1 instances.We believe that rising demand for 28-nm, 20-nm and 16-nm nodes is positive for the company.Xilinx’s expanding software defined programming portfolio along with hardware solutions to accelerate machine learning is expected to drive user base. The company has significant growth opportunities in Data center, 5G deployment, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Industrial IoT and Advanced Driver Assisted Systems (ADAS) applications over the long haul.Upward Estimate RevisionsIn the last 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Xilinx’s current quarter and current year witnessed upward revisions. For the current quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at 62 cents, up from earnings of 61 cents earlier. Similarly, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current year is currently pegged at $2.55 per share compared with $2.50 projected 60 days ago.Style Scores Look GreatXilinx currently sports an A grade for Growth, lifting its overall VGM Score to B.ConclusionThe stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Additionally, the stock has long-term earnings per share growth rate of 9.3%. Notably, the company has posted a positive earnings surprise in the last four quarters with an average beat of 7.4%.In our opinion, the stock deserves a place in investor’s portfolio and we are expecting an impressive return from the stock in the next few months.A few better-ranked stocks worth considering are Applied Materials, Inc. (AMAT  -  Free Report) and NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report), both sporting s a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

337,AMAT,"Shares of Qualcomm (QCOM  -  Free Report) were down more than 4% through early afternoon trading hours Tuesday after the chipmaker lost its legal bid to postpone changes to its cellular patent licensing process in South Korea.The semiconductor manufacturing giant confirmed on Monday night that the Seoul High Court had denied its application to put a stay on a remedial order by the Korea Fair Trade Commission over the way it licenses cellular patents.Qualcomm was seeking to delay the Fair Trade Commission’s order while the company appeals the regulator body’s findings in court. Nevertheless, South Korea denied the request and ruled that Qualcomm’s business would not suffer irreparable harm if the order took effect during the appeals process.Qualcomm shares dropped about 4% to $50.08 by early afternoon. However, at least one analyst argued that the ruling wouldn’t really have a major effect on the company’s results.“While this is interesting, we do not believe it affects QCOM treatment in other countries,” said JPMorgan’s Rod Hall in a note. “We also point out that the smartphone volumes in Korea are tiny relative to global volume and have little impact on Qualcomm’s licensing revenue stream.”Indeed, Qualcomm’s slump appears to be coming on a weak day throughout the semiconductor industry. The iShares PHLX Semiconductor Sector ETF (SOXX  -  Free Report) was down more than 1.5%, while major chipmakers like AMD (AMD  -  Free Report) and Nvidia (NVDA  -  Free Report) were down more than 3%.Other industry giants, including Micron Technology (MU), Applied Materials (AMAT  -  Free Report), Analog Devices (ADI  -  Free Report), and Texas Instruments (TXN  -  Free Report), also fell on Tuesday. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index was down over 1.3% through Tuesday afternoon trading.Tech’s rough day was mirrored by nearly all major sectors, as several major international stories, as well as the onset of the market’s historic worst month, helped drag stocks down on Tuesday (also read: Stocks Dip To Start September, The Market's Traditional Worst Month).Want more stock market analysis from this author?

338,AMAT,"Alphabet Inc.’s (GOOGL  -  Free Report) Google is rolling out its free Wi-Fi program Google Station in Indonesia as part of which public places like railway stations and universities will have free connectivity.The program will be initially launched in a few cities and expanded going ahead. Google is working with internet service providers (ISPs), system integrators and venue owners on this endeavor.We observe that Alphabet stock has gained 16.7% over the past year, outperforming the 13.4% rally of the industry it belongs to.Replicating the Success in IndiaGoogle launched this program in India in January 2016, partnering with Indian Railways’ Internet services arm RailTel to provide public Wi-Fi service at the Mumbai Central station. In September, Google expanded the project to other public places including malls, cafes, universities, stations and hangout spots.The company claims that the service is currently active in more than 150 stations and plans to extend it to 400. With the new move, it seems that Google is trying to repeat the success of this program in Indonesia.Alphabet Inc. PE Ratio (TTM) Alphabet Inc. PE Ratio (TTM) | Alphabet Inc. QuoteOpportunities in IndonesiaAccording to eMarketer, Indonesia currently has about 100.8 million internet users, the highest among Southeast Asian countries. The figure is expected to reach 137.2 million by 2021.However high-speed internet connectivity is lacking in the nation. Per a data from Akamai, Indonesia had just 7.2 megabits per second (Mbps) of average data connection speed in the first quarter of 2017.Furthermore, mobile users of the country prefer connecting to Wi-Fi rather than internet from mobile service providers to save usage fees. Per a JakPat survey from February 2017, more than 50% of mobile internet users in the country connected to Wi-Fi on a daily basis.Furthermore, according to a report by Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund Temasek and Google, the internet economy of Southeast Asia is expected to surge to a massive $200 billion by 2025.These trends offer ample opportunities for Google to tap the growing number of data conscious and budget friendly internet users in Indonesia and lure them to its high-speed services.The company is also launching the YouTube Go app in the country that will allow users save videos and watch or share them offline.Our TakeWe believe that with this move, Google is looking to strengthen its global foothold as well as boost ad revenues. The company’s ability to innovate has translated into strong growth as it continues to adapt to changing market trends.It seems that it has all resources and technology to create successful ventures in Asia. The company is banking on its huge cash balance and technological prowess to pursue growth in any market that exhibits true potential.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderCurrently Alphabet carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

339,AMAT,"The U.S. equity market remained skittish over the last few days as the nation faced one of the worst tropical storms in 50 years — Hurricane Harvey. In addition to catastrophic flooding, the Category 4 storm ravaged properties and caused widespread damage to various industries. As sublime tensions within and outside the country continue to raise an element of caution, investors are on the lookout for ‘cash cow’ stocks that will offer high returns.However, singling out cash-rich stocks alone does not make for a solid investment proposition unless they are backed by attractive efficiency ratios like return on equity (ROE). A high ROE ensures that the company is reinvesting its cash at a high rate of return.ROE: A Key MetricROE = Net Income/Shareholders’ EquityROE helps investors distinguish between profit-generating companies from profit burners and is useful for determining the financial health of a company. In other words, this financial metric enables investors to identify stocks that diligently deploy cash for higher returns.Moreover, ROE is often used to compare the profitability of a company with other firms in the industry – the higher, the better. It measures how well a company is increasing its profits without investing new equity capital in the business and portrays management efficiency in rewarding shareholders with attractive risk-adjusted returns.Screening ParametersIn order to shortlist stocks that are cash rich with high ROE, we have added Cash Flow greater than $1 billion and ROE greater than X-Industry as our primary screening parameters. In addition, we have taken a few other criteria into consideration to arrive at a winning strategy.Price/Cash Flow less than X-Industry: This metric measures how much investors pay for one dollar of free cash flow. A lower ratio indicates that investors need to pay less for a better cash flow generating stock.Return on Assets (ROA) greater than X-Industry: This metric determines how much profit a company earns for every dollar of asset, which includes cash, accounts receivable, property, equipment, inventory and furniture. The higher the ROA, the better it is for the company.5-Year EPS Historical Growth greater than X-Industry: This criterion indicates that continued earnings momentum has translated into solid cash strength.   Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Here are five of the 19 stocks that qualified the screen:Broadcom Limited (AVGO  -  Free Report): Broadcom is a premier designer, developer and global supplier of a broad range of semiconductor devices with focus on complex digital and mixed signal complementary metal oxide semiconductor-based devices and analog III-V based products.

340,AMAT,"When it comes to choosing stocks, investors often opt for complex investment strategies in a bid to book higher returns. But with ever changing market dynamics, this may not yield the desired results every time. Therefore, using conventional strategies, based on key fundamentals, to choose stocks is always a wise decision.One such strategy is sales growth. Maintaining steady sales growth is the key to survival for any business. Sales growth as such remains a vital measure for any corporate house, as it is important to growth projections and strategic decision making.So, when companies incur losses for a temporary period, they are valued based on their revenues, as top-line growth (or decline) is usually an indicator of a company’s future earnings performance. Also, in contrast to price to earnings and price to book value ratios, which can turn negative and cease to be relevant, price-to-sales (P/S) ratio is available even for companies that have hit choppy waters.Additionally, profits and book value are largely influenced by several factors including accounting decisions tied with depreciation, significant charges and inventory. However, management has limited opportunities to manipulate sales, which further underscores the importance of P/S ratio. Hence, P/S ratio can serve as a more reliable metric for stock valuation. Focusing solely on sales growth is, however, not enough.A consideration of a company’s cash position along with its sales can be a more dependable strategy. Significant cash in hand and steady cash flow give a company more flexibility with respect to business decisions and investments.Picking the Winning StocksIn order to shortlist stocks that have witnessed impressive sales growth along with a high cash balance, we have selected 5-Year Historical Sales Growth (%) greater than X-Industry and Cash Flow greater than $500 million as our main screening parameters.But sales growth and cash strength are not the absolute criteria for selecting stocks. So, we added certain other factors to arrive at a winning strategy.Price-to-Sales (P/S) Ratio less than X-Industry: This metric determines the value placed on each dollar of a company’s revenues. The lower the ratio, the better it is for picking a stock since the investor is paying less for each unit of sales.% Change F1 Sales Estimate Revisions (4 Weeks) greater than X-Industry: Better-than-industry estimate revision has often been seen to trigger an increase in stock price.Operating Margin (Average Last 5 years) greater than 5%: Operating margin measures how much every dollar of a company's sales translates into profits. A high ratio indicates that the company has good cost control and sales are increasing faster than costs, an optimal situation for the company.Return on Equity (ROE) greater than 5%: This metric will ensure that sales growth is translated into profits and the company is not hoarding cash. A high ROE means the company is spending wisely and is in all likelihood profitable.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.

341,AMAT,"Western Digital Corp.’s (WDC  -  Free Report) shares have climbed 4.1% in yesterday’s trading session, outperforming the market.Western Digital stock has gained 29.4% in the last three months, outperforming the 25.3% rally of the industry it belongs to.Will the recent positive trend continue driving the stock over the long haul or is it due for a pullback? Before we discuss how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the fundamentals and trends in order to get a better hold on the important drivers.Growth DriversWestern Digital delivered second-quarter fiscal 2018 non-GAAP earnings of $3.95 per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 14 cents and soared 71.7% from the year-ago quarter.Revenues increased 9.2% year over year to $5.34 billion and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.29 billion. The strong top-line growth reflected healthy demand in the company’s end-markets for high capacity enterprise hard drives and flash-based products.Western Digital has started deploying 64-layer 3D technology across its product portfolio and the ramp of the 96-layer technology is expected in the later part of 2018. The company MAMR-based capacity enterprise hard drives are anticipated to be available for sampling in the second half of 2018.Product RolloutsWestern Digital recently unveiled two new NVMe (Non-Volatile Memory Express) SSDs namely Western Digital PC SN720 and Western Digital PC SN520. This addresses the need of storage system that enables the fast data applications and new technologies.With such launches, we expect Western Digital to strengthen market position against the likes of Seagate Technology.According to Cisco GCI estimates, the machine, people and other things will require about 850 zettabytes (ZB) of storage by 2021. The growing demand requires a new storage standard and easy accessibility. We believe that the latest Western Digital’s NVMe client architecture and product portfolio will benefit from pent up demand in the storage market.These product additions will enhance the company’s existing product portfolio. It will also aid Western Digital in getting a strong foothold in the global SSD market, which per latest data by TechNavio is expected to witness CAGR of 17% during 2016-2020.Western Digital also unveiled the world’s fastest UHS-I microSD card and PCIe-enabled flash memory card technology, the 400GB SanDisk Extreme UHS-I micro SDXC card at MWC. It will enable users to better capture, preserve, access, share, transform and enjoy their personal content.Joint Venture on TrackIn Dec, 2017, Western Digital settled its dispute with long-time joint venture (JV) partner, Toshiba, over the divestiture of Toshiba Memory Corporation to a consortium led by Bain Capital. The company gave consent to the transfer of Toshiba’s equity interests in the JVs to TMC.The settlement now ensures long-term availability of NAND supply for Western Digital.Western Digital also announced that it will participate in the development of Fab 6 starting with the second investment tranche. Fab 6 operations are expected to commence in the next few months with initial bit output in the third calendar quarter of 2018.The company also expects to participate in the new wafer fab scheduled to be constructed in Iwate.Upward Estimate RevisionsIn the last 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Western Digital's current quarter and current year witnessed upward revisions. For the current quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at $3.27 per share, up from earnings of $3.11 per share earlier. Similarly, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current year is currently pegged at $13.97 per share compared with $13.47 projected 60 days ago.Style Scores Look GreatWestern Digitalcurrently sports an A grade for Growth and Value, lifting its overall VGM Score to A.Positive Earnings Surprise HistoryWestern Digitalhas an impressive earnings surprise history. The company outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, delivering a positive average earnings surprise of 6.43%.Further, it has a long-term expected EPS growth rate of 19%.To ConcludeIn our opinion, the stock deserves a place in investor’s portfolio and we are expecting an impressive return from the stock in the next few months.Currently, the stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector include Applied Materials, Inc. (AMAT  -  Free Report), NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report) and DXC Technology Company (DXC  -  Free Report).

342,AMAT,"Investors in search of great value opportunities in the semiconductor industry might look no further than Applied Materials (AMAT  -  Free Report). This Silicon Valley giant is one of the top suppliers of equipment to the global semiconductor business, and with the rise in demand for high-end chips throughout the world, AMAT has seen its client activity pick up significantly.In its most recent quarter, Applied Materials witnessed adjusted earnings of $1.06 per share, up 59% from the year-ago period. Total quarterly revenues came in at $4.2 billion, improving more than 28% year over year.It is not often that companies with AMAT’s size and legacy see such rapid expansion. And investors have certainly noticed this growth, sending the stock soaring more than 50% over the past year. Still, there appears to be plenty of room left for Applied to run higher.One catalyst for a continued surge could be the company’s improving outlook. Within the past 60 days, we have seen seven positive revisions for AMAT’s full-year earnings estimates, bringing our Zacks Consensus Estimate a whopping 31 cents higher over that timeframe. We now expect to see the company witness full-year earnings growth of 35%.Even with the stock’s recent surge, AMAT’s positive outlook makes its forward-looking guidance extremely attractive for value investors. What’s more, the stock is also trading at a discount to its most comparable peers.Here’s Applied’s Forward P/E trend compared to that of its peer group: AMAT’s peer group includes ASML Holding (ASML  -  Free Report), Lam Research (LRCX  -  Free Report), KLA-Tencor (KLAC  -  Free Report), and Advanced Energy Industries (AEIS  -  Free Report). Not all of these companies are direct competitors to AMAT, but they do function as suppliers to semiconductor manufacturers. Comparing AMAT to these stocks helps us show how investors tend to value this niche market.When we break it down like this, we can really see that AMAT is an interesting value option. However, we should note that the stock is only sporting a “C” grade for Value in our Style Scores system. In contrast to its attractive P/E, AMAT’s P/S of 4.1 is less appealing than the broader market. Applied might also raise eyebrows from a cash-flow perspective, as it is only generating about $3.69 in cash per share right now—about 40% less than its industry’s average.Still, the foundation of AMAT’s is only getting stronger right now, and the stock’s Forward P/E implies that investors are getting a great price for that strength.Want more market analysis from this author?

344,AMAT,"3D Systems Corporation’s (DDD  -  Free Report) adjusted earnings came in at 5 cents per share, down 66.7% from the prior-year tally of 15 cents per share. However, the figure came in above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 1 cent. Increase in total operating expenses, on account of rise in selling, general and administrative, as well as research and development costs, put pressure on the bottom line.The company reported a GAAP loss of 8 cents per share in fourth-quarter 2017, which is in sharp contrast to earnings of 5 cents per share reported in the prior-year quarter.For full-year 2017, 3D Systems incurred an adjusted loss of 2 cents per share against adjusted earnings of 46 cents per share in 2016.Inside the HeadlinesThe 3D printer maker reported revenues of $177.3 million in the quarter, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 6.9%. Steady demand for the company’s healthcare, materials, software and on-demand manufacturing, along with increased printer unit sales proved favorable for the top line. Moreover, revenues came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $164 million.For full-year 2017, 3D Systems generated revenues of $646.1 million, up 2.1% from the prior-year’s tally of $633 million.3D Systems’ Healthcare revenues were up 13% to $50.4 million year over year, driven by growth across all categories. Notably, the company’s on-demand manufacturing revenues were up 10% to $26.5 million, helped by its investments in facilities, customer experience and technology. For full-year 2017, healthcare revenues experienced an increase of 18% to $188.7 million.Software revenues were up 8% to $26 million compared with the prior-year quarter. Material revenues rose 8% to $42.8 million, driven by continued utilization of its installed base and strong contribution from the previously acquired Vertex-Global. For full-year 2017, material revenues experienced an increase of 8% to $168.8 million.Printer revenues were almost flat compared with the prior-year quarter and came in at $34.9 million. Meanwhile, printer unit sales increased 15% owing to increase in both production as well as professional unit sales.3D Systems Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  3D Systems Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | 3D Systems Corporation Quote In the reported quarter, gross margin contracted 180 basis points on a year-over-year basis to 48.2%, due to the adverse impact from product discontinuations and legacy inventory cleanup charges.In the reported quarter, the company’s operating expenses increased 15.7% to $91.2 million, as SG&A (up 18%) expenses rose significantly, driven by the company’s persistent investment in go-to-market and IT transformation. R&D expense (up 9%) also increased to $23 million.Notable DevelopmentsRecently, 3D Systems launched the NextDent 5100, a 3D printer designed for dental labs. The company also rolled out a number of new materials for the NextDent 5100. Moreover, the company launched the FabPro 1000, a low cost high productivity DLP based 3D printers, designed for high functionality industrial prototyping, dental and jewelry production.Going forward, the company plans to commence shipping its next-generation SLS printer, the ProX SLS 6100. Other plans in the pipeline include the introduction of additional Figure 4 products and the DMP 8500, an automated and fully integrated next generation metals platform.Cash Flow and Balance Sheet3D Systems ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $136.3 million, down significantly from $184.9 million as of Dec 31, 2016. At the end of December, net cash generated from operating activities came in at $25.9 million, significantly lower than the year-earlier figure of $57.5 million.To ConcludeOf late, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company has been benefiting from favorable 3D printing industry fundamentals, led by rising demand for diverse applications of this novel technology across multiple domains. Moving ahead, strong demand for production printers, materials and software, as well as healthcare solutions will likely act as major catalysts for growth. We also believe that the acquisition of Vertex-Global Holding B.V. will unlock multiple opportunities for the company.However, over the past few quarters, revenues from 3D printing products and services have been significantly undermined due to sustained challenging market conditions that adversely impacted customers' capital investment cycles and reduced demand across most geographies. If these problems persist, the company’s performance might come under pressure, moving ahead.Stocks to ConsiderA few better-ranked stocks in the same space include DST Systems, Inc. , Applied Materials, Inc.

This represents a 35.08% change in EPS on a 19.61% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $4.55 per share on $18.67 billion in revenues. This represents changes of 3.64% and 7.37%, respectively.Valuation MetricsApplied Materials may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for AMAT? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself.On this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.Applied Materials has a Value Score of C. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are A and C, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of A.In terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 14.03x current fiscal year EPS estimates. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 16.71x versus its peer group's average of 17.06x. Additionally, the stock has a PEG ratio of 1.17. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.Applied Materials, Inc. Price and Consensus  Applied Materials, Inc. Price and Consensus | Applied Materials, Inc. QuoteZacks RankWe also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, Applied Materials currently has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy) thanks to rising earnings estimates.Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 or 2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if Applied Materials fits the bill. Thus, it seems as though AMAT shares could have potential in the weeks and months to come.How Does Applied Materials Stack Up to the Competition?Shares of Applied Materials have been soaring, and the company still appears to be a decent choice, but what about the rest of the industry? Some of its industry peers are also solid potential picks, including AEIS, NANO, and WTS, all of which currently have a Zacks Rank of at least #2 and a VGM Score of at least B, making them well-rounded choices.The Zacks Industry Rank is in the top 1.89% of all the industries we have in our universe, so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for AMAT, even beyond its own solid fundamental situation.

348,AMAT,"A jobs report tailor-made to boost investor sentiment helped U.S. stocks surge higher last Friday. The biggest beneficiaries of this data were tech stocks, with the Nasdaq hitting closing and intraday records. In the process, the index recouped losses incurred during February’s correction, inching up marginally.Clearly, investors are seeking out tech stocks in an environment where growth-oriented investments are a favored option. Additionally, tech stocks have seen a successful earnings season and are expected to report strong numbers through 2018. With no roadblocks in sight, it makes sense to bet on large-cap tech stocks from the Nasdaq 100 at this point.Tech Stocks Rebound From February Correction During the week ended Feb 9, the Nasdaq Composite index declined 5.1%, suffering its worst losses since early 2016. And it has taken only a month for the tech-heavy index to recover completely. On Mar 9, the index gained 1.8% to close at 7560.81, around 0.33% higher than the previous record achieved on Jan 26.Additionally, the Nasdaq 100, which is made up of the 100 largest companies in the index, hit a record level. The Nasdaq is now up 9.5% year to date while the S&P 500 has gained only 3.4%. The broader market benchmark is yet to fully recover from February’s selloff, thanks to inflationary concerns.But in a market captivated by superior momentum levels, the likes of Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report), Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report) and Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) have once again become investor favorites. Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) and Amazon each gained 1.7% on Mar 9 while Netflix rose 4.6%. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index gained 2.1%.Strong Earnings Expectations, Lack of ImpedimentsAs of Mar 7, we have received Q4 results from 98.2% of the sector’s market cap in the S&P 500 index. Total earnings for these tech companies are up 23.6% from the same period last year on 10.9% higher revenues. Additionally, for full-year 2018, total earnings for these companies are expected to rise 22.7% on 10.9% higher revenues. (Read: A Very Positive Earnings Picture)Strong earnings prospects are among the key reasons why tech stocks have once again caught investors’ imagination. Given the strong economic backdrop, this class of assets has become a favored option among investors since they are growing at a faster pace than the overall economy.Also, there is a clear absence of factors which could snap the ongoing tech gains, at least in the short term. This is why they are becoming favored choices, much in keeping with one of last year’s top stock strategies, sticking with winning options. Further, investors are choosing to ignore any associated volatility which accompanies such an investment strategy.Our ChoicesTech stocks have rebounded within a month of February’s correction, outpacing their equity counterparts. Investors have chosen to focus on their strong earnings prospects and the lack of impediments to future gains. This class of equities is probably the most favored growth choices even as the economy goes from strength to strength.Given this backdrop, it makes sense to bet on large-cap tech stocks which make up the Nasdaq 100. Notably, this prominent large-cap index also hit a record high on Mar 9. However, picking winning stocks may be difficult.This is where our VGM Score comes in. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores. Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners. However, it is important to keep in mind that each Style Score will carry a different weight while arriving at a VGM Score.We have narrowed down our search to the following stocks based on a good Zacks Rank and VGM Score.Applied Materials, Inc. (AMAT  -  Free Report) is one of the world’s largest suppliers of equipment for the fabrication of semiconductor, flat panel liquid crystal displays (LCDs), and solar photovoltaic (PV) cells and modules.Applied Materials has a VGM Score of B.

352,AMAT,"Investors in search of great value opportunities in the semiconductor industry might look no further than Applied Materials (AMAT  -  Free Report). This Silicon Valley giant is one of the top suppliers of equipment to the global semiconductor business, and with the rise in demand for high-end chips throughout the world, AMAT has seen its client activity pick up significantly.In its most recent quarter, Applied Materials witnessed adjusted earnings of $1.06 per share, up 59% from the year-ago period. Total quarterly revenues came in at $4.2 billion, improving more than 28% year over year.It is not often that companies with AMAT’s size and legacy see such rapid expansion. And investors have certainly noticed this growth, sending the stock soaring more than 50% over the past year. Still, there appears to be plenty of room left for Applied to run higher.One catalyst for a continued surge could be the company’s improving outlook. Within the past 60 days, we have seen seven positive revisions for AMAT’s full-year earnings estimates, bringing our Zacks Consensus Estimate a whopping 31 cents higher over that timeframe. We now expect to see the company witness full-year earnings growth of 35%.Even with the stock’s recent surge, AMAT’s positive outlook makes its forward-looking guidance extremely attractive for value investors. What’s more, the stock is also trading at a discount to its most comparable peers.Here’s Applied’s Forward P/E trend compared to that of its peer group: AMAT’s peer group includes ASML Holding (ASML  -  Free Report), Lam Research (LRCX  -  Free Report), KLA-Tencor (KLAC  -  Free Report), and Advanced Energy Industries (AEIS  -  Free Report).

However, we should note that the stock is only sporting a “C” grade for Value in our Style Scores system. In contrast to its attractive P/E, AMAT’s P/S of 4.1 is less appealing than the broader market. Applied might also raise eyebrows from a cash-flow perspective, as it is only generating about $3.69 in cash per share right now—about 40% less than its industry’s average.Still, the foundation of AMAT’s is only getting stronger right now, and the stock’s Forward P/E implies that investors are getting a great price for that strength.Want more market analysis from this author?

The company’s latest products, available for 600 MHz and millimeter-wave in 28 GHz and 39 GHz, will enable T-Mobile to start deployment of 5G in its network in the current year.In collaboration with Ericsson, T-Mobile is building out 5G in New York, Las Vegas as well as Los Angeles by leveraging Ericsson's 5G New Radio (NR) radios and baseband. In fact, Ericsson's enhanced 5G Platform will aid the rollout of the network, catering to the increasing needs for customers. Based on first 3GPP 5G NR standards, Ericsson had also launched 5G Radio Access Network (RAN) commercial software in early February. The software will be available in fourth-quarter 2018, which will offer multi-band support for worldwide deployment thus enabling T-Mobile to build out 5G network in the current year.Meanwhile, Ericsson and TIM, an Italy's major ICT company, has successfully deployed first virtual Radio Access Network (vRAN) platform in a live advanced LTE network in Turin. Notably, both companies have begun to digitalize TIM's nationwide radio access network in Italy. The vRAN technology supports network transformation into a flexible cloud platform, thereby facilitating optimization of processes and reducing associated costs related to the management of innovative services and automation.Additionally, Ericsson and TIM are looking to pool their efforts to develop Self Organizing Network solutions that have increased automation with considerable improvements of customer experience. The partnership also augments TIM's transformation project, DigiTIM, which focuses on better customer experience and improved operational efficiency through automation of network systems and virtualization.Existing Business ScenarioBeing one of the premier telecom services providers, Ericsson is much in demand among operators to expand network coverage and upgrade networks for higher speed and capacity. As operators continue to invest in telecom core networks for deployment of new service offerings such as Voice over LTE, the company stands to benefit significantly from the same. For instance, the company is enthusiastic about the turnaround of the Chinese market in terms of 4G deployments and believes, which is likely to be a significant growth driver going forward. In the past three months, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company has gained 6.8% outperforming the industry’s rally of 5.8%.Moving ahead, the company foresees mainstream 4G offerings to give way to 5G technology. Meanwhile, the impending deployment of 5G networks in 2020 is expected to boost the adoption of IoT devices with technologies like network slicing gaining more prominence. In fact, we believe 5G is likely to accelerate the digital transformation in many industries, thereby enabling new use cases in areas such as IoT, automation, transport and big data. For 2022, the Ericsson Mobility forecasts 550 million 5G subscriptions, with North America expected to lead the way. Such positive industry trends are expected to boost the company’s long-term growth.However, of late, the company seems to be grappling with negative industry trends and a declining wireless equipment market. Additionally, it expects an increasingly challenging investment environment in Europe and Latin America. Lower IPR licensing revenues and an unfavorable mix between coverage, and capacity and services are further adding to the company’s concerns.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the same space are Aspen Technology, Inc.

356,AMAT,"Alibaba Group Holding Limited (BABA  -  Free Report) is set to report third-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Feb 1. Last quarter, the Chinese e-Commerce giant delivered a positive earnings surprise of 24%.The surprise history has been good in Alibaba’s case. The company surpassed estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, with an average four-quarter positive surprise of 15%.Coming to the price performance, on a 12-month basis, the company’s shares have rallied 103.2% compared with the industry’s gain of 68.1%.Strength in Alibaba’s Core E-Commerce BusinessThis segment comprises marketplaces operating in retail and wholesale commerce in China, and international commerce. Revenues in the last-reported fiscal second quarter were RMB46.46 billion (US$6.98 billion), increasing 63% year over year. Revenues are expected to further increase, driven by innovation in data technology, widespread application of big data and increasing validation for Taobao and Tmall portals.Strong Mobile Growth In the fiscal second quarter, Mobile Monthly Active Users (MAU) were 549 million, reflecting an increase of 22% year over year and 4% sequentially. The number is expected to further expand, driving revenues for the company. This is because of the increased adoption of mobile devices by consumers as the primary method of accessing Alibaba’s platforms. Additionally, over the last few quarters, Alibaba has witnessed an increase in monetization rates. The company is building its online marketing inventory on both mobile and PC and is likely to continue witnessing higher monetization rates, thereby increasing the profits of the company.Growing Cloud MomentumIn the last-reported fiscal second quarter, revenues were RMB2.98 billion (US$447 million), increasing 99% year over year. Additionally, Alibaba Cloud launched 245 new products and features to enable small and large enterprises to achieve higher computing performance and storage capability.The figure is expected to further increase in the upcoming quarter driven by an increase in the number of paying customers and higher-than-usual spending by them, reflecting increased usage of services.Overhangs RemainConcerns remain in the form of rising costs associated with new businesses initiatives, rising logistics and order-fulfillment costs. Also, the company is willing to spend plenty of cash on its entertainment and media units, which management has identified as key growth drivers outside of its core e-commerce business.Also, increasing competition from companies like Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) and Jd.com (JD), among others and deceleration of growth in the e-commerce market both domestically and internationally could impact results in the upcoming quarter.Moreover, the company was suspected for the sale of counterfeit products on its online shopping platform, Taobao.com. Such report may have a negative impact on the company’s image and its international expansion strategy.What Our Model SaysAccording to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive Earnings ESP.

358,AMAT,"Two major developments dominated market proceedings on Wednesday. On the one hand, tech stocks suffered losses, with chip stocks in particular bearing the brunt. Meanwhile, a nationalist stance on trade and the dollar emerged in Davos through statements of key members of the Trump administration.On the one hand, a section of analysts believe that tech stocks are running out of steam and would find it difficult to replicate last year’s gains in 2018. On the other hand, a weaker dollar is likely to weigh on U.S. exports.Chip Stocks Weigh on the MarketsTech stocks weighed on the bourses over the last session with chipmakers in particular feeling the heat. Shares of Texas Instruments (TXN  -  Free Report) lost 8.5% after the company released dismal projections for the current quarter. Other chipmakers followed suit, with Applied Materials (AMAT  -  Free Report) declining by 1.6%.Meanwhile, shares of Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report) also lost 1.6% after Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi said iPhone sales might come in weaker than expected in the coming spring. Also weighing of the broader index was a decline of 1.5%, 0.4% and 0.4%, respectively, in shares of Facebook (FB  -  Free Report), Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) and Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report).Over the last few months, chipmakers have made massive strides. For instance, the VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH) is up 5.9% year to date and has gained 40.9% over the last one year.However, a section of analysts believe that it may be difficult for the sector to sustain such gains. Analysts from Citi Investment Research feel that chipmakers’ business conditions have softened after a series of strong results.Nationalist Position EmergesMeanwhile, key members of the Trump administration espoused a nationalist position on trade and the dollar at the World Economic Forum in Davos. U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross firmly elucidated the current administration’s muscular stance on trade. Ross also blamed China for been hiding its practice of trade protectionism under the veil of free trade.Even more noteworthy comments were heard from his colleague U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin who said that the Trump administration favored “bilateral trade agreements.” Mnuchin added that any weakness in the dollar was beneficial for trade. His comments led to the ICE U.S. Dollar Index falling below the 90 mark for the first time since December 2014.Can Chip Stocks Gain from a Weaker Dollar?Mnuchin’s comments are something of a first, more so from a Treasury Secretary. In the past, U.S. administrations advocated a stronger dollar and urged other countries to work toward lowering their barriers to free trade. This new protectionist stance is a double edged sword. It could trigger off a trade war, leading to retaliations from the likes of China.Further, a fall in the dollar could lead to a contraction in capital inflows which in turn could send yields shooting upward. This in turn could lead to unwelcome shocks for equity markets. Of course, Ross tried to backpedal on the Treasury Secretary’s remarks later, telling CNBC television that Mnuchin wasn’t calling for a weaker dollar.However, such a scenario seems to be a little far-fetched at the moment. If a sovereign bond selloff does come about, it will be triggered by China which recently denied Bloomberg reports on the matter. In any case, such a move would be against China’s own interests in the long run.So, as of now a weaker dollar would only be beneficial for major U.S. exporting sectors like semiconductors. In 2016, semiconductors were the third-largest exports, amounting to around $43 billion. This was likely the case for last year as well and despite alarms being raised over exorbitant valuations and a weaker business environment, chipmakers are likely to have another banner year.Our ChoicesChipmakers have got off on the wrong foot in 2018. But this false start in no way detracts from their astounding performance last year as well as their future prospects. The slump in the dollar is likely to add to the luster of this major exporting sector.Adding select chip stocks to your portfolios continues to make for a profitable option.

361,AMAT,"If you are still holding on to shares of CyberArk Software Ltd. (CYBR  -  Free Report) in your portfolio, it is time you dump them as chances of favorable returns in the near term appear bleak.Dropping CyberArk can maximize investor’s portfolio returns as it has witnessed a significant price decline in the past one year, and has seen negative earnings estimate revisions for the current quarter and the year. Further, the company’s Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) only reflects its innate weakness.CyberArk has lost 26.8% of its value year over year versus the 11.3% growth of its industry. The stock carries a VGM Score of D.Let’s delve deeper and find out what is taking this company down.Why CyberArk Should be AvoidedCyberArk is an Israeli company that specializes in protecting accounts from cyber-attacks. The company offers several products that protect passwords, close loopholes in the security system, and secure cloud-based assets.For the full year 2017, we have seen eight estimates moving south in the past 30 days. This trend has caused the consensus estimate to trend downward, going from $1.09 per share a month ago to its current level of $1.05.Additionally, for the current quarter, CyberArk has seen 11 downward estimate revisions against no revisions in the opposite direction, dragging the consensus estimate down to 19 cents per share from 25 cents in the past 30 days.The company’s non-GAAP earnings per share for second-quarter 2017 came in at 21 cents, which declined 27.6% on a year-over-year basis. On an adjusted basis too, earnings per share (excluding amortization of intangible assets and other one-time items but including stock-based compensation) on a proportionate tax basis came in at 11 cents per share, registering a plunge of 47.6% from the year-ago quarter’s earnings of 21 cents.The year-over-year plunged in earnings on both fronts, i.e. non-GAAP and adjusted, was mainly due to the lower-than-expected sales growth and elevated operating expenses.Though, CyberArk’s revenues increased just 14.1% year over year to $57.5 million, it was the slowest since it got listed in 2014. The company’s revenues also fell short of management’s guided range of $61-$62 million (mid-point $61.5 million), as well as the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $58 million, mainly due to weak performance in the Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) region resulting from some sales execution problem.The company also provided sluggish revenue guidance for the third quarter and full-year 2017.For the third quarter, CyberArk expects revenues in the range of $62-$63 million (mid-point $62.5 million), representing 13-15% year-over-year growth. The mid-point of the guided range, however, is below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $63.26 million.For the year, the company lowered outlook. CyberArk now anticipates revenues in the band of $253-$256 million (mid-point $254.5 million), representing 17-18% year-over-year growth, down from the previous range of $268.5–$271.5 million (mid-point $270 million). The guided range at the mid-point is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $254.72 million.Similarly, non-GAAP earnings for 2017 are now expected to be between $1.02 and $1.06 per share, down from the earlier guided range of $1.18-$1.22. Its outlook for the third quarter as well as full year indicates that it will remain around 15%. This makes us slightly cautious about its future prospects.Intensifying competition from peers such as CA Inc. (CA  -  Free Report) and Microsoft Corp. (MSFT  -  Free Report), and an uncertain macroeconomic environment add to woes.So, it may not be a good decision to keep this stock in your portfolio anymore, at least if you don’t intend to wait for a long time.Stocks to ConsiderA better-ranked stock in the technology sector is Applied Materials, Inc.

These funds have been up 11.1%, 10.9% and 10.4%, respectively, so far, and have crushed the broad technology fund (XLK  -  Free Report) by a wide margin. XLK has gained 7.5% in the same time frame.A combination of other factors like a stabilizing PC market, waves of consolidation and expectation of solid corporate earnings are propelling semiconductor stocks higher.

366,AMAT,"Investors in Applied Materials, Inc. (AMAT  -  Free Report) need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Jan 26th 2018 $44.00 Put had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Applied Materials, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Applied Materials is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) in the Semiconductor Equipment - Wafer Fabrication industry that ranks in the Top 8% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter has moved from 98 cents per share to 97 cents in the last 60 days.Given the way analysts feel about Applied Materials right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Often times, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Each week, our very own Dave Bartosiak gives his top options trades.

367,AMAT,"Waters Corporation (WAT  -  Free Report) has a brilliant earnings beat streak, spanning 13 quarters of positive earnings surprises, which the company broke just once as it reported in-line earnings once last year. In fourth-quarter 2017, Waters Corp. continued its impressive trend, as the company’s adjusted earnings of $2.51 per share trumped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.44 by 2.9%.The bottom-line figure fared even better in year-over-year comparison, reflecting striking growth of 13.6% from the prior-year quarter tally of $2.21. Remarkable broad-based top-line expansion, along with spectacular growth in Europe, aided the earnings beat.Solid operational execution, backed by the company’s efficient business model, also lent strength to the results. Further, a decline in interest expenses aided quarterly profits.On a GAAP basis, Waters Corp. reported a loss of $4.44 per share compared with earnings of $2.15 in fourth-quarter 2016. The company’s GAAP profitability was adversely affected by a huge, one-time expense of income tax of about $550 million.For the full year, the company reported adjusted earnings of $7.49 per share, reflecting impressive growth of 14% over the previous year.Inside the HeadlinesIn the reported quarter, Waters Corp.’s net sales grew 9% year over year to $687 million and also came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $671 million. For the full year, revenues grew 7% year over year to $2.3 billion.The upside in the quarter’s top line came on the back of robust performance in the bio/pharmaceutical end markets (up 11% year over year), and the government and academic market (up 17% year over year). The momentum was further backed by 3% growth in the industrial end markets.Also, impressive contribution from sale of key products across major geographies supplemented quarterly sales growth. In addition, Water Corp.’s recurring revenues and instrument system sales climbed 12% and 7%, respectively, driving top-line growth.In terms of geographies, Waters Corp. witnessed strong sales in Europe, United States and Asia, which posted 16%, 9% and 7% growth, respectively.

The company’s total liabilities at quarter end increased to about $3.1 billion from $2.4 billion as on Dec 31, 2016.Our TakeWaters Corp.’s leading position in the high-performance liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry markets is its key strength that has acted as a sturdy revenue driver for the past few quarters. The company’s bright pharmaceutical business ended 2017 on a healthy note and looks set to continue its momentum into 2018 as well. It is also seeing encouraging trends in its industrial businesses. The governmental and academic markets have also turned its performance around and look poised to maintain the growth trend, in the coming quarters.Waters Corp.’s exposure in the pharma/biotech industry is primarily in regulated commercial lab environments, where demand is non-discretionary and not prone to cyclicality. This helps the company mitigate uncertain client spending stemming from macroeconomic volatility. Additionally, given the fact that liquid chromatography is used in a huge variety of applications, Waters Corp. is well poised to benefit significantly from this business in the near future.Zacks Rank & Key PicksWaters Corp. currently holds a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader sector include Nutanix Inc. (NTNX  -  Free Report), DXC Technology Company (DXC  -  Free Report) and Applied Materials, Inc. (AMAT  -  Free Report), each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

The company is well poised to gain from strong demand for more efficient manufacturing processes.Moreover, the technical complexity of manufacturing semiconductors and increasingly challenging yield issues are anticipated to drive growth from the company’s process control and yield management solutions.We believe solid customer demand for products across the four end-markets — Wafer Inspection (46% of shipments), Service (21%), Non-semi (3%) and Patterning (30%) — is anticipated to drive order growth in the upcoming quarter.For second-quarter fiscal 2018, KLA expects shipments of $945-$1.025 billion.

The growth was driven by expanded installed base and increasing demand for the upgrade and maintenance of legacy nodes.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues for the Service is currently pegged at $208 million.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Moreover, our proven model shows that KLA is likely to beat earnings due to the favorable combination of a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and +0.35% Earnings ESP.

370,AMAT,"The Q4 earnings season is off to a stellar start and is likely to pick up pace with more releases flowing in. This has helped most of the leading benchmark indices to trade near record highs. The stock market euphoria is likely to extend further on tax overhaul and relatively healthy job data, boosting corporate earnings, stoking investments and trickling down to employees in some instances.As investors employ a wait-and-see approach in a classic example of “backing and filling” in the market, they could benefit from ‘cash cow’ stocks that garner higher returns.However, singling out cash-rich stocks alone does not make for a solid investment proposition unless they are backed by attractive efficiency ratios like return on equity (ROE). A high ROE ensures that the company is reinvesting its cash at a high rate of return.ROE: A Key MetricROE = Net Income/Shareholders’ EquityROE helps investors distinguish profit-generating companies from profit burners and is useful in determining the financial health of a company. In other words, this financial metric enables investors to identify stocks that diligently deploy cash for higher returns.Moreover, ROE is often used to compare the profitability of a company with other firms in the industry — the higher, the better. It measures how well a company is multiplying its profits without investing new equity capital and portrays management’s efficiency in rewarding shareholders with attractive risk-adjusted returns.Screening ParametersIn order to shortlist stocks that are cash rich with high ROE, we have added Cash Flow greater than $1 billion and ROE greater than X-Industry as our primary screening parameters. In addition, we have taken a few other criteria into consideration to arrive at a winning strategy.Price/Cash Flow less than X-Industry: This metric measures how much investors pay for one dollar of free cash flow. A lower ratio indicates that investors need to pay less for a better cash flow generating stock.Return on Assets (ROA) greater than X-Industry: This metric determines how much profit a company earns for every dollar of asset, which includes cash, accounts receivable, property, equipment, inventory and furniture. The higher the ROA, the better it is for the company.5-Year EPS Historical Growth greater than X-Industry: This criterion indicates that continued earnings momentum has translated into solid cash strength.   Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Here are five of the 20 stocks that qualified the screen:CBRE Group, Inc. : Headquartered in Los Angeles, CBRE Group is a commercial real estate services and investment firm.

371,AMAT,"Lam Research Corporation (LRCX  -  Free Report) is slated to report second-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Jan 24. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 5.81%.The surprise history has been good in Lam’s case. The company surpassed estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 5.3%.The company’s shares have charted a solid trajectory in recent times, increasing 84% in the last year, outperforming the industry’s gain of 68.2%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderLam Research has high exposure to the memory segment, which is likely to witness strong growth in the coming quarters. The strength is driven by cloud computing, big data, mobile devices and IoT.The company is doing well and expects to succeed in areas such as device architecture, process flow and advanced packaging technology inflections.The company also continues to witness increased adoption rates for 3D NAND technology, FinFETs and multi-patterning. The company has undertaken cost-reduction activities and density scaling for 3D NAND and new memory technologies. All these factors could positively impact the top-line figure of the company.For the upcoming quarter, the company expects revenues of approximately $2.55 billion (+/- $100 million). The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $2.56 billion. Shipments are projected to be roughly $2.60 billion (+/- $100 million). The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $2.61 billion.However, volatility in the PC market remains a major concern. The weakness in the PCs could offset the expansion in the 3D NAND, impacting the upcoming results.Also, the company faces significant competition in all its product and service categories in the semiconductor capital equipment market.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Lam Research is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP:The Most Accurate estimate stands at $3.66 and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stands at $3.67. Hence, the difference is -0.27%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Also,Lamhas a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), which when combined with a -0.27% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions.Lam Research Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Lam Research Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Lam Research Corporation QuoteStocks to ConsiderYou could consider the following stocks with a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank:Applied Materials, Inc.

Also, Industrial market generated approximately 28%, up year over year. Increasing growth in infotainment content and factory automation products in the areas of interface and power management should continue to drive revenues in the upcoming quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is currently pegged at $619.9 million.Customer Concentration a Major HurdleHowever, the concentration of Maxim’s mobility revenues at Samsung is a major concern. Samsung’s projections and announcements, especially those related to its high-end models, where Maxim has greater exposure, could have a significant impact on Maxim’s performance.Moreover, Maxim’s exposure to the consumer and communications markets increases risks.Earnings Whispers?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Maxim will beat estimates this quarter.

373,AMAT,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM  -  Free Report) reported fourth-quarter 2017 earnings of 64 cents per ADR, which exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Further, it increased 13% sequentially and 5% year over year.Moreover, revenues increased 5.9% year over year and 10.1% sequentially. The increase was primarily driven by major mobile product launches and strong sales from cryptocurrency mining boom.Notably, shares of Taiwan Semiconductor have returned approximately 50.4% in the past year, outperforming the industry’s growth of 45.6%.Quarter DetailsNorth America accounted for 67% of the total revenues. Asia Pacific, China, EMEA (Europe, Middle East, and Africa) and Japan accounted for 7%, 13%, 7%, and 6% of the total revenues, respectively.By application, Communication, Industrial/Standard, Computer and Consumer increased 62%, 22%, 11% and 5%, respectively.The 10-nanometer (nm) process technology contributed 10% of the total wafer revenues. The combined 16/20-nm contribution was 25% of the total wafer revenues. The 65-nm contribution was 10% of the total wafer revenues.MarginsPer the press release, gross margin was 50%, up 10 basis points (bps) sequentially but down 230 bps from the year-ago quarter. The increase was due to a higher level of capacity utilization and inventory valuation adjustment, partially offset by margin dilution from higher 10nm contribution and an unfavorable exchange rate.Operating margin was 39.2%, up 30 bps sequentially but down 270 bps year over year.Balance SheetAt the end of the fourth-quarter, cash and marketable securities were NT$649.4 billion compared with NT$501.8 billion at the end of third-quarter.Cash flow from operating activities was NT$204.13 billion against NT$116.8 billion in the previous quarter.

374,AMAT,"Texas Instruments (TXN  -  Free Report) or TI is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2017 earnings on Jan 23 after the bell.We expect the company to perform well driven by strength in several high-margin, high-growth areas of the analog and embedded processing markets. It continues to prudently invest its R&D dollars in these areas. This is gradually increasing its exposure to the industrial and automotive markets and increasing dollar content at customers, while reducing exposure to volatile consumer/computing markets.We observe that shares of Texas Instruments have gained 60% over the past 12 months, outperforming the industry’s 49% rally.Expectations From AnalogTI’s analog business has been witnessing both sequential and year-over-year growth for the last four quarters. This was driven by strong performance in almost all the product lines. Last quarter, this segment generated $2.7 billion, up 12% sequentially and 16% from the year-ago quarter.We expect this trend to continue in the to-be-reported quarter, given TI’s compelling product line and manufacturing efficiencies that include growing 300-millimeter Analog output. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Analog segment revenues is currently pegged at $2.5 billion.Expectations From Embedded ProcessingThis segment has also been growing sequentially and year over year for the last four quarters, driven by growth across all product lines. Last quarter, it generated $931 million, up 7% sequentially and 17% year over year.This segment is also expected to do well in the to-be-reported quarter, as product lines remain strong. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Analog segment revenues is currently pegged at $853 million.Overall The company has always executed well. It, along with chipmaker Intel (INTC  -  Free Report), is one of the few semiconductor companies that depend on internal capacity for manufacturing the bulk of its devices.Since the company usually builds out capacity well ahead of demand, it is able to make opportunistic purchases. As a result, it is able to contain capex at up to 4% of sales even when it is expanding. Management remains focused on increasing free cash flow per share and strengthening competitive advantages.What Our Model SaysAccording to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or #3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive Earnings ESP. Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or #5) are best avoided.Texas Instruments has a Zacks Rank #2 and an Earnings ESP of +2.89%, which indicates a likely positive surprise.

375,AMAT,"Shares of Applied Materials (AMAT  -  Free Report) surged over 5% on Wednesday to inch closer to their 52-week high as the company gets off to a hot start in the New Year, following a stellar 2017.Now, as AMAT starts 2018 with a bang, investors might consider buying this Silicon Valley firm positioned to keep on growing as AI and the Internet of Things become more prevalent than ever.What AMAT DoesApplied Materials is one of the world’s largest suppliers of fabrication equipment to semiconductor, LCD, and solar PV cell manufacturers. The company was founded in 1967 and went public in 1972.The Santa Clara, California-based firm is currently divided into four major divisions: Silicon Systems, Applied Global Services, Display, as well as Corporate and Other. The company also boasts a venture capital leg, Applied Ventures LLC.Most Recent QuarterThe company closed its fiscal 2017 on a high note. Applied Materials posted record quarterly revenues of $3.97 billion in Q4, which marked a 20% year-over-year jump. On top of this outstanding top-line growth, the tech power saw its bottom-line expand by 63% from the year-ago period to reach $0.91 per share.For the full fiscal year, Applied Materials’ sales soared 34% to reach $14.54 billion. The company posted full-year  earnings of $3.17 per share and an operating income of $3.87 billion.“We have great momentum and we’re confident that in 2018 we can deliver strong double-digit growth across our semiconductor, display and service businesses,” CEO Gary Dickerson said in a statement.“This is the most exciting time in the history of the electronics industry. AI will transform entire industries over the coming years, creating trillions of dollars of economic value, and Applied is uniquely positioned to deliver the innovative materials needed to enable next-generation memory and high-performance computing.”Fundamentals Applied Materials is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and sports an overall “B” VGM grade.In terms of value, which can sometimes be missing at these multibillion-dollar tech firms, the company is currently trading at just 13.50x earnings. This marks a discount compared to the S&P 500 average, as well as the “Semiconductor Equipment – Wafer Fabrication” average. Applied Materials’ P/S and P/B ratios also both come in below its industry’s average.The company’s 2017 success can be attributed in large part to its traditional semiconductor business, which is expanding due to important design wins in the CVD and PVD tools markets. Applied Materials also stands to benefit as industries shift from LCD to OLED.Maybe more importantly, the firm grew its NAND business last year, driven by growth in cloud computing as a whole. Going forward, Applied Materials should be able to bolster its NAND semiconductor business further as big data and the Internet of Things become the norm and artificial intelligence continues to develop.Applied Materials’ current cash flow growth rate of 68.11% more than doubles the industry average and should help it invest in new technologies and industries on the rise, such as AI.Looking ahead to the first quarter of fiscal 2018, the company is expected to see its sales surge 25.16% year-over-year to hit $4.10 billion, based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimates. For the upcoming full year, Applied Materials is projected to see its revenues reach $16.90 billion, which would mark more than 16% growth over its record-setting 2017.Investors might be even more impressed by the company’s EPS growth projections. Applied Materials is expected to see its Q1 2018 earnings soar by nearly 45% while its full-year earnings are projected to pop by 24.31%. And the last time Applied Materials failed to match or beat earnings estimates was 2014.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

376,AMAT,"Netflix Inc. (NFLX  -  Free Report) is set to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Jan 22. The company has beaten the Zack Consensus Estimate twice in the past four quarters, delivering an average positive surprise of 1.25%.Last quarter, the company reported earnings of 29 cents per share, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 32 cents, but increased 141.7% year over year. Revenues increased 30.3% year over year to $2.985 billion and beat the consensus estimate of $2.973 billion. Subscriber growth primarily helped Netflix generate significant revenues.For the fourth-quarter of 2017, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Netflix’s earnings per share and total revenues are pegged at 41 cents and $3.259 billion, respectively, representing year-over-year increase of 173.3% and 31.5%.Notably, shares of Netflix have gained 66.7% in the past year, significantly outperforming the industry’s 19.2% rally.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderNetflix has been drawing strength from its growing portfolio of original content. The company had a very strong programming slate in the fourth quarter, given the new seasons of popular shows like Stranger Things and The Crown.  Its new original German series, Dark also garnered positive reviews.Per Nielsen data, which was quoted by Bloomberg, the movie Bright released in December and attracted 11 million views in the first three days of release. We believe all these will translate into an increase in subscribers. In October, the company announced that it had over 109 million subscribers globally.Netflix has also been ramping up its efforts to boost regional programming. This is expected to expand its international presence as the domestic market approaches saturation.We believe the strength of its content portfolio will drive subscriber growth across the globe. Per the latest report by SensorTower, Netflix topped the list of overall non-game apps by revenues across Apple’s App Store and Google’s Play Store in 2017.However, high costs that accompany the company’s rapid international expansion and production of original content might weigh on the bottom line.Netflix, Inc.

Also, shares of Lam have been steadily treading higher on a 12-month basis. The stock has returned 74.5% compared with the industry’s growth of 57.6%.Reason for the Hike?The analyst, Mehdi Hosseini, at Susquehanna, remains positive about the memory spending in the near future.The strength in memory spending will be driven by cloud computing, big data, mobile devices and IoT.

In other words, this financial metric enables investors to identify stocks that diligently deploy cash for higher returns.Moreover, ROE is often used to compare the profitability of a company with other firms in the industry — the higher, the better. It measures how well a company is multiplying its profits without investing new equity capital and portrays management’s efficiency in rewarding shareholders with attractive risk-adjusted returns.Parameters Used for Screening In order to shortlist stocks that are cash rich with high ROE, we have added Cash Flow greater than $1 billion and ROE greater than X-Industry as our primary screening parameters. In addition, we have taken a few other criteria into consideration to arrive at a winning strategy.Price/Cash Flow less than X-Industry: This metric measures how much investors pay for one dollar of free cash flow. A lower ratio indicates that investors need to pay less for a better cash flow generating stock.Return on Assets (ROA) greater than X-Industry: This metric determines how much profit a company earns for every dollar of asset, which includes cash, accounts receivable, property, equipment, inventory and furniture. The higher the ROA, the better it is for the company.5-Year EPS Historical Growth greater than X-Industry: This criterion indicates that continued earnings momentum has translated into solid cash strength.  Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Here are five of the 21 stocks that qualified the screen:CBRE Group, Inc. : Headquartered in Los Angeles, CBRE Group is a commercial real estate services and investment firm.

379,AMAT,"More often than not, investors wonder if the high price range has made the stock overpriced. While the apprehensions are not completely groundless, all stocks hitting a 52-week high are not necessarily high-priced.At the same time, a few investors regard the stock as an overpriced one at that level. While they are not entirely mistaken, all stocks hitting a 52-week high aren’t expensive.In fact, in order to avoid stocks that are trading near their 52-week highs, an investor might miss out on top gainers.A stock can continue the momentum and keep reaching new highs as time passes. So, a more informed approach to understand if any further upside is left is beneficial for assessing the stock.Here we will discuss a strategy to find the right stocks:Borrowing from the basics of momentum investing, this technique bets on the catchphrase “buy high, sell higher.”52-Week High: A Good IndicatorMany a time, stocks hitting a 52-week high are prevented from scaling higher despite robust potential due to the psychological bias of investors, who fear that the stocks are overvalued and a price crash is impending.In fact, overvaluation is quite natural for most of these stocks as investors’ special attention (or willingness to pay premium) has helped them achieve the level. But that doesn’t always mean an impending decline. The factors — such as robust sales, surging profit levels, earnings growth prospects and strategic acquisitions — that motivated investors to bet on these stocks could keep them motivated if there is no tangible negative. In other words, the momentum might continue.Also, when a string of positive developments dominate the market, investors find their under-reaction unwarranted, even if there are no company-specific driving forces.Setting the Right FiltersWe ran a screen to zero in on 52-week high stocks (trading near the high level) that hold tremendous upside potential. The screen includes parameters to shortlist stocks with strong earnings growth expectations, sturdy value metrics and price momentum.Moreover, the screen filters stocks that are relatively undervalued compared to their peers, in terms of earnings as well as sales, ensuring continuation of their rally for some time.Current Price/52 Week High >= .80This is the ratio between the current price and the highest price at which the stock has traded in the past 52 weeks. A value greater than 0.8 implies that the stock is trading within 20% of its 52-week high range.% Change Price – 4 Weeks > 0It ensures that the stock price has moved north over the past four weeks.% Change Price – 12 Weeks > 0This metric guarantees a continued upward price momentum for the stock over the past three months as well.Price/Sales <= XIndMedThe lower, the better.P/E using F(1) Estimate <= XIndMedThis metric measures the amount an investor puts into a company to obtain one dollar of earnings. It narrows down the list of stocks to those that are undervalued compared to the industry.One-Year EPS Growth F(1)/F(0) >= XIndMedThis helps choose stocks that have higher growth rates than the industry. This is a meaningful indicator, as decent earnings growth adds to investor optimism.Zacks Rank <=2No screening is complete without our proven Zacks Rank, which has proved its worth since inception. It is a fundamental truth that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) have always managed to brave adversities and beat the market. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Current Price >= 5This parameter will help screen stocks that are trading at $5 or higher.Volume – 20 days (shares) >= 100000Inclusion of this metric ensures that there is a substantial volume of shares, so trading is easier.Here are five of the 24 stocks that made it through the screen:Shutterfly, Inc. (SFLY  -  Free Report) manufactures and retails digital personalized products and services. It provides a range of products and services that make it easy, convenient and fun for consumers to upload, edit, enhance, organize, find, share, create, print and preserve their digital photos in a creative and thoughtful manner.

384,AMAT,"Premium technology company, Ubiquiti Networks, Inc. (UBNT  -  Free Report), recently rolled out its compact wearable camera, FrontRow, which can easily rival action camera maker, GoPro’s (GPRO  -  Free Report), Hero5 line. This also marks a bold move on Ubiquiti’s part to break away from the mould of an established enterprise networking equipment provider.Touted as “fully autonomous”, FrontRow weighs only 55 grams and can help consumers capture pictures and videos seamlessly. Powered by the Snapdragon 625 chipset, the monocle-shaped camera comes with 1.96-inch LCD display, 32 GB storage and 8-megapixel main camera & 5-megapixel front camera. FrontRow has been made Android-compatible.FrontRow can be worn using multi-purpose magnetic clip and third-party chains and Ubiquiti has plans to roll out other accessories including a car window mount and flexible coil mount. Also, it features three third-party live streaming apps including Facebook, Twitter and YouTube. The device can be linked to other popular applications like Dropbox and Spotify.FrontRow comes with a price tag of $400, comparable to GoPro’s Hero5 cameras which can be purchased for $399.  Also, Snapchat’s economically priced wearable camera sunglasses, Spectacles, which were launched last year, is likely to put up a tough fight against Frontrow. Other tech biggies including Alphabet Inc.  and Samsung have tried their luck in wearable tech, meeting with moderate to low success.According to latest numbers, Snapchat’s Spectacle sales have shrunk 35% during the second quarter, placing its future in jeopardy. It remains to be seen whether Ubiquiti’s FrontRow can carve out a niche of its own in the highly dynamic wearable tech space. FrontRow comes from the company’s consumer product division, Ubiquiti Labs, which offers mesh Wifi systems.Luckily for Ubiquiti, strategic product launches at disruptive prices have helped it trump rivals to a great extent. Ubiquiti ended fiscal 2017 on a high note and set an ambitious goal for the next year, driven by robust demand across segments. The company remains upbeat on the market traction of the newly launched products. Ubiquiti recorded an average return of 37.1% in the past three months, miles ahead of the industry''s flat trend.We believe that Ubiquiti’s excellent global business model, which is highly flexible and adaptable to any kind of change in markets, has helped it steer past challenges and maximize growth. Over the past few quarters, Ubiquiti has made significant investments in inventory to reduce lead times, meet increasing demand and support the growing number of customers. These efforts are also likely to stoke growth for the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company.A better-ranked stock in the sector is Applied Materials, Inc. (AMAT  -  Free Report).

385,AMAT,"The world’s largest online retailer, Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report), recently announced a private offering of bonds aggregating $16 billion.According to Informa Global Markets, this is the fourth largest high-grade debt offering of 2017. These bonds have been issued in seven tranches of different amounts and maturities, ranging from three-year notes to 40-year notes.Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase will act as lead underwriters for the offering.Price MovementAmazon is one of the leading players in the extremely fast-growing retail ecommerce market and its strength lies in its huge scale of offerings, its broad reach and platform approach.However, Amazon has underperformed the industry on a year-to-date basis. During this period, the company’s shares have increased only 30.4%, lower than the industry’s gain of 46.4%.The underperformance could be due to a spike in operating expenses as a result of buildout of fulfillment centers in preparation for the holiday season. The company’s increased spending on original TV shows and movies and offline retail has also been impacting its profits.Reason for the Debt IssueAmazon stated that the transaction proceeds will be used to fund its acquisition of Whole Foods Market, Inc. The amount will also be used to repay its 1.200% notes due 2017, and for general corporate purposes.In June, Amazon had announced that it had reached a deal to acquire leading natural and organic foods supermarket, Whole Foods Market, Inc.  for $13.7 billion. The deal, which is expected to conclude in the second half of this year, will open a window of opportunities for Amazon in the retail market. The deal will also help it counter competition, if it manages to get a first-mover advantage.Amazon’s Cash PositionAs of Jun 30, 2017, the company had total debt of $7.7 billion. Its cash equivalents and marketable securities balance were almost $21.45 billion, slightly down from the prior quarter. Also, the company generated $3.8 billion of cash from operations, spending $2.5 billion on fixed assets (including internal-use software and website development costs) and $633 million on acquisitions. Principal repayments of capital lease obligations were $1.2 billion in the second quarter.The new debts will carry a fixed rate of interest and will help the company to lower interest burden compared with the floating rate in the credit facility.Amazon.com, Inc.

388,AMAT,"3D Systems Corporation’s (DDD  -  Free Report) posted another huge earnings miss – its second after the last quarter’s huge miss ended its streak of three back-to-back quarters of impressive beats. The company reported adjusted loss (including share-based compensation expense) of 7 cents per share for second-quarter 2017, which was way below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of earnings of 6 cents.Non-GAAP earnings came in at 8 cents per share, plunging 33.3% from the prior-year quarter figure of 12 cents, as modest top-line growth was more than offset by a rise in operating expenses.In light of weaker-than-expected results, the company’s management tweaked the full-year 2017 guidance lower.Inside the HeadlinesThe 3D printer maker reported revenues of $159.5 million, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 0.9%. Strong demand for the company’s healthcare solutions, along with steady demand for the industrial offerings was largely offset by lower revenues from professional printers. The company also saw growth in production printers, materials, software and healthcare revenues, but lower sales in APAC restricted top-line growth. Revenues missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $163 million by a small margin.3D Systems’ Healthcare revenues were up 25% to $48.5 million year over year, primarily attributable to high demand for printers and materials from medical and dental customers. Software revenues totaled $24 million, up 9% on a year-over-year basis.Materials revenue rose 8% to $43.9 million, thanks to strong production orders and robust contribution from the previously acquired Vertex-Global. The company’s Printer revenues were down 14% to $28 million, while on-demand manufacturing decreased 5% to $26 million.In the quarter, gross margin contracted 30 basis points on a year-over-year basis to 50.6%. The company plans to drive further reductions in cost of sales from supply-chain betterment initiatives and manufacturing improvements, in order to drive margins higher.In addition, the company’s operating expenses flared up (up 4%) to $87.5 million, as R&D expense rose 17% year over year, mainly on account of a rise in focused investments in production application solutions, including Figure 4, metals and materials.Notable DevelopmentsDuring the first quarter, 3D Systems had rolled out a next-generation additive manufacturing platform, based on the company’s Figure 4 technology and NextDent materials. The company believes that the new platform will bring down cost of operations, reduce fabrication times and produce far less material waste.In the second quarter, 3D Systems launched the Simbionix SPINE Mentor, a hands-on simulated training and practice tool for minimally invasive spine surgeries. The company also released new products, materials and capabilities at RAPID + TCT 2017 to accelerate its leadership in plastic additive manufacturing.3D Systems Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise 3D Systems Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | 3D Systems Corporation QuoteProducts included the new ProJet MJP 5600, offering print speeds up to two times faster, a larger build volume, and part costs that are up to 40 percent less than competing multi-material 3D printers.The company also rolled out VisiJet CR-BK, a new rigid black plastic material for the ProJet MJP 5600 that enables producers to meet the most demanding product designs and models.Also, during the quarter, 3D Systems and United Therapeutics joined forces to develop solid-organ scaffolds for human transplants. The multi-year collaboration will integrate 3D Systems’ profound healthcare printing and precision expertise with the regenerative medicine and organ manufacturing capabilities of United Therapeutics Corporation.Cash Flow and Balance Sheet3D Systems ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $154 million, down significantly from $184.9 million as at Dec 1, 2016. At the end of June, net cash generated from operating activities came in at $18.4 million, significantly lower than the year-ago figure of $31 million.GuidanceConcurrent with the second-quarter 2017 earnings release, the company revised its guidance for full-year 2017. 3D Systems now anticipates revenues in the range of $643–$671 million, which would reflect year-over-year growth of 2–6% in 2017 (earlier projection: $643–$684 million).In addition, the company expects to report GAAP loss per share of around 14 cents for 2017 (compared to prior expectations of GAAP earnings of 2–6 cents per share), while non-GAAP earnings are now expected to be approximately 46 cents per share (earlier projection: 51-55 cents per share).To Conclude3D Systems’ year-over-year bottom-line improvements during second-quarter 2017 are attributable to a host of factors, including solid momentum of healthcare offerings, robust demand for production printers and materials, and higher efficiency in “demand manufacturing services”. We believe the acquisition of Vertex-Global Holding B.V will unlock multiple opportunities for the billion-dollar digital dentistry space.The company is banking on continued double-digit growth in healthcare and sustained growth in software and materials to drive 2017 growth. Even on-demand manufacturing and printer revenues are likely to return to growth.Also, the company’s efforts to streamline its cost structure by focusing on IT infrastructure, go-to-market and innovation are likely to stoke growth. In addition, the company remains bullish about the prospects of Figure 4 technology — the ultra-fast, modular Stereolithography system — designed for the production of plastic parts on the factory floor.Despite these positives, 3D Systems’ broader market concerns have thwarted growth of the premium 3D printing company. The industry is battling a widespread decline in demand for enterprise 3D printers over the past two years. Other headwinds, including economic slowdown, inflation, currency fluctuations and commodity price vagaries, also marred the performance of most players in the industry.3D Systems currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the same space include Lam Research Corporation (LRCX  -  Free Report), Applied Materials, Inc.

397,AMAT,"TrueCar, Inc. (TRUE  -  Free Report) is slated to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 15 after the bell. Last quarter, the company’s earnings matched the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Notably, TrueCar’s surprise history has been impressive with an average positive earnings surprise of 32.50%. In the last one year, the stock lost 17%, underperforming its industry’s gain of 16.4%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderTrueCar's revenues improved year over year in the last four quarters, while its losses narrowed. The company’s third-quarter revenues increased 10% from the year-ago quarter.

398,AMAT,"Shares of Applied Materials (AMAT  -  Free Report) closed relatively flat on Tuesday, just one day before the semiconductor equipment supplier is scheduled to report its latest quarterly earnings results. As a leading supplier to the red-hot chip manufacturing industry, Applied serves as a bellwether for the entire technology sector, and its report should attract plenty of attention on Wall Street.Applied Materials is one of the world’s largest suppliers of fabrication equipment to semiconductor, LCD, and solar PV cell manufacturers. The company also provides equipment used in the production of coatings for flexible electronics and services related to manufacturing processes and installation.The strength of the semiconductor industry over the past two years has well documented, and that means that suppliers like Applied Materials have benefitted too. In fact, shares of AMAT have moved about 40% higher in the past 52 weeks alone.But what does Applied Materials have in store for its latest report tomorrow? Let’s take a closer look.Latest OutlookBased on our latest Zacks Consensus Estimates, we expect Applied Materials to report adjusted earnings of $0.97 per share and revenues of $4.10 billion. These results would represent year-over-year growth of 44.8% and 25.2%, respectively.But of course, earnings and revenue are just two of the many things investors will be concerned with when Applied reports on Wednesday. It will also be important to track the company’s performance in its different business segments to get a better sense of what is driving growth right now.To prepare for this, we can turn to our exclusive non-financial metrics consensus estimate file. The Zacks Consensus NFM file contains detailed estimate data for business segment metrics and non-financial metrics reported by companies. The data is acquired from digest and contributing broker models and includes the independent research of expert stock market analysts.Our consensus estimate file is calling for AMAT to post total revenues of $2.84 billion in its Silicons division, which would represent growth of 32.1% from the year-ago period. The Silicons division includes Applied’s semiconductor-focused products and is the company’s largest in terms of revenue. Last quarter, Applied witnessed growth of just 14.1% in this segment.Meanwhile, our consensus estimates are projecting that AMAT will post total Services revenues of $791 million. That would mark growth of about 13.7% from the year-ago quarter. In the previous quarter, Applied saw growth of 19.9% in this unit.Earnings ESPInvestors will also want to anticipate the likelihood that Applied Materials surprises investors with better-than-anticipated earnings results. For this, we turn to our Earnings ESP figure.Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst estimates. This is done because, generally speaking, when an analyst posts an estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.A positive Earnings ESP paired with a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better ranking helps us feel confident about the potential for an earnings beat. In fact, our 10-year backtest has revealed that this methodology has accurately produced a positive surprise 70% of the time.Just one day before its report, AMAT is sporting a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and an Earnings ESP of 0.57%. This is because the company’s Most Accurate Estimate for earnings sits at $0.98 per share, meaning that the most recent analyst estimates have been higher than the consensus. This improved outlook is a good sign heading into the report.Price Performance and Surprise HistoryAnother important thing to consider ahead of AMAT’s report is the company’s history of earnings surprises and the effect that these surprises have had on share prices.Applied Materials, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Applied Materials, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Applied Materials, Inc. QuoteApplied Materials has an impeccable earnings surprise history and has not missed our consensus estimates since 2013. We have also witnessed the stock respond pretty well to these positive surprises, although this is far from a guarantee.Another thing to remember is that Applied will likely be taking a huge one-time charge related to the recent U.S. tax reform bill. This will result in a significant difference between GAAP and non-GAAP results, but the overall impact of tax reform could lead to favorable earnings guidance for the next few quarters.Want more analysis from this author?

400,AMAT,"Stocks opened lower on Tuesday morning, suggesting that celebrations over the end of the recent sell-off may have been premature. Markets looked prime to bounce back strong from their worst week in two years after Monday’s strong gains, but investors have again been reminded that volatility appears to be back in play.What is most interesting about the recent market volatility is that it comes on the back of a strong earnings season. Critics will point to large disparities between GAAP and non-GAAP results—created by one-time tax reform charges—as a reason to be skeptical, but revenue growth was truly impressive, and guidance was encouraging across the board.We have certainly moved past the busy stretch of Q4 earnings season, but a few marquee reports are still trickling in. Athletic retail giant Under Armour (UAA  -  Free Report) just announced its latest results this morning, and tech giants like Cisco Systems (CSCO  -  Free Report) and Applied Materials (AMAT  -  Free Report) are expected later this week.With that said, one of the best ways for investors to avoid the possibility of continued volatility over the next few trading periods is to target companies that are likely to outperform earnings estimates.

401,AMAT,"After experiencing a strong 2017, the hotel industry is likely to enjoy another successful year. A confluence of factors is working in favor of the sector at the moment. Firstly, the economy remains strong and the labor market continues to strengthen. Also, the recent jump in yearly wage growth bears evidence of the fact that the American consumer is likely to have even greater levels of disposable levels of income over the rest of the year.According to the recently released Deloitte 2018 Travel and Hospitality Industry Outlook, the hotel industry is likely to expand by 5-6% over 2018. This is likely to result in record gross bookings of around $170 billion.In January, a report by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) indicated that a strong economy and recent tax cuts would fuel the highest rates of occupancy for the hospitality industry since 1981. According to PwC, occupancy is likely to increase to 66.1% for hotels in the United States in 2018.With Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. (HLT  -  Free Report) and Marriott International Inc. (MAR  -  Free Report) both scheduled to report on Feb 14, this may be a good time to consider which of these is a better stock. Both stocks have a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Other major stocks reporting earnings on Feb 14 include Cisco Systems (CSCO  -  Free Report) and Applied Materials, Inc. (AMAT  -  Free Report).Price PerformanceWhen considering price performance over the last three months, Marriott has gained 13.2%, higher than the broader industry’s 9.9% increase over the same period. On the other hand, Hilton has gained 10.8% over this period, which exceeds the broader industry’s performance but falls behind Marriott.Current RatioThe hospitality industry requires a large quantum of working capital. Additionally, it also needs to service a number of short-term financial obligations. This is why liquidity ratios are an essential component of the industry’s analysis.The current ratio measures the ability of a company to meet short-term debt obligations. In other words, it is the ratio of the current level of total assets and expresses to that of the current level of liabilities. Here, Hilton is a clear winner with a current ratio of 0.94, which is superior to the industry average of 0.72 as well as Marriott’s reading of 0.53.Debt RatioThe hospitality industry is characterized by a high level of long term debt as well as current liabilities. Such high levels of debt are required to finance, maintain and operate large cruise lines as well. Given the high proportion of long term assets, debt financing over an extended period is a necessary requirement.Since the sector has a high level of financial leverage, debt ratios naturally come into the picture. This measures the ability of a company to services long term debt. Hospitality stocks should ideally have lower debt ratios. This implies that assets are present in higher proportion compared to debt over the long term.Here Hilton is at a disadvantage with a debt ratio of 46.5%, which is higher than the industry average of 41.1%. At 35.8%, Marriott has a debt component, which is lower than both Hilton’s as well as the industry.Dividend YieldIn the last one-year period, Marriott has provided a dividend yield of 0.95%, marginally higher than the industry average of 0.94. In comparison, Hilton offers a dividend of 0.73%. Hence, on a comparable basis, Marriott shareholders earned better dividend yield than those of Hilton.ValuationThe most appropriate metric to capital-intensive companies like hotels is the EV/EBITDA multiple. This ratio helps to overcome several of the drawbacks of the P/E ratio. This is because, unlike P/E, the EV/EBITDA ratio accounts for both the debt and shareholder perspectives.With an EV/ EBITDA value of 21.6, Marriott is clearly overvalued compared with the industry which as an EV/EBITDA value of 12.77. In contrast, Hilton is a cheaper stock with an EV/EBITDA value of 11.19.Gross MarginCompanies which are part of the hospitality industry generate billions of dollars of revenues. Additionally, several companies are well established which implies that appreciably high profit margins are generated by companies with differing market capitalizations.With a gross margin TTM value of 16.1%, Marriott underperforms its smaller rival Hilton on this count. On the other hand, Hilton sports a gross margin TTM value of 72.6%, which outperforms Marriott as well as the broader industry, which has a gross margin TTM value of 36.8%.Earnings History, ESP and Estimate RevisionsWhen considering Earnings ESP, Hilton is a clear winner with an ESP value of +0.13%, which is superior to Marriott’s reading of -1.11%. The situation is similar when comparing the increase in earnings estimates over the last thirty days. While Marriott’s estimate has increased by 2.1%, Hilton is better off on this count since its estimate has increased by 3.9% over the same period.Considering a more comprehensive earnings history, both Hilton and Marriott have delivered positive surprises in each of the trailing four quarters. However, Hilton has a superior average earnings surprise of 19.2% compared to Marriott’s figure of 9.1%.ConclusionBoth Hilton and Marriott carry a Zacks Rank #2, so there is little to choose between the two on this count. However, our comparative analysis shows that Marriott has an edge over Hilton when considering price performance, debt ratios and dividend yields.But when considering valuations, gross margins and current ratios, Hilton is a superior stock. Hilton is also ahead when considering their comprehensive earnings histories and estimate revisions.What clinches the case firmly in favor of Hilton is a superior ESP value of +0.13% than Marriott’s reading of -1.11%. This is why it may be a good idea to bet on Hilton over Marriott as they prepare to report earnings on Feb 14.  The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of All                 Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

402,AMAT,"Equinix, Inc. (EQIX  -  Free Report) is set to report fourth-quarter 2017 earnings results on Feb 14. This company has witnessed a remarkable streak of beating earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous four reports. In fact, in each of the trailing four quarters, Equinix surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate, with an average positive earnings surprise of 6.8%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.What to Expect?The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter is pegged at $4.80, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 17.7%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales of $1.19 billion indicates around 26.5% growth from the prior-year quarter.Factors at PlayEquinix is a global provider of network-neutral data centers, and internet-exchange services for enterprises, content companies, systems integrators, and network service providers. The company operates across various geographical regions and its increasing popularity among major tech industry players looking for data management will likely drive revenues in the fourth quarter.Acquisitions have been a major growth driver for Equinix and helped it expand its data-center capacity in many of the company’s key markets since 2003. We anticipate the company’s buyouts of data-center assets from Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ  -  Free Report), Telecity Group, Bit-isle and Nimbo to boost the top line in the quarter under review.Expansion in important markets and consolidation of facilities in existing ones have been important parts of Equinix's core strategy. We believe the company’s focus on offering upgraded technology to attract clients will bolster its revenues and profitability in the to-be-reported quarter.However, we remain slightly cautious about the huge capital outlays, which might dent Equinix’s fourth-quarter profitability. It should be noted that the company had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $1.629 billion, while the total debt principal outstanding was $10.12 billion as on Sep 30, 2017. Growing debt burden will affect the company’s profitability in the quarter as interest expense would flare up.Moreover, heightening competition from established internet data-center operators, such as AT&T (T  -  Free Report), Level 3 Communications, COLT and Verizon, will affect product pricing, thereby thwarting the company’s margins.Equinix, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Equinix, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Equinix, Inc. QuoteWhat the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Equinix is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Equinix carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%, as both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at $4.80. The combination of Equinix's Zacks Rank #3 and Earnings ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult.A Stock With Favorable CombinationHere is a company you may want to consider as our model shows that this stock has the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Applied Materials, Inc.

However, the figure remained unchanged on a year-over-year basis.Cisco missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues in three of the trailing four quarters. Revenues declined 1.7% year over year in the first quarter to $12.14 billion and were almost in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The decline was due to the transition to subscription-based model.Guidance & EstimatesFor second-quarter fiscal 2018, revenues are expected to increase in the range of 1-3% on a year-over-year basis. Non-GAAP earnings are anticipated between 58 and 60 cents per share.

407,AMAT,"Alibaba Group Holding Limited’s (BABA  -  Free Report) Taobao was recently put on United States Trade Representative’s (USTR) annual list of world’s most “notorious markets”, for the second consecutive year, along with 24 other online markets and 18 physical markets.Alleged sale of counterfeit products on the online shopping platform and the challenges faced by the right(s) holders in removing and stopping sale of such illegal products are the reasons  behind Taobao  being blacklisted.USTR said in its report, “A high volume of infringing products reportedly continue to be offered for sale and sold on Taobao.com and stakeholders continue to report challenges and burdens associated with IP enforcement on the platform.”Also, the agency recommended ways through which Alibaba Group can improve its position by stating, “Simplifying processes for right holders to register and request enforcement action; making good faith takedown procedures generally available; and reducing Taobao’s timelines for takedowns and issuing penalties for counterfeit sellers.”Moreover, it stressed on the fact that Alibaba’s efforts to protect brands and IP appeared to be more biased toward global brands, neglecting small and medium businesses.To defend the company, Alibaba’s President Mike Evans spoke up in a blog post, “In light of all this, it’s clear that no matter how much action we take and progress we make, the USTR is not actually interested in seeing tangible results. Therefore, our inclusion on its list is not an accurate representation of Alibaba’s results in protecting brands and IP, and we have no other choice but to conclude that this is a deeply flawed, biased and politicized process.”Notably, shares of Alibaba have gained 95.3% in the past 12 months, substantially outperforming its industry’s 61.9% surge.Our TakeAlibaba dominates the Chinese e-commerce market with a share of 80%. For some time, the company has been taking steps to strengthen its position outside China, especially in the United States. In pursuance of this strategy, Alibaba made its first foray into the U.S. retail market in June this year with the launch of a low-profile website with an American name — 11Main.com — a platform for smaller sellers to hawk their wares.The company has also dealt with lot of copyright and intellectual property infringement issues in the recent past and has closed 240,000 online stores on Taobao on suspicion of infringement last year. Moreover, the company said that it witnessed a sharp decline in the number of complaints after this move. In its annual report on intellectual property protection in 2017, the company claimed that transactions involving suspicion of fake goods went down to 1.49 out of every 10,000 transactions.The recent report may have a negative impact on the company’s reputation and its international expansion strategy, as it is making all efforts to strengthen its position in the United States. Also, the decision of blacklisting it will make it more difficult for the company to win the trust of U.S. and global brands.The e-commerce market in the United States is expected to grow at a double-digit rate over the next few years and if the company wishes to tap this growth, it’ll have to take some steps to improve its position.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderAlibaba has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Broadcom Limited (AVGO  -  Free Report), NetApp, Inc.

International Streaming revenues (44.5% of total revenue) soared 55.6% year over year to $1.327 billion driven by an increase in paid members in the third quarter. The company expects to add another 5.05 million international subscribers in the fourth quarter.Netflix’s investment in producing films is also beneficial for the company. The company’s portfolio of original films improved with the addition of Death Note, Naked and To the Bone to its platform in the third quarter.Per Nielsen data, which was quoted by Bloomberg, Bright released in December, starring Will Smith and Joel Edgerton, was made with a budget of $90 million. It went on to attract 11 million views in the first three days of its release.The company also stated that Bright had more international viewers than domestic ones. This bodes well for Netflix since it is looking to expand its international presence as the domestic market approaches saturation.Netflix, Inc. Revenue (TTM) Netflix, Inc.

QuoteMoreover, an original German series named Dark and the second season of The Crown series – based on the life of Queen Elizabeth II – launched by the company in the fourth quarter of 2017 are gaining popularity worldwide.Besides, the company’s upcoming eight-episode musical series named The Eddy shot in Paris and with dialogues in French and Arabic apart from English will help it attract more international subscribers.

410,AMAT,"Dutch technology behemoth, Koninklijke Philips N.V. (PHG  -  Free Report), recently announced an agreement to buy image-analysis software provider, TomTec Imaging Systems GmbH. Last month, the healthcare technology provider had announced the acquisition of two companies – CardioProlific and Spectranetics Corporation . All the three buyouts are likely to be conducive to Philips’ image-guided therapy portfolio.Philips boasts a large global installed base of customers and has earned a solid reputation among clients providing anatomical intelligence, ultra-mobile and portable ultrasound solutions.The company has been striving to fortify its foothold in the cardiac ultrasound market. The latest buyout will likely prove to be a significant step toward achieving this goal. Financial details of the deal have been kept under wraps.The Deal in DetailsThe acquisition is also expected to help Philips expand to other clinical areas, including obstetrics and gynecology. Germany-based TomTec specializes in diagnostic ultrasound that helps healthcare personnel to increase efficiency and diagnostic quality. Post this buyout, over 100 employees of TomTech will become part of Philips’ Ultrasound Business Group.Apart from helping to commercialize Philips-branded products, TomTec will continue its vendor-neutral product line and integrate these medical software applications into third-party systems. Philips’ ultrasound image quality, 3D-imaging and transducer technology portfolios are expected to benefit the most from TomTec’s clinical applications, workflow solutions, and research and development (R&D) capabilities.Acquisitions to Stoke Healthcare UnitOver the past two years, Philips has successfully morphed into a healthcare technology provider. To expand its presence in the domain, the company is increasingly turning to bolt-on acquisitions. The TomTec buyout marks the company’s seventh acquisition in the calendar year. Shares of the company have returned 21.4% in the last six months, outperforming the Zacks categorized Electronic-Miscellaneous Products industry’s average gain of 15.1%.Philips’ revenues have been encouraging in recent times, and these accretive buyouts should lend solid momentum to the unit’s growth in the quarter to come. Also, the company’s transformation from a hardware-oriented to a software-driven business, which is a higher-margin, recurring-revenue model, sits well with the investors.Connected Care Business Slowdown Plays a SpoilsportDespite these positives, the macroeconomic sluggishness is having a negative impact on the company’s growth drive. Some time back, President and CEO, Frans van Houten had expressed discontent about the pace of adoption of connected-care products. This is particularly alarming, considering the premium health-service provider has concertedly streamlined its massive business empire to focus mainly on healthcare.The present structure of insurance institutions, which focuses on reimbursing critical care, and not prevention of incidents, has played a major spoilsport in thwarting investments. Though Houten remains bullish about the long-term growth drivers, weakness in the connected-care businesses continues to pose as a major overhang for Philips, at least in the short run.In addition, the consensus analyst community is not favoring the stock as the Zacks Consensus Estimate for full-year 2017 earnings has gone down from $1.57 cents to $1.55, due to one downward estimate revisions versus zero upward.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader sector include Applied Materials, Inc. (AMAT  -  Free Report) and Applied Optoelectronics, Inc. (AAOI  -  Free Report). While Applied Materials sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Applied Materials holds a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

412,AMAT,"A prudent investment decision involves buying stocks that have solid prospects and selling those that carry risks. At times it is rational to hold certain stocks that have enough potential but are weighed down by tough market conditions. Here we have discussed Proofpoint Inc. (PFPT  -  Free Report), a stock with expected long-term earnings per share growth rate of 29.3% and Growth Style Score of ‘A’.In the last one year, Proofpoint has outperformed the Zacks Computer Software-Service industry. The stock has returned approximately 34% in the said period, outperforming the industry’s gain of just 24.6%.Let’s look at the reasons behindProofpoint’s solid momentum.Driving FactorsProofpoint reported better-than-expected results for top line in the first quarter and raised its outlook for 2017. Although the company’s bottom-line results fell short of estimates, the figure improved year over year.Proofpoint reported total revenue of $113.3 million, up 43.3% year over year, mainly driven by customer additions, improved add-on-sales and strong renewal rate. The company’s revenues also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $110 million and moved ahead of its own guidance range of $109–$111 million.The company’s adjusted loss per share narrowed year over year to 38 cents from 54 cents posted in the year-ago quarter. The year-over-year improvement was primarily stemmed by strong top-line growth and efficient cost management, which were partially offset by higher share counts.Proofpoint also raised it guidance for the full year. For 2017, the company anticipates revenues in the range of $496–$500 million, up from the earlier guidance range of $488–$492 million. Billings’ guidance for the year has been revised upward and is now anticipated between $619.0 million and $623 million. Earlier, the same was projected in the range of $611–$615 million.Similarly, non-GAAP earnings per share are now expected to be between 56 cents and 59 cents, up from the previous guidance range of 49–52 cents.Proofpoint is a leading security-as-a-service provider that focuses on cloud-based solutions for threat protection, compliance, archiving & governance and secure communications. The company’s sustained focus on launching products, acquisitions and partnerships have helped it to register more 40% revenue growth consistently for the last few quarters.According to a Markets and Markets report, the cyber security market will touch $202.36 billion in 2021 from $122.45 billion in 2016, representing a compounded annual growth rate of 10.6%. The favourable trend in the space is likely to aid Proofpoint’s financial results.ConcernsSince the company continues to invest in sales and marketing, we expect this to remain a drag on the company’s bottom line in the near term. Intense competition and an uncertain macroeconomic environment add to its woes.Bottom LineNotably, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company has shown an uptrend in terms of earnings as is evident from its average positive earnings surprise of 8.7% in the trailing four quarters.We believe that the stock still has much potential, which essentially filters the negatives and focus on the positives which drive price.Stocks to ConsiderFew better-ranked stocks in the broader broader technology sector are Applied Materials, Inc. (AMAT  -  Free Report), Broadcom Limited (AVGO  -  Free Report) and Applied Optoelectronics, Inc. (AAOI  -  Free Report), each sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Applied Materials, Broadcom and Applied Optoelectronics have a long-term expected earnings growth rate of 16.6%, 13.6% and 18.7%, respectively.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at $61.87 million. License revenue is anticipated in the range of $30–$30.5 million. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $8.5–$8.9 million, down from the earlier guidance of $10.9–$11.7 million.CyberArk  provided not-so-encouraging guidance for the second quarter, due to lower-than-expected business in Europe and the Middle East (EMEA). Udi Mokady, CEO of CyberArk, said, ""The primary reason for our revenue shortfall was our performance in EMEA, where certain deals that we anticipated would close did not close by the end of the quarter.""The company also predicted cash flow from operations to be around $29 million for the first six months of 2017. As of Jun 30,, cash, marketable securities and short term deposits are expected to amount $283 million approximately.Notably, the company is scheduled to report its full financial results on Aug 8, 2017.Price PerformanceThe stock has underperformed the Zacks categorized Security industry in the year-to-date period. While the industry has gained 23.2%, CyberArk has returned just 12.1%.Last WordsCyberArk is an Israeli company that specializes in protecting accounts from cyber-attacks. The company offers several products that protect passwords, close loopholes in the security system and secure cloud-based assets.While maintaining its earnings streak for the 11th consecutive quarter, CyberArk reported better-than-expected first-quarter 2017 results. However, in the last two quarters, the company reported the slowest revenue growth rate of around 25% since it was enlisted in Sep 2014. Prior to this, CyberArk witnessed more than 35% revenue growth every quarter.Moreover, intense competition from peers such as CA Inc. (CA  -  Free Report) and Microsoft Corp. (MSFT  -  Free Report) and an uncertain macroeconomic environment add to its woes.Given a healthy security market, we are optimistic about the company’s product lineup, deal wins and investment plans, which will boost results in the long run. Furthermore, CyberArk’s expansion strategy through acquisitions is encouraging. Investments in product suite and go-to market are the other positives for the company.Currently, CyberArk carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A better-ranked stock in the broader technology sector is Applied Materials, Inc.

415,AMAT,"Zacks Investment Research downgraded FUJIFILM Holdings Corporation (FUJIY  -  Free Report) to a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) from a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) on Jan 15, 2018. Going by the Zacks model, stocks carrying a Zacks Rank #4 are likely to perform weaker than the broader market in the next one to three months.Why the Downgrade?Fujifilm conducts its business in a highly competitive market. Extensive business rivalry makes consumers’ demand highly elastic and hence exposes the company to risks to market share loss. In order to boost up brand recognition within the competitive industry, Fujifilm stays under constant pressure to make newfangled research and development investments. However, lofty innovation expenses often weighs on the company’s aggregate margins, and proves to be futile if an innovation becomes obsolete.The company’s overseas businesses are exposed to risks of adverse foreign currency translations. For instance, in second-quarter fiscal 2018, revenues of Fujifilm’s Documents Solutions segment were hurt due to negative foreign exchange translation impact.Moreover, Fujifilm predicts that uncertain geopolitical environment in the overseas market (like unclear impact of the Brexit referendum in Europe) might weigh over its near-term profitability.We also notice that revenues of Fujifilm’s graphic systems business had dipped in second-quarter on account of reduced demand of major product categories such as CTP plates and graphic arts film. We fear that weaker demand might continue to hurt the company’s graphics business and hence depress revenues of its Information Solutions segment.Revenues of Fujifilm’s Documents Solution segment had dipped by almost 1% in second-quarter fiscal 2018 due to weaker sales generated from the Oceania end-markets. Sales of office printing business had dipped in Oceania, Japan and Asia; on account of an upward shift in price mix. Moreover, lower production services business in the United States and Europe has also weighed over the segment’s performance. Also, revenues of the company’s solutions and services business was also lower in the Asia and Oceania end-markets during the reported quarter. We fear that further downfall inOceania revenues might depress Fujifilm’s aggregate revenues in the upcoming quarters.The stock’s projected sales growth is 2.1% and EPS growth is 7% for fiscal 2018 compared to the respective tallies of 5.6% and 58.8% estimated for the industry. Notably, over the last 7 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Fujifilm has moved south for both fiscal 2018 and 2019, reflective negative market sentiments.   Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks within the sector are listed below:Analog Devices, Inc. (ADI  -  Free Report) currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). The company has pulled of an average positive earnings surprise of 16.34% for the last four quarters.

418,AMAT,"Technology stocks had a prolific run in 2017, courtesy of the rapid adoption of cloud-based platforms, increasing demand for Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools and significant progress in developing advanced driver assisted system (ADAS) solutions.Moreover, Augmented/Virtual (AR/VR) reality devices became part of the mainstream technology market driven by significant investments from tech bigwigs — Apple, Microsoft, Samsung and Facebook.Further, Internet of Things (IoT) technology made rapid strides in 2017. Consumer as well as industrial products and machines were embedded with sensor technology to process data or interact with other electronic devices.According to latest Earnings Trend, technology sector’s fourth-quarter earnings are expected to improve 14% from the same period last year on 8.5% higher revenues.Semiconductors Biggest GainersSemiconductors are primarily gaining from strong demand for power-efficient and high-performance chips. These are essential to run cloud-data centers and process massive data by using IoT analytics, machine learning and deep learning applications.Moreover, the rapidly expanding IoT market is driving growth for chip components to power applications, particularly ADAS, medical/healthcare and smart devices. Further, rapid development of 5G platform and technology has evolved as another catalyst for semiconductor providers.We believe that these emerging trends have provided much needed opportunity to semiconductor companies to offset loss of business due to the shrinking PC market which still consumes bulk of chips.According to Gartner’s latest data, PC shipments in the quarter were down 2% year over year to 71.6 million units. The downside marked the 13th straight quarter of year-over-year fall, which is the longest duration of decline in the history of the PC industry.However, IDC’s data contradicted Gartner’s figures due to different techniques used for tracking PC sales as well as the inclusion and/or exclusion of certain products. According to IDC, PC shipments touched 70.6 million units, marking year-over-year growth of 0.7% and outperforming the research firm’s previous prediction of a fall of 1.7%.Cyber Security Stocks in Focus2017 witnessed a plethora of cyber attacks. Two back-to-back ransomware attacks were reported — WannaCry or WannaCrypt in May and Petya in June — followed by the massive data breach at Equifax in September.In addition to these, the data theft and ransom paid by Uber disclosed in November fueled the bullish momentum of the stocks in this space. Notable companies like Mondelez, FedEx, Merck & Co. suffered from cyber attacks during the year, which may have a material impact on their financial performances.The frequency and severity of attacks have exposed the loopholes of the security systems deployed by enterprises worldwide. Further, with rapid technological advancement, organizations are increasingly adopting the “bring your own device” (BYOD) policy to enhance employee productivity with anytime/anywhere access. This trend, in turn, calls for stricter data security measures.These factors increased demand for advanced cyber security solutions that drove stock prices of cyber security companies in 2017.How to Make the Right Pick?With the existence of a number of industry players, finding the right technology stocks that have the potential to beat earnings can be a daunting task. However, our proprietary methodology makes it fairly simple for investors.You can narrow down the list of choices by looking at stocks that have the combination of a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) and a positive Earnings ESP.Earnings ESP is our proprietary methodology for determining stocks that have the best chance to surprise with their next earnings announcement.

419,AMAT,"Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report) is coming up with innovative ways to keep users hooked on to its products. Given that customers these days look for convenience when it comes to shopping, Amazon is taking every possible step to ensure that.The company recently announced that it has added four new device makers to the Amazon Dash Replenishment program, namely HP, Kenmore, 3M’s Filtrete brand, Epson, and Blustream.That’s not all. The e-commerce giant also announced the Virtual Dash Button Service (VDBS), a software development (SDK) kit. This kit allows third parties to add software-based reordering to screened devices instead of the physical Dash button play used previously, making it easier for brands to implement virtual versions of Amazon Dash Buttons on their connected devices.The SDK could be a great move by the company as it will expand the reach of its Dash program to many more screened devices, thereby increasing the number of reorder supplies.On a 12-month basis, Amazon has underperformed the industry it belongs to. The company’s shares have gained 56.9% compared with the industry’s growth of 59.3%.What is Dash Replenishment Program?This program enables connected devices to automatically order physical goods from Amazon when supplies are running low.This is a Prime-exclusive press-to-buy service. There are small wireless devices, each with a button, and linked to a particular product. Users can keep them anywhere in their homes and press one to get automatically place orders. The product reaches the customer on time. All it needs is a Wi-Fi connection.Our TakeAmazon has been focusing more on the platform approach. The company has attained the position of a top retailing platform where it acquires goods at a wholesale price and then retails them.It has the resources to drive out middlemen, who offer more to producers and also keep higher margins for themselves.

420,AMAT,"Seagate Technology Plc’s (STX  -  Free Report) shares have added about 4.1% in yesterday’s trading session, outperforming the market.In the last year, its shares have gained 41.4%, while the industry recorded growth of 31.7%.Will the recent positive trend continue driving the stock over the long haul or is it due for a pullback? Before we discuss how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the fundamentals and trends in order to get a better hold on the important drivers.Growth DriversSeagate recently announced preliminary results for the second quarter of fiscal 2018. The storage solutions provider expects higher revenues and margins in the quarter due to greater demand for its HDD products and operational efficiencies.It now expects revenues to be approximately $2.9 billion compared with an increase of 3-5% guided previously. The Zacks Consensus Estimates for revenues is pegged at $2.74 billion. The improvement can primarily be attributed to strong growth in exabyte demand.The company expects exabyte shipments to be roughly 88 exabytes, which reflects drive shipments to be around 40 million and average capacity per drive to be approximately 2.2 terabytes.Moreover, non-GAAP gross margin is anticipated to be 30%. Further, operating expenses on a non-GAAP basis are projected to be in the range of $390-$444 million. Previously, the company expected non-GAAP operating expenses to decrease 2-3% with cost cutting initiatives.According to Dave Mosley, Chief Executive Officer of Seagate, “Our revenue growth and strong portfolio profitability in the December quarter reflect solid demand for high-capacity mass-storage solutions, particularly for our cloud-based environments.”Another factor that bolstered share price was Seagate’s agreement with Toshiba, per which the latter will provide Seagate with NAND supply, consequently helping in innovation of hard disk drives (HDD), solid state drives (SSD) and hybrid solutions. This will improve competitive position in the flash memory market.Seagate is also gaining from the increasing adoption of its Nearline HDDs. We believe that Nearline’s rapid adoption will boost Seagate’s competitive position against Western Digital.Further, the company’s efforts in the improvement of areal density with the ramping up of its heat assisted magnetic recording (HAMR) technology are a catalyst.Notably, with the huge transformations in the storage industry mobile cloud is taking the center stage. This in turn has provided a boost to the deployment of high-capacity mass storage products, which is beneficial for Seagate.Upward Estimate RevisionsIn the last seven days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Seagate's current quarter and current year witnessed upward revisions. For the current quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at $1.27 per share, up from earnings of $1.15 per share earlier. Similarly, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current year is currently pegged at $4.28 per share compared with $4.06 projected seven days ago.Style Scores Look GreatMicron currently sports an A grade for Value, Growth and Momentum, lifting its overall VGM score to A.ValuationOn the valuation front too, the stock looks attractive. The company currently trades at a forward P/E multiple of 11.0x, significantly lower than the industry average of 16.4x. The ratio, which is obtained by dividing a stock’s current market price with its historical or estimated earnings, measures how much an investor needs to shell out per dollar of earnings. Consequently, lower the P/E of a stock, the better for investors.OutlookNotably, the stock carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). The company outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, delivering a positive average earnings surprise of 2.5%. Additionally, the stock has long-term earnings per share growth rate of 18.9%.To ConcludeIn our opinion, the stock deserves a place in investor’s portfolio and we are expecting an impressive return from the stock in the next few months.Some other top-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector include Applied Materials, Inc. (AMAT  -  Free Report), NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report) and Broadcom Limited (AVGO  -  Free Report), all sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

421,AMAT,"Investors often fail to think through sales growth as a dependable metric when it comes to picking winning stocks. This might be because of their preconceived notion that a company’s stock price is typically sensitive to its earnings momentum. However, betting on stocks completely depending on such a perception may not prove worthwhile.It’s worth keeping in mind that in cases when companies incur a loss, albeit transitorily, they are valued based on their revenues not earnings, as top-line growth (or decline) is usually an indicator of a company’s future earnings performance. In contrast with price to earnings and price to book value ratios, which can turn negative and cease to be relevant, the price-to-sales (P/S) ratio is available even for firms that have hit choppy waters.Further, a company can improve earnings by resorting to cost control measures while maintaining stable revenues. But superior profits could be achieved through continued revenue growth.Also, earnings and book value are largely influenced by several factors including accounting decisions tied with depreciation, significant charges and inventory. However, management has limited opportunities to manipulate sales, which further underscores the importance of P/S ratio.A huge sales number does not necessarily convert into profits. Hence, considering a company’s cash position along with its sales number can prove to be more prudent. Substantial cash in hand and a steady cash flow lend a company more flexibility with respect to business decisions and investments.Choosing the Winning StocksIn order to shortlist stocks that have witnessed impressive sales growth along with a high cash balance, we have selected 5-Year Historical Sales Growth (%) greater than X-Industry and Cash Flow greater than $500 million as our main screening parameters.But sales growth and cash strength are not the absolute criteria for selecting stocks. So, we added certain other factors to arrive at a winning strategy.Price-to-Sales (P/S) Ratio less than X-Industry: This metric determines the value placed on each dollar of a company’s revenues. The lower the ratio, the better it is for picking a stock since the investor is paying less for each unit of sales.% Change F1 Sales Estimate Revisions (4 Weeks) greater than X-Industry: Better-than-industry estimate revision has often been seen to trigger an increase in the stock price.Operating Margin (Average Last 5 years) greater than 5%: Operating margin measures how much every dollar of a company's sales translates into profits. A high ratio indicates that the company has good cost control and sales are increasing faster than costs, an optimal situation for the company.Return on Equity (ROE) greater than 5%: This metric will ensure that sales growth is translated into profits and the company is not hoarding cash. A high ROE means the company is spending wisely and is in all likelihood profitable.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Here are five of the 15 stocks that qualified the screening:Based in St. Petersburg, FL, Raymond James Financial, Inc.

422,AMAT,"Coupa Software Inc. (COUP  -  Free Report) recently announced plans of offering $200 million of convertible unsecured senior notes to enhance liquidity. The interest rate, conversion rate and certain other terms of the notes are yet to be determined.The notes will be offered to qualified institutional buyers only and in accordance with Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The company will also give the initial purchasers of the notes an option to buy up to an additional $30 million aggregate principal amount of the notes to cover any over-allotment.

The company will also utilize it to pay the cost of the capped call transactions.Notably, the stock has returned 28.7% in a year, slightly better than the 25.2% rally of its industry.Coupa’s Cash PositionThe enhanced capital deployment reflects Coupa’s strong balance sheet and confidence in long-term business prospects. The company exited third-quarter fiscal 2018 with cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $219.3 million compared with $208.3 million in the previous quarter. Cash flow provided from operating activities for the nine months ended Oct 31, 2017 came in at $21.5 million.We believe that the company has a strong balance sheet, which will help it in capitalizing on investment opportunities and pursuing strategic acquisitions, further improving growth prospects. Moreover, the senior notes offering will lower the company’s cost of capital, consequently strengthening balance sheet and supporting growth.Bottom LineCoupa provides unified, cloud-based spend management platform that helps enterprises keep a tab of daily expenditures.An expanding partner base is expected to drive top-line growth.

423,AMAT,"A successful investor understands the importance of retaining well-performing stocks in the portfolio at the right time. Notably, indicators of a stock’s bullish run include a rise in share price and strong fundamentals.International Business Machines Corp (IBM  -  Free Report) is one such technology stock that has been on healthy growth trajectory, of late. The company’s shares have returned 12.1% in the past three months, substantially outperforming the 10.3% rally of the industry.Let’s delve deeper and take a look at some of the factors aiding the performance.Positive Earnings Surprise HistoryIBM has an impressive earnings surprise history. The company outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, delivering a positive average earnings surprise of 3.4%.Further, it has a long-term expected EPS growth rate of 4.95%.Valuation Looks ImpressiveOn the valuation front too, the stock looks attractive. The company currently trades at a forward P/E multiple of 11.8x, significantly lower than the industry’s average of 74.4x. The ratio, which is obtained by dividing a stock’s current market price with its historical or estimated earnings, measures how much an investor needs to shell out per dollar of earnings. Consequently, the lower the P/E of a stock, the better it is for a value investor.Other Driving FactorsIBM is involved in a number of Blockchain initiatives as the technology gains rapid mainstream adoption. The company is currently the dominant player in the blockchain market. Recently, CNBC quoted Juniper Research, which placed IBM above Microsoft Corporation in blockchain-related advancements.The company uses hyperledger technology for its blockchain applications and is also a key member of the Hyperledger committee. This enables the company to gain access to prior notification of any changes in the underlying infrastructure.IBM has been winning significant deals in recent times. The company has struck bank guarantee deals with ANZ and Westpac as well as a multi-line insurance contract with American International Group and Standard Chartered PLC.It has also inked a deal with global food suppliers and another one with automobile manufacturer, ZF Friedrichshafen to enhance its Car e-Wallet technology.This apart, IBM is also focusing on cloud computing which is evident from the fact that it continues to open data centers aggressively. Globally, the company owns 60 data centers across 19 countries.The cloud computing market bodes well for IBM. Most recently, Forbes mentioned that the cloud computing market will be worth $162 billion in 2020 from $67 billion in 2015, at a CAGR of 19%.IBM remains focused on solidifying footprint in the market, which is evident from expanding data centers. The company recently opened data centers (two in London, one in San Jose and one in Sydney) that are equipped with the required cloud infrastructure to help clients develop cognitive artificial intelligence (AI) and Internet of Things (IoT).We believe this will improve IBM’s competitive position in the cloud computing market currently dominated by Amazon’s Web Services and Microsoft Corp.Risks RemainHowever, IBM is having a tough time, given the ongoing and heavily time-consuming business model transition to cloud.  Further, sluggish IT spending particularly on on-premise and data center hardware and foreign exchange volatility remain concerns.Moreover, intensifying competition in most of the markets is a major concern.Zacks Rank & Other Key PicksIBM currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector include Applied Materials, Inc.

424,AMAT,"ViaSat Inc.  announced that it has commenced beta service on the ViaSat-2 satellite, also affirming its plans for full commercial service launch next month. ViaSat-2, touted to have twice the bandwidth and seven times more broadband coverage, is a massive improvement over ViaSat-1 and has immense prospects.The above-mentioned service is anticipated to radically increase speeds, cut costs and expand the reach of broadband services across North America, Central America, the Caribbean, and a portion of northern South America as well. The ViaSat-2 satellite system is also expected to broaden its footprint in order to cover the primary aeronautical and maritime routes across the Atlantic Ocean between Europe and North America.Viasat has conducted several performance tests on the ViaSat-2 satellite and end-to-end network, and has demonstrated downstream speeds of more than 100 Mbps to production consumer terminals. Successful alpha testing demonstrates that the satellite ground network and other networking technologies are actually performing better than initially expected. Per initial tests, the company anticipates to grow its distribution channel significantly.ViaSat will continue the testing during the beta service period, in light of the fact that Boeing has identified an in-orbit antenna issue, which is causing some spot beams to behave differently than anticipated. However, ViaSat does not expect this to impact the coverage area of the satellite, or materially affect the planned services and the estimated economic results from ViaSat-2.The company will release more details on the ViaSat-2 service launch plans in its next earnings call, early next month.ViaSat has numerous growth drivers in place, at present. The company recorded stellar growth in government business, which was somewhat offset by contraction in the Commercial Networks revenues. Steady growth in in-flight connectivity services, mobile broadband, consumer ARPU gains and cost-reduction initiatives are proving conducive to the company’s growth.ViaSat’s stock has appreciated 18.7% over the past six months, ahead of the industry’s average gain of 6.3%.However, ViaSat’s recent earnings have been hurt badly by escalating research and development costs, and ramped-up expenses, ahead of offering subscribers service with its new high-speed satellite. The primary drivers of the high operating expenses are the ViaSat-3 payload, pre-flight development and testing, and commercial in-flight connectivity, STCs and line-fit activity. This indicates that we can see more pressure on profits in the upcoming quarters.Also, stiff competition in the industry proves to be a major growth deterrent for the company, particularly for its satellite services segment. The satellite services business is also highly affected by seasonality of demand due to traditional retail-selling periods.Overall, while we acknowledge that this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company has a robust foothold in numerous markets and is enjoying strong growth momentum, we feel its earnings are set up for more pressure in the quarters ahead.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader space include Comtech Telecommunications Corp. (CMTL  -  Free Report), Applied Materials, Inc. (AMAT  -  Free Report) and NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report), each sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.With four back-to-back, robust earnings beats, Comtech has a striking average positive surprise of 88.7%.Applied Materials has recorded an average positive surprise of 2.8% over the trailing four quarters, beating estimates all through.NVIDIA has an impressive earnings surprise history for the four preceding quarters, beating estimates each time, with an average positive surprise of 33.5%.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

425,AMAT,"Skyworks Solutions Inc. (SWKS  -  Free Report) unveiled a new suit of network-driven solution that supports wireless 5G networks called Sky5.Sky5 solution is a platform that deals with revolutionary 5G applications. According to the press release, “Our Sky5 solutions will address new 5G waveforms and spectrum, enhanced carrier aggregation, dual connectivity (4G/5G) and massive MIMO requirements while delivering unmatched levels of integration and performance, all underpinned by Skyworks’ intellectual property, operational scale and financial strength.”Advantage of 5GIts common knowledge that 5G has achieved rapid momentum over the past year. In the near future, operators will likely need to support zillions of Internet of Things (IoT) devices which are expected to be wirelessly connected. This has huge technical implications, and its implementation will entail huge time and costs.5G, which marks a revolution in the field of communications and technology, is anticipated to accumulate connections starting 2020. By 2021, there should be 25 million 5G connections worldwide. Moreover, 5G mobile handsets will be available for sale in the market by 2020, following a broader rollout of the technology.Moreover, per May 2017 Research and Markets report, the 5G network infrastructure market is expected to grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 70% between 2019 and 2025. This will ultimately account for $28 billion in annual spending by the end of 2025.The 5G network will provide 50 times the throughput of the currently available 4G LTE network. Further, 5G technology is designed to be more power efficient than any other standard wireless network. Consequently, such 5G-enabled solutions are likely to last longer than their 3G or 4G counterparts. Consequently,Skyworks is well-positioned to capitalize on the 5G based infrastructures with a rising demand for high-performance analog solutions in new markets.Bottom line The manufacturer of high performance analog and mixed signal semiconductors’ strength is further intensified by increased demand for highly integrated solutions as customers implement the next level of functionality for higher bandwidth.With a customer base comprising the likes of Cisco in MIMO gateways, Nintendo in its Switch Gaming console; Fitbit, Garmin and LG, the company is on strong growth trajectory. Notably, the upcoming 5G upgrade cycle is also a major positive.Skyworks’ shares have returned 29.9% in a year, substantially outperforming the industry’s rally of 22.7%. However, customer concentration remains a risk as a significant portion of Skyworks’ revenues comes from a handful of customers, particularly Apple. Moreover, slow growth rate of the smartphone market and piled up inventories with Chinese smartphone providers remain headwinds.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderSkyworks currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector include Applied Materials, Inc.

428,AMAT,"Applied Materials’ (AMAT  -  Free Report) price target was recently raised by 9% to $72 from $66 by Needham’s analyst Edwin Mok. The analyst also raised its rating from Buy to Strong Buy.Following the news, Applied Materials’ shares inched up 2.42%, eventually closing at $55.92. Also, shares of Applied Materials have been steadily treading higher on a 12-month basis. The stock has returned 70.6% compared with the industry’s growth of 63.7%.Why the Hike?The analyst at Needham remains optimistic about Applied Materials’ market dominance in the semiconductor space.The analyst believes that capital equipment spending has become less cyclical and the current wafer fab equipment (WFE) growth will continue in the near future, thus helping Applied Materials. He believes that the company's WFE mix is now more balanced in 2018 as logic and memory comprises 52% and 48% of Applied’s semiconductor business, respectively.Notably, the company has tasted considerable success in expanding beyond semiconductors, particularly in display.

429,AMAT,"The U.S. equity markets welcomed 2018 on a strong note as the Dow broke the historic milestone of 25,000 for the first time, while other leading benchmark indices scaled record highs on solid economic data across the globe. The stock market euphoria is likely to extend further on the corporate tax overhaul and relatively healthy job data.   As investors employ a wait-and-see approach in a classic example of “backing and filling” in the market, they could benefit from ‘cash cow’ stocks that garner higher returns.However, singling out cash-rich stocks alone does not make for a solid investment proposition unless they are backed by attractive efficiency ratios like return on equity (ROE). A high ROE ensures that the company is reinvesting its cash at a high rate of return.Why ROE?ROE = Net Income/Shareholders’ EquityROE helps investors distinguish profit-generating companies from profit burners and is useful in determining the financial health of a company. In other words, this financial metric enables investors to identify stocks that diligently deploy cash for higher returns.Moreover, ROE is often used to compare the profitability of a company with other firms in the industry — the higher, the better. It measures how well a company is multiplying its profits without investing new equity capital and portrays management’s efficiency in rewarding shareholders with attractive risk-adjusted returns.Parameters Used for ScreeningIn order to shortlist stocks that are cash rich with high ROE, we have added Cash Flow greater than $1 billion and ROE greater than X-Industry as our primary screening parameters. In addition, we have taken a few other criteria into consideration to arrive at a winning strategy.Price/Cash Flow less than X-Industry: This metric measures how much investors pay for one dollar of free cash flow. A lower ratio indicates that investors need to pay less for a better cash flow generating stock.Return on Assets (ROA) greater than X-Industry: This metric determines how much profit a company earns for every dollar of asset, which includes cash, accounts receivable, property, equipment, inventory and furniture. The higher the ROA, the better it is for the company.5-Year EPS Historical Growth greater than X-Industry: This criterion indicates that continued earnings momentum has translated into solid cash strength.   Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Here are five of the 15 stocks that qualified the screen:Waste Management, Inc. (WM  -  Free Report): Headquartered in Houston, TX, Waste Management is the largest provider of comprehensive waste management services in North America. The company provides collection, transfer, recycling and resource recovery, as well as disposal services to nearly 20 million residential, commercial, industrial and municipal customers.

430,AMAT,"On Jan 5, we issued an updated research report on technology firm, Amkor Technology (AMKR  -  Free Report).Amkor Technology is one of the largest providers of semiconductor packaging and test services. It packages and tests integrated circuits (ICs) for chip manufacturers, fabless semiconductor companies and contract foundries.Growth DriversAmkor has a well-diversified product portfolio, which will continue to drive Amkor’s revenue base. The most important among these is the growing demand for mobile devices. Amkor has been increasing its share in the mobile communications market. The rapid migration of features such as fingerprint sensors from the high-end into the mid range is a big positive. The company is also expanding its customer base with a particular focus on Greater China. The company’s strong market position and customer relationships in China are long-term drivers of its business. In the last reported third quarter, Amkor’s revenues of $1.14 billion increased 14.8% sequentially and 4.5% year over year.Amkor’s focus to channelize its resources in important growth areas like automotive is very encouraging. The increasing percentage of auto sales will lend stability to the business and offset any weakness in the more volatile consumer market (mainly mobile). Additionally, this is a higher-margin business and Amkor is witnessing an increasing number of design wins, which could mean stronger and more stable margins going forward. As per market forecasts, automotive market will grow in high single digit in the coming years. The growth is expected to be driven by increasing electronic content. Given its attractive value proposition for automotive customers, the company is poised to benefit from it.Amkor is quite active on the acquisition front. Last year, the company completed the acquisitions of J-Devices Corp and Europe's largest OSATS (Outsourced Semiconductor Assembly and Test Services) company Nanium S.A. These acquisitions are expected to strengthen Amkor’s product technology expertise and boost recurring revenues, going forward.Management is focused on improving gross and operating margins. The company is making efforts to improve its existing portfolio and acquire businesses over time that will aid its top and bottom-line trajectory. The company has also taken various restructuring activities which will help the company to lower the cost structure, leading to relatively steady gross margins.Positive Earnings Surprise History: Amkor has an impressive earnings surprise history. The company outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, delivering an average positive earnings surprise of 17.6%.HeadwindsNotably, Amkor has underperformed the industry on a 12-month basis. Shares of the company have gained approximately 4% compared with the industry’s growth of nearly 37% in the same time period.The company has a high fixed cost structure. Therefore, margins suffer a lot when sales fall. On the other hand, the structure is necessary to support an increase in demand. Additionally, Amkor has to spend a considerable amount of money on R&D to maintain its edge in innovation and recover margins that are high enough to continue this spend. Therefore, R&D expense has been increasing considerably over the years, impacting its bottom-line growth.Furthermore, though acquisitions are a part of Amkor’s growth strategy, unsuccessful execution and integration of new buyouts and an increase in acquisition costs due to stiff competition is likely to negatively impact its sales/margin performance.Amkor Technology, Inc. Price and Consensus  Amkor Technology, Inc. Price and Consensus | Amkor Technology, Inc. QuoteZacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderAmkor currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A few better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are Applied Materials, Inc. (AMAT  -  Free Report), PetMed Express, Inc. (PETS  -  Free Report), and SMART Global Holdings, Inc.

The deal will expand the MEP Engineering Solutions of the original equipment manufacturer of positioning, surveying and machine control products.The financial details of the deal have been kept under wraps.Based in the Netherlands, Stabiplan is a provider of 3D Computer Aided Design and Engineering software and Building Information Modeling (BIM) content to support the workflow from engineering to construction.The company’s solutions include Stabicad software and the MEPcontent BIM content library.

The stock has returned 40.5% compared with the industry’s growth of 22.1%.This was largely backed by the company’s aggressive merger and acquisition strategy.How Will The Deal Help?Acquisitions have helped Trimble in building a comprehensive portfolio, entering new markets and generating additional revenues.This acquisition, effective immediately, will enhance Trimble’s capabilities in serving its customers in the building and construction business. The deal will enhance Trimble’s capabilities in automated estimating, project management, modeling, detailing, layout and construction, allowing its clients to develop better technical installations. These new solutions will help MEP contractors and engineers to avoid wastage of time and work with more constructible and actionable models.Post acquisition, Stabiplan’s businesses will become part of Trimble's Buildings and Infrastructure Segment.

These being more macro-sensitive, allow a stable revenue stream and better profits.Also, these acquisitions are small compared to Trimble, so there have been no integration issues. Instead, the acquisitions facilitated market expansion and revenues buildup. The company also forms joint ventures to build positions in strategic areas.

433,AMAT,"Groupon Inc. (GRPN  -  Free Report) is set to release its fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 14. The question lingering in investors’ minds is whether this daily deals website operator will be able to post a positive earnings surprise in the to-be-reported quarter. Notably, the company’s last quarter earnings were in-line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. So, let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors to ConsiderGroupon has been trying to reduce its dependence on goods deals and is shifting its focus toward local services market. This is because local services market is a high margin business while goods deals bring in high revenues but smaller margins.The transition is hurting the company’s revenues as reflected in its third-quarter North American top-line performance, which witnessed a 14% year-over-year decline. Although the strategy will boost Groupon’s margins, we expect the strategy to negatively impact its revenues in the to-be-reported quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues from North American Goods division is pegged at $342 million for the fourth quarter, reflecting a decline of approximately 19% year over year.Groupon, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Groupon, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Groupon, Inc. QuoteWhat Does Our Model SayOur proven model does not conclusively show that Groupon is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Groupon carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) and has an Earnings ESP of -13.79%. Notably, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at 9 cents, representing year-over-year growth of 28.6%. However, analysts polled by Zacks project revenues of roughly $860.6 million, down approximately 8% from the year-ago quarter.Stocks to ConsiderHere are a few stocks you may want to consider as our proven model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Applied Materials, Inc.

434,AMAT,"Equifax Inc. (EFX  -  Free Report) is expected to report fourth-quarter 2017 results this week. The question lingering in investors’ minds is whether this credit information providing company will be able to post a positive earnings surprise in the to-be-reported quarter.Last quarter, the company posted a positive earnings surprise of 2.7%. Notably, Equifax outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters with an average positive earnings surprise of 2.4%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderWe believe last year’s data breach will continue to hurt Equifax’s fourth quarter’s financial results. Notably, in September 2017, the company announced that very sensitive personal data of approximately 143 million consumers has been stolen from its database.Since then, the brand image and creditability of Equifax has been in question and has been facing huge customer criticism, while cybersecurity companies are questioning the company’s preparedness and response to the massive data breach. Moreover, with lawmakers and investigating agencies probing the mishap, its troubles are unlikely to end any time soon.We believe the entire issue might result in loss of customers and the company will also have to make huge compensation to its clients. This will have an adverse impact on the company’s financial performance in the near term.It should be noted that in third-quarter 2017 the company had witnessed the slowest revenue growth rate in the last several years. This was mainly due to the dismal performance at its U.S. Information Solutions (USIS) division which registered a year-over-year 3% decline in revenues to $307.7 million, reflecting massive impact due to the data-breach scandal.Furthermore, escalating expenses related to the cyber attack will remain a drag on the company’s profitability. Per its 10-Q filing, the company expects to incur more expenses in the form of legal and professional services associated with the data-breach incident. Furthermore, it had stated that its expenses might flare up due to increased investments in IT and security solutions as well as insurance services.Equifax, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Equifax, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Equifax, Inc. QuoteWhat the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Equifax is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter.

You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Equifax carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company has an Earnings ESP of -0.29%. The combination of Equifax's Zacks Rank #3 and a negative Earnings ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at $1.35, representing year-over-year decline of 4.9%. We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate has remained unchanged over the past 30 days. Additionally, analysts polled by Zacks project revenues of roughly $824.9 million, down approximately 3% from the year-ago quarter.Some Stocks With Favorable CombinationHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Applied Materials, Inc.

438,AMAT,"Nikon Corporation’s (NINOY  -  Free Report) third-quarter fiscal 2018 earnings increased significantly over the comparable quarter last fiscal, as the company generated a net profit of ¥8.4 billion ($74.3 million) against a loss of ¥7.9 billion last year.Operating income for the fiscal third quarter came in at ¥18.4 billion ($162.8 million), versus an operating loss of ¥8.6 billion in the year ago quarter.For the first nine months of the fiscal, net profit attributable to owners increased 57% to ¥22.3 billion ($199.1 million) compared with year-ago quarter. Earnings per share for the first nine months of the fiscal improved 56.6% year over year.Further, operating income increased 123.1% year over year to ¥41.4 billion, supported by strong performance in the Precision Equipment and Imaging Products businesses.Inside the HeadlinesIn the quarter, Nikon’s net sales decreased 11.5% year over year to ¥196.8 billion ($1.74 billion). The top line was negatively impacted by decline of sales volume of digital camera-interchangeable lens type, compact digital cameras as well as FPD lithography systems.Nikon Corp. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Nikon Corp. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Nikon Corp. QuoteFor the first nine months of the fiscal, net sales fell 7.2% to ¥525.2 billion ($4.69 billion), due to negative growth in Imaging Products Business as well as in Precision Equipment Business, year over year.For the quarter, sales for the Precision Equipment Business recorded a decline of 33.6% year over year to ¥48.1 billion ($425.7 million). Revenues were offset by decline in sales volume of FPD lithography systems. Operating income at the segment rose to ¥8.4 billion, against an operating loss of ¥10.6 billion in the prior-year period. Operating income for the segment increased significantly on the back of improved performance in the semiconductor lithography system field.The Imaging Products Business witnessed a decline in sales as the top line shrunk 5.3% year over year to ¥116 billion ($1.03 billion). However, operating profit recorded an increase of 95.2% to ¥16.2 billion compared with ¥8.3 billion in the prior-year period. The unit’s operating profit improved on account of favorable response to the D850, a digital SLR camera in the market.Sales for the Healthcare Business recorded an increase of 6.1% year over year to ¥14 billion ($123.9 million). The units’ revenues were driven by impressive sales of ultra-wide field retinal imaging device in Europe and the United States. The segment recorded an operating loss of ¥1 billion, wider than the loss of ¥0.7 billion in the prior-year period. The figure was dragged by upfront investments in new businesses.The Industrial Metrology and Others delivered sales of ¥18.7 billion ($166.4 million) in the quarter, up from sales of ¥14.2 billion recorded in the year-ago period. This segment also recorded an operating profit of ¥1.6 billion, higher than the profit of ¥1 billion in the prior-year period.Liquidity & Cash FlowAs of Dec 31, 2017, Nikon’s cash and cash equivalents were ¥386.7 billion ($3.4 billion), up from ¥316.7 billion recorded a year ago.Total liabilities as of Dec 31, 2017, came out to be ¥557 billion ($4.9 billion), up from ¥480.2 billion as of Mar 31, 2017.GuidanceConcurrent with its earnings release, Nikon raised the guidance for fiscal 2018. The company now expects net sales to come at around ¥720 billion, up from previous forecast of ¥710 billion. The company anticipates sales and profit in the Imaging Products Business to be stronger than previously expected. Precision Equipment business profit is anticipated to rise in both FPD lithography system field as well as semiconductor lithography system field. However, in the Industrial Metrology and Others profit is expected to decline due to high restructuring expenses. This apart, the company raised forecast for operating profits, from ¥45 billion to ¥53 billion.Restructuring Plan & Business SegmentsEarlier, Nikon unveiled a plan to undertake company-wide structural reform, as it seeks to enhance operational profitability and create value.The restructuring was prompted by the fact that Nikon has not been able to derive value from its existing businesses. The company’s Imaging Product business has been grappling with foreign exchange headwinds.In light of the above scenario, Nikon planned to discontinue the current ""Medium-Term Management Plan Update."" Instead, it has initiated a company-wide restructuring to help shift to a strategy which pursues profit growth instead of revenue growth.The plan includes reassessment of the strategy of the Semiconductor Lithography and Imaging Product Businesses. Additionally, Nikon intends to optimize manufacturing, sales and R&D on a global basis along with streamlining and optimizing workforce. As part of the initiative, Nikon stated it will be declaring a voluntary retirement program for about 1,000 employees.Further, Nikon restructured its business segments during the fiscal second quarter. The company integrated two of its business units, Microscope Solutions BU and Medical Business Development Division into Healthcare BU, which falls under a separate, new segment named the Healthcare Business. Also, the Industrial Metrology BU was reclassified under the new Industrial Metrology and Others segment, along with Customized Products BU, Glass BU, and Encoder BU.The business structure was reorganized to facilitate collaboration and streamline operations.Our TakeNikon remains bullish on its Healthcare business along with Industrial Metrology and Others businesses. It expects these segments to act as strong growth drivers, going forward. The reorganized business structure is likely to facilitate collaboration as well as streamline operations.However, poor performance from Imaging Products business and Precision Equipment business remain headwinds. Also, high R&D expenditure and investments related to the medical business are escalating operational costs, consequently putting pressure on margins.Nikon currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Stocks to ConsiderA few better-ranked stocks in the same space include Aspen Technology, Inc. (AZPN  -  Free Report), Applied Materials, Inc. (AMAT  -  Free Report) and MKS Instruments, Inc. (MKSI  -  Free Report).

444,AMAT,"The semiconductor industry has been one of the outperformers of 2017. Notably, the iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF (SOXX  -  Free Report), which represents semiconductor stocks, has witnessed a year-to-date (YTD) gain of approximately 38.9%, while the Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLK  -  Free Report), which represents the overall technology sector, has returned 32.6% during the same time period. This gain is way higher than the YTD returns of 19.7% and 28.9%, respectively clocked by the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite.Micron Technology, Inc. (MU  -  Free Report) remains one of the outstanding performers in the semiconductor space. The stock has been clocking solid returns since the beginning of the year and has appreciated more than 92% in the YTD period. This robust performance has been mainly spurred by the company’s phenomenal results in last few quarters.Notably, this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, generating an average positive surprise of 10.2%. Micron recorded significant top- and bottom-line year-over-year growth, during this period, primarily driven by improved pricing as well as elevated demand for DRAM and NAND chips.Nevertheless, we fear Micron’s remarkable run might not continue into the next year as the stock’s forward price-earnings multiple is hovering near to its industry average. The company’s shares currently trade at a forward P/E multiple of 5.3x, while the industry average is 5.6x. Therefore, we believe the stock will definitely go up in 2018 but not as much as it did in the current year.Therefore, as we approach 2018, we should look for stocks that have the potential to record significant growth like Micron did in 2017.Other Picks in the IndustryAs the U.S. economy is rebounding, we believe there are tremendous growth opportunities for the semiconductor stocks in 2018. The industry is poised to benefit from the increasing demand for chips that are used in cloud-based platforms, Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools, Augmented/Virtual (AR/VR) reality devices, autonomous cars, advanced driver assisted systems (ADAS), as well as Internet of Things (IoT) related software and hardware.Also, the recently-passed Tax Cuts And Jobs Act will benefit the technology sector as companies across sectors might utilize savings from lower tax as well as cash repatriations for technological upgradation. This will again be conducive for the semiconductors space.Additionally, as per latest predictions from World Semiconductor Trade Statistics (WSTS), semiconductor sales are likely to increase 7% in 2018.Right now, the semiconductor segment has several promising stocks to choose from. Here we have picked four semiconductor stocks that have performed well in the year so far and have the potential to retain the momentum in the coming year as well. These stocks also have a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy), VGM Style Score of A or B, and lower P/E multiple than the industry average. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Four Promising StocksOur first choice is the world’s largest chip maker — Intel Corporation (INTC  -  Free Report). Though this stock came late to the party, it is poised to witness tremendous growth in 2018 due to its strategy of focusing on fast-growing data-centric business model. Notably, for the last few quarters, Intel has been benefiting from the robust performance of the Data Center Group, IoT Group, and Non-Volatile Memory Solutions and Programmable Solutions Group.Further, in a move to boost its PC market share, the company has been continuously bringing in new advanced products such as Xeon Scalable, Core 8 chips, Myriad X and next-generation desktop processors. The latest desktop processors are expected to back Intel's gaming endeavors amid stiff competition from AMD and NVIDIA.In addition, anticipated improvement in the company’s cost structure and lower spending, primarily due to its improving operational efficiency will aid in expansion of margins.The stock carries a Zacks Rank #2 and has a VGM Style Score of A. Moreover, Intel currently trades at a forward P/E multiple of 14.2x, which is lower than the industry average of 20.2x. Year to date, the company has gained 27.1%. (Looking for the Best Stocks for 2018? Be among the first to see our Top Ten Stocks for 2018 portfolio here.)Another pick is Lam Research Corporation (LRCX  -  Free Report), which supplies wafer fabrication equipment (“WFE”) and services to the semiconductor industry. The improving WFE market, strong demand for server DRAM and increased adoption rates of 3D NAND technology will continue to propel the company’s growth. The stock has rallied 74.3%, in the year so far.Based on the Zacks Consensus Estimate, Lam is anticipated to finish fiscal 2018 with EPS growth of 48% and sales growth of 50%. On top of this, the stock currently trades at a forward P/E multiple of 12.5x, which is lower than the industry average of 20.1x. Lam is a Zacks Rank #2 stock and has a VGM Score of B.Our next pick is Marvell Technology Group Ltd. (MRVL  -  Free Report), which is a promising player in the solid state drive (SSD) controllers market and has been benefiting from the rising demand for SSD products. The storage market is witnessing a steady increase in demand, given fast-growing data volume and especially exponential growth in unstructured data. We believe the company is well positioned to grab this opportunity.The stock carries a Zacks Rank #2 and has a VGM Score of B. Also, at a forward P/E multiple at 21.5x, the company currently trades at a huge discount to the industry average of 27.0x. The company has gained 57.5% in the YTD period.The next stock which makes to our list is Applied Materials, Inc. (AMAT  -  Free Report) which is one of the largest suppliers of fabrication equipment to semiconductor, LCD and solar PV cell manufacturers. The company is currently riding on inflection-focused innovation strategy — its key growth driver.It continues to witness technological advancements in semiconductor and display areas. Applied Materials is in a great position to grow sustainably and profitably, based on its robust pipeline of enabling technologies, supported by expanding opportunities on the semiconductor and display fronts. Also, 3D NAND, DRAM and patterning have led to significant market share gains.Applied sees significant opportunities from emerging trends on the semiconductor and display fronts, such as artificial intelligence, big data, cloud infrastructure, IoT, virtual reality and smart vehicles.The stock flaunts a Zacks Rank #1 and has a VGM Score of B. Also, at forward P/E multiple at 12.6x, the company currently trades at a huge discount to the industry average of 20.1x. Year to date, it has appreciated 58.2%.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time. It’s a once-in-a-generation opportunity to invest in pure genius.Click for details >>

445,AMAT,"Paychex Inc. (PAYX  -  Free Report) reported fiscal second-quarter 2018 results wherein the top line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate but the bottom line came in line with the same. However, the company registered year-over-year improvement on both the counts.Non-GAAP earnings per share of 59 cents increased 5% from the year-ago quarter.Notably, the stock has returned 10.6% on a year-to-date basis, outperforming 7% growth recorded by the industry.Quarter DetailsPaychex reported total revenues (including interest on funds held for clients) of $826.5 million, up 7% year over year. Excluding interest on funds held for its clients, total services revenues (Payroll service and Human Resource Services) were up 7% year over year to $812.5 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate was pegged at $823 million.Payroll Service segment revenues went up 1% from the year-ago period to $444.8 million, primarily on the back of higher revenues per check, which benefited from price increases and net of discounts. However, revenues were negatively impacted by a change in client base mix.Human Resource Services segment revenues rose 15% year over year to $367.7 million, chiefly driven by strong growth in client base across the prominent human capital management (HCM) services.Interest on funds held for clients increased 23% on a year-over-year basis to $14 million, mainly benefiting from higher average interest rates earned.Paychex’s total expenses rose 7% from the year-ago quarter to $494.3 million due to increased investments in technology and combined PEO business. Acquisition of HROI accounted for 5% of the total increase in expenses. Total expenses, as a percentage of total revenues, increased 20 basis points (bps) to 59.8%.Operating income grew 7% year over year to $332.2 million. However, Paychex’s operating margin decreased 10 bps to 40.2%.Adjusted net income surged 8% year over year to $437.2 million.Paychex, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Paychex, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Paychex, Inc. QuoteBalance Sheet & Cash FlowPaychex exited the fiscal second quarter with cash, cash equivalents and corporate investments of $338.6 million compared with $323.4 million recorded at the end of the previous quarter. The company has no long-term debt. For the first half of fiscal 2018, the company generated operating cash flow of $519.4 million.During the first two quarters, Paychex repurchased 1.6 million shares for $94.1 million. GuidanceThe guidance for fiscal 2018 provided at the end of the first quarter remains unaltered.Total revenues are expected to grow around 6%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at $3.35 billion.Payroll Services Revenues are anticipated surge between 1% and 2%.Human Resource Services revenues are projected to grow in the range of 12-14%.Operating margin is anticipated to be between 39% and 40%. Effective income tax rate, excluding any potential impact from tax reform legislation, is projected to be 35.0% to 35.5%.Interest on funds held for clients and investment income is expected to grow in the mid-to-upper-teen range.Net income is still likely to advance 5% year over year on a GAAP basis and 7% on a non-GAAP basis. Non-GAAP earnings per share are estimated to be up in the range of 7-8%, which comes to $2.35-$2.38. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at $2.37.Our TakeThe company’s top-line is benefiting from acquisitions. In the second quarter fiscal 2018, HROI which was acquired in August 2017, added 3% to total service revenue growth.However, the company is facing issues in retaining its customer base for the last few quarters, which is a major concern. Due to a challenging demand environment and modest decline in retention, the company’s payroll client base remained flat in the previous quarter. Additionally, political uncertainty, which in turn impacted outsourcing decision making in the mid-market, affected the company’s client base.Furthermore, increasing competition from industry peers like Automatic Data Processing, Insperity, Intuit, H&R Block, Broadridge Financial Solutions and DST System is another key concern.Currently, Paychex has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).A few better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are Western Digital Corp. (WDC  -  Free Report), Axcelis Technologies Inc. (ACLS  -  Free Report) and Applied Materials, Inc. (AMAT  -  Free Report), all sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

446,AMAT,"Accenture plc (ACN  -  Free Report) recently reported better-than-expected first-quarter fiscal 2018 results. The company posted earnings of $1.79 per share, which came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.66. Moreover, earnings increased from $1.58 per share reported in the year-ago quarter, mainly driven by higher revenues and lower share counts.The Accenture stock has rallied 29.6% year to date, outperforming 26.5% growth recorded by the industry it belongs to.Revenues and BookingsAccenture’s fiscal first-quarter net revenues increased 12% year over year to $9.52 billion and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $9.244 billion. In local currency terms, revenues grew 10% year over year.

It is worth mentioning that both Consulting revenues and Outsourcing revenues were up 11% and 9% in local currency, respectively.Among the operating segments, Communications, Media & Technology revenues went up 11% on a year-over-year basis to $1.87 billion.

Accenture reported $1.19 billion of net income compared with $1.06 billion reported in the year-earlier quarter.Accenture PLC Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Accenture PLC Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Accenture PLC QuoteBalance Sheet & Cash FlowAccenture exited the fiscal first quarter with a total Cash and cash equivalents of $3.68 billion compared with $4.13 billion in the preceding quarter. The company’s long-term debt balance at the end of the quarter was $22.2 million.Operating cash flow for the quarter was $1.01 billion, while free cash flow was $872 million.Share Repurchase and DividendIn line with its policy of returning cash to shareholders, Accenture repurchased 4 million shares for $563 million during the fiscal first quarter. The company’s total remaining share repurchase authority as on Nov 30, 2017, was around $2.6 billion.The company also paid a semi-annual cash dividend of $1.33 per share during the quarter.GuidanceFor second-quarter fiscal 2018, Accenture expects net revenues between $9.15 billion and $9.40 billion (mid-point $9.275 billion). The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $9.11 billion. The company did not provide any earnings per share guidance.Accenture raised its lower-end revenue guidance range for fiscal 2018. The company now estimates net revenues to grow in the range of 6-8% in local currency compared with the previous predicted range of 5-8%.Earnings per share on GAAP basis for fiscal 2018 are now projected in the range of $6.48-$6.66, up from the prior forecast of $6.36-$6.60.

Accenture expects operating cash flow of $5-$5.3 billion and free cash flow of $4.4-$4.7 billion.Our TakeAccenture delivered impressive first-quarter results, wherein the top and bottom lines, both, surpassed the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate and marked year-over-year improvement. In addition, the company provided encouraging second-quarter and fiscal 2018 outlook.The company’s long-term prospects look promising, driven by continued focus on innovative product roll outs, consistent investments in enhancing digital and marketing capabilities, along with major acquisitions. In addition, we believe regular acquisitions will significantly contribute to the revenue stream.However, Accenture’s announcement of creating 15K new jobs by 2020, and investment plan of $1.4 billion for employee training and opening of 10 innovation centers across U.S. cities may dent its bottom-line results, in our opinion.Additionally, increasing competition from peers such as Cognizant Technology Solutions (CTSH  -  Free Report) and IBM Corp. (IBM  -  Free Report), and an uncertain macroeconomic environment may deter its growth to some extent.Accenture currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).A better-ranked stock in the same space includes Applied Materials, Inc. (AMAT  -  Free Report), which sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

447,AMAT,"The Republican-led U.S. Senate managed to pass the tax bill, a big step in the direction of Trump’s promise to dramatically alter U.S. tax law. With corporate taxes likely to come down from 35% to 20%, expectations of higher corporate earnings and dividend payouts are likely to drive stocks.However, stock markets fell on the news with apprehensions over its probable effect on years of monetary policy stimulus and interest rates. As investors employ a wait-and-see approach in a classic example of “backing and filling” in the market, they could benefit from ‘cash cow’ stocks that garner higher returns.However, singling out cash-rich stocks alone does not make for a solid investment proposition unless they are backed by attractive efficiency ratios like return on equity (ROE). A high ROE ensures that the company is reinvesting its cash at a high rate of return.ROE: A Key MetricROE = Net Income/Shareholders’ EquityROE helps investors distinguish profit-generating companies from profit burners and is useful in determining the financial health of a company. In other words, this financial metric enables investors to identify stocks that diligently deploy cash for higher returns.Moreover, ROE is often used to compare the profitability of a company with other firms in the industry — the higher, the better. It measures how well a company is multiplying its profits without investing new equity capital and portrays management’s efficiency in rewarding shareholders with attractive risk-adjusted returns.Screening ParametersIn order to shortlist stocks that are cash rich with high ROE, we have added Cash Flow greater than $1 billion and ROE greater than X-Industry as our primary screening parameters. In addition, we have taken a few other criteria into consideration to arrive at a winning strategy.Price/Cash Flow less than X-Industry: This metric measures how much investors pay for one dollar of free cash flow. A lower ratio indicates that investors need to pay less for a better cash flow generating stock.Return on Assets (ROA) greater than X-Industry: This metric determines how much profit a company earns for every dollar of asset, which includes cash, accounts receivable, property, equipment, inventory and furniture. The higher the ROA, the better it is for the company.5-Year EPS Historical Growth greater than X-Industry: This criterion indicates that continued earnings momentum has translated into solid cash strength.   Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Here are five of the 13 stocks that qualified the screen:Accenture plc (ACN  -  Free Report): Headquartered in Dublin, Ireland, Accenture is one of the world’s leading providers of management consultancy, technology and outsourcing services. The company has a modest trailing four-quarter average positive earnings surprise of 2.6% and long-term earnings growth expectation of 10.3%. Accenture carries a Zacks Rank #2.Applied Materials, Inc.

448,AMAT,"Badger Meter, Inc. (BMI  -  Free Report) has been disappointing investors of late. Is it time for investors to offload this stock from their portfolio? Let’s delve deeper and find out.Estimates Moving SouthThe stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings as well as for 2018 being revised downward over the past 90 days, thus reflecting a negative outlook of analysts. For 2017, the consensus mark has dropped 7.1% to $1.18 per share and for 2018, declined 8.5% to $1.30.Price PerformanceShares of Badger Meter underperformed the industry over the past three months. The stock has gained only 2.8% compared with the industry’s growth of 8.4%.Negative Earnings Surprise HistoryThe company missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing four quarters. Further, it recorded an average negative earnings surprise of 3.33% over the last four quarters.Badger Meter, Inc. Price and Consensus  Badger Meter, Inc. Price and Consensus | Badger Meter, Inc. QuoteUnfavorable Zacks Rank and ScoreBadger Meter carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) and has an unimpressive VGM Score of D. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum. The score is a weighted combination of these three scores (Value: B, Growth: A, Momentum: B). Such a score allows investors to eliminate the negative aspects of a stock and select winners.Expensive ValuationBadger Meter's trailing 12-month price to earnings (P/E) ratio is 41.7, above the industry's average trailing 12-month P/E ratio at 21.4. This implies that the stock is overvalued.Disappointing Q3Badger Meter’s third-quarter 2017 earnings declined 10% year over year, affected by elevated brass and other costs. The bottom line lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Although sales in the quarter increased 3.9% year over year, the metric fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Municipal water sales, which represent around 75% of total third-quarter sales, were impacted by lower sales of residential meters and related technologies.Persistent HeadwindsBadger Meter continues to bear the brunt of rising copper prices, which will hurt its margin performance. Further, delayed orders of the ORION Cellular LTE endpoint will likely dent its municipal water sales in the next quarter. Also, the company noted that sales from the Middle East continue to be irregular in nature. Moreover, higher debt to total capitalization, short-term increases in inventory and higher quality-control costs remains concerns for the company.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the same sector are Applied Materials, Inc. (AMAT  -  Free Report), Allied Motion Technologies Inc. (AMOT  -  Free Report) and Analog Devices, Inc. (ADI  -  Free Report), each sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

449,AMAT,"(0:30) - Tech Rally Fades: Buying Opportunity or Value Trap?(4:40) - Tracey's Top Semiconductor Stock Picks(12:00) - Takeaways From Recent Sell Off(14:15) - Episode Roundup: Podcast@Zacks.comWelcome to Episode #71 of the Value Investor PodcastEvery week, Tracey Ryniec, the editor of Zacks Value Investor portfolio service, shares some of her top value investing tips and stock picks.Things were running smoothly for the technology stocks until December hit. Suddenly, investors and traders started selling the big technology names, including the FANG stocks, and putting the money into other sectors like retail and financials.The hardest hit technology industry, however, has been the semiconductors.They’ve been on a tear in 2017. The semiconductor ETFs are up about 36% year-to-date, and that’s even after the recent weakness. Some individual names are up over 100% in the last 12 months.Is this just profit taking and has it created a buying opportunity for value investors?Or is there something else lurking below the surface that could lead these stocks down the road of being value traps?Definition of a Value TrapRemember, a lot of stocks can look cheap. They may have low P/E ratios or the shares may have taken a dive, giving the illusion of cheapness.What investors need to look at is the “E” part of the equation.What are earnings doing? Are they on the rise or are analysts cutting them?A value trap is a stock that looks cheap but which has declining earnings so it’s not really as cheap as it seems.Tracey decided to take a look at 5 big semiconductor names to see if they were value stocks or value traps.5 Semiconductor Stocks: Are They Values or a Trap?1.     Nvidia(NVDA  -  Free Report) has fallen over 10% since the semiconductor sell off began but it hasn’t been a “cheap” stock in some time. Even with the sell off it still trades with a forward P/E of 45.2. However, for growth investors, is the big earnings growth story still intact?2.    Micron(MU  -  Free Report) actually reports earnings on Dec 19 so The Street will get an update on what the outlook is shortly. Last quarter, the company was still bullish on fiscal 2018 demand. Will they be this time? Shares are still cheap, with a forward P/E of only 5.2.3.    Applied Materials(AMAT  -  Free Report) has fallen over 12% since the semiconductor sell off began. And while one estimate has been cut for fiscal 2018 in the last 60 days, 9 have been raised in that time period. It still has attractive valuations with a forward P/E of just 12.6.4.    Lam Research(LRCX  -  Free Report) has gotten hit for a 15% pullback on the industry worries. That haven’t been any analyst cuts to the fiscal 2018 estimates while 6 estimates were raised over the last 2 months. It has a forward P/E of only 12.2.5.    Intel(INTC  -  Free Report) didn’t see as big of gains in 2017 as others but it also hasn’t sold off as sharply. Shares were down just about 3% on the semiconductor sell off. Analysts continue to be bullish with 14 estimates raised for both 2017 and 2018 while none have been cut.The semiconductor industry is diverse. Not all semis are created equal so investors need to do their research on each company.What else should you know about the semiconductors?Listen to this week’s podcast to find out.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

450,AMAT,"It has been a tale of two very different indexes so far on Monday, as the Dow Jones Industrial Average has surged higher on the back of the Senate’s tax reform deal, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite has slumped.The Dow’s rally today is being supported by continued strength in the financial sector. Index component JPMorgan Chase (JPM  -  Free Report) was up over 2.3% in morning trading, touching a new all-time high in the process.Meanwhile, investment banking behemoth Goldman Sachs, which is one of the most heavily-weighted members of the index, was up about 1.5% on Wednesday morning. Other notable Dow stocks in the green include American Express (AXP  -  Free Report), Disney (DIS  -  Free Report), and Procter & Gamble (PG  -  Free Report).Shares of Disney gained as much as 6% in morning hours after reports of reignited buyout talks between Disney and Twenty-First Century Fox (FOXA  -  Free Report) surfaced. According to the latest batch of rumors, Disney has started talking to Fox about purchasing some of its assets again, with a renewed focus on its fellow media giant’s TV and movie studios (also read: Why Shares of Disney, Fox & Comcast Surged Today).Led by these strong gains, the Dow gained about 1% in Wednesday morning trading, touching an intraday high of 24,534.04 in the process. On the other hand, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite dove as much as 0.5% to reach an intraday low of 6,798.48.The Nasdaq’s sluggishness comes as investors continue to transition away from the technology sector, which has dominated Wall Street for the majority of 2017.More specifically, it looks like the red-hot semiconductor industry is starting to cool off, as shares of companies like Micron Technology (MU  -  Free Report), Applied Materials (AMAT  -  Free Report), and Nvidia (NVDA  -  Free Report) have all dropped significantly over the past few trading periods.Before this selloff, the Nasdaq had soared about 30% on the year, eventually settling at a new all-time high in late November. That run-up was inspired by another strong earnings report season, but now it appears that many investors are cashing out of the sector—with strong profits from this year’s rally.Additionally, the tech sector is still viewed as a high-volatility area by many investors, and recent geopolitical news may be forcing people towards more “safe and sound” options. Despite sector-wide earnings and revenue growth, Wall Street is quick to jump out of volatile areas when the threat of crisis looms—and it is probably fair to say that North Korea’s recent missile testing has caused that threat to rise.Want more stock market analysis from this author?

452,AMAT,"Investors in Applied Materials, Inc. (AMAT  -  Free Report) need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Dec 1, 2017 $47.00 Put had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Applied Materials shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Applied Materials is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) in the Semiconductor Equipment - Wafer Fabrication industry that ranks in the Top 2% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 30 days, six analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while none have dropped their estimates. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from 91 cents per share to 98 cents in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Applied Materials right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options? Each week, our very own Dave Bartosiak gives his top options trades.

453,AMAT,"Several semiconductor stocks were hit yesterday after Morgan Stanley downgraded several memory chip makers on concerns of falling NAND prices and weak earnings growth projection for 2018.Analyst Shawn Kim of Morgan Stanley noted that NAND flash memory chip prices are peaking but may start declining from the beginning of next year due to a supply glut. Notably, over the past year, NAND prices have been flaring up due to shortage of supply. Kim has a cautious stance as the supply-demand mismatch will diminish over the next few months. He further projects that there will be no material earnings growth for memory chip makers in 2018 due to fall in NAND prices.Based on these projections, Morgan Stanley lowered its ratings for three semiconductor companies which have high exposure in the NAND memory-chip space — Western Digital Corp. (WDC  -  Free Report), Samsung and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Ltd. (TSM  -  Free Report). In a note to clients, Kim wrote, “We think now is the time to reduce exposure to NAND [flash memory] and Asian semiconductor names as the industry has benefited from sizable demand tailwinds and unprecedented pricing power, which we see reversing soon.”He further stated, ""Given our view of the cycle, we cannot recommend the sector until the market recognizes mounting pressure on NAND prices and slowing logic chip growth momentum in the near term… This reflects our negative view of prospects for the global memory industry, which is currently at a peak.""Semi Stocks Face the BruntThe recent rating downgrade and comments on the future prospects of memory chips adversely impacted several chip makers, sending the companies’ shares to close in the red on Nov 27. The iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF (SOXX  -  Free Report), which represents the entire semiconductor performance, closed 1.3% lower yesterday.Among stocks, Western Digital and Taiwan Semiconductor were the biggest losers — the companies’ shares plunging 6.7% and 4.4%, respectively. Chip equipment manufacturers like Lam Research (LRCX  -  Free Report) and Applied Materials (AMAT  -  Free Report) also took the punch, recording a decline of 2.7% and 1.7%, respectively.Another memory-chip maker — Micron Technology (MU  -  Free Report) — also faced the brunt of the rating downgrade despite having little exposure to NAND. The stock lost approximately 3.3% of its value yesterday even after Morgan Stanley raised its target price. Also, Kim’s encouraging remarks on its main segment —DRAM — failed to boost its performance.Kim noted that investors should not worry about Micron as the supply-demand dynamics for DRAM are still in favour of the company and price of DRAM will top-out in mid 2018. Morgan Stanley reiterated its overweight rating on the stock.Cash in Your Investment Ahead of the FallKim’s recent comments reflect that the industry is nearing end of the super cycle, where memory-chip makers have enjoyed a remarkable run til last Friday. Therefore, it is wise to cash in your investment before the stocks start tumbling drastically.Citing Morgan Stanley’s analysis, Kim mentioned that investors should offload their holdings three to six months before the memory prices peak.Memory-chip providers Western Digital, Taiwan Semiconductor and Micron Technology have rallied 27.4%, 42.8% and 119.2%, respectively, year to date. This implies that exiting here will generate a good return unless you may lose your money.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

454,AMAT,"Alibaba Group Holding Limited’s (BABA  -  Free Report) financial arm Ant Financial has imposed a ban on consumer loans with annual interest rates above 24% from its Alipay platform, with China tightening regulations related to the Internet lending industry.We observe that Alibaba stock has gained 114.2% year to date, substantially outperforming the 65% rally of the industry it belongs to.China’s government is trying to cut down problems associated with online loans such as abusive collection methods, default risks and diversion of loan funds to real estate market.Ant Financial’s move comes on the heels of People’s Bank of China and China Banking regulatory commission’s decision to impose stricter regulations on Internet micro loans that have been proliferating over the past year taking advantage of weak regulations. The government has asked provincial authorities to suspend issuance of new licenses for online consumer loan companies and stop the non-compliant ones.What’s Behind the MoveAnt Financial said in a statement,” Our inspections discovered that products recommended by a few merchants on Lifestyle have problems such as interest rates that exceed the legal limit and inappropriate collection methods.”So basically, the move appears to be part of Ant Financial’s efforts to impose better monitoring and remove inferior loan offerings from its platform. It has asked all to perform self-checks by Nov 30.Alibaba Group Holding Limited Revenue (TTM) Alibaba Group Holding Limited Revenue (TTM) | Alibaba Group Holding Limited QuoteNotably, China’s Supreme People’s Court ruled in 2015 that collection of loans with annual interest rate up to 24% would be enforced by the courts. Interest rates of up to 36% are legally allowed but collection would not be enforced by courts. Lenders have to find their own collection methods in case of default.That being said, the move underscores a conservative approach on Ant Financials’ part to preserve its ongoing partnerships under a situation where it is still not clear how regulators will act.We believe that increased government regulations will affect Alibaba and Ant Financial backed Chinese online lender, Qudian. This U.S. listed company offers small cash and merchandise credit products to college students and young workers.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderAlibaba shares currently carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector include Activision Blizzard (ATVI  -  Free Report), Applied Materials (AMAT  -  Free Report) and Twitter (TWTR  -  Free Report), each carrying a Zacks Rank #2.

456,AMAT,"Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report) faces a fresh set of allegations from German automaker Daimler AG over sale of counterfeit products in its marketplace.In a lawsuit filed in the U.S. District Court in Los Angeles, Daimler alleged Amazon of trademark infringement and claimed that the company sells fake Mercedes-Benz wheel center caps. The lawsuit also claimed that Amazon has not taken steps to handle the infringement issue.“Amazon’s sale of the infringing products causes significant damage to Daimler,” the complaint states. “For example, sales of the infringing products decrease sales of authentic Mercedes-Benz wheel center caps, and tarnish Daimler’s reputation for quality and excellence. The infringing products are of substantially inferior quality than authentic Daimler wheel center caps.”The companies have been at loggerheads since April last year when Daimler sued Amazon in a district court and then the U.S. International Trade Commission (USITC) for selling fake Mercedes-Benz wheels from 10 distributors. Both the companies decided to stay the district court case until the USITC case reaches conclusion.In August this year, Daimler asked for a resumption of the lawsuit in a Washington federal court stating that the USITC case was resolved with key issues still undecided.Though there are no comments from Amazon on the current lawsuit, the company usually argues that it cannot be held responsible for infringing activities of its third-party sellers. The company claims that it has zero tolerance for the sale of counterfeit items.We observe that Amazon shares have gained 52% year to date, underperforming the industry’s 62.9% rally.Our Take The growth of the e-commerce industry, with consumers increasingly buying things online, is a dynamic going in favor of Amazon. While big brands may build their own online stores over time, a platform like Amazon allows discovery of new buyers.Amazon.com, Inc. Net Income (TTM) Amazon.com, Inc. Net Income (TTM) | Amazon.com, Inc. QuoteSmaller players are far more dependent on Amazon as they don’t have the resources to invest in technology and fulfillment to generate the kind of reach that Amazon can deliver. Amazon’s platform is currently being used by more than 2 million independent sellers.Moreover, the market is in the early growth phase (considering opportunities in international markets. So, the company’s high growth rates are likely to be sustained over the next few years.But that should not make Amazon overly confident about its online business. When brands hit by counterfeit charges lose sales and potential customers, the ripple effect will also be felt by Amazon and earn it a bad name.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderAmazon carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

459,AMAT,"Many investors like to look for momentum in stocks, but this can be very tough to define. There is great debate regarding which metrics are the best to focus on in this regard, and which are not really quality indicators of future performance. Fortunately, with our new style score system we have identified the key statistics to pay close attention to and thus which stocks might be the best for momentum investors in the near term.This method discovered several great candidates for momentum-oriented investors, but today let’s focus on Applied Materials, Inc. (AMAT  -  Free Report) as this stock is looking especially impressive right now. And while there are numerous ways in which this company could be a great choice, we have highlighted three of the most vital reasons for AMAT’s status as a solid momentum stock below:Longer Term Price Change for Applied MaterialsWhile any stock can see a spike in price, it takes a real winner to consistently outperform the market. That is why looking at longer term price metrics—such as performance over the past three months or year-- and comparing these to an industry at large can be very useful.And in the case of AMAT, the results are quite impressive. The company has beaten the industry at large over the past 12 weeks by a margin of 32.1% to 18%, while it has also outperformed when looking at the past year, putting up a gain of 83.8%. Clearly, AMAT is riding a bit of a hot streak and is worth a closer look by investors.Applied Materials, Inc. Price  Applied Materials, Inc. Price | Applied Materials, Inc. QuoteQuarter EPS Estimate Change for Applied Materials StockWhile looking at price performance or full year earnings can be essential to understanding a momentum stock, you shouldn’t forget about the current quarter EPS and the trend in estimates there. This change can signal how a stock might perform in the next earnings season, which is obviously vital for momentum investors.Right now, AMAT is seeing a nice trend over the past month when it comes to this quarter’s earnings estimate projections. In the time frame, EPS estimates for Applied Materials have gone up by 6.9% compared to an industry average move of 0.9%, suggesting that not only is AMAT heading in the right direction, but it is seeing an increase relative to the industry too.AMAT Earnings Estimate Revisions Moving in the Right DirectionWhile the great momentum factors outlined in the preceding paragraphs might be enough for some investors, we should also take into account broad earnings estimate revision trends. A nice path here can really help to show us a promising stock, and we have actually been seeing that with AMAT as of late.Over the past two months, eight earnings estimates have gone higher compared to one lower for the full year, while we are also seeing that five estimate has move upwards with no downward revision for the next year time frame. These revisions have helped to boost the consensus estimate, as two months ago, AMAT was expected to post earnings of $3.65 per share for the full year, though today it looks to have EPS of $3.93 for the full year, representing a solid increase which is something that should be welcome news to would-be investors.Bottom LineGiven these factors, investors shouldn’t be surprised to note that we have AMAT as a security with a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and a Momentum Score of A. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.So if you are looking for a fresh pick that has potential to move in the right direction, definitely keep AMAT on your short list as this looks be a stock that is very well-positioned to soar in the near term.Wall Street’s Next Amazon Zacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

465,AMAT,"Baidu, Inc. (BIDU  -  Free Report) raised the curtains on Raven series AI-powered hardware at the 2017 Baidu World yesterday. Raven H is the company’s AI-based smart home assistant that is due for a wider rollout in China in December.The device has been developed in collaboration with Swedish consumer electronics manufacturer, Teenage Engineering and is powered by Baidu’s own DuerOS platform. Danish audio systems maker, Tymphany is in charge of providing the high-end audio components.The Chinese tech giant also unveiled raven R, an automated six-axis robot and claimed that it possesses emotional intelligence. Its Raven Q is a concept AI Home Robot still under development. The company plans to implement technologies like simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), voice recognition and natural language processing, and computer vision to raven Q going forward.The three launches are part of Baidu’s “All in on AI” strategy aimed at ramping up its artificial intelligence efforts. We observe that Baidu shares have rallied an impressive 45.6% year to date, significantly outperforming the industry’s 24.6% surge.What’s New in Raven H?There’s not much information except the fact that the design is unique. It is not like other smart speakers that have that have an orthodox cylindrical structure. Baidu, Inc. Net Income (TTM) Baidu, Inc. Net Income (TTM) | Baidu, Inc. QuoteRather, the palm-sized gadget looks a lot like eight colorful (red, blue, green and orange) plastic squares stacked above one another. The top-most square becomes a forward-facing LCD screen when tilted upward. It can be also detached completely and used as a touch-sensitive remote or a portable microphone.The gadget costs $256 (1699 yuan), considerably higher than competing products like Alphabet’s (GOOGL  -  Free Report) Google Home, Alibaba’s (BABA  -  Free Report) Tmall Genie, JD’s Dingdong or any of the Echo variants from Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report).It seems that Baidu is not at all interested in price competition despite its late entry in a market that’s already has several branded smart speakers. In fact, at the moment, it’s difficult to say what’s actually the selling point or functionality that gives it an edge over rival products.That’s because, at the launch, Cheng Lyu, General Manager of Baidu’s Intelligent Hardware Unit, spent very few words on the product’s functions and spoke more on design and hardware. There is no information on international launch plans.Third-Party Contracts Coming in QuicklyThis is important when it comes to smart speakers as third-party contracts not only help penetrate potential business areas but also attract more customers.Baidu collaborated with InterContinental Hotels Group (IHG  -  Free Report) to install Raven H in 100 rooms at its Beijing Sanlitun hotel.The company also partnered with interior design platform Jia.com to offer patrons home décor solutions.Zacks Rank and Other Key PicksBaidu carries a Zacks Rank 2 (Buy).
