Tuesday's move aims to add 10% tariffs to another $200 billion in annual products, listed in a 205-page document released late Tuesday.  U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer's office plans four days of public hearings on the expanded sanctions, beginning Aug. 20.China pledged to lodge a complaint with the World Trade Organization, and urged other countries to join it in protecting free trade.

2,MRO,"Just how bad will the U.S.' slap-fight over trade, which escalated with China on Friday, be for S&P 500 earnings and stocks? Just how much can the U.S. economy, which delivered solid June jobs growth on Friday, still grow after a nine-year expansion?Analysts expect another blowout quarter in Q2 — 20.7% earnings-per-share growth for S&P 500 index components and an 8.1% jump in revenue, according to Thomson Reuters. Wall Street is betting on continued scorching results for the rest of the year. But they may not be as scorching if President Donald Trump's trade wars with China, Canada, Mexico, Europe and others become more heated. The quiet earnings growth next year might be even more muted.Analysts say the effects of a trade war have yet to be priced into financial forecasts.""I think the first tangible impact should start showing up in estimate revisions as these earnings results come out,"" said Sheraz Mian, director of research at Zacks.In other words, the second-quarter earnings season could offer some higher drama than CEOs' usual blanched remarks about ""headwinds"" and ""tailwinds."" Investors, even more than usual, will focus on earnings guidance and post-earnings call commentary to get some answers as to how the tariffs will affect profit, sales, prices, corporate strategy and shareholder returns.Higher costs for parts and supplies that U.S. companies bring in from overseas could mean higher costs for customers. Businesses could rethink or even uproot complex global supply chains. Higher prices on U.S.-made goods sold overseas could crimp international demand. Companies could cut or delay major investments.S&P 500 index companies, filled with hundreds of U.S. multinationals and exporters, are more exposed to tariffs and global demand than the U.S. economy itself.As for the second-quarter itself, the gains from S&P 500 companies come courtesy of President Trump's tax cuts and an enduring U.S. economy.Rebounding oil prices will lift the energy sector's Q2 earnings by around 141.5%, with sales up some 20%, according to Thomson. S&P 500 energy stocks, which include Dow Jones giants Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX) as well as ConocoPhillips (COP), Valero (VLO), Marathon Oil (MRO), Schlumberger (SLB) and many others, have generally been strong performers.Analysts expect the S&P 500 financials to clock a 22% gain in earnings on a 4.5% bump in revenue, as JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and other banks enjoy lower taxes and deregulation. Thomson forecasts semiconductors and internet software and services to lead the S&P 500 tech components toward 25.5% earnings growth. Tech revenue is seen jumping 12%. Apple (AAPL), Intel (INTC), Amazon.com (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX) and Facebook (FB) are all slated to deliver solid-to-stellar growth.As estimates stand now, Thomson Reuters is forecasting the 20%-plus earnings growth to reach into the third and fourth quarters.""The last time we had earnings growth in Q3 and Q4 like this was in 2010,"" Tajinder Dhillon, senior research analyst at Thomson Reuters, said in an email.However, looking past 2018, analysts appear to have a harder time justifying bullish expectations for S&P 500 companies.""You look at the numbers going forward, you really don't start to see a significant drop in growth until you get into 2019, when again, you'll be back to apples-to-apples on the tax rates,"" said John Butters, senior earnings analyst at FactSet.But tougher comparisons aren't a massive concern right now, analysts say. And next year's growth still looks solid. Dhillon said that for 2019 investors can expect a 9.7% earnings growth rate, ""which is still higher than the 20-year average of 7.3%.""Wall Street also worries that the U.S. economy has fewer tools at its disposal to keep its marathon run going. The dollar is stronger. The yield curve is flatter due partly to the Federal Reserve's decisions to lift short-term interest rates.The narrowing yield curve, the gap between rates on short-term and long-term government debt, looms large for banks in particular. The flatter curve, also seen as a precursor to an economic downturn, has dragged bank stocks lower in recent months.Banks also lend money to borrowers based on long-term rates, but borrow from depositors according to short-term rates. The narrower the difference between the two, the narrower the banks' net interest margins. JPMorgan, Citigroup (C) and Wells Fargo (WFC) report second-quarter earnings on Friday.The three banking giants, which all announced hefty shareholder-return packages last month, are expected to deliver solid EPS growth. But JPMorgan stock, along with that of Citigroup, Wells Fargo and others, is near 2018 lows.When the Fed raises rates that affects the money flowing into global, emerging markets as well.""If U.S. interest rates are going up,"" Mian said, ""and an investor or a class of investors is scouring world markets for yield and returns, and if the yield and return is going up in a developed market like the U.S., then there's no reason to take the extra risk of going to Argentina or Turkey when you can get it in the U.S.""The U.S. on Friday lobbed tariffs at $34 billion worth of Chinese products — more than 800 types of products total. That's the first part of a $50 billion response for what Trump says are China's trade abuses against the U.S.The U.S. tariffs target aircraft parts, industrial parts and equipment, some vehicles and other machinery. The duties from the U.S. targeted products related to China's tech-focused ""Made in China 2025"" plan. Trump has said that initiative would ""hurt economic growth for the United States and many other countries.""""The United States can no longer tolerate losing our technology and intellectual property through unfair economic practices,"" Trump said in a statement last month.China on Friday responded with penalties of its own on U.S. products, including automakers and agriculture. China aimed those tariffs squarely at Trump's base.Trump has threatened to levy another $200 billion in tariffs on China, and even more. Meanwhile, Trump has threatened to impose a global import tariff on autos. That follows duties on steel and aluminum that have spurred Europe, Canada and Mexico to retaliate.Further trade discord could force companies to rethink their supply chains. Those adjustments could undo corporate America's efforts over the past two decades to more efficiently manage their inventories. Such practices over that time firmed up businesses' balance sheets.The brinkmanship has swept up some of the most iconic American businesses along the way. General Motors (GM) said as much last week, warning that more tariffs would lead to ""reduced presence at home and abroad for this iconic American company.""Harley-Davidson (HOG) said it would offer more detail, on its earnings call this month, about its plans to move some production out of the U.S. to skirt tariffs from the EU. Brown-Forman (BFB) is raising the price of Jack Daniel's in parts of Europe because of the tariffs imposed by the EU.No one knows how the Trump trade wars, and their impact on S&P 500 companies, will play out.""We expect company-specific risks from tariffs and China-trade exposures to be a central discussion topic during 2Q18 earnings calls,"" RBC analyst Deane Dray, who covers industrials vulnerable to steel and aluminum tariffs, wrote in a note last month. ""But no one has a crystal ball on how the tariff situation will ultimately play out, especially the potential knock-on effects.""He said companies like 3M (MMM) and Danaher (DHR) looked best equipped among industrials to handle the trade disputes.The trade war also threatens chipmakers like Micron (MU). A Chinese court blocked sales of some of its chips in the country, a move seen as pushback from the nation against Trump's trade salvos. China has held up approving the Qualcomm (QCOM) takeover of NXP Semiconductors (NXPI). Boeing (BA) isn't subject to China tariffs, but Beijing could favor Airbus (EADSY) jets in a protracted U.S.-China trade war. The aerospace company in April downplayed worries over a trade war.Baird analyst Benjamin Hartford covers transportation and logistics companies like UPS (UPS), FedEx (FDX) and Expeditors International (EXPD). Hartford wrote in a research note last month that he'd seen no ""material evidence (yet) of freight volume weakness amid rising global trade tensions.""Some analysts, like Tigress' Ivan Feinseth, expressed optimism that strength in corporate earnings would offset any trade damage. Others wonder how much a trade war will hurt corporate travel for the likes of global carriers like American Airlines (AAL) and Delta Air Lines (DAL), and cargo demand broadly. Delta Air earnings are due Thursday.""We still expect demand to grow, but those expectations are dampened with each new tariff introduced,"" Alexandre de Juniac, CEO of the International Air Transport Association, said of air cargo demand in a statement this week.

Privacy Policy & Terms of UseOil prices were volatile ahead of the closely watched meeting of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. OPEC and partners, including Russia, to discuss production strategy. Prices reversed higher, with Brent crude up 1.6% to $74.25 per barrel and West Texas intermediate rising 1.3% and trading above $66 a barrel. Prices rose despite reports that Iran had softened its opposition to an agreement to increase production, making a boost in oil supply more likely.Much like the central banks that stimulated their economies through buying bonds and holding down interest rates, OPEC and Russia agreed in November 2016 to reduce oil output to bolster glut-weakened oil prices. The strategy was effective and, like the central banks that have gradually tapered their stimulus programs, OPEC appears set to release the cap on its production.How quickly they might do that is the question global energy and financial markets are asking. An analyst quoted by the Houston Chronicle said that a production increase of less than 500,000 barrels a day would be bullish for the oil market.  The Saudis have recommended a 600,000-barrel-per-day boost. Some industry watchers are looking for a hike nearer to 1 million barrels per day.U.S. domestic oil markets have not valued in much of a change.

The stock ended Thursday's session up 262% from its May 2017 IPO price.Among FANG stocks, Amazon.com reversed an early loss and rose 0.3% ,as investors showed only a mild reaction to new reports of a second shake-up in the company's marketplace operation. Peter Faricy, vice president of Amazon Marketplace, was reportedly stripped of authority. Retail group head Doug Herrington had reportedly taken over much of Faricy's role. In March, Marketplace Senior Vice President Sebastian Gunnigham resigned and joined WeWork.Amazon Marketplace, a third party e-commerce facilitator, reportedly accounts for over half of Amazon's e-commerce volume.Amazon fell 1.1% Thursday after a Supreme Court ruling came down that could increase taxes required from Amazon customers in some states.

11,MRO,"Things are looking up for Libya oil traders.XThe North African country where militants disrupted oil production for months just a year ago is now closing in on Saudi Arabia as the third-biggest source of seaborne supply to Europe after Iraq and Russia, the International Energy Agency said Thursday. Even as the U.S. is reviving its own oil industry and exporting, Libya managed to ship more crude to America in the fourth quarter than a year earlier while supplies from Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and Iraq declined, the report showed.""Libya is holding onto its recent gains,"" the IEA said. While it remains a modest global exporter by volume, the politically divided nation also boosted exports to China, according to the report.The revival hasn't gone unnoticed by international oil companies. Earlier this month, France's Total (TOT) bought the Libyan assets of Marathon Oil (MRO) for $450 million.

25,MRO,"Tesla kept charging higher and continued to work on its new base, while software companies also helped sustain the Nasdaq composite's leadership in stocks today.

Watch for a new potential base to form.Meanwhile, futures traders are counting a virtually 100% probability that the Federal Reserve will execute another quarter-point hike in short-term interest rates on Wednesday. The U.S. central bank has been raising rates since December 2015, when the fed funds rate rose to a target range of 0.25%-0.5%.Tesla (TSLA), as noted in this recent Stock Market Today column, is still fashioning the right side of a brand-new base. However, the stock is still feeling the overhead supply of sellers near 350, a critical level of upside price resistance. At 341, the stock is now less than 13% below its all-time peak of 389.61.Sentiment appears to be warming to the high possibility that the electric-vehicle pioneer is getting past serious difficulty in ramping up Model 3 production. On Tuesday, CEO Elon Musk announced a 9% cut in total staff, centered on salaried employees. A company memo to employees said that no production associates got laid off.The company seeks to get profitable while also meeting the tremendous demand for its entry-level all-electric car. The planned staff cuts should reduce total headcount to 37,000.Tesla shares show a terrible Relative Price Strength Rating of 25 on a scale of 1 to 99. But as seen in IBD Stock Checkup, the Accumulation/Distribution Rating has improved to a B on a scale of A to E. A rating above the neutral C grade means that over the past 13 weeks, institutions have likely been accumulating the stock on net.In IBD's automakers group, only Ferrari (RACE) and General Motors (GM) show better Accumulation/Distribution ratings than Tesla at A- each. Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters see Tesla swinging from a net loss of $6.82 a share in 2018 to a net profit of $2.46 a share in 2019. Both estimates have recently moved up.Meanwhile, the market is showing at least four new reasons why the stock market's six-year bull run (after a 20%-plus correction in 2011) may have more room to run.One, market breadth continues to improve. The Nasdaq's advance-decline line has been climbing for five straight weeks. This means that more stocks are advancing than declining. This also means that more high-rated stocks stand a chance of breaking out.Two, the new highs list remains robust. As seen in Monday's IBD-screened list, a total 325 stocks on the Nasdaq and NYSE hit 52-week or all-time highs, swamping the 42 names making new lows. More stocks hitting new highs boost the probability of breakouts.Three, leading stocks are outperforming the major indexes.Among the top 10-ranked names in the IBD 50, the average gain approached 3%.Four, investor sentiment is not wildly optimistic. On Tuesday, the put-call volume ratio stood at 0.68. During the March 2000 tech market top, this ratio of bearish put options to bullish call options sank beneath 0.4. Such a low ratio pointed to a severe evaporation of bearish sentiment among options traders.The Investors Intelligence report on newsletter editors also shows the bullish ratio at 52.9%, well below its mid-January peak of 66%.

35,MRO,"Oil prices and stocks, led by Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA), Marathon Oil (MRO) and California Resources (CRC), surged after OPEC agreed to increase production next month, though the vagueness of the deal underscored the fissures in the oil group.XOPEC producers and allies like Russia will aim to increase output by about 1 million barrels per day, Saudi Oil Minister Khalid al-Falih told reporters, though the actual increase is likely to be smaller as countries like Venezuela struggle to ramp up. S&P Global Platts expects a net output increase of around 700,000 bpd, largely met by Saudi Arabia.But OPEC's official statement on the decision didn't provide a specific number for the production increase. Instead, the statement said producers will more closely adhere to an earlier deal to reduce production by 1.8 million barrels per day. Since that deal was struck in 2016, participants have substantially overshot that target, with the reduction estimated at 2.8 million bpd.Despite the mixed signals coming from OPEC, the highly awaited policy decision Friday is bullish for oil prices as the planned output boost will bring markets closer to balance, said Edward Jones analyst Brian Youngberg.But he also found the contentious run-up to Friday's decision telling, as Iran had threatened to veto proposals to boost output.""OPEC is not the unified group it once was, they are all different interests and different capabilities,"" said Youngberg, who sees the introduction of electric vehicles and rise in U.S. shale production further crimping OPEC's leadership in the years ahead.He added that politics are more of an issue within OPEC now, with Russia playing both sides of the Iran-Saudi Arabia geopolitical rivalry.Last week, Saudi Arabia and Russia, which isn't an OPEC member, notably began looking at forging their own, separate agreement on energy cooperation.U.S. crude oil prices jumped 4.6% to settle at $68.58 a barrel, and Brent crude rallied 3.4% to $75.55 a barrel. Royal Dutch Shell spiked 4.4% on the stock market today. Marathon Oil leapt 8%, and shale producer California Resources soared 10%. Meanwhile, Exxon Mobil (XOM) rose 2.1%, Chevron (CVX) gained 2%, and BP (BP) surged 3.7%.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseOther details from Friday's agreement were left vague, such as how the increase will affect member countries at the individual level, focusing instead on a collective target.""It's an elegant solution to the problem they have had, where some countries have not been able to increase and some have lost production,"" said Roger Diwan, energy analyst at IHS Markit. ""They don't have to renegotiate quotas,"" bypassing a thorny issue and avoiding antagonizing OPEC members who can't produce, he added.What OPEC achieved, he added, ""is trying to keep (Brent crude) prices in a narrow range and not to cross $80+.""Ahead of OPEC's policy meeting in Vienna on Friday, divisions within the oil cartel threw the outcome into uncertainty up to the last minute.OPEC's de facto leader, Saudi Arabia, and Russia sought to boost output again. But Iran was stubbornly opposed to a boost, as renewed U.S. sanctions would prevent it from selling more oil anyway. Other OPEC members like Venezuela and Iraq also signaled they weren't on board with an increase.OPEC was able to overcome objections by Iran and others to production increases by framing their decision as a return to the originally agreed 1.8 million bpd cuts, S&P Global Platts noted.""The fact that we dealt with overcompliance (on cutback commitments) that was worrying the industry … this is what made the deliberations meaningful,"" OPEC President Suhail Mohamed Al Mazrouei of the United Arab Emirates said in a press conference Friday.On Saturday, OPEC and its non-member partners will hold another meeting to ratify today's agreement.Meanwhile, the OPEC decision is unlikely to drive any strategic shift from American shale companies in the near term, Youngberg said.In the past year, many companies have promised to prioritize spending discipline over production expansion after previously rushing to pump more oil when prices recovered.""Shale plays are focused really on living within their cash flow and returning excess cash to shareholders,"" reflected in their debt reduction, dividends and buybacks, he said.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Energy Stocks And Industry News: Oil, Gas, Solar, CoalIBD Stock Of The DayBest Growth Stocks To Buy And Watch: See Updates To IBD Stock ListsStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth Stocks

The stock is also triggering a follow-on buy point by rebounding off its 10-week moving average near 20.29.That price level, as seen in a weekly chart, is above the integrated oil and gas firm's original breakout point of 18.76. On May 3, the stock broke out of a perfect 13-week cup with handle. To find the correct entry, add 10 cents to the highest price within the handle, or 18.66 + 10 cents.Marathon has ended a long drought on the bottom line with earnings of 7 cents and 18 cents a share in the past two quarters. The Street is forecasting Q2 profit of 18 cents a share vs. a net loss of 24 cents in the year-ago quarter.Revenue jumped 26%, 23% and 62% in the past three quarters.Marathon is a classic turnaround play. Watch to see if its IBD ratings continue to improve, as seen in Stock Checkup.Meanwhile, amid a correction in China mainland equity indexes, the hot money seems to be taking more profits in the country's streaming video firms.IQiyi (IQ), dubbed the Netflix of China, bounced hard off Friday's low, but still fell nearly 3% to 37.92.At that price, iQiyi still carries a terrific 84% gain after thrusting past a 20.60 buy point in a narrow IPO base. Shares went public March 29 at 18 a share.Those who have long-term conviction in the online video platform can decide to hold through the next inevitable correction. In the IPO base, iQiyi fell 23% from high to low.Short-term traders could decide to lock in gains if the stock struggles to hold above the 10-day moving average, currently at 39.19.Another technical price level to watch: the medium-term 50-day moving average. It's rising fast, but at 24.90 the 50-day line is still sharply lagging iQiyi's share price.Outstanding stocks, after breaking out of sound bases, often pull back to the 50-day or 10-week moving average as some institutional investors lock in profits. But in a solid market uptrend, the 50-day line can offer a follow-on buy point.In the software sector, Dropbox (DBX), Ultimate Software (ULTI), ServiceNow (NOW) and Salesforce.com (CRM) all dropped 1% or more.Dropbox fell below its prime entry of 34.93 after clearing its own IPO base last week, triggering a sell signal. The cloud-based data storage play went public in March at 21 a share.Elsewhere, the Dow utility average rallied nearly 0.7% as the yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond looks headed to finish below the critical 3% level for a fifth week in a row.At 695, the Dow utilities still lag the key equity indexes with a 4% loss since Jan. 1.RELATED: Three Hot IPOs Flash Sell Signals; China Plays Keep Tumbling Inside The Big Picture: Is It Time To Sell Growth Stocks Now?The Latest Inside Investor's CornerDropbox Is One of The Current Names In IBD Leaderboard

39,MRO,"If you like energy stocks, perhaps you've been licking your chops lately.After crude oil peaked in the summer of 2014, oil stocks fell furiously. IBD's integrated oil & gas industry group fell 51% to multi-year lows in January 2016, even as the S&P 500 marked new highs. Continental Resources (CLR), part of IBD's U.S. oil exploration group, slid from a 2014 high of 80.91 to a January 2016 low of 13.94, down 83%.The market is changing, though.For a long time, Energy ranked dead last among the 33 sectors featured in IBD's Smart Tables for NYSE and Nasdaq-listed companies. No longer.As seen in the latest stock tables, viewable online in the Data Tables section of Stock Lists at Investors.com, the Energy sector is now ranked No. 2. With WTI (West Texas intermediate) near-term futures holding firmly above the $70 level, the gigantic energy sector is showing signs of life again.Marathon Oil (MRO), one of two energy plays in IBD Leaderboard, has excelled since it jumped out of a nifty cup with handle at 18.76 on May 3 this year. That 13-week base is part of a bigger, longer cup-type pattern. So, you can interpret Marathon's action since December 2016 as a base-on-base pattern.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseGo to a weekly chart and you'll see the integrated oil firm went through an Odyssey-like venture to multiyear lows, going from a 2014 high of 41.74 to a low of 6.52 in 2016. Serious destruction. But Marathon has recovered. The company has recently scored two solid quarters of profits and serious revenue growth (up 23% in Q4 2017, up 62% in Q1 2018).Shake Shack (SHAK), seller of one of the most popular burgers in the country, is forming a bottoming base. And Apple (AAPL) has thrived since it broke out of its own bottoming base, an 11-week cup with handle that completed at the end of 2016.Apple broke out of that perfect base on Jan. 6-9 at 118.12. Today, shares are hovering near 172, up more than 45%. Not bad for the largest company in the U.S. equities markets in terms of market value.In many cases such stocks won't become CAN SLIM-quality leaders for years. Yet eventually any sector in the stock market that is bludgeoned this badly will come back. But what should the disciplined investor look for in terms of these stocks' chart action?After the bear market of 2008-09 ended, sending the entire market to its knees, some growth stocks stopped kneeling. After the S&P 500's March 12, 2009, follow-through bottoming signal took hold, companies with excellent products, top-drawer management and industry-leading margins came back. They formed what IBD Chairman William O'Neil likes to call bottoming bases.What are the characteristics of a bottoming base?First, they form when the market has undergone a cataclysmic bear market. When the S&P 500 or the Nasdaq composite drops 40% to 50% from its highs, expect former growth stock leaders to drop 1-1/2 to 2-1/2 times that amount. That's why you'll see some former market darlings fall 60% to 75% from their peaks, even more.The stock needs ample time to form the right side of a bottoming base. Think months, even years. Why so long? You want confirmation that institutional investors accumulate shares in a big way and eventually tip the scale from one of excess supply (funds are extra-willing to sell their shares) to excess demand (extra-willing to buy at any price).The traits of good bases all apply. Look for big up weeks in price in heavy or rising weekly volume. Seek symmetry within the base. If a handle forms, it should slant downward along the handle's price lows and volume should dry up. The base should show tight trading.Finally, keep an eagle eye out for a strong breakout to a 52-week high in heavy trade to trigger a buy point. Remember, for a bottoming base to complete, a stock doesn't have to necessarily trade at or near an all-time high. Know in advance the average volume over the past 50 sessions: get it at the top of any IBD daily chart, available under the Research tab at Investors.com.Under Armour (UA) debuted on the market in November 2005. Shares dove 84% from its August 2007 peak during the 2008-2009 market slide. But the fast-growing sports apparel maker offered a stylish, performance-driven alternative to other brands. Yogafit founder Beth Shaw notes that UA was unusual in marketing its brand at trade shows for the exercise and health and wellness industries.The stock bottomed out at 11.94 on March 6, 2009, then rebounded for the rest of the year. Shares climbed more than 20% from an entry in September, but a breakout attempt in October flopped fast.But UA later formed better-quality bases, including a nearly six-week flat base with a 40.10 buy point in August to September 2010. The base showed light volume in each of the three down weeks.UA also showed solid ratings at its Sept. 9, 2010, breakout, including a 95 Composite Rating, 97 EPS, 93 RS and B+ for Accumulation/Distribution. Just days earlier on Sept. 1, the market followed through. UA doubled in six months before hitting choppy waters during the 2011 market correction.See Full Series On Smart Chart Reading(A version of this column was first published on June 6, 2016.

42,MRO,"Last week's rally, led by the Nasdaq composite, signaled the stock market is looking healthier. But which stocks and sectors are likely to lead?The FANG+ stocks of Apple (AAPL), Facebook (FB), Amazon (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) generally have been performing well. Salesforce.com (CRM) and other software stocks have been winners. Payment stocks are a pocket of strength. Many retail names, from Lululemon (LULU) to TJX (TJX) have been strong. Energy stocks from Chevron (CVX) to Marathon Oil (MRO) are doing well, but are subject to the ups and downs of crude oil prices. Biotechs are trying to make a recovery, with Biogen (BIIB) skyrocketing Friday on positive Alzheimer's drug news.Meanwhile, chips are still well off their highs, a bad sign for any stock market rally. Financials are near 2018 lows, with JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Citigroup (C) and Wells Fargo (WFC) kicking off earnings season Friday.Dow futures rose 0.5% vs. fair value. S&P 500 futures climbed 0.5%. Nasdaq 100 futures were 0.5% above fair value. Keep in mind that Dow Jones futures and other overnight action doesn't always translate into actual trading in the next regular session.China's Shanghai composite roared 2.5% higher on Monday, after tumbling into a bear market in recent weeks. Hong Kong's Hang Seng advanced 1.3%. and Japan's Nikkei 1.2%. European markets showed modest gains intraday.During last week's holiday-shortened week, the stock market averages were volatile but ultimately rallied. The Nasdaq composite rallied 2.4%, the S&P 500 1.5% and the Dow Jones 0.8%. Friday's post-jobs, post-China tariffs rally was particularly significant.

Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe stock market came under pressure amid Trump trade war tariffs and threats over the past several weeks. President Donald Trump on Friday imposed tariffs on $34 billion worth of Chinese goods, quickly matched by Beijing. Trump also threatened tariffs on virtually all Chinese imports. But for now, Wall Street has decided the Trump trade impact has been priced into stocks.If you look at the Nasdaq composite over the last several months, the tech-heavy index looks like it broke out on June 1, rallied for a few weeks, then erased those gains before rebounding again last week from its 50-day moving average.The S&P 500 index and Dow Jones have been consolidating since late January, with the S&P 500 in somewhat better shape.Stocks, even top stocks, tend to track the broader stock market. But sector rotations into and out of China internets, software stocks and energy names have left many individual stock charts looking more volatile.Amazon stock and especially Netflix stock have been two of the biggest stock market winners in 2018. Facebook stock, after a scandalous spring, is at record highs, slightly extended from a buy point. Apple stock is in buy range from 179.04 double-bottom entry. The Dow Jones component has pulled back to its 50-day line and could be working on a new consolidation. Alphabet (GOOGL) is below a buy point after a low-volume breakout last month and hitting resistance at its old high.Software accounts for four of the top 10 groups in the 197 industries that IBD tracks. Two more are in the top 20.Buying and holding individual software stocks has been a challenge. Salesforce, the top stock in the No. 3-ranked enterprise software group, staged a low-volume breakout in early May, then promptly undercut the buy point. It didn't trigger a 7%-8% loss that would trigger an automatic sell. By the end of May, following quarterly earnings, Salesforce stock was back in buy range and is now modestly extended.Meanwhile, some stocks did trigger the 7%-8% loss sell rule, like Workday (WDAY) and Red Hat (RHT), while others round-tripped double-digit gains, such as Qualys (QLYS).Software Stocks To Watch: Okta (OKTA), an April 2017 cybersecurity IPO, is finding support at its 50-day moving average for the first time since a late April breakout. A solid gain in heavy volume could offer a buying opportunity. Alternatively, Okta could continue to consolidate for a few weeks, forming a new base and buy point.Collaboration software maker Atlassian (TEAM) broke out last October. Anyone holding Atlassian stock since then would be sitting pretty. Since then the stock has staged a few failed breakouts but still moved up, generally following its 50-day. Atlassian stock is once again finding 50-day support but needs at least another week to form a proper base.Lululemon Athletica and Canada Goose (GOOS) are among the trendy apparel retail stock that have boomed in 2018. Specialty discounters such as TJX are faring well too, with TJX rival Ross Stores (ROST) stock in buy range currently. Five Below (FIVE) and Dollar General (DG) are setting up near buy points.An improving jobs market and Trump tax cuts have fueled consumers' wallets and confidence. Most retailers also aren't that exposed to Trump trade wars with Europe, China and others.Energy stocks are tricky to play because they tend to rise and fall with crude prices. (Refiners tend to benefit from a wider ""crack spread"" between crude and gasoline prices.)EOG Resources (EOG), a recent IBD Stock of the Day, broke out in early May and ran up for a couple of weeks as crude futures rallied. But the EOG stock pulled back below the buy point and found support at the 50-day line in June as crude also backed off multiyear highs. EOG Resources, known as the ""Apple of Oil,"" is setting up in a new base with crude hitting its best levels since 2014.Marathon Oil, another IBD Stock of the Day, also broke out in early May and ran up. Marathon Oil stock also pulled back to its 50-day line, but never undercut the buy point. Shares are now in a flat base within a base-on-base formation.Biogen shot up nearly 20% to 357.48 on Friday, racing toward a 370.67 cup-base entry. Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) also is closing in on a buy point. But both Biogen and Vertex Pharma have relative strength lines, while improving, that were in downtrends for several months. The relative strength line tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 indexNotable biotech ETFs, including iShares Nasdaq Biotech (IBB) and the triple-levered Direxion Daily S&P Biotech Bull (LABU) also are approaching possible buy points, but with RS lines that have made much headway over the past year.Payment stocks have been a pocket of strength. Mastercard (MA) and Dow Jones component Visa (V) have been consolidating near record highs for a few weeks, finding support around their 50-day or 10-week lines.

46,MRO,"Dow Jones futures rallied Wednesday morning along with S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq futures, as crude oil prices rebounded solidly a day after President Donald Trump pulled the U.S. out of the Iran nuclear deal. Meanwhile, the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield moved back above 3%.Despite concerns about the stock market and geopolitical impact, the Dow Jones, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite closed virtually unchanged Tuesday after Trump's Iran decision. Most top stocks in buy range continued to act well, with Apple (AAPL), Nvidia (NVDA), Visa (V) and Mastercard (MA) nudging higher.Crude oil prices fell, but pared losses and held near multiyear highs Tuesday.Dow Jones futures rose 0.5% vs. fair value. S&P 500 futures climbed 0.45%. Nasdaq 100 futures were 0.35% higher.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseU.S. crude futures rose 2.7% to $70.95 a barrel, hitting their best levels since late 2014.The 10-year Treasury yield just topped 3%, hitting 3.006%, after peaking at 3.02% in late April. Meanwhile, the 2-year yield climbed to 2.52%, putting the spread at a still-narrow 48 basis points. That 3% yield, and the narrowing Treasury yield spread with the 2-year rate, pressured stock markets.Tuesday's stock market action held three key investing lessons. 1. Don't be swayed by outside noise and punditry; focus on the action of the major stock market averages and leading stocks. 2. The 50-day moving average looms large for the Dow Jones, S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite. 3. Pay close attention to the relative strength line, which tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index. The RS line is an easy way to separate true stock market winners from laggards.Investors should stay in tune with important business, political, economic and technology news and trends. That can inform your investing decisions. But your primary focus and investing guide should be the action of the major indexes — the S&P 500, Nasdaq composite and Dow Jones industrial average — and the action of leading stocks.President Trump's decision on the Iran nuclear deal drew a lot of attention, and deservedly so. But ultimately, the collective wisdom of investors decided for now that Trump's decision to exit that accord was not a market-moving event. The Dow Jones and Nasdaq composite just inched higher in stock market trading Tuesday, while the S&P 500 index edged lower.Meanwhile, most recent breakouts fared well. Tech giants Apple and Nvidia rose fractionally, outperforming the broader market. Top oil stocks like Marathon Oil (MRO) acted bullishly, paring intraday losses or even gaining despite a modest loss for crude futures.The 50-day is often a key area of support for leading stocks as well as the major indexes. But it can also act as resistance. Since late January, the S&P 500 index and Dow Jones have struggled to move above the 50-day line, with the few attempts short-lived. Both indexes are just below the 50-day currently, though futures Wednesday suggest they may make another run at that level.The Nasdaq composite reclaimed that level on Friday and is holding just above that line.Investors should always focus on the true stock market leaders. If you're going to take on stock-specific risk, you want to get outperformance. But in conditions like now, when the stock market uptrend is under pressure, besting the S&P 500 simply is a must.Apple, Nvidia, Mastercard and Visa all rose fractionally, moving higher but still within their 5% buy zones. While the price gains were modest, the RS lines all hit long-term or all-time highs. Marathon Oil fell intraday to 19.15 before roaring back for a 3.4% gain at 20.44, extended from an 18.76 buy point.

48,MRO,"Marathon Oil (MRO) shares jumped into buy range, the only oil giant with a significant gain Thursday, while Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD) tumbled along with other top shale producers.Late Wednesday, Marathon Oil reported Q1 EPS of 18 cents on revenue of $1.733 billion. Analysts polled by Zacks Research were expecting EPS of 15 cents and revenue of $1.347 billion.The company also raised its full-year guidance for production growth from its resource plays to 25%-30%, up from a prior view 20%-25%. But it kept its 2018 development capital budget forecast at $2.3 billion, noting its commitment to ""financial discipline.""Pioneer Natural Resources also beat Q1 forecasts late Wednesday and said Permian Basin production growth for 2018 is tracking toward the high end of its 19%-24% forecast.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseHowever, Pioneer CEO Tim Dove said during the company's conference call Thursday that this year's expected capital budget of $2.9 billion will likely increase.He cited the addition of rigs, cost inflation and a ramp-up in a more intense completion process that involves higher concentrations of fluids and proppants as well as tighter spacing of wells. Based on the success of these so-called Version 3.0+ completions, the company is considering adding more of them in the second half of the year.Dove said Pioneer will have a better handle ""mid-year"" on how much the spending increase will be, but the company still plans to spend within its forecast cash flow of $3.2 billion.Shares of Marathon Oil jumped 6.3% to 19.45 on the stock market today, breaking out of a cup with handle base with an 18.76 entry point. Pioneer dropped 2.15% to 191.11, above its buy point of 190.05 after falling intraday to 188.79.U.S. crude futures rose 0.7% to $68.43 a barrel. Brent crude advanced 0.4% to $73.62.Last year, oil companies began stressing spending discipline over production growth, even as crude prices rallied, cheering investors who hoped more of the extra cash generated would be returned to investors instead of development budgets.Last month, oilfield services giant Schlumberger (SLB) CEO Paul Kibsgaard said he doesn't see spending increasing across the oil and gas industry this year, even though crude prices are at the highest levels in more than three years.Shale companies are also focusing more on the Permian Basin, where oil can be extracted and delivered at lower costs than in other shale plays.Pioneer decided to go all in on the prolific Permian, selling off 70,000 acres in the Eagle Ford play and other assets in South Texas; Raton, New Mexico and the West Panhandle earlier this year.""Looking forward, our deep, low-risk inventory of high-margin Permian Basin wells allows us to deliver increasing cash flow and corporate returns,"" Dove said in a statement Wednesday, noting the company's transition to a Permian ""pure play"" is progressing.""Our balance sheet remains among the strongest in the industry, while our focus on capital discipline supports an economic, steady long-term growth profile. We believe our high Permian 'return on capital' will enhance shareholder value by delivering increasing 'return of capital' to investors.""Despite the drop in shale stocks, the earnings season has been positive for the sector so far. Along with Pioneer, Matador Resources (MTDR) and Continental Resources (CLR) reported earnings and revenue beats late Wednesday.On Tuesday, Viper Energy Partners (VNOM), Anadarko Petroleum (APC), Noble Energy (NBL) and Concho Resources (CXO) topped quarterly estimates.EOG Resources (EOG) and Parsley Energy (PE) will report Q1 results after the market closes Thursday.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN: Energy Stocks And Industry News: Oil, Gas, Solar, Coal

49,MRO,"The major indexes enjoyed a slow yet steady afternoon rebound but still closed mildly lower on Thursday. Some commodity stocks and cyclical plays paced the upside, including ship transport, logistics, coal and homebuilding. Preliminary volume figures were mixed as traders fret over how the U.S. and China will handle two-day talks on trade.Inside the IBD 50, small-cap energy play Warrior Met Coal (HCC) gapped up at the open. At one point the energy play rallied to an all-time high of 26.93, briefly surpassing a 26.53 buy point within a nearly nine-week cup without handle.Meanwhile, as Apple (AAPL) tiptoed closer to a potential new breakout, an emerging group of new leaders powered past their own buy points and sharply outperformed the market. They included Marathon Oil (MRO) (up 6% in double average volume) and Tableau Software (DATA) (up nearly 7% in more than four times usual turnover).The Dow Jones industrial average eked out a tiny gain of 5 points as it notched a positive reversal. Dow components Boeing (BA) and 3M (MMM) were the only two out of 30 names to rise 1 point or more.Ninety minutes into Thursday's session, the blue chip index slid as much as 1.6% before slowly climbing higher the rest of the way.The Dow industrials poked below its long-term 200-day moving average for the second time since April 2. That's evidence of a new shakeout taking place.At 23,930, the Dow industrials still stands nearly 10% off its peak, despite the fact that IBD's current outlook for the market holds at ""Uptrend under pressure.""The S&P 500 also slid below the long-term 200-day moving average but turned a loss of more than 1.4% to just a 0.2% dip, another bullish sign. Still, watch to see if the large-cap benchmark tries in future trading sessions to mark another close below the 200-day line.The Nasdaq composite was off less than 0.2% after having fallen as much as 1.5%. The premier index of growth companies continues to test buying support near the 7000 level.Volume ran sharply higher on the Nasdaq vs. the same time Wednesday and slipped lower on the NYSE, according to early data.The Russell 2000 and the Dow transports both fell 0.5%. The Russell 1000, a popular small-cap gauge, is clinging to a tiny year-to-date gain.Marathon Oil rallied more than 6% at one point and got as high as 19.51 before cooling off some. The stock easily surpassed an 18.76 buy point in a 13-week cup with handle. The 5% buy zone extends up to 19.70.Marathon is an integrated oil and gas firm. The large-cap firm from Houston posted earnings of 18 cents a share in Q1, reversing a 13-cent net loss in the year-ago quarter. Sales boomed 62% to $1.73 billion.Marathon is not the only company with strong relative performance and good IBD ratings, as seen in IBD's stock quotes and in the Stock Checkup tool. Ecopetrol (EC), Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) and Italy's Eni Spa (E) all hold a Relative Price Strength Rating of 80 or higher.While oil and gas explorers slumped, integrated firms such as Marathon Oil advanced smartly as the rally in crude oil futures show no signs of abating. U.S. WTI near-term futures bounced from a nearly 0.7% loss to finish up and well above $68 a barrel.WTI crude is now up more than 13% year to date. In contrast, the S&P 500, at 2627, is down nearly 1.7% since Jan. 1. The 500 ran up 19.4% in 2017.Tableau, meanwhile, gapped out of a base-on-base pattern at 87.70, rising more than 7% to 91.30 in quadruple normal volume.Tableau is a Big Data analytics software expert. The Seattle-based firm notched its fourth quarter in a row of solid earnings per share. Revenue climbed 23% to $246.2 million, the biggest jump in five quarters.According to IBD Stock Checkup, Tableau's so-so 68 Composite Rating belies a strong 89 RS Rating, meaning the company is outperforming 89% of all publicly traded firms in IBD's database over the past 12 months. Given Thursday's strong advance, watch to see if Tableau's ratings edge higher.Going back to Apple, the iPhone, iPad and digital services titan acted stingy in giving back Wednesday's strong gain, a good sign for the bulls. The stock initially fell more than 1% to 174.63 in brisk trade. Then it wiped out those modest losses to end 0.2% higher to 176.89.The megacap tech is possibly forming the right side of a shallow seven-week double-bottom base. The middle peak between the base's  two lows is 178.94. Hence, a new buy point would be 179.04, 10 cents above that middle peak. The decline within the base is very light at 12.5%.Apple is still trading near all-time highs, another bullish sign. At $897 billion, it's the largest company by market value on the U.S. financial markets. In IBD Stock Checkup, the Cupertino, Calif., firm shows decent ratings such as an 85 for EPS (Earnings Per Share) and 86 for Relative Price Strength.Earlier this week the iPhone giant reported a 30% jump in fiscal second-quarter earnings to $2.73 a share, the biggest jump in 10 quarters, as revenue grew 16%, marking a sixth quarter in a row of top-line acceleration.Apple's revenue slumped 9% during the fiscal fourth quarter of FY 2016, then rose 3%, 5%, 7%, 12% and 13% in the next five quarters.The Street expects Apple's earnings turnaround to keep shining brightly. Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters expect profit to climb 30% in the June-ending fiscal third quarter to $2.17 a share.Despite the nifty reversal by the major indexes, investors also seem to show nervousness on the outcome of two-day trade talks between top U.S. and Chinese economic officials in Beijing.Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, and other key players arrived in the Middle Kingdom on Thursday for talks later in the day and Friday.Bloomberg reported a senior Chinese government official as saying that China will refuse any U.S. preconditions for negotiations, such as narrowing the bilateral trade gap.On Friday, a number of top Federal Reserve officials and regional bank presidents are slated to speak, including William Dudley, John Williams, and Esther George. On Wednesday, the U.S. central bank kept short-term interest rates unchanged. The fed funds rate that's charged on overnight cash infusions to major lenders currently hovers at a 1.5%-1.75% target range.CME futures see a nearly 45% probability that the Fed will raise the fed funds rate three more times to a target range of 2.25%-2.5%, slightly down from recent days. Numerous money center banks, Wall Street investment giants and regional lenders have recently been hit with intense selling.Citigroup (C), Morgan Stanley (MS), Goldman Sachs (GS) and Bank of America (BAC) have either sliced below or came close to touching their 200-day moving averages. But some fast-growing banks, such as Western Alliance Bancorp (WAL) and SVB Financial (SIVB), have been holding up much more firmly.(Please follow Saito-Chung on Twitter at @IBD_DChung for more commentary on leading stocks, breakouts, sell signals, and financial markets.)RELATED:Inside The Big Picture?

53,MRO,"Stocks greeted the Fed's interest-rate increase with volatile trading Wednesday, as the central bank delivered the expected hike but Chairman Jerome Powell gave the market some angst.Stocks initially climbed after the Fed confirmed a long-expected quarter-point rate hike. But the burst soon evaporated and indexes showed losses for a while. Stocks recovered briefly and then slid into the close, a reflection of the market's confusion over Fed policy.The Dow Jones industrial average and S&P 500 each fell 0.2% and the Nasdaq composite lost 0.3%. The S&P 500 made it three days in a row below the 50-day moving average, something that's added uncertainty to the general market.But the small-cap Russell 2000 bucked the trend, rising 0.6% at the closing bell.

Two more quarter-point rate increases are expected for the rest of this year, easing worries that one additional hike might be in the cards.But there was a hawkish tone in some of the Fed's observations, and Powell for the first time said the Fed expects above-target core inflation of 2.1%.The 10-year note's yield rose 3 basis points to 2.91%, nearing the close of 2.94% of Feb. 21, according to Tradeweb.

The small-cap Russell 2000 fell 0.7% after touching an all-time high earlier in the session.Volume crept higher on the NYSE but slipped on the Nasdaq.The Dow's outperformance was somewhat misleading.

64,MRO,"Dow futures rose modestly Tuesday morning, along with S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq futures. The Dow Jones led another solid stock market advance Monday, with the S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite also strong following Friday's big rally. But quality breakouts were scarce. Monday's big winners tended to be recent laggards, including Dow Jones components Caterpillar (CAT), JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS) as well as recent China livestreaming IPOs Huya (HUYA) and iQiyi (IQ).The lack of breakouts is somewhat surprising. Friday's post-jobs-report, post-China-tariffs surge triggered a shift in IBD's market direction back to confirmed uptrend. Given that stocks, even leading stocks, tend to follow the major averages, you'd expect to see some new breakouts. The Nasdaq composite is just below last month's record high, while the S&P 500 index is just below a four-month best, near a handle-like formation. The Dow Jones reclaimed its 50-day moving average Monday.There are some quality stocks working on buy points. Marathon Oil (MRO) and EOG Resources (EOG) are among the many energy stocks closing in on breakouts. Trendy apparel and handbag retailer Michael Kors (KORS) — along with Dollar General (DG) and Home Depot (HD) — is also in sight of an entry area. But none of these top stocks cleared buy points in Monday's stock market trading.Cactus (WHD) stock shot up 4.5% to 35.60 on Monday, clearing a 35.28 cup-with-handle buy point. But the maker of wellhead and pressure-control equipment tumbled late on plans for a follow-on offering. Cactus came public at 19 a share in early February.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

The Dow Jones industrial average, up 1.3%, outpaced the 0.9% gains for the S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite.Within the Dow Jones, the big winners were Caterpillar, JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs, up 4.1%, 3.1% and 2.7% respectively. But Caterpillar stock is still below its 50-day and 200-day moving averages. So are JPMorgan stock and Goldman stock, after both hit 2018 lows last week.Huya stock, a recent spinoff from YY (YY), shot up 18% Monday. Meanwhile, iQiyi stock, a Baidu (BIDU) spinoff, rebounded more than 6%. Bilibili (BILI), another recent China livestreaming IPO, popped 4%. Huya is the only one that has turned profitable.All three stocks were big winners in May and much of June, but then sold off sharply. Perhaps Huya, iQiyi and Bilibili will consolidate and form new bases and buy points. But they have a lot work to do.Dow futures rose 0.3% vs. fair value. Nasdaq 100 futures popped 0.4%.

69,MRO,"Ten computer-related industry groups dropped 1% or more in the stock market Monday, effectively taking away morning gains of the key stock indexes. But the stock market remains in a confirmed uptrend, and the quiet action looks normal overall after the market's superb advance last week.The 10 computer-related industry groups, which can be viewed in IBD's daily rankings of 197 industries, include education software, desktop software, enterprise software, databases, integrated systems, networking and hardware.Meanwhile, Apple (AAPL) held firm, finishing off less than 0.4% after rallying a combined 16% in the prior two weeks. The iPhone giant joined Leaderboard on May 4 as the sole member from IBD's telecom consumer products industry group.

But most stocks in this group have severely lagged the market leadership since the second half of 2017.More companies in the oil & gas and retail sectors are showing much more relative strength than fiber-optic plays (think names such as Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA), Marathon Oil (MRO) and IBD 50 name Viper Energy Partners (VNOM)).Meanwhile, the Retail-Apparel/Shoes industry group has placed in the top 10 among 197 IBD groups for six-month relative price performance for more than five weeks in a row.

FFTY rallied 34% in 2017.West Texas intermediate crude oil futures finished roughly break-even and remain above $70 a barrel. The yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond hovered near 3%. Futures traders see a 100% probability that the Federal Reserve will hike short-term interest rates by another quarter point in June.

77,MRO,"Total (TOT)'s chief executive officer may be one of the few major oil heads who isn't salivating over the booming Permian Basin shale oil field.""Total today is the most profitable major company without any shale,"" Patrick Pouyanne said in an interview Monday on Bloomberg Television. Instead, Pouyanne said his company is focused on five core areas — Africa, the Middle East, the North Sea, deepwater development and liquefied natural gas. ""I prefer to play into my strengths,"" he said.Pouyanne spoke a few hours after the International Energy Agency issued a report that said the shale boom will help U.S. supply cover more than half the world's oil demand growth to 2023. Production from the prolific Permian Basin will double over that period, according to the agency.The shale boom that helped push the U.S. into the position of one of the largest crude producers caught most major oil companies flat-footed. Instead, it was smaller, independent exploration and production companies who figured out how to unlock the rock formations to free massive new supplies of oil and natural gas.The price of drilling rights in the Permian has increased as production soared. Exxon Mobil (XOM) has announced plans to triple its output from the Permian by 2025. Total has looked elsewhere, including war-torn Libya, where the French giant last week agreed to buy out Marathon Oil (MRO)'s assets. In Monday's interview, Pouyanne called the $450 million deal ""one of the best I've ever done.""As for investors interested in so-called ""short-cycle"" oil that can respond quickly to price changes? ""Short-cycle means you are able to turn off capex quickly, so it's a matter of contractual arrangements,"" Pouyanne said. Total has 1 billion barrels that he ""can turn off"" in response to low prices.""We are the most efficient today. Do we have shale? No. Do we have short-cycle? Yes.""Meanwhile, crude oil futures gained 2.2% Monday after data-provider Genscape Inc. was said to report that inventories dropped in Cushing, Okla., according to two people with knowledge of the report. Tanks there are already at the lowest level since 2014, following 10 straight weeks of decline. Signals that the American economy is booming are also supporting crude prices.Draws at Cushing will continue, said Bob Yawger, director of futures at Mizuho Securities USA in New York, as long as near-term futures contracts trade higher than later ones, a market structure known as backwardation that discourages storage. ""Why would anybody want to auto-lose money by storing crude oil?"" Yawger said.U.S. service industries expanded in February near the fastest pace in at least a decade, signaling the economy is on track for steady growth this quarter, according to a survey from the Institute for Supply Management on Monday.The U.S. benchmark crude has traded mostly above $61 in past weeks as the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries works to cut output as part of their supply agreement. The International Energy Agency said that closer to 2023, global markets will start to tighten and warned that more investment is needed to meet growth in consumption and to make up for production lost to natural declines.

87,MRO,"The House re-approved the $1.5 trillion Trump tax cuts Wednesday after the Senate OK'd the measure in the morning with a 51-48 vote. The bill now heads to President Trump's desk. The House had to revisit Tuesday's vote due to procedural issues.X Now the focus on Wall Street is figuring out just how big of a bonanza the new 21% corporate tax rate will be for corporate America and how much of a boost to earnings investors should expect.On Monday, Goldman Sachs said that Wells Fargo (WFC) stands to gain the most among the biggest U.S. banks from the tax package, with a 17% earnings boost. Beyond the corporate rate cut, the legislation also limits the deductibility of FDIC premiums and limits the ability of companies to deduct past losses, which would hit Citigroup the hardest. After Wells Fargo, Goldman sees PNC Financial Services (PNC) and Bank of America (BAC) as the biggest winners, with expected earnings increases of 15% and 14%.BofA Merrill Lynch analyst Kenneth Bruce upgraded credit-card issuers Capital One Financial (COF), Discover Financial Services (DFS) and Synchrony Financial (SYF) to neutral from buy on Monday and reiterated a buy rating on American Express (AXP), saying tax legislation wasn't fully priced in to the stocks. Bruce sees a 15%-25% boost to EPS, with Discover and Synchrony near the top of the range and Capital One and AmEx both poised for a 17% EPS increase.Delta Air Lines (DAL) CEO Ed Bastian told analysts last week that a 21% corporate tax rate would cut its tax bill by $800 million a year, the Financial Times reported. The tax legislation would boost Delta's 2018 earnings by $1 per share above current guidance of $5.35 to $5.70 per share. That amounts to roughly an 18% EPS bump. Beyond the lower corporate rate, airlines will benefit from being able to immediately deduct the cost of aircraft purchases. Data from IBD's parent corporation, William O'Neil & Co., show that Alaska Air Group (ALK) has the highest effective tax rate, 38%, among U.S. airlines.IBD'S TAKE: Read IBD's The Big Picture column every day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines. As long as the current ""confirmed uptrend"" — the equivalent of a green light — stays in place, leading stocks breaking above a buy point are more likely than not to have the wind at their backs. Here's a good place to start looking for stocks that may be poised to move higher.""Companies with businesses that are primarily domestic-focused tend to have higher tax rates on average. Similarly, small-cap stocks, which are generally more U.S.-centric, could see strong earnings revisions,"" wrote William O'Neil chief investment strategist Randy Watts and senior equity analyst Romeo Alvarez. Among S&P 500 sectors, ""Energy currently has the highest corporate tax rate and would see major relief.""The data show Marathon Oil (MRO) with a 49.9% effective tax rate and ConocoPhillips (COP) paying a 46.9% rate.Energy stocks were big winners Thursday. Conoco Philips jumped 3%, nearly breaking out to a buy zone on the stock market today. Marathon Oil was among the many energy stocks moving toward entry points. Diamondback Energy (FANG) did blast out into buy range in strong volume.CVS Health (CVS) has a 38.9% effective tax rate, tops among consumer staples companies, according to William O'Neil data. Aetna (AET), another high-tax company, is being acquired by CVS as it braces for the entry of Amazon.com into the retail prescription business. CEO Larry Merlo said recently that CVS would take some of its tax windfall and reinvest it in reconfiguring its stores to provide more health services.RELATED:6 Big Rule Changes For Individuals In The New Tax BillTrump Tax Package Seen Boosting These Players In Info TechHere's How Much Trump Tax Cuts Will Boost Profits At These Banking GiantsFederal Reserve Gives Trump Tax Cuts A Green LightFive Reasons Why JPMorgan, Citigroup, Other Financials Are Seizing Market Leadership

103,MRO,"Oil prices are likely to remain volatile for the rest of the year, but some analysts believe U.S. crude will finally rise above $50 per barrel in 2017.Since the spring, West Texas Intermediate has topped the $50 mark repeatedly only to drop back below that level soon after. The price surged last week after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed to curb production, raising hopes for a more sustained price rally.Despite some doubts about whether the OPEC deal will hold, oil prices crept higher Monday, with WTI settling up 1.2% to $48.81, the highest in three months, and Brent up 1.4% to $50.89.Brian Youngberg, an energy analyst at Edward Jones, said via email that his company expects to see oil prices staying in the mid-to-high 40s before rising above the $50 ceiling next year. But he doesn't see shale companies increasing spending until oil is solidly in the mid-50s, and even then the ramp-up will be modest as firms remain conservative.For now, Youngberg is bullish on EOG Resources (EOG) and Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD) for their ""flexibility both financially and operationally"" and Devon Energy (DVN), Marathon Oil (MRO) and Apache (APA) for their ""attractive acreage.""EOG shares closed down 0.6% to 96.11 on the stock market today. Pioneer edged down 0.1%. Devon added 0.2%. Marathon rose 1.1%. Apache climbed 0.1%.IBD's TAKE: The Permian Basin in Texas is the epicenter of low-cost production of U.S. shale oil. Read more about stock winners in the oil patch in the Industry Snapshot.The U.S. Energy Information Administration said last month — before OPEC announced its plan to cut output — that it sees U.S. oil averaging below $45 a barrel this quarter and in Q1 2017, before topping $50 later in the year.Chris Lafakis, a director at Moody's analytics said the OPEC agreement put a floor on prices of $45 per barrel and while the cartel hasn't yet committed to the production cuts decided last week, he said it was clear that Saudi Arabia is struggling with low oil prices as it trims government workers' salaries and depletes its foreign reserves.""For some places, the point is that we think that current prices are sufficient to have a modest increase in investment, especially if companies are hedging oil prices and as prices continue to creep up,"" Lafakis said.U.S. shale companies have taken advantage of the rise in oil prices to lock in price risk for next year by hedging.""Hedging makes sense given uncertainty in markets, but many companies hedge on a regular basis and may just be taking advantage of the rise last week,"" Youngberg said. ""It may not be a bearish take, just a good opportunity to hedge given the recent flat price environment with oil stuck in the low to mid-40s.""RELATED: U.S. Oil Drilling To Jump Next Year As OPEC Looks To Scale BackU.S. Oil Rig Counts Rise Again On Permian, Williston Gains

Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD) said last week that 100 rigs could be added to the highly productive Permian.Earlier this month, EOG Resources (EOG) announced it would purchase privately held Yates Petroleum to expand its presence in the Permian. And in July, Diamondback Energy bought $560 million worth of assets in the southern portion of the Permian. The Permian is in West Texas and SE New Mexico.U.S. oil rigs rose by seven to 425 this week, Baker Hughes reported Friday, the highest in seven months.

105,MRO,"The U.S. rig count, which is already on the rise, is expected to jump next year, in contrast with the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, which is now trying to reduce its own output after pressuring U.S. companies to cut down.Rigs in operation will average 579 for 2017, up 29% from what's expected this year, according to a study out Wednesday by Platts RigData, a forecasting unit of S&P Global Platts. Analysts forecast 11,151 new wells to be drilled next year, up 25% from the 8,915 wells expected to be started this year.After collapsing last year, the U.S. oil rig count is heading back up and climbed by two to 418 in the week ended Sept. 23, marking the 15th gain in the last 17 weeks, according to Baker Hughes (BHI) data. Similarly, U.S. production has started to creep higher after a drawdown.Platts RigData expects capital spending this year to rise in the Anadarko Woodford, Marcellus/Utica, and Permian basins as exploration and production companies focus on ""highest-margin opportunities.""Spending is seen falling in the Bakken and Eagle Ford plays as companies keep capital spending targets steady, but drilling improvements and efficiencies have helped lower costs.""We have seen efficiency gains, like  high grading, and companies are able to do more with less as far as capex is concerned,"" said Jenna Delaney, senior energy analyst, Platts Analytics. ""They had to get creative to survive, and even though prices are only going to rise a fairly marginal amount next year, we would still see production rebounding.""IBD'S TAKE: The Permian is the epicenter of low-cost production of U.S. shale oil and investors should look at shale oil companies with large assets in the Texas play. Read more about stock winners in the oil patch in the Industry Snapshot. The Permian has been the focus of heavy acquisition interest lately.Noble Energy (NBL), Marathon Oil (MRO), and Occidental (OXY) are reportedly looking at offers for privately held Silver Hill Energy Partners.EOG Resources (EOG) said earlier this month it would buy Yates Petroleum to expand its presence in the Permian, and in July Diamondback Energy (FANG) bought $560 million worth of assets in the southern portion of the Permian.Chevron (CVX), the Permian's largest net acreage holder, could double its holdings there to $3 billion by 2020, according to a BMO Capital Markets note out earlier this month.Producers will also use their extra capital to finish drilled but uncompleted (DUC) wells. Platts RigData  said that DUC ""inventories may get depleted by between 950 to 1,200 wells this year.""The rise in U.S. rig counts comes as OPEC and other top producers agreed to limit production starting in November, according to Reuters.OPEC members are discussing concessions where Saudi Arabia would cut 400,000 barrels a day from its production, which hit 10.6 million barrels  a day in August, and Iran would cap production at 3.7 million barrels, the Wall Street Journal reported earlier, below the presanction level of about 4 million Tehran has said it is targeting.""If OPEC actually curtails production obviously that is going to be supportive of prices, and the rig count tends to track what the price of oil does,"" said Trey Cowan, Senior Industry Analyst, Platts RigData.Shares of Noble Energy climbed 4.55% in the stock market today on news of the OPEC agreement.

Iran, which refused to join other nations in a push to freeze output in April, could be ready to start discussions on production quotas within one or two months, according to an official from the state oil company.Oil has rebounded after slumping to the lowest since 2003 earlier this year amid signs the global glut will ease as U.S. production declines. While Iran may soon be open to discussions with other members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, there isn’t currently a proposal to revive output limits at its June meeting and delegates from the group said such action may no longer be necessary as the market improves.“The production decline in the U.S. is now obvious,” said Abhishek Deshpande, an analyst at Natixis SA in London. ""It’s moving slowly, but it’s moving in the right direction. The rate at which we’ll see it drop this year and next will be determined by prices, and whether producers can survive the price rout without going bankrupt.""West Texas Intermediate for June delivery rose 4.4% to $45.70 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract gained 13 cents to $43.78 on Wednesday. Total volume traded was about 76 percent above the 100-day average.Brent for July settlement gained 4.1% to $46.45 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange.

Managing Director Rokneddin Javadi said in Tehran. Exports averaged 2.1 million barrels a day last month out of total production of 3.7 million, he said.U.S. production slid by 113,000 barrels a day to 8.83 million, according to a report Wednesday from the Energy Information Administration. That’s the biggest weekly drop since August 2015. Nationwide crude inventories increased by 2.8 million barrels to 543.4 million, the most since 1929.Oil-market news:Suncor Energy (SU) and Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) are among companies reducing production in Canada because of a blaze that may affect more than 1 million barrels a day of capacity, according to company statements and data published in Alberta’s Spring Oil Sands Quarterly. The wildfires have already reduced capacity by 800,000 barrels a day, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Canadian Natural Resources Ltd., the nation’s largest heavy-oil producer, reported a narrower first-quarter loss as production volumes met forecasts and costs dropped. Marathon Oil (MRO) reported a first-quarter loss of $407 million as oil and natural gas producers continue to be affected by the downturn. The U.S. shale boom that cut crude imports by 32 percent in a decade isn’t being felt out west as California grows increasingly dependent on Middle East supplies. Saudi Arabian Oil Co. raised prices for crude grades to Asia by the most since April 2015, a sign that the world’s biggest exporter may be expecting demand to recover.

124,MRO,"Moody's put Chevron (CVX) on review for a downgrade on expected negative free cash flow and changed Exxon Mobil's (XOM) debt rating outlook to negative, as lower capital reinvestment will likely haunt the oil major for the rest of the decade.The ratings agency predicts negative free cash flow this year and next at Chevron, according to a note from Pete Speer, Moody’s senior vice preesident. He thinks negative free cash flow could even continue until 2018.Last month Chevron cut its capital spending for this year by 25% vs. 2015, but Moody's sees negative free cash flow to exceeded $15 billion in 2016, despite the spending cut. Chevron had negative free cash flow of around $16 billion in 2015.Chevron shares closed down 1.1% in the stock market today as oil prices fell.Moody's changed Exxon's debt rating outlook to negative from stable on ""negative free cash flow and weak cash flow based leverage metrics for ExxonMobil in 2016 and 2017.""Exxon is also cutting capex this year and Speer thinks the ""diminished level of capital reinvestment could adversely affect Exxon's reserve replacement and production profile in the latter part of this decade.""Exxon shares dipped 0.3%.Moody's also downgraded ConocoPhillips' (COP), Marathon Oil's (MRO), Devon Energy's (DVN) and Apache's (APA) senior unsecured ratings with a negative outlooks late Thursday.

125,MRO,"The number of oil rigs operating in the U.S. fell for the 14th time in 15 weeks, as top shale firms hold off on completing wells.Baker Hughes (BHI) said Friday that the rig count fell by 13 to 400 in the past week, the lowest level since December 2009 and down from a peak of 1,609 in October 2014.The number of natural gas rigs ticked up to 102 from 101, despite prices hitting a 17-year low during the week.Crude prices rallied for most of Friday as pipeline issues in Iraq and Nigeria are expected to keep 800,000 barrels temporarily off the market. But they reversed lower, with Brent futures closing down 0.5% at $35.10 a barrel and U.S. oil down 0.9% at $32.78.The oil bust and the collapse in drilling activity have hit oilfield service providers especially hard, with the pain continuing as prices stay lower for longer.On Thursday, Halliburton (HAL) said it would cut its workforce by another 8%, roughly 5,000 jobs. Since 2014, the company has slashed 22,000 employees, or 25% of its workforce. Halliburton also has been divesting assets to get European regulators to approve its acquisition of Baker Hughes.Rival Schlumberger (SLB) has laid off 34,000 workers, or 26% of its workforce, since the end of 2014, including 10,000 cuts in in the past quarter.Baker Hughes shares closed up 2.3% in the stock market today. Halliburton rose 0.95%. Schlumberger edged up 0.2%.The new round of  layoffs come as U.S. shale drillers stop completion activities in the massive Bakken shale formation.Late Wednesday, Continental Resources (CLR) said it stopped fracking operations in the Bakken. It already had planned to defer most completions in the North Dakota play in 2016.It has four operated drilling rigs in the North Dakota Bakken, with plans to maintain that level through the year, but said it has no stimulation crews deployed there.Also late Wednesday, Whiting Petroleum (WLL) said it will stop completing wells and cut its 2016 capital spending budget by 80% from 2015 to $500 million.Shale companies hope that by leaving wells drilled but not completed, they can bring back production quickly once oil prices rise. Fracking a well normally accounts for two-thirds of a well’s total production costs.While oil companies are trying to save money by operating fewer rigs and slashing budgets, their debt ratings are in jeopardy as lower revenue and investment will likely hurt companies for the next four years.Late Thursday, Moody's put Chevron (CVX) on review for a downgrade on expected negative free cash flow and changed Exxon Mobil’s (XOM) debt rating outlook to negative, as lower capital reinvestment will likely haunt the oil major for the rest of the decade.The ratings agency also downgraded ConocoPhillips’ (COP), Marathon Oil’s (MRO), Devon Energy’s (DVN) and Apache’s (APA) senior unsecured ratings with a negative outlooks late Thursday.

But IEA sees total U.S. production hitting a record high of 14.2 million barrels a day by 2021, helped by cost cuts and efficiencies.""Anybody who believes that we have seen the last of rising LTO production in the United States should think again,"" the IEA said.U.S. crude futures jumped 6.2% to $31.48 a barrel, and Brent crude rose 5.1% to $34.69, lifting shares of top oil companies. Chevron (CVX) climbed 2.7%, Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) 2.1% and BP (BP) 1.85%%, but Exxon Mobil (XOM) dipped 0.1%t.However, as oil companies continue to make cutbacks, the energy watchdog for top developed economies warned that ""the availability of resources that can be easily and quickly tapped will limit the scope of rallies -- at least in the near term.""“It is easy for consumers to be lulled into complacency by ample stocks and low prices today, but they should heed the writing on the wall: The historic investment cuts we are seeing raise the odds of unpleasant oil-security surprises in the not-too-distant-future,” IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol said in a statement.The U.S. oil rig count continued to fall last week, Baker Hughes (BHI) said, while the Energy Information Administration reported crude inventories rose. Marathon Oil Corp. (MRO), Antero Resources (AR) and Gulfport Energy (GPOR) all announced big spending cuts in recent days.And earlier, Exxon Mobil, Chevron and ConocoPhillips (COP) announced steep spending cuts.In addition to the U.S., Iran would be another expected leader in oil-production growth, according to IEA.With sanctions easing, Iran's production is seen hitting 3.9 million barrels a day by 2021.The IEA said 4.1 million barrels a day would be added the oil supply worldwide between 2015 and 2021, though that's well below 11 million barrels per day between 2009 and 2015.The report comes after Saudi Arabia, Russia, Qatar and Venezuela have agreed to freeze output at January's levels as long as they aren't the only nations to do so. But it was unclear whether Iran would join that agreement, and Nigeria's government said Iraq and Iran ought to have more flexibility to recover market share.“Countries like Iran and Iraq have been out of the market for a while and if they are to come back you shouldn’t freeze them out where they are, you should freeze them at a higher level,” Minister of State for Petroleum Resources Emmanuel Kachikwu said Sunday, according to Bloomberg.Saudi Oil Minister Ali al-Naimi is set to talk Tuesday at the IHS CERAWeek conference in Houston. Nigeria will also meet with the Saudi king on Tuesday, with plans to talk about propping up oil prices, Bloomberg said.Image provided by Shutterstock.

Industrial production has also been weak, and the strong dollar has hit exporters.David Kostin, Goldman Sachs' chief U.S. equity analyst, came up with the recommendations for recession stocks on the assumption that strong balance sheets and high domestics sales should outperform in a downturn, according to Bloomberg.In addition to Facebook, Starbucks and Visa, Goldman also named Alphabet (GOOGL,), Whole Foods Market (WFM), which continues to benefit from the trend in the U.S. toward healthy food, industrial giant 3M (MMM) and Verizon Communications (VZ), the top wireless service provider.Facebook closed up 0.3% on the stock market today.

176,MRO,"""Fed Keeps December Rate Hike In Play - Officials remove explicit mention of concern at overseas tumult, delivering warning to markets"" - WSJ 10-29-15
"
177,MRO,"The operative word in that headline is 'Play'....in this case Play is defined as 'engaging in activity for enjoyment or fun - to amuse oneself'  
"
178,MRO,"""Federal Reserve officials explicitly said they might raise short term interest rates in December pushing back against investors who have bet that the central bank wouldn’t move this year.""
"
179,MRO,"They continue to try and convince us that they are going to move in 2015....and December is their last opportunity.......but can they really?  US macro data continues to weaken,  The U6 Underemployment rates is still above 10%, inflation remains frustratingly low,  congress just approved a disastrous 'spending plan' kicking their responsibility into the NEXT CENTURY,  The ECB announces a new bigger & better QE type program to further stimulate that sagging economy, and China?  Well they cut short term lending rates last week in a last ditch effort to 'boost growth' while they continue to threaten another currency devaluation.....and Hilsenrath thinks that these moves signal 'STRENGTH'.........and pave the way for the FED to raise rates?   Now in a move to show us how serious they really are - the FED "" struck from their policy statement a sentence introduced in September that pointed to market turbulence and global developments as potential restraints on U.S. economic activity. As those concerns recede, the Fed has fewer impediments standing in the way of a rate increase.""
"
180,MRO,"Now the funny thing is that the FED is clearly split....some say go, while other say no.......and yesterday's statement was supposed to remove any doubt at all about the coming increase.   Remember - the FED remains 'data dependent' so we will get two more months of 'data' before the FED meets again on Dec 16th/17th.....but remember - they may have wanted to send 'that wakeup call' but in the end - yesterday's statement DID NOT commit to a December move.....(they left the door slightly ajar so that they have an exit plan....) 
"
181,MRO,"And amuse themselves is exactly what they did.....Stocks rallied early on prior to 'the announcement'  - the DOW was up 131 pts at 2 pm.....then the news hits...the mkts stumbles as it dissects the headline...then the algo's hit......sending stocks into a minor tailspin sending the DOW  - down 287 pts - from hi to lo.....in a matter of 13 mins.....only to reverse and surge higher into the close as the 'smart algos' realized that the statement didn't really say anything new...there was NO definitive decision....there was nothing in there that sets the path for a move in December at all.....Yeah - there was a vague reference to a move - but does anyone really believe it to be true?  Not yesterday anyway...as they closed the mkt on its highs  at 2090 on the S&P and 17,779 on the DOW..... You gotta love when the FED speaks out of both ends, no? 
"
182,MRO,"It is interesting to think that all of a sudden the FED thinks that economy is ready to launch..... Remember!  The Fed hasn’t raised interest rates since 2006 - (they have only lowered them)  and here 9 yrs later  when we have zero interest rates (while some countries have negative rates)  - we also have manufacturing crashing, durable goods and retail sales plunging our national debt approaching $19 trillion, housing still struggling, healthcare costs soaring, wages stagnating,  entitlement programs exploding, Underemployment still in the double digits, weak commodity prices, struggling global economies, half the world in recession and the other half gasping for air and NOW she thinks it's the right time to launch?   Is it me?  Now all this says is that monetary policy alone cannot solve the world's problems....so I once again point the finger at leadership.....or lack of...but hey...that's a conversation for another time I guess.....
"
183,MRO,"In the end - The FED made it clear that they won't raise rates until they are 'reasonably confident' that the data supports the move.....and that ain't happening in 60 days.....
"
184,MRO,"Technically  - the mkt has enjoyed a surge off the August lows...making everyone 'feel better' but is it really better?   Have we moved too fast and now need to play catch up?  I think that answer is yes....and as the mkt gets used to the latest FED speak and analysts/strategists recalculate the possibilities - I suspect that we see the mkt back and fill..... Last night we ended at S&P 2090.....a good 30 pts above support.....earnings are coming to an end and so the focus will return to more broader global macro issues once again....For now - I think we are in the 2060/2100 range...and if the 'data' continues to disappoint then expect the mkt to find its legs and push higher (indicating NO rate increase) ....but if as Janet indicates - the 'data' becomes stronger -then yes....look for the mkt to back off as the reality of an 'increase' hits home....and the mkt re-prices.  Either way - I do not think we get a move in 2015...so I suspect that the mkt churns and attempts to return closer to the yearly highs (2150)  as we approach year end.
"
185,MRO,"Now this morning - US futures are off 8 pts  as we await the first release of 3rd QTR GDP...and it does not have a 3 handle on it, and it does not have a 2 handle on it......we will be lucky if it has a 1 handle on it...as the Atlanta FED suggests it will be 0.9% (vs. the robust 3.9% in the 2nd qtr) and some of the biggest investment banks in the country are looking for 1.2% - 1.4% .  The 'official' (govt) expectation is for a reading of +1.6%.... and if it comes in stronger then I think someone will have 'a lot of 'splainin to do' ......

As those concerns recede, the Fed has fewer impediments standing in the way of a rate increase.""Now the funny thing is that the FED is clearly split....some say go, while other say no.......and yesterday's statement was supposed to remove any doubt at all about the coming increase.   Remember - the FED remains 'data dependent' so we will get two more months of 'data' before the FED meets again on Dec 16th/17th.....but remember - they may have wanted to send 'that wakeup call' but in the end - yesterday's statement DID NOT commit to a December move.....(they left the door slightly ajar so that they have an exit plan....) And amuse themselves is exactly what they did.....Stocks rallied early on prior to 'the announcement'  - the DOW was up 131 pts at 2 pm.....then the news hits...the mkts stumbles as it dissects the headline...then the algo's hit......sending stocks into a minor tailspin sending the DOW  - down 287 pts - from hi to lo.....in a matter of 13 mins.....only to reverse and surge higher into the close as the 'smart algos' realized that the statement didn't really say anything new...there was NO definitive decision....there was nothing in there that sets the path for a move in December at all.....Yeah - there was a vague reference to a move - but does anyone really believe it to be true?  Not yesterday anyway...as they closed the mkt on its highs  at 2090 on the S&P and 17,779 on the DOW..... You gotta love when the FED speaks out of both ends, no? It is interesting to think that all of a sudden the FED thinks that economy is ready to launch..... Remember!  The Fed hasn’t raised interest rates since 2006 - (they have only lowered them)  and here 9 yrs later  when we have zero interest rates (while some countries have negative rates)  - we also have manufacturing crashing, durable goods and retail sales plunging our national debt approaching $19 trillion, housing still struggling, healthcare costs soaring, wages stagnating,  entitlement programs exploding, Underemployment still in the double digits, weak commodity prices, struggling global economies, half the world in recession and the other half gasping for air and NOW she thinks it's the right time to launch?   Is it me?  Now all this says is that monetary policy alone cannot solve the world's problems....so I once again point the finger at leadership.....or lack of...but hey...that's a conversation for another time I guess.....In the end - The FED made it clear that they won't raise rates until they are 'reasonably confident' that the data supports the move.....and that ain't happening in 60 days.....Technically  - the mkt has enjoyed a surge off the August lows...making everyone 'feel better' but is it really better?   Have we moved too fast and now need to play catch up?  I think that answer is yes....and as the mkt gets used to the latest FED speak and analysts/strategists recalculate the possibilities - I suspect that we see the mkt back and fill..... Last night we ended at S&P 2090.....a good 30 pts above support.....earnings are coming to an end and so the focus will return to more broader global macro issues once again....For now - I think we are in the 2060/2100 range...and if the 'data' continues to disappoint then expect the mkt to find its legs and push higher (indicating NO rate increase) ....but if as Janet indicates - the 'data' becomes stronger -then yes....look for the mkt to back off as the reality of an 'increase' hits home....and the mkt re-prices.  Either way - I do not think we get a move in 2015...so I suspect that the mkt churns and attempts to return closer to the yearly highs (2150)  as we approach year end.Now this morning - US futures are off 8 pts  as we await the first release of 3rd QTR GDP...and it does not have a 3 handle on it, and it does not have a 2 handle on it......we will be lucky if it has a 1 handle on it...as the Atlanta FED suggests it will be 0.9% (vs. the robust 3.9% in the 2nd qtr) and some of the biggest investment banks in the country are looking for 1.2% - 1.4% .  The 'official' (govt) expectation is for a reading of +1.6%.... and if it comes in stronger then I think someone will have 'a lot of 'splainin to do' ......Look for earnings today from MasterCard (MA),Western Union  (WU), CME Group  (CME),Air Products  (APD), Good Year Tires  (GT), Coca Cola  (KO), Pitney Bowes  (PBI),  and Marathon Oil  (MRO).....European mkts are in negative territory.....not big, but a bit softer....earnings are the focus.......DBK reports a loss of $6.5 bil  and said that they will CUT their workforce by some 26k jobs over the next 2 yrs - sending that stock lower.........Barclays also missed on their earnings....sending that stock down 4.5%... Frances Total Oil reports a 69% drop in revenue....(no surprise)  and they take the stock UP......Take good care.

254,MRO,"Boasting vast endowments of oil and gas resources, the Canadian energy sector boom dates back two decades when superior technologies, high crude prices and a global supply shortage encouraged companies to exploit the potential of the country’s natural assets. However, the oil industry downturn coupled with U.S. shale revolution has hit the country hard, quashing years of expansionary phase and a job creation wave within Canada’s energy industry, especially its oil sands region.Scars of the SlumpOil sands, contributing to more than 66% of the total Canadian energy output, drove the annual economic growth of Alberta at 5.5% rate between 2010 and 2014. However, high-production costs associated with the oil sands and the crude’s fall into bear market territory wreaked havoc on the profit margins of most companies. Finding development of resources too expensive, the likes of Marathon Oil Corporation (MRO  -  Free Report), Royal Dutch Shell plc (RDS.A  -  Free Report), Equinor ASA, ConocoPhillips et al exited Canadian oil sand deposits. These companies then preferred to explore the U.S. shale plays and invest in short cycle projects, much opposed to deploying money across capital-intensive operations in Canada.With the crude downturn, oil sands development was severely affected inducing axing of around $30 billion projects and more than 50,000 jobs. Oil sands capital spending declined for three consecutive years ending 2017.Canadian Oil Sands Still on Slippery SlopeCanada’s oil sands, popularly referred to as bitumen sands, are extremely heavy crude oils, which can’t be recovered at a commercial rate through a well. The process of extracting crude from oil sand reserves is extremely costly and a complicated one, involving strip mining and underground heating. Moreover, obtaining crude from oil sands is also quite carbon-intensive, causing more than 15% higher emissions compared with the conventional methods of production. Leading operators in the region include Canadian explorers, namely Suncor Energy Inc (SU  -  Free Report), Imperial Oil Limited (IMO  -  Free Report), Cenovus Energy Inc (CVE  -  Free Report) and Canadian Natural Resources Limited (CNQ  -  Free Report) among a few others. All these companies carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.While the production from oil sands might grow on the back of completed projects and investments made prior to crude crash, Canadian producers are not willing to make fresh investments in the region even though the oil prices have been recovering.Reportedly, the crude pricing strength is not likely to lead to a proportionate increase in the capital investments in the oil industry of Canada with capex in 2018 to remain almost unchanged with the prior-year levels of around $43 billion. Instead of investing in risky and costly oil sands projects, the companies are now looking forward to pump resources into two of the popular shale plays of the company — Duvernay in central Alberta and Montney in east central British Columbia.Duvernay and Montney in the SpotlightCanadian shale plays Montney and Duvernay require much slimmer upfront investment, and also result into faster top-tier returns compared with offshore and oil sands projects. Known for lighter oil, which is cheaper to produce and easier to refine, Montney and Duvernay give a tough competition to the prolific U.S. shale plays. Notably, the two fields together hold resources of around 500 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, 20 billion barrels of natural gas liquids and 4.5 billion barrels of oil.Canada’s shale output, accounting for 8% of the country’s total oil production, currently stands at around 335,000 barrels per day (bpd) and per the estimates of energy consultants Wood Mackenzie, the output is anticipated to be raised to 420,000 bpd in the next 10 years.Deals Heating up the Canadian Shale PlaysCashing in on the gradual uptick in oil prices along with attractive economics and prospects of Duvernay and Montney plays, Canadian producers as well as various global oil companies are betting big on the country’s vast shale reserves.Leading Canadian explorers Seven Generations Energy Limited, Cenovus Energy and Encana Corporation (ECA  -  Free Report) along with smaller players such as Raging River Exploration Inc, Vesta Energy among others are already tapping into these lucrative regions.However of late, major global oil players like Chevron Corporation, Shell and ConocoPhillips have also started putting money on the promising zones. Notably, Chevron green lighted its first Canadian shale development last November, targeting to develop 55,000 acres in the Duvernay. Shell also intends to spend huge sums of money on the Duvernay shale this year. ConocoPhillips expanded its Montney foothold this year, acquiring 35,000 net acres for $120 million.Various companies are also considering opting for merger strategies to widen their geographic footprint and bolster future growth prospects. In April 2018, Vermillion Energy Inc. inked an all-stock deal with Canadian rival Spartan Energy Corporation for C$1.4 billion. Just a week ago, Baytex Energy Corporation secured a $2.3 billion deal to acquire Raging River for broadening its scope of operations in Duvernay Shale.Production Ramp-UpLate last year, Canadian Natural Resources completed a major expansion of its Horizon oil sands mine, increasing the production capacity by 80,000 barrels per day. Exxon Mobil Corporation operated Hebron project — offshore oil field in Canada — came online last December and is likely to yield about 150,000 barrels of oil per day at its peak. Earlier this year, Suncor Energy completed its significant Fort Hills project, anticipated to boost the company’s output by 20%.Per the International Energy Agency (IEA), Canadian oil output is estimated to average more than 5.11 million barrels of oil per day (bbl/d) in the current year, higher than the 4.8 million bbl/d averaged in 2017. Production growth from three major projects including Fort Hills, Hebron and Horizon oil sands mine, which became functional of late, is likely to provide the boost.Pipeline Problems GaloreHowever, pipeline construction in Canada has failed to keep pace with the rising domestic oil, forcing producers to sell their products at a discounted rate. Reportedly, infrastructural bottlenecks are likely to lead to lost revenues of C$15.8 billion in 2018.With the cancellation of major projects like Northern Gateway and Energy East along with uncertainties relating to existing ones, things have gone from bad to worse for investors in the Canadian oil energy space. Though several major pipeline projects have received the nod from country wide review agencies, Canadian industry observers felt that it’s not going to be a smooth ride amid environmental and political turmoil.TransCanada Corporation’s $8-billion Keystone XL pipeline has been facing regulatory obstacles and opposition from landowners, environmentalists and Native American tribes. The company is yet to make a final investment decision on the project. Enbridge Inc.’s Canada-United States connecting Line 3 replacement project confronted criticism from the Ojibwe communities. The fate of the project is expected to be decided in a couple of days. However, Line 3 will not commence operations before 2019. Further, it will be little surprise if the date is further postponed amid public outcry due to environmental concerns.Kinder Morgan, Inc.’s C$7.4 billion Trans Mountain pipeline expansion project, aimed at transporting Canadian tar sands oil to the Asian markets, has been tackling severe opposition from the green crusaders. In fact, federal government has agreed to buy the company’s project, nationalizing the pipeline. This might defer the in-service date of the pipeline to at least 2021.The pipeline shortage is also increasing dependence on railway and trucks for transportation of crude, a highly costlier and an environmentally unsafe option for the industry.Final ThoughtsThe industry needs streamlined regulatory system, tax reforms and inflated capital investments. Notably, capital investment in Canada’s energy sector is witnessing decline of late, with the spending reduced by 47% between 2014 and 2017. This, in turn, is minimizing jobs, impacting the overall economy. Lack of sound regulatory and environmental framework is eroding the country’s investment climate.While overall Canadian oil production likely to increase to 5.6 million bpd by 2035, lack of takeaway capacity — a major challenge haunting the industry — is not expected to wane anytime soon. The country, targeting production growth of around 30% by 2030, requires more pipelines to be built to supply additional capacity of around 1.3 million barrels a day by the time.Canada also needs to bring in new pipeline projects to connect supply with the tidewater. This is precisely because the U.S. market is the chief importer of Canadian oil and as the former is itself revving up its production, the U.S.demand for Canadian oil is likely to decline. Therefore, Canadian producers must access the new emerging oversees market to enhance its competitive edge.However, as already discussed, there is immense uncertainty surrounding a pipeline project even after being shown a green signal. Major pipelines like Keystone XL and Trans Mountain are not predicted to come online before the start of the next decade, which puts the Canadian oil industry into much ambiguity at least in the near term, if not in the long run.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

255,MRO,"The U.S. Energy Department's inventory release showed that crude stockpiles recorded a large weekly draw on the back of strong refinery runs. As a result, the front month West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures gained 1.8% (or $1.15) to $66.22 per barrel yesterday.The federal data sparked widespread buying in energy stocks. In fact, some of the biggest gainers of the S&P 500 were oil and oil-related stocks like Apache Corporation (APA  -  Free Report), Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO  -  Free Report), Newfield Exploration Company (NFX  -  Free Report), Marathon Oil Corporation (MRO  -  Free Report), Devon Energy Corporation (DVN  -  Free Report) and Hess Corporation (HES  -  Free Report).Nevertheless, the commodity continues to remain under pressure from reports that top suppliers Saudi Arabia and Russia are likely to step up output amid reduced supply from Iran and Venezuela. As of now, all eyes are on the oil producers’ meeting set for Jun 22 in Vienna, which will decide what happens next regarding their supply curb policy.Analysis of the EIA DataCrude Oil: The federal government’s EIA report revealed that crude inventories fell by 5.9 million barrels for the week ending Jun 15, following a decrease of 4.1 million barrels in the previous week. The analysts surveyed by S&P Global Platts – the leading independent commodities and energy data provider – had expected crude stocks to go down some 3.7 million barrels.Record refinery throughput led to the larger-than-expected stockpile draw with the world's biggest oil consumer even as domestic production remains at 10.9 million barrels per day – the most since the EIA started maintaining weekly data in 1983.Oil inventories have generally trended lower in a year and a half. In fact, stockpiles have shrunk in 43 of the last 63 weeks and are down more than 80 million barrels in the past year. The gradual fall has helped the U.S. crude market shift from year-over-year storage surplus to a deficit. At 426.5 million barrels, current crude supplies are 16% below the year-ago figure and 2% under the five-year average.Moreover, stocks at the Cushing terminal in Oklahoma – the key delivery hub for U.S. crude futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange – fell 1.3 million barrels to 32.6 million barrels.The crude supply cover was down from 25.2 days in the previous week to 24.5 days. In the year-ago period, the supply cover was 29.5 days.Gasoline: Gasoline supplies were up for the fourth time in five weeks as demand weakened. The 3.3 million barrels gain – defying the polled number of one million barrels fall in supply level – took gasoline stockpiles up to 240 million barrels. Following last week’s addition, the stock of the most widely used petroleum product inched closer to the year-earlier level and is 6% over the five-year range.Distillate: Distillate fuel supplies (including diesel and heating oil) went up 2.7 million barrels last week, again contrary to analysts’ expectations for 700,000 barrels decrease in supply level. The weekly rise could be attributed to lower demand. At 117.4 million barrels, current supplies are 23% below the year-ago level and 14% lower than the five-year average.Refinery Rates: Refinery utilization was up by 1% from the prior week to 96.7% - the highest in 2018.About the Weekly Petroleum Status ReportThe Energy Information Administration (EIA) Petroleum Status Report, containing data of the previous week ending Friday, outlines information regarding the weekly change in petroleum inventories held and produced by the U.S., both locally and abroad.The report provides an overview of the level of reserves and their movements, thereby helping investors understand the demand/supply dynamics of petroleum products. It is an indicator of current oil prices and volatility that affect the businesses of the companies engaged in the oil and refining industry.Want to Own an Energy Stock Now?If you are looking for a near-term energy play, Wildhorse Resource Development Corporation (WRD  -  Free Report) may be an excellent selection.

257,MRO,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for Marathon Oil Corporation (MRO  -  Free Report). Shares have added about 17.7% in that time frame.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is MRO due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.First-Quarter 2018 ResultsMarathon Oil posted first-quarter adjusted income of 18 cents per share, turning around from the year-ago quarter’s loss of 7 cents. The bottom line was also ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 15 cents.The strong numbers are attributed to higher production from the U.S. E&P segment and recovery in crude prices. In particular, total quarterly output rose 20.6% year over year to 398,000 oil-equivalent barrels per day (BOE/d).Quarterly revenues of $1,733 million comfortably beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,347 million and also rose from the prior-year quarter level of $1,072 million.Segmental PerformanceUnited States E&P: Marathon Oil’s United States upstream segment reported a profit of $125 million, turning around from the loss of $79 million a year ago. Higher oil prices and production improved the results.Marathon Oil reported production available for sale of 284,000 BOE/d, up from 208,000 BOE/d in the first quarter of 2017. The improvement was mainly due impressive contribution from U.S. resource plays in Eagle Ford, Bakken, Oklahoma and Northern Delaware.The company realized liquids (crude oil and condensate) price of $62.22 per barrel, 28.4% higher than the year-earlier quarter’s level of $48.46 per barrel. Natural gas liquids price realizations also witnessed a year-over-year increase of 18.7% to stand at $22.95 a barrel. However, natural gas realizations decreased 14.2% year over year to $2.59 per thousand cubic feet (Mcf).International E&P: The segment’s income increased 42% from the prior-year quarter to $132 million. Substantially higher liquids realizations led to the profit growth.Marathon Oil reported production available for sale (excluding Libya) of 114,000 BOE/d, down from 122,000 BOE/d in the first quarter of 2017. The decrease in output could be blamed on planned turnaround activity in Equatorial Guinea.The company realized liquids (crude oil and condensate) price of $66.23 per barrel, reflecting a 31.4% rise from the year-earlier quarter’s level of $50.41 per barrel. Also, natural gas realizations were up 18.2% year over year to 65 cents per thousand cubic feet (Mcf). However, natural gas liquids realizations fell to $1.83 a barrel compared with $3.86 per barrel in the first quarter of 2017.Costs & ExpensesThe company’s exploration expenses in the quarter came in at $52 million, higher than $28 million in the year-earlier quarter. Moreover, Marathon Oil’s total quarterly cost and expenses rose 16.1% to 1,161 million compared with the prior-year quarter.Capex & Balance sheetDuring the quarter, Marathon Oil’s capex stood at $618 million. As of Mar 31, 2018, Marathon Oil had cash and cash equivalents of $2,490 million and long-term debt of around $5,723 million. Debt-to-capitalization ratio of the company was 31.2%.GuidanceMarathon Oil expects second-quarter 2018 United States E&P output available for sale in the range of 270,000-280,000 BOE/d and International E&P output within 115,000-125,000 BOE/d.For the full year, Marathon Oil forecasts 25-30% annual growth in U.S. shale plays, up from the prior guidance of 20-25%. Full-year capital expenditure budget remains intact at $2.3 billion.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed an upward trend in fresh estimates. There have been six revisions higher for the current quarter.Marathon Oil Corporation Price and Consensus Marathon Oil Corporation Price and Consensus | Marathon Oil Corporation QuoteVGM ScoresAt this time, MRO has a great Growth Score of A, a grade with the same score on the momentum front.

258,MRO,"Oil production is surging in Canada but producers are far from happy as their profit margin is sinking and they are striving to stay competitive with their U.S. counterparts. While upstream companies like Marathon Oil Corporation (MRO  -  Free Report), Hess Corporation (HES  -  Free Report) and others are enjoying the shale boom and rebound in prices in the United States, their Canadian counterparts like Cenovus Energy Inc. (CVE  -  Free Report) and others are thinking of reducing production. The primary reason behind this is the shortage of pipelines in the country. In short, pipeline construction in Canada has failed to keep pace with rising domestic oil production – the heavier sour variety churned out of the oil sands –  resulting in infrastructural bottlenecks. This has also forced producers to give away their products at a discounted rate.Price Differences Leading to Lower RevenuesPipeline capacity constraints mean that Canadian oil explorers are selling their products in the United States – their major market – at highly discounted prices, causing tremendous loss in revenues. In fact, the discounts have led to a huge difference between Alberta’s Western Canada Select and New York-traded West Texas Intermediate oil benchmark. After adjustments made for differences in quality and shipping costs, the Fraser Institute in Canada found the difference between oil prices in the United States and Canada at $26.30 per barrel for 2018. This is expected to land a C$15.8 billion blow to the energy sector’s revenues. Notably, the price difference between the two averaged at $16.54 per barrel during the 2012-17 period, which resulted in lost revenues of C$20.7 billion.As it is, extraction from oil sands is a high-risk strategy considering the extra costs involved compared with production from conventional oil wells. Add to it limited pipeline capacity and things do not look too promising for Canada’s upstream players.Now the question is what led to this infrastructural scenario.Environmental and Political TurmoilThough several major pipeline projects received the green light from the review agencies in the country, their future is still uncertain due to political turmoil. Moreover, environmental protests are on the rise, thereby further derailing construction. The crusaders believe that the rapidly growing movement of oil around the country is unsafe.For example, the C$7.4 billion Trans Mountain pipeline expansion project of Kinder Morgan, Inc. (KMI  -  Free Report) – a Zacks Ranks #3 (Hold) company – faced opposition from British Columbia residents and indigenous communities, who are wary of the potential impact of the project on the environment. The NDP government in British Columbia also opposed the expansion project. Currently, the Canadian government is planning to provide a financial shield to the company from the politically motivated delays.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Moreover, TransCanada Corporation’s (TRP  -  Free Report) $8 billion Keystone XL pipeline – expected to carry heavy crude from Alberta to refineries in the United States – is yet to get a final investment decision. The midstream company had secured 20 years commitment for 500 thousand barrels per day for the pipeline and received Alberta government’s support. However, the Nebraska government sanctioned the Mainline Alternative Route for the controversial project, which is longer than the company’s preferred route and has forced it to review the alternative route keeping the final decision on hold.Enbridge Inc.’s (ENB  -  Free Report) Canada-United States connecting Line 3 replacement project faced criticism from the Ojibwe communities. The capital cost of the project in Canada is estimated to be C$5.3 billion while the portion in the United States will cost $2.9 billion. The preferred route of the company goes against the interests of the Native Americans. The fate of the project is expected to be decided by Jun 27, 2018. The situation has become discouraging for investors in the oil energy space in Canada.Related ProblemsApart from Canadian oil’s massive discount relative to WTI, the pipeline shortage created another problem for the energy sector, as crude shippers increased their dependence on railway and trucks, which is costlier than pipelines as well as less safe. Carrying oil by railways and roads makes crude transportation more prone to spills, which is ironically the primary concern for environmentalists. Hence, it can be said that the pipeline shortage is causing both economic and environmental problems for Canada.Additionally, the farmers who ship their grains via railroads are experiencing difficulties as they are left with stranded cargos and cash crunch. Rise in demand for shipping crudes by rail is pushing other cargoes off the rail. It created grain backlog due to lack of lower availability of crop cars. In short, the pipeline bottleneck is slowly squeezing Canada’s two most important sectors and giving investors a hard time. It has also put the government in a tough spot.ConclusionEven if implementation of the pipeline policies accelerates, it will take considerable time to actually finish the projects. Until then, the economy is likely to take a blow on two fronts, energy and agriculture. In case of Trans Mountain, the government’s plan to provide financial assurance, taking the burden of politically-motivated delays, will further create a hole in tax payers’ fund. Hence, a sound regulatory and environmental policy framework is the need of the hour. The sooner it is devised, the better it is for the Canadian economy. Otherwise, it will become increasingly difficult for energy companies to find new routes to take the country's landlocked oil to foreign markets.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

259,MRO,"West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude continues to trade above the $70-a-barrel psychological mark in the wake of concerns that Iran’s crude export might fall after Trump nixed the nuclear deal.Higher oil prices are definitely a plus for all drillers in major U.S shale plays. Investors interested in the energy sector should know which oil plays are profitable at the moment.The Permian Basin has long been the favorite oil and gas play for drillers, as the region supported companies even when oil was trading below $50, per media reports. At such a low price level, most explorers struggled to survive in areas like Eagle Ford and instead chose to focus on the Permian Basin by dumping assets in other plays.However, the situation is quite different now with Eagle Ford taking center stage following the bottleneck in the Permian pipeline.Strong Permian OperationsThe Permian region has always been in the spotlight when it comes to oil and natural gas production in the United States. In terms of production, Permian has outrun resources like Anadarko, Appalachia, Bakken, Eagle Ford, Haynesville and Niobrara.As per data provided by the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), oil production from Permian has been increasing steadily over the past several years. Notably, the maximum proportion of crude production in the United States came from Permian.From nearly 1 million barrels a day of crude at the beginning of 2009, Permian’s daily production is now heading toward 3.5 million barrels, per the EIA. While the prolific Permian Basin is undoubtedly the hottest shale play in the United States, Eagle Ford and Bakken are the other regions that have contributed meaningfully to the overall production picture.After a steep fall in rig count in the mid-2014 to mid-2016 period due to crude weakness, the number of rigs exploring oil has started to increase. We can say that the rise in drilling activities has been directly contributing to Permian production.Rising Activities in Eagle Ford From minimal production since the start of 2009, daily production of oil in the Eagle Ford region is now headed toward 1.5 million barrels, per the EIA. This has been supported by an uptick in rig count in the shale play.The weekly rig count in Eagle Ford was mostly in the range of 188 to 214, per data provided by Baker Hughes (BHGE  -  Free Report), a GE company. The count fell to below 30 in mid-2016 and is now treading toward 70, reflecting increasing focus on the shale play.Notably, daily crude production in the Eagle Ford saw upward momentum since early 2011, approaching toward 1.8-million barrels per day. However, production started falling since 2015-beginning as energy market was already grappled with crude weaknesses.Focus Now on Eagle FordEIA predicts new well oil production per rig from Eagle Ford to increase from 1,479 barrels a day in May to 1,532 barrels in June this year. Meanwhile, in the Permian, EIA expects the production growth to be only 2 barrels per day.This seems that drillers and explorers are redirecting focus from the crowded Permian to Eagle Ford. In Permian, there is a dearth of pipeline capacity for transporting oil to Gulf Coast export facilities, major refinery terminals and principal hubs like Cushing. This has forced Midland operators to sell stranded oil at a big discount to that in Cushing.Drillers with strong foresight have already booked the existing pipeline capacity for transporting Permian crude to the principal hubs. Thus, other drillers do not have the incentive to operate in the basin.Also, labor shortage and low pipeline capacity have bumped up the cost of production in the Permian Basin, making the operating scenario unfavorable for new drillers. Hence, upstream players have shifted focus to the Eagle Ford, where the cost of production is relatively low.Eagle Ford Drillers Come to the ForefrontHeadquartered in Houston, TX, ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report) is giving more importance to the Eagle Ford shale play than the crowded Permian Basin, per Ryan Lance, CEO of the upstream energy giant.The company’s prime focus on the Eagle Ford is reflected in the first-quarter 2018 production picture. Through the quarter, the company’s daily oil equivalent production from the Permian Basin was recorded at 19,000 barrels, considerably lower than 163,000 barrels from Eagle Ford. (Read more: ConocoPhillips Chooses Eagle Ford Over Permian: Here's Why).EOG Resources, Inc. (EOG  -  Free Report) is among the leading players in the Bakken play and the largest in the Eagle Ford. In the South Texas Eagle Ford, the company has brought online 72 gross wells through first-quarter 2018. The company’s strong first quarter production was significantly aided by operations in Eagle Ford.Houston, TX-based Marathon Oil Corporation (MRO  -  Free Report) has extensive acres of resources in the oil-rich Eagle Ford. The company’s year-over-year rise in production, available for sale, in the first-quarter 2018 was aided by solid contributions from U.S. resource plays in the Eagle Ford.Chesapeake Energy Corporation (CHK  -  Free Report), headquartered in Oklahoma City, OK, has a footprint across roughly 245,000 acres in the lucrative Eagle Ford. Through 2018, the company plans to bring online up to 140 wells in the Eagle Ford.We advise investors not to dump the above stocks right away as the companies currently carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

260,MRO,"The U.S. Energy Department's weekly inventory release showed that crude stockpiles registered a fall of 1.4 million barrels as exports jumped to a new record. On a further bullish note, the report revealed that refined product inventories, gasoline and distillate, both dropped from their week earlier levels. Importantly, the positive data sets have added to the strong sentiment in the oil market.As a result, the front month West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures gained 0.3% (or 18 cents) to $71.49 per barrel yesterday – the highest settlement since November 2014.Over the past month, the commodity has been supported by speculation that the United States could renew sanctions on OPEC-member Iran. True to predictions, U.S. President Donald Trump recently withdrew from a nuclear deal with the cartel’s third-largest producer and pledged to reimpose sanctions on Tehran. The action has stoked worries about a cut in Iranian oil exports by around 1 million barrels per day from the current levels and a supply shortage in an already tight oil market.Energy Stocks on a RollThe bullish oil market sentiment has encouraged buying in energy stocks, which lifted the Energy Select Sector SPDR – an assortment of the largest U.S. energy companies – more than 7% over the past month.The two energy representatives in the 30-stock Dow Jones industrial average, Exxon Mobil (XOM  -  Free Report) and Chevron (CVX  -  Free Report) added 4.7% and 6.7%, respectively. Meanwhile, some of the biggest gainers of the S&P 500 were oil and oil-related stocks like Devon Energy Corporation (DVN  -  Free Report), Hess Corporation (HES  -  Free Report), Marathon Oil Corporation (MRO  -  Free Report) and National Oilwell Varco, Inc. (NOV  -  Free Report).Analysis of the EIA DataCrude Oil: The federal government’s EIA report revealed that crude inventories fell by 1.4 million barrels for the week ending May 11, following a decrease of 2.2 million barrels in the previous week. The analysts surveyed by S&P Global Platts – the leading independent commodities and energy data provider – had expected crude stocks to go down some 2.3 million barrels.Soaring exports in the wake of widening Brent premium to WTI led to the draw with the world's biggest oil consumer. This was partly offset by record high domestic production, which restricted the decline below expectations.In particular, U.S. output rose by 20,000 barrels per day last week to more than 10.72 million barrels per day – the most since the EIA started maintaining weekly data in 1983. In early February, oil production broke through the 10 million barrels a day threshold for the first time in nearly 50 years and has maintained the record levels thereafter.Meanwhile, stockpiles have shrunk in 40 of the last 58 weeks and are down nearly 90 million barrels in the past year. The gradual fall has helped the U.S. crude market shift from year-over-year storage surplus to a deficit. At 432.4 million barrels, current crude supplies are 17% below the year-ago period and are in the bottom half of the average range during this time of the year.However, stocks at the Cushing terminal in Oklahoma – the key delivery hub for U.S. crude futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange – edged up by 53,000 barrels to 37.2 million barrels.The crude supply cover was up from 26.0 days in the previous week to 26.1 days. In the year-ago period, the supply cover was 30.5 days.Gasoline: Gasoline supplies were down a second week in a row as imports dropped, while demand remained strong with the onset of the summer driving season. The 3.8 million barrels decline – outpacing the polled number of 2 million barrels fall in supply level – took gasoline stockpiles down to 232 million barrels. Following last week’s draw, the stock of the most widely used petroleum product is now 3.6% below the year-earlier level though it is in the top half of the average range.Distillate: Distillate fuel supplies (including diesel and heating oil) inched down 92,000 barrels last week, unable to match up with analysts’ expectations for 1.3 million barrels decrease in supply level. The weekly fall could be attributed to lower imports and strong demand. At 114.9 million barrels, current supplies are 21.7% below the year-ago level and are in the lower half of the average range for this time of the year.Refinery Rates: Refinery utilization was up 0.7% from the prior week to 91.1%.About the Weekly Petroleum Status ReportThe Energy Information Administration (EIA) Petroleum Status Report, containing data of the previous week ending Friday, outlines information regarding the weekly change in petroleum inventories held and produced by the U.S., both locally and abroad.The report provides an overview of the level of reserves and their movements, thereby helping investors understand the demand/supply dynamics of petroleum products. It is an indicator of current oil prices and volatility that affect the businesses of the companies engaged in the oil and refining industry.Want to Own an Energy Stock Now?If you are looking for a near-term energy play, Wildhorse Resource Development Corporation (WRD  -  Free Report) may be an excellent selection.

"
262,MRO,"Markets closed higher on Wednesday, driven by a rally in energy stocks, as oil prices soared. The rise in oil prices followed President Donald Trump’s decision to pull out of the Iran nuclear deal a day earlier. Moreover, the broader market also got a boost from financial stocks. This saw all three major indexes ending the day in positive territory.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) rose 0.8%, to close at 24,542.54, registering its fifth straight day of gains. The S&P 500 increased 1% to close at 2,697.79. The Nasdaq Composite Index closed at 7,349.91, increasing 1%. The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) closed down 1.29 points at 13.42, its lowest since Jan 26, 2018. A total of 7.1 billion shares were traded on Wednesday, higher than the last 20-session average of 6.6 billion shares. Advancers outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by a 1.71-to-1 ratio. On Nasdaq, a 1.65-to-1 ratio favored advancing issues.How did the Benchmark Perform?The Dow gained 182.33 driven by a rally in tech stocks. Of the 30 blue-chip companies 23 registered gains.

Meanwhile, the tech-heavy Nasdaq gained 73.00 points.Oil Prices Rise Bossing Energy StocksOil prices hit a three and-half-year high on Wednesday following Trump’s decision to abandon the 2015 Iran nuclear deal a day earlier. WTI Crude Oil increased 2.9% to $71.14 a barrel, while Brent Crude Oil rose 3.1% to $77.21 per barrel.On Tuesday, Trump had said that the United States would re-impose sanctions on Iran. This gave rise to speculation of increasing level of conflict in the Middle East, which could result in curtailing global oil supplies. This saw oil prices shooting up resulting in a rally in energy stocks.Occidental Petroleum Corporation (OXY  -  Free Report) was the best performer in the S&P 500, with its shares increasing 5.4%. Marathon Oil Corporation (MRO  -  Free Report) gained 4%.Financial Stocks GainThis rise in oil prices increased inflationary pressure. This in turn lead to possibility of further rate hikes by the Fed, eventually boosting financial shares.As inflationary pressure is expected to build up with the rise in oil price, bonds are becoming less appealing resulting in its yield to go up. This rise in yield again helped financial stocks move north.

264,MRO,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for Marathon Oil Corporation (MRO  -  Free Report). Shares have lost about 8.6% in that time frame.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is MRO due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Fourth-Quarter 2017 ResultsMarathon Oil posted fourth-quarter adjusted income of 7 cents per share, ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 2 cents. In the year-earlier quarter, the company incurred adjusted loss of 10 cents.The strong numbers came thanks to higher production and the recovery in crude prices. In particular, total quarterly output rose 12% year over year to 383,000 oil-equivalent barrels per day (BOE/d).Quarterly revenues of $1,382 million beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,280 million and also rose from the prior-year quarter level of $1,124 million.Segmental PerformanceUnited States E&P: Marathon Oil’s United States upstream segment reported a profit of $76 million, turning around from the loss of $91 million a year ago. Higher oil prices and production improved the results.Marathon Oil reported production available for sale of 262,000 BOE/d, up from 212,000 BOE/d in the fourth quarter of 2016. The improvement was mainly due impressive contribution from U.S. resource plays.The company realized liquids (crude oil, condensate and natural gas liquids) price of $47.61 per barrel, 22.1% higher than the year-earlier quarter level of $39.00 per barrel. But natural gas realizations decreased 7.7% year over year to $2.65 per thousand cubic feet (Mcf). International E&P: The segment’s income increased 7.3% year over year to $118 million. Substantially higher liquids realizations led to the profit growth.Marathon Oil reported production available for sale (excluding Libya) of 121,000 BOE/d, down from the 129,000 BOE/d in the fourth quarter of 2016. The decrease in output could be blamed on the temporary shut-down of the third party-operated Forties Pipeline System, natural field declines and planned turnaround activity in the U.K.The company realized liquids price of $51.13 per barrel, reflecting a 35.1% rise from the year-earlier quarter level of $37.85 per barrel. Also, natural gas realizations were up 11.3% year over year to 59 cents per thousand cubic feet (Mcf).Costs & ExpensesThe company’s exploration expenses for the quarter came at $57 million, higher than $34 million in the year-earlier quarter. Moreover, Marathon Oil’s total quarterly cost and expenses rose 7.3% to 1,174 million.Capital ExpenditureDuring the year, Marathon Oil spent $2,100 million on capital programs, in line with its guidance. The company announced a 2018 capital program of $2,300 million, with 90% of the outlay earmarked for high return U.S. resource plays.GuidanceMarathon Oil expects first-quarter 2018 United States E&P output available for sale in the range of 265,000–275,000 BOE/d and International E&P output in the range of 105,000–115,000 BOE/d.For the full year, Marathon Oil forecasts sale-ready output from the combined United States and International E&P segments to average 390,000 to 410,000 net BOE/d.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed an upward trend in fresh estimates. There have been four revisions higher for the current quarter. In the past month, the consensus estimate has shifted by 30.3% due to these changes.Marathon Oil Corporation Price and Consensus Marathon Oil Corporation Price and Consensus | Marathon Oil Corporation QuoteVGM ScoresAt this time, MRO has a strong Growth Score of A, a grade with the same score on the momentum front. However, the stock was allocated a grade of D on the value side, putting it in the bottom 40% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of B. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.Zacks' style scores indicate that the company's stock is suitable for growth and momentum investors.OutlookEstimates have been trending upward for the stock and the magnitude of these revisions looks promising. Notably, MRO has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.

265,MRO,"It was a week where oil ended lower but natural gas futures extended gains.On the news front, upstream player Marathon Oil Corp. (MRO  -  Free Report) sold its assets in Libya for $450 million, while offshore driller SeaDrill Ltd.  announced a new restructuring plan. Meanwhile, energy biggie Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. (CNQ  -  Free Report) came out with strong fourth-quarter results.Overall, it was a mixed week for the sector. While West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures lost 3.6% to close at $61.25 per barrel, natural gas prices rose 1.4% to $2.695 per million Btu (MMBtu). (See the last ‘Oil & Gas Stock Roundup’ here: Concho & Devon's Q4, EQT's Spin-Off & More)The U.S. oil benchmark declined for the fourth time in seven weeks. The major culprit was the Energy Department's inventory release, which revealed that crude stockpiles recorded a higher-than-expected weekly build.The commodity was further pressured by soaring U.S. production, wherein output rose to 10.3 million barrels per day -- the most since the EIA started maintaining weekly data in 1983. The Trump administration’s planned tariffs on imported steel and aluminum also adversely impacted oil prices on fears that the move will make pipelines, refineries and petrochemical plants costlier.Meanwhile, natural gas prices moved higher last week after exports hit an all-time high Investors were also encouraged by forecasts of cooler weather, leading to the heating fuel’s strong demand.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    In a bid to deepen its focus on U.S. shale plays, Marathon Oil offloaded its oil acreage in Libya to France-based supermajor TOTAL S.A. (TOT  -  Free Report). The $450 million deal marks the exit of Marathon Oil from Libya.Per the deal, Marathon Oil divested 16.3% interest in the Waha acreage in Libya. Other partners in Waha concessions include Libya’s national oil company with 60% stake, along with ConocoPhillips and Hess Corp. with 16.3% and 8.2% stake, respectively. At the end of 2017, Marathon Oil held 199 million barrels of oil equivalent (boe) of proved reserves in Libya.The transaction is just another move by the company to further streamline its portfolio. Over the last two years, Marathon Oil has successfully positioned itself into the Delaware Basin and low cost-high margin STACK/SCOOP resource plays while exiting non-core property assets with limited upside.

266,MRO,"In a bid to deepen its focus on U.S. shale plays, Marathon Oil (MRO  -  Free Report) recently offloaded its oil acreage in Libya to France-based supermajor TOTAL S.A. (TOT  -  Free Report). This development marks the exit of Marathon Oil from Libya.Deal HighlightsPer the deal, Marathon Oil divested 16.3% interest in the Waha acreage in Libya. Other partners in Waha concessions include Libya’s national oil company with 60% stake, along with ConocoPhillips and Hess Corp. with 16.3% and 8.2% stake, respectively. At the end of 2017, Marathon Oil held 199 million barrels of oil equivalent (boe) of proved reserves in Libya.The divestment deal was valued at $450 million.Marathon Oil on a Divestment SpreeIn the last couple of years, the Texas-based energy explorer has inked several deals to sell non-core assets that do not fit into the company’s long-term growth plan. In August 2015, the company divested its Wilburton, OK assets for an amount of $102 million. In November 2015, Marathon Oil jettisoned Gulf of Mexico (GoM) assets for a total price of $205 million.In April 2016, the company inked a deal to divest its Wyoming upstream and midstream assets to Merit Energy for $950 million. Further, in October 2016, the upstream player signed a deal to sell some of its non-core assets in West Texas and New Mexico for $235 million. Additionally, in March 2017, the company exited the high-cost Canadian oil-sands operations for $2.5 billion.In fact, over the last two years, the company has garnered proceeds of over $4 billion from its divestment deals. Notably, Marathon Oil has made an exit from seven countries since 2013.Deal RationaleThe recent divestment of Libyan holdings is just another move by Marathon Petroleum to further streamline its portfolio. Over the last two years, the company has successfully positioned itself into the Delaware Basin and low cost-high margin STACK/SCOOP resource plays while exiting non-core property assets with limited upside.In fact, driven by the key low cost-high margin U.S. resource shales including Permian, Eagle Ford and Bakken, Marathon Oil has projected an increase of 18% in its total production for 2018. The company announced a 2018 capital program of $2,300 million, with around 95% of the outlay earmarked for high return U.S. resource plays.Also, the deal is in sync with the company’s focus to boost its financials. In the recent earnings release, the company restated its commitment toward strengthening its balance sheet and driving cash flows. With $450 million coming in from the latest divestment, along with the remaining proceeds from the sale of Canadian oil-sands business, Marathon Oil is set for a robust cash influx in the coming quarter. This will also position the company to tap on strategic growth opportunities through bolt-on acquisitions.  Moreover, Marathon Oil has been bearing the brunt of stuttering operations in Libya amid political instability and conflicts in the region. Production from the region once accounted for over 11% of the company’s total oil and gas output. However, amid the political and security scenario, the company’s operations in the region had become uncertain and consequently the output was declining. As such, Marathon Oil generated little cash flow from the region in comparison with the rest of its portfolio.Nevertheless, TOTAL — having operated in Libya for nearly 65 years — looks better positioned to handle the political uncertainty of the region. Despite the risks, TOTAL believes that the acquisition will provide growth opportunities and bolster its historic strengths in the Middle East and North African regions. The acquisition signifies TOTAL’s vote of confidence in the country that is making efforts to ramp-up production amid political turmoil.Zacks Rank & Key PicksMarathon Oil carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Shares of Marathon Oil have increased almost 27% over the last six months, outperforming the broader industry’s gain of 12%.We believe that the company's high emphasis on exiting non-core business, and focusing on strategic acquisitions and balance sheet strengthening will drive growth. However, management’s low priority toward dividend growth and share buyback programs may dampen investor's confidence.A few better-ranked players within the same industry include ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report) and Occidental Petroleum Corp. (OXY  -  Free Report), each sporting a Zacks Rank #1(Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.ConocoPhillips delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 144.45% in the last four quarters.Occidental Petroleum delivered a positive earnings surprise in each of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 24.57%.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

268,MRO,"It was a week where the price of oil rallied. However, natural gas futures were down slightly.On the news front, energy biggies Occidental Petroleum Corporation (OXY  -  Free Report), The Williams Companies, Inc. (WMB  -  Free Report) and Marathon Oil Corporation (MRO  -  Free Report) came up with strong earnings reports.  Overall, it was a mixed week for the sector. While West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures gained about 4.2% to close at $61.68 per barrel, while natural gas prices lost 1% to $2.558 per million Btu (MMBtu). (See the last ‘Oil & Gas Stock Roundup’ here: Earnings Beats & Dividend Hikes from Total, Anadarko & Suncor)The U.S. oil benchmark recorded its second increase in five weeks. The major catalyst was the Energy Department's inventory release, which revealed that crude stockpiles recorded a lower-than-expected weekly build. A tumbling dollar – that made the greenback-priced crude more affordable for investors holding foreign currency – provided further support.Meanwhile, natural gas prices dropped last week despite a larger-than-expected decrease in supplies. The decline was primarily on account of strength in the commodity’s production Investors were also spooked by forecasts of warmer weather, leading to the heating fuel’s tepid demand.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    Houston-based energy explorer Occidental Petroleum reported fourth-quarter 2017 earnings of 41 cents per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny. In the year-ago quarter, the Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company had posted a loss of 13 cents. The outperformance was owing to improvement in worldwide sales volume and realized price of oil and natural gas liquids.

The bottom line improved from the prior-year figure of 17 cents per share. Better year-over-year results can be attributed to absence of impairment charges associated with equity method investments and favorable changes in the income tax provision.During the reported quarter, Williams Companies’ capital expenditure was $699 million. As of Dec 31, 2017, the company had cash and cash equivalents of 899 million compared with $170 million in the year ago quarter.

The prime reservoir of the project – discovered in March 2015 – holds approximately 1.5 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.BP was able to start production from the Atoll field seven months before it was planned. Moreover, the company was successful in reducing the operating cost of the upstream project by 33% from its initial projection. BP’s daily oil and natural gas production from the field currently stands at 10,000 barrels and 350 million cubic feet, respectively.Investors should know that Atoll Phase One project is the first key upstream development of BP, having initiated operations in 2018.

(XOM  -  Free Report) recently agreed to divest its 50% stake in the Scarborough gas field offshore Western Australia to Woodside Petroleum Ltd for $744 million. The gas field is located in the Carnarvon Basin.The divestment can shrink ExxonMobil's risky asset portfolio and give an opportunity to focus on comparatively cheaper offshore liquefied natural gas (“LNG”) prospects in Papua New Guinea, Mozambique and others.Moreover, the company was of the opinion that the economic development of the gas field involved a few challenges like water depth, resource characteristics and execution complexities. With production unlikely to start before 2025, short-run payoff from the field is not available.Additionally, offshore drilling is excessively expensive that might dent the company’s cash flow. The Scarborough project’s overall estimated cost was $9.7 billion. ExxonMobil’s move is likely to enable the company to improve its cash flow situation.

The S&P 500 rose 1.4% to close at 2,698.63. The tech-laden Nasdaq Composite Index closed at 7,143.62, gaining 1.9%. The fear-gauge CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) decreased 2% to close at 19.24. A total of 7.8 billion shares were traded on Wednesday, lower than the last 20-session average of 8.4 billion shares. Advancers outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by a 2.28-to-1 ratio. On Nasdaq, a 2.94-to-1 ratio favored advancing issues.Markets Recover for Fourth Straight DayAll the key U.S. indexes rebounded and increased for the fourth consecutive trading day after entering correction territory last week. Although, the movement lacked specific catalysts, some of the day’s gains were fueled by strong earnings season and steady strengthening in the U.S. economy.Moreover, the Cboe fear-gauge index, (VIX) came below 20 for the first time since Feb 5. A reading below 20 is considered soothing and with volatility getting reduced, key indexes took a breather on Wednesday. For the S&P 500, eight of the 11 key sectors increased on Wednesday, with financials and technology stocks leading the way.Increase in the consumer prices index (CPI) raised rate hike chances as early as Fed’s next policy meeting in March.  The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that CPI and core-CPI gained 0.5% and 0.3%, respectively, in January, better than their respective consensus estimates. Consumer inflation index posted its best increase in five months. But, year-over-year rise in CPI was 2.1% in January, same as December’s figure. Further, year-over-year increase in core CPI was 1.8%, lower than Fed’s desired target of 2%.Nevertheless, possibility of an imminent rate hike led the Financial Select Sector SPDR (XLF) to advance 2.4%, becoming the best performing sector in the S&P 500. Dow components, JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM  -  Free Report) and The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (GS  -  Free Report) rose 2.3% and 2.8%, respectively.Additionally, the Technology Select Sector SPDR (XLK) soared 1.8%, becoming the second biggest gainer among the key S&P 500 sectors. FAANG stocks, Facebook, Inc. (FB  -  Free Report), Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report), Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report), Netflix, Inc. (NFLX  -  Free Report) and Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL  -  Free Report) increased 3.7%, 1.8%, 2.6%, 3% and 1.8%, respectively.Separately, retail sales lost 0.3% to $492.0 billion in January, in contrast to the consensus estimate of an increase of 0.2%. Sales also rose 3.6% from the year ago level. However, excluding auto sales, the metric remained unchanged.Stocks That Made HeadlineMarathon Q4 Earnings Beat on Oil Price, ProductionMarathon Oil Corporation (MRO  -  Free Report) posted fourth-quarter adjusted income per share, ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate.

271,MRO,"Marathon Oil Corporation (MRO  -  Free Report) – a leading upstream energy firm based in Houston, TX – posted fourth-quarter adjusted income of 7 cents per share, ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 2 cents. In the year-earlier quarter, the company incurred adjusted loss of 10 cents.The strong numbers came thanks to higher production and the recovery in crude prices. In particular, total quarterly output rose 12% year over year to 383,000 oil-equivalent barrels per day (BOE/d).Quarterly revenues of $1,382 million beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,280 million and also rose from the prior-year quarter level of $1,124 million.Marathon Oil Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Marathon Oil Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Marathon Oil Corporation QuoteSegmental PerformanceUnited States E&P: Marathon Oil’s United States upstream segment reported a profit of $76 million, turning around from the loss of $91 million a year ago. Higher oil prices and production improved the results.Marathon Oil reported production available for sale of 262,000 BOE/d, up from 212,000 BOE/d in the fourth quarter of 2016. The improvement was mainly due impressive contribution from U.S. resource plays.The company realized liquids (crude oil, condensate and natural gas liquids) price of $47.61 per barrel, 22.1% higher than the year-earlier quarter level of $39.00 per barrel. But natural gas realizations decreased 7.7% year over year to $2.65 per thousand cubic feet (Mcf). International E&P: The segment’s income increased 7.3% year over year to $118 million. Substantially higher liquids realizations led to the profit growth.Marathon Oil -- which spun off its refining/sales business into a separate, independent and publicly traded company Marathon Petroleum Corporation (MPC  -  Free Report) in 2011 -- reported production available for sale (excluding Libya) of 121,000 BOE/d, down from the 129,000 BOE/d in the fourth quarter of 2016. The decrease in output could be blamed on the temporary shut-down of the third party-operated Forties Pipeline System, natural field declines and planned turnaround activity in the U.K.The company realized liquids price of $51.13 per barrel, reflecting a 35.1% rise from the year-earlier quarter level of $37.85 per barrel. Also, natural gas realizations were up 11.3% year over year to 59 cents per thousand cubic feet (Mcf).Costs & ExpensesThe company’s exploration expenses for the quarter came at $57 million, higher than $34 million in the year-earlier quarter. Moreover, Marathon Oil’s total quarterly cost and expenses rose 7.3% to 1,174 million.Capital ExpenditureDuring the year, Marathon Oil spent $2,100 million on capital programs, in line with its guidance.

272,MRO,"Marathon Oil Corporation (MRO  -  Free Report) is set to release fourth-quarter 2017 results after the closing bell on Feb 14.In the last quarter, the Houston, TX-based company reported a lower-than-expected loss on lower production from the U.S. land markets and higher price realizations.Moreover, the company also flaunts a solid earnings surprise history. Marathon Oil surpassed earnings estimates in three of the last four quarters, with an average beat of 1.75%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Marathon Oil Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Marathon Oil Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Marathon Oil Corporation QuoteFactors at PlayMarathon Oil’s strong inventories of development projects poise it for growth. The company has been improving the quality of assets and is well positioned to augur production.The company has successfully positioned itself into the Delaware Basin and STACK/SCOOP resource plays while exiting the oil sands and conventional assets with limited upside.Notably, driven by the robust performance in the last quarter, Marathon Oil raised its production guidance for 2017 to 350,000-360,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (BOE/d) and expects the total production to end the year toward the top end of the revised guidance.In fact, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for total sales volume for the fourth quarter is 390,000 BOE/d. However, this figure is lower than 409,000 BOE/d and 419,000 BOE/d recorded in the prior quarter and the year-ago quarter.While the company is likely to benefit from higher production in the North American market, output in the international markets may hurt revenues. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarterly output in North American market is pegged at 261,000 BOE/d, higher than the 244,000 BOE/d and 212,000 BOE/d reported in the prior quarter and the year-ago quarter. However, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the international sales volume is 134,000 BOE/d, reflecting a decline of 18.8% and 7.6% sequentially and year-over-year, respectively.Further, the North American market is likely to benefit from higher commodity price realizations. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for crude price realization is pegged at $49.70 per barrel, higher than the $46.65 per barrel and $45.89 a barrel recorded in third quarter of 2017 and fourth-quarter 2016, respectively. The natural gas price realizations in the North American markets is also pegged higher, both sequentially and year-over year, at $2.93 per thousand cubic feet (Mcf).Meanwhile, lower price realizations from the international markets are likely to put the company’s earnings under pressure. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for crude price realization is pegged at $43.83 a barrel for this quarter, down 14% and 5.6% sequentially and year-over-year.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Marathon Oil will beat estimates this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter. That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is -6.25%.Zacks Rank: Marathon Oil carries a Zacks Rank #3. Though a Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP, the company’s negative ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.Conversely, we caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Ranks #4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks with Favorable CombinationThough an earnings beat looks uncertain for Marathon Oil, here are some firms from the energy space you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post earnings beat:Keane Group (FRAC  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +14.79% and carries a Zacks Rank #2.

273,MRO,"The U.S. Energy Department's weekly inventory release showed that crude stockpiles recorded a fall of 2.2 million barrels, the first increase in three weeks, and significantly larger than expected. On a further bullish note, the report revealed that refined product inventories, gasoline and distillate, both dropped from their week earlier levels. Importantly, the positive data sets have added to the strong sentiment in the oil market.As a result, the front month West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures gained 3% (or $2.08) to $71.14 per barrel yesterday – the highest settlement since November 2014.Over the past month, the commodity has been supported by speculation that the United States could renew sanctions on OPEC-member Iran. True to predictions, U.S. President Donald Trump recently withdrew from a nuclear deal with the cartel’s third-largest producer and pledged to reimpose sanctions on Tehran. The action has stoked worries about an expected cut in Iranian oil exports by around 1 million barrels per day from current levels and lead to a supply shortage in an already ‘tight’ oil market.Energy Stocks on a RollThe bullish oil market sentiment encouraged buying in energy stocks, which lifted the Energy Select Sector SPDR – an assortment of the largest U.S. energy companies – more than 2% Wednesday.The two energy representatives in the 30-stock Dow Jones industrial average, Exxon Mobil (XOM  -  Free Report) and Chevron (CVX  -  Free Report) added 2.4% and 1.7%, respectively. Meanwhile, some of the biggest gainers of the S&P 500 were oil and oil-related stocks like Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO  -  Free Report), Occidental Petroleum Corporation (OXY  -  Free Report), Marathon Oil Corporation (MRO  -  Free Report) and National Oilwell Varco, Inc. (NOV  -  Free Report).Analysis of the EIA DataCrude Oil: The federal government’s EIA report revealed that crude inventories fell by 2.2 million barrels for the week ending May 4, following an increase of 6.2 million barrels in the previous week. The analysts surveyed by S&P Global Platts – the leading independent commodities and energy data provider – had expected crude stocks to go down some 400,000 barrels.A sharp drop in net crude imports to its lowest since March led to the larger-than-expected draw with the world's biggest oil consumer even as domestic production reached a new record.In particular, U.S. output rose by 84,000 barrels per day last week to more than 10.7 million barrels per day – the most since the EIA started maintaining weekly data in 1983. In early February, oil production broke through the 10 million barrels a day threshold for the first time in nearly 50 years and has maintained the record levels thereafter.Meanwhile, stockpiles have shrunk in 39 of the last 57 weeks and are down nearly 90 million barrels in the past year. The gradual fall has helped the U.S. crude market shift from year-over-year storage surplus to a deficit. At 433.8 million barrels, current crude supplies are 17% below the year-ago period and are in the bottom half of the average range during this time of the year.However, stocks at the Cushing terminal in Oklahoma – the key delivery hub for U.S. crude futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange – was up by 1.4 million barrels to 37.2 million barrels.At 26.0 days, the crude supply cover was unchanged from the previous week. In the year-ago period, the supply cover was 30.7 days.Gasoline: Gasoline supplies recorded their first decrease in three weeks as imports and production dropped, while demand strengthened. The 2.2 million barrels decline – outpacing the polled number of 600,000 barrels fall in supply level – took gasoline stockpiles down to 235.8 million barrels. Following last week’s draw, the stock of the most widely used petroleum product is now 2.2% below the year-earlier level and it is in the bottom half of the average range.Distillate: Distillate fuel supplies (including diesel and heating oil) were down 3.8 million barrels last week, twice analysts’ expectations for 1.9 million barrels decrease in supply level. The weekly fall could be attributed to slightly lower production. At 115 million barrels, current supplies are 23% below the year-ago level and are in the lower half of the average range for this time of the year.Refinery Rates: Refinery utilization was down by 0.7% from the prior week to 90.4%.About the Weekly Petroleum Status ReportThe Energy Information Administration (EIA) Petroleum Status Report, containing data of the previous week ending Friday, outlines information regarding the weekly change in petroleum inventories held and produced by the U.S., both locally and abroad.The report provides an overview of the level of reserves and their movements, thereby helping investors understand the demand/supply dynamics of petroleum products. It is an indicator of current oil prices and volatility that affect the businesses of the companies engaged in the oil and refining industry.Want to Own an Energy Stock Now?If you are looking for a near-term energy play, Wildhorse Resource Development Corporation (WRD  -  Free Report) may be an excellent selection.

277,MRO,"The U.S. Energy Department's inventory release showed that crude stockpiles recorded a second straight weekly build. On a further bearish note, gasoline and distillate inventories rose, too.However, the talking point from the data sets was the steady trend of rising domestic oil production that continues to be the biggest headwind for the market. EIA revealed that weekly U.S. crude output jumped above 10 million barrels a day for the first time since 1970. This has refueled concerns that the domestic supply glut is cancelling out cuts from OPEC and its allies.As a result, the front month West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures moved down 2.5% (or $1.6) to end at $61.79 per barrel yesterday – the lowest settlement since Jan 8.Investors Dump Energy StocksThe federal data sparked widespread selling in energy stocks, which pushed the Energy Select Sector SPDR – an assortment of the largest U.S. energy companies – down almost 1.7% Wednesday.The two energy representatives in the 30-stock Dow Jones industrial average, ExxonMobil Corp. (XOM  -  Free Report) and Chevron Corp. (CVX  -  Free Report) lost 1.8% and 1.6%, respectively, yesterday. Meanwhile, some of the biggest casualties of the S&P 500 were oil and oil-related stocks like Southwestern Energy Co. (SWN  -  Free Report), Chesapeake Energy Corp. (CHK  -  Free Report), Marathon Oil Corp. (MRO  -  Free Report) and Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO  -  Free Report).Analysis of the EIA DataCrude Oil: The federal government’s EIA report revealed that crude inventories rose by 1.9 million barrels for the week ending Feb 2, following an increase of 6.8 million barrels in the previous week. The analysts surveyed by S&P Global Platts – the leading independent commodities and energy data provider – had expected crude stocks to go up some 2.8 million barrels.Record high domestic production led to the stockpile build with the world's biggest oil consumer. This was partly offset by lower imports and higher refiner demand, which helped restrict the inventory injection below expectations.In particular, U.S. output rose by 332,000 barrels per day last week to more than 10.2 million barrels per day – the most since the EIA started maintaining weekly data in 1983 and the first time in nearly 50 years that oil production broke through the 10 million barrels a day threshold.While oil inventories rose for a second successive week, stockpiles have shrunk in 34 of the last 44 weeks and are down more than 110 million barrels since April. The gradual fall has helped the U.S. crude market shift from year-over-year storage surplus to a deficit. At 420.3 million barrels, current crude supplies are 17.4% below the year-ago period though they are in the middle of the average range during this time of the year.Meanwhile, stocks at the Cushing terminal in Oklahoma – the key delivery hub for U.S. crude futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange – was down by 711,000 barrels to three-year lows of 36.3 million barrels.The crude supply cover was up from 25.1 days in the previous week to 25.4 days. In the year-ago period, the supply cover was 31.6 days.Gasoline: Gasoline supplies recorded their twelfth increase in 13 weeks on the strength of production and imports. The 3.4 million barrels addition – significantly above the polled number of 200,000 barrels rise in supply level – took gasoline stockpiles up to 245.5 million barrels. Despite last week’s increase, the stock of the most widely used petroleum product remains 4.2% below the year-earlier level and is in the middle of the average range.Distillate: Distillate fuel supplies (including diesel and heating oil) gained 3.9 million barrels last week, contrary to analysts’ expectations for 800,000 barrels decrease in supply level. The weekly rise could be attributed to tepid demand and strong production. But at 141.8 million barrels, current supplies are still 16.9% below the year-ago level and are in the middle of the average range for this time of the year.Refinery Rates: Refinery utilization was up by 4.4% from the prior week to 92.5%.About the Weekly Petroleum Status ReportThe Energy Information Administration (EIA) Petroleum Status Report, containing data of the previous week ending Friday, outlines information regarding the weekly change in petroleum inventories held and produced by the U.S., both locally and abroad.The report provides an overview of the level of reserves and their movements, thereby helping investors understand the demand/supply dynamics of petroleum products. It is an indicator of current oil prices and volatility that affect the businesses of the companies engaged in the oil and refining industry.The data from EIA generally acts as a catalyst for crude prices and affect producers, such as ExxonMobil Corp. (XOM  -  Free Report), Chevron Corp. (CVX  -  Free Report) and ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report), and refiners such as Valero Energy Corp. (VLO  -  Free Report), Phillips 66 (PSX) and Marathon Petroleum Corp.

278,MRO,"The U.S. Energy Department's inventory release showed that crude stockpiles recorded a higher-than-expected weekly draw to the lowest level since 2015 on strong refining demand.But the positive effect from the hefty crude inventory draw was partly offset by another build in gasoline and distillate supplies. On a further bearish note, domestic oil production revisited its rising trend that continues to be the biggest headwind for the market.As a result, the front month West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures edged up 0.3-6% (or 38 cents) to end at $62.01 per barrel yesterday – the highest settlement since December 2014.Energy Stocks on a RollWith the federal data showing the seventh consecutive week of U.S. stockpiles decline, energy stocks have been in a strong uptrend lately.The two energy representatives in the 30-stock Dow Jones industrial average, ExxonMobil (XOM  -  Free Report) and Chevron (CVX  -  Free Report) added 3.9% and 6%, respectively, in the past month. Meanwhile, some of the biggest gainers of the S&P 500 during the period were oil and oil-related stocks like Marathon Oil Corp. (MRO  -  Free Report), Halliburton (HAL  -  Free Report), Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO  -  Free Report), and Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (APC  -  Free Report).Analysis of the EIA DataCrude Oil: The federal government’s EIA report revealed that crude inventories fell by 7.4 million barrels for the week ending Dec 29, following a decrease of 4.6 million barrels in the previous week. The analysts surveyed by S&P Global Platts – the leading independent commodities and energy data provider – had expected crude stocks to go down some 5.7 million barrels.An uptick in refinery demand led to the larger-than-expected stockpile draw with the world's biggest oil consumer even as U.S. output edged up 28,000 barrels per day last week to 9.8 million barrels per day – just 9,000 barrels per day short of last month’s record levels.Oil stockpiles have shrunk in 31 of the last 39 weeks and are down almost 109 million barrels since April. The gradual fall has helped the U.S. crude market shift from year-over-year storage surplus to a deficit. At 424.5 million barrels, current crude supplies are 11.4% below the year-ago period and the lowest since 2015 though they are in the middle of the average range during this time of the year.Meanwhile, stocks at the Cushing terminal in Oklahoma – the key delivery hub for U.S. crude futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange – was down by 2.4 million barrels to 49 million barrels.The crude supply cover was down from 25.2 days in the previous week to 24.6 days. In the year-ago period, the supply cover was 28.9 days.Gasoline: Supplies of gasoline were up for the eighth straight week on weak demand. The 4.8 million barrels addition – more than double the polled number of 2 million barrels rise in supply level – took gasoline stockpiles up to 233.2 million barrels. Despite last week’s increase, the stock of the most widely used petroleum product remains 1% below the year-earlier level and is also above the upper limit of the average range.Distillate: Distillate fuel supplies (including diesel and heating oil) soared 8.9 million barrels last week, dwarfing analysts’ expectations for 1.3 million barrels increase in supply level. The massive weekly rise could be attributed to higher output and tepid demand. But at 138.8 million barrels, current supplies are still 14.2% below the year-ago level and are in the middle of the average range for this time of the year.Refinery Rates: Refinery utilization was up by 1% from the prior week to 96.7% - the highest since 2005. The operators kept processing large volumes of crude into products to circumvent year-end tax payments on stocks.About the Weekly Petroleum Status ReportThe Energy Information Administration (EIA) Petroleum Status Report, containing data of the previous week ending Friday, outlines information regarding the weekly change in petroleum inventories held and produced by the U.S., both locally and abroad.The report provides an overview of the level of reserves and their movements, thereby helping investors understand the demand/supply dynamics of petroleum products.

280,MRO,"Investors in Marathon Oil Corporation (MRO  -  Free Report) need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the December 29, 2017 $13 Put had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Marathon shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Marathon is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Oil and Gas - Integrated - United States industry that ranks in the Top 27% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, seven analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while no analyst has dropped the estimates. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from a loss of 5 cents per share to a loss of a penny in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Marathon right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Often times, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay.

281,MRO,"Crude mostly traded above the $100-per barrel mark before August 2014, arguably the most glorious days for energy explorers. This helped the upstream players rake in significant cash and reward investors handsomely. The healthy pricing scenario convinced U.S. shale players to ramp up production by utilizing new methods such as horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing (or fracking).While major oil producers started ramping up crude production, the energy space changed from an oil deficit one to an oversupplied market which resulted in low oil prices. Even as oil is currently trading above the $55-a-barrel mark, the commodity price is way lower than the mid-2014 level.Along with OPEC’s production cut extension agreement, the tax reform bill will provide a breather to energy players.Senate & House Agree on 21% Corporate TaxThe Republicans in the Senate and House have decided to put the corporate tax rate at 21% instead of 20%, per the accord signed on Dec 13. Even after the slight bump up, the rate is way lower than the current 35%. Meanwhile, President Trump applauded the move and is content with the 21%.How Will the Energy Sector Benefit?The Energy sector has long been a major tax payer with a median tax rate of 36.8% for the last 11 years, as per the corporate tax calculator of MarketWatch. Over the same time frame, the average tax rate for the S&P 500 universe has been estimated at 30% by MarketWatch. Hence, energy companies in general have been losing money more than the majority of S&P 500 companies in the form of taxes.  To date, energy firms like Marathon Oil Corporation (MRO  -  Free Report), ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report), Hess Corporation (HES  -  Free Report), Apache Corporation (APA  -  Free Report) and Chevron Corporation (CVX  -  Free Report) have paid high median effective annual tax rates of 49.9%, 46.9%, 45.5%, 42.6%, and 42.4%, respectively, per MarketWatch.Marathon Oil, Hess, Apache and Chevron carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), while ConocoPhillips carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.With a 21% tax rate, oil and gas companies will definitely save a lot of money, which could be directed toward growth and maintenance projects.More DetailsEnergy companies invest significantly as the industry is capital-intensive in nature. For example, the world’s largest publicly traded oil company, ExxonMobil Corp. (XOM  -  Free Report), has announced a $22-billion capital plan this year, while Chevron has set its capital spending budget for 2017 at around $20 billion.In the current scenario, capital expenditures cannot be tax-deducted in the year they are incurred. Consequently, U.S. companies need to plan their capital expenditure judiciously. However, companies will be able to deduct their capital expenditures from taxable income immediately, as per the provisions of the tax reform bill. Naturally, this aspect of the bill hugely favors the oil industry.In the event of companies being able to deduct capital expenses in the year of their occurrence, their tax bills for the year would be lowered significantly due to higher deductions. This will leave more cash in the hands of these companies which can be used to make capital expenditures, acquisitions and share repurchases, among others.Investor Alert: Breakthroughs PendingA medical advance is now at the flashpoint between theory and realization.

285,MRO,"The U.S. Energy Department's inventory release showed that crude stockpiles recorded a lower-than-expected weekly draw. On a further bearish note, the report revealed that refined product inventories, gasoline and distillate, both rose slightly from their week earlier levels. Meanwhile, refinery activity improved.However, the talking point from the data sets was the steady trend of rising domestic oil production that continues to be the biggest headwind for the market.Despite the mostly negative data sets, the benchmark was buoyed by the fact that commercial inventories actually dropped after notching up successive weekly builds.The U.S. oil benchmark also rallied on expectations that OPEC and other major producers will agree to expand their output-cut deal beyond March when they meet at the end of the month. The agreement, already renewed once, keeps 1.8 million barrels a day off the market in an attempt to clear a supply glut.Further support came from the shutdown of TransCanada Corporation’s (TRP  -  Free Report) 590,000 barrel-per-day Keystone oil pipeline – one of the largest from Canada to the United States – due to a leak and subsequent cleanup operations.As a result, the front month West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures gained 2.1% (or $1.19) to $58.02 per barrel yesterday – the highest settlement since Jun 30, 2015.Energy Stocks GainThe bullish oil market sentiment encouraged buying in energy stocks, which lifted the Energy Select Sector SPDR – an assortment of the largest U.S. energy companies – almost 0.4% Wednesday. Some of the biggest gainers of the S&P 500 yesterday were oil and oil-related companies like Chesapeake Energy Corporation (CHK  -  Free Report), Range Resources Corporation (RRC  -  Free Report), Marathon Oil Corporation (MRO  -  Free Report), Southwestern Energy Company (SWN  -  Free Report) and Helmerich & Payne, Inc. (HP  -  Free Report).Analysis of the EIA DataCrude Oil: The federal government’s EIA report revealed that crude inventories fell by 1.9 million barrels for the week ending Nov 17, following a rise of 1.9 million barrels in the previous week. The analysts surveyed by S&P Global Platts – the leading independent commodities and energy data provider – had expected crude stocks to go down some 2.1 million barrels.An uptick in refinery demand led to the stockpile draw with the world's biggest oil consumer. But the withdrawal failed to match up with expectations as U.S. output rose by 13,000 barrels per day last week to 9.7 million barrels per day – the most since the EIA started maintaining weekly data in 1983.Oil stockpiles have shrunk in 25 of the last 33 weeks and are down more than 76 million barrels since April. The gradual fall has helped the U.S. crude market shift from year-over-year storage surplus to a deficit. At 457.1 million barrels, current crude supplies are 6.5% below the year-ago period though they are in the upper half of the average range during this time of the year.Meanwhile, stocks at the Cushing terminal in Oklahoma – the key delivery hub for U.S. crude futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange – was down by 1.8 million barrels to 61.2 million barrels.The crude supply cover was down from 28.3 days in the previous week to 27.8 days. In the year-ago period, the supply cover was 30.7 days.Gasoline: Supplies of gasoline were up for the second straight week as production jumped. The small, 44,000 barrels addition – compared to the polled number of 1 million barrels rise in supply level – took gasoline stockpiles up to 210.5 million barrels. Despite last week’s increase, the existing stock of the most widely used petroleum product remains 6% below the year-earlier level but is in the middle of the average range.Distillate: Distillate fuel supplies (including diesel and heating oil) edged up 269,000 barrels last week, contrary to analysts’ expectations for 1.8 million barrels decrease in supply level. The marginal weekly rise could be attributed to healthy production. At 125 million barrels, current supplies are 16.2% below the year-ago level and are in the middle of the average range for this time of the year.Refinery Rates: Refinery utilization was up by 0.3% from the prior week to 91.3%.About the Weekly Petroleum Status ReportThe Energy Information Administration (EIA) Petroleum Status Report, containing data of the previous week ending Friday, outlines information regarding the weekly change in petroleum inventories held and produced by the U.S., both locally and abroad.The report provides an overview of the level of reserves and their movements, thereby helping investors understand the demand/supply dynamics of petroleum products. It is an indicator of current oil prices and volatility that affect the businesses of the companies engaged in the oil and refining industry.Want to Own an Energy Stock Now?If you are looking for a near-term energy play, ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report) may be a good selection.

Per the latest Earnings Trends, total earnings for these companies are up 8.7% from the same period last year on 6.7% higher revenues, with 75.7% positive earnings surprises and 66.2% beating revenue estimates.As of now, 17 energy companies on the S&P 500 index have reported their Q3 numbers. Recently two biggies ExxonMobil Corporation (XOM  -  Free Report) and Chevron Corporation (CVX  -  Free Report) reported strong quarterly results, courtesy of increased commodity price realizations and robust refining profits.

Also, the bottom line improved from the year-ago quarter level of 63 cents. (Read more: ExxonMobil Earnings Beat Estimates in Q3, Rise Y/Y)Q3 Oil and Gas Price Report CardOil:Prices of oil at the end of the third quarter improved amid continued decline in domestic inventories and an improving supply-demand narrative. With fundamentals pointing to a tighter market, price of oil at the end of the third quarter was $51.67 per barrel, up about 10.5% sequentially. A year ago, crude prices lingered around $45 per barrel.Natural Gas: Prices of natural gas dropped about 3.5% in the July-September period owing to the fuel’s tepid demand due to mild weather conditions and hurricane-related power outages. Despite the sequential fall, natural gas prices remain favorable when compared with the corresponding period of 2016. The commodity futures ended the quarter at $3 per MMBtu, up more than 3% from the Sep 30, 2016 settlement of $2.9 per MMBtu.Bullish Expectations and ResultsA look back at the Q2 earnings season reflects that earnings for the sector recorded a massive 252.7% jump from the same period last year — by far the highest growth among all sectors — on 16.8% higher revenues.The energy sector is poised to see the strongest growth in Q3 again. This is evident from the current upbeat projection of 148.2% year-over-year earnings growth for the sector. The top line is likely to witness an improvement of 19.7% from the year-ago levels.True to the predictions, the sector came out quite a winner. So far, for the sector components enlisted on the S&P 500 index, total Q3 earnings grew 253.9% on 33.5% higher revenues.Energy Stock Reporting Q3 Earnings on Nov 1Let’s see what’s in store for three energy companies that are slated to release their quarterly numbers.Pioneer Natural Resources Company (PXD  -  Free Report): Texas-based upstream player is slated to report results after the closing bell.According to our quantitative model, a company needs the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — to increase its odds of an earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Note that we caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Ranks #4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Last quarter, the company posted an average positive earnings surprise of 90.91% on improved drilling program and higher price realizations. Also, for the last four quarters, Pioneer Natural’s average positive surprise was 46.74%.Pioneer Natural is expected to keep its earnings streak alive this quarter also as it has the right combination of the two ingredients.

Pioneer Natural recently announced 6.4% sequential rise and 15.4% year-over-year growth in production volumes. Further, the company also reported realized crude and natural gas prices of $45.35 per barrel and $2.58 per thousand cubic feet, respectively, both of which are higher than year-ago quarter levels.

However, Marathon Oil has topped estimates in three out of the last four quarters with an average beat of 1.57%.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Marathon Oil is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter as it has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of 0.00%.Marathon Oil Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Marathon Oil Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Marathon Oil Corporation Quote The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarterly output is pegged at 237,000 BOE/d, higher than the 222,000 BOE/d reported in the prior quarter. This may boost the company’s prospects. However, lower price realizations for oil and gas especially in the international markets may put the company’s earnings under pressure. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for average realized oil and gas prices in the international markets are pegged at 8.8% and 11.5%, lower than the prior-quarter levels.Our model did not predict an earnings beat earlier too. When we issued its Q3 earnings preview article, the company had an earnings ESP of -11.54% and carried a Zacks Rank #3.The Williams Companies, Inc. (WMB  -  Free Report):Tulsa, OK-based energy infrastructure provider is anticipated to release results after the closing bell.In the preceding quarter, the company reported a negative earnings surprise of 31.6% owing to unfavorable changes in income tax provision. For the trailing four quarters, the company has an average negative earnings surprise of 13%.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Williams Companies is likely to beat on earnings in the quarter under review. This is because the company has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of -0.36%.Williams Companies, Inc. (The) Price and EPS Surprise  Williams Companies, Inc. (The) Price and EPS Surprise | Williams Companies, Inc. (The) Quote Strong growth in production in the Northeast region is likely to result in higher transport volume for the company. The company also dominated the West American gas transportation with the help of its Northwest Pipeline. These factors bode well for the company’s performance this quarter.

288,MRO,"As per North Dakota’s oil regulator, the state’s daily crude output rose 2.1% in September after climbing 3.5% in the previous month. The North Dakota Department of Mineral Resources’ (""DMR"") latest data said that oil production in September averaged 1,107,104 barrels a day, up 22,414 barrels a day from August.Record Number of Producing WellsReflecting a healthy increase and trumping expectations, the newest numbers confirm the resurgence in volumes extracted from North Dakota, centered on the Bakken Shale formation. As daily output consolidated above 1 million barrels for the eighth month in a row, the state’s total number of producing wells numbered 14,190 at the end of September, a new all-time high.Despite the Increase, Production is a Shadow of Earlier HighsChurning out as high as 1,227,483 barrels/day in December 2014, the current production statistics highlight oil’s horror show that has seen prices come down from $110 per barrel in mid-2014 to around $55 now, in between falling to a 12-year low of $26.21 in February 2016. The commodity’s collapse has fueled spending cuts and layoffs while threatening the industry’s creditworthiness by hurting cash flows, drying up liquidity and narrowing profit margins.Rig Count Clawing Back SteadilySome 56 drilling rigs were active in the state in September, flat from the August count. The all-time low of 27 was set in May 2016, while a year ago, North Dakota had just 34 rigs operating. A closely watched yardstick of North Dakota oil industry's strength, the steady rise in the number of units searching for oil and gas in the region indicates increase in drilling activities and essentially steady production. Notwithstanding recent gains, the rig count is still down considerably from the peak of May 2012 when North Dakota had 218 units drilling.Shale Industry Adjusting to $50 OilMore rigs in operation and stable production not only confirms the positive developments for the state of North Dakota, but also points to the rising flood of U.S. shale-driven production.Now at a financial equilibrium, the shale firms are putting more rigs and employees back to work. Throughout the downturn, producers (in North Dakota and particularly the Permian Basin in Texas) worked tirelessly to cut costs down to a bare minimum and look for innovative ways to churn out more oil from rock. And they managed to do just that by improving drilling techniques.With these efforts, many upstream companies have repositioned themselves to adapt to the new $50 oil reality and even thrive at those prices. In other words, while OPEC's moves to trim output and rebalance the demand-supply situation has stabilized the market to a large extent, in the process it has incentivized shale drillers to churn out more.What Lies Ahead?The U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) benchmark hit a more than two-year high of $57 recently. Also, we are confident that improving fundamentals have probably put a floor under crude prices for the time being. While we do not rule out chances for short-term pullbacks on oversupply concerns and a stronger U.S. dollar, we remain extremely confident of a bull run in the near future.In this context, the improvement in North Dakota’s September production bode well for the region. With oil prices likely to head higher, the monthly output in the second-largest oil producing state after Texas is expected to stay above the psychologically important one million barrel a day mark for the time being.Dakota Access Pipeline: Can It Increase Production Further?Apart from the strength in crude prices, there is another factor that might speed up Bakken output growth – the 1,100-mile-long Dakota Access Pipeline.Making good on his campaign promises to rev up infrastructure spending, President Trump ignored bitter opposition from environmental activists and signed executive order to smooth the way for Energy Transfer Partners L.P.’s (ETP  -  Free Report) $3.7 billion Dakota Access Pipeline just a few days into his new Administration. As a result, disregarding the censure from environmental groups and the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, the sponsor brought the controversial conduit online in early June.With the project’s arrival, operators have scrambled to use the Dakota Access Pipeline to send a major portion of their product to market. In fact, around 78% of oil shipments out of North Dakota are now being carried by pipelines, with the costly railroad share dropping from over 24% earlier in 2017 to less than 10%.Market players believe that the pipeline has helped in bettering the region’s drilling economics by lowering transportation costs for operators. Set to carry about 500,000 barrels of oil daily, or more than 50% of North Dakota’s output, the commencement of the Dakota Access Pipeline has bridged the gap between Bakken players and producers in other U.S. oil producing areas like the Permian Basin.This, industry observers hope, will support the increase in Bakken output and help producers like Continental Resources Inc. (CLR  -  Free Report), Whiting Petroleum Corp. (WLL  -  Free Report), EOG Resources Inc. (EOG  -  Free Report), Hess Corp. (HES  -  Free Report), Marathon Oil Corp. (MRO  -  Free Report).Want to Own a North Dakota Play Now?If you are looking for a near term North Dakota play, Northern Oil and Gas, Inc. (NOG  -  Free Report) may be a good selection.

289,MRO,"U.S. energy firm Apache Corp. (APA  -  Free Report) reported third-quarter earnings per share – excluding one-time items – of 4 cents, versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate for a loss of 5 cents. The bottom line also turned around from the year-ago adjusted loss of 3 cents. The outperformance stems from higher oil and gas realizations, and lower cost.Revenues of $1,575 million were above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,416 million and was 9.5% above the third-quarter 2016 sales of $1,438 million.Operational PerformanceThe production of oil and natural gas (excluding divested assets and non-controlling interests) averaged 353,645 oil-equivalent barrels per day (BOE/d) (68% liquids), down 6.5% from last year. Apache’s production for oil and natural gas liquids (NGLs) was 241,722 barrels per day (Bbl/d), while natural gas output came in at 671,533 thousand cubic feet per day (Mcf/d).The average realized crude oil price during the third quarter was $49.34 per barrel, representing an increase of 11.3% from the year-ago realization of $44.35. Moreover, the average realized natural gas price during the September quarter of 2017 was $2.75 per thousand cubic feet (Mcf), up 6.2% from the year-ago period.Apache Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Apache Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Apache Corporation QuoteBalance Sheet, Capital Spending & Lease Operating ExpensesAs of Sep 30, 2017, Apache had approximately $1,846 million in cash and cash equivalents. The company had a long-term debt of $7,933 million, representing a debt-to-capitalization ratio of 53.1%.During the oil rout, Apache – like many other oil and gas players including ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report) and Marathon Oil Corp. (MRO  -  Free Report) – aligned its spending plans with the low-price environment.But Apache is now looking to increase its capital investment after achieving cost rationalization. With returns-focused growth in mind, Apache announced a 2017 capital budget of $3.1 billion, representing a 60% increase over its 2016 spend. Keeping with the company’s planned shift in strategic objective, Apache’s oil and gas capital investments totaled $843 million during the July-September period, 95.1% higher than the $432 million incurred a year ago.Apache’s third quarter lease operating expenses totaled $358 million, down 6.3% from the year-ago quarter. However, total costs and expenses fell 36.7% from the third quarter of 2016 to $1,482 million.Zacks Rank & Stock PicksApache currently retains a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A better-ranked player from the same space would be QEP Resources Inc.

290,MRO,"Leading upstream energy player Marathon Oil Corporation (MRO  -  Free Report) posted third-quarter 2017 adjusted loss of 8 cents per share, narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 14 cents. Increased production activities especially from the U.S. markets and higher commodity price realizations drove the results. The loss also lowered than the year-earlier adjusted loss figure of 11 cents.Quarterly revenues of $1,252 million surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,024 million. Further top line improved from the prior-year figure of $990 million.Marathon Oil Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Marathon Oil Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Marathon Oil Corporation Quote Segmental PerformanceNorth America E&P: Marathon Oil’s North American upstream segment reported a loss of $38 million, narrower than the year-ago loss of $59 million. Higher price realizations and increased production boosted the segment’s results.Marathon Oil reported production available for sale of 245,000 oil-equivalent barrels per day (BOE/d), up from 216,000 BOE/d in third-quarter 2016. The improvement was mainly driven by higher drilling and completion activities primarily in the Oklahoma Basin.The company realized liquids (crude oil, condensate and natural gas liquids) price of $40.48 per barrel, higher than the year-earlier quarter level of $34 per barrel, reflecting an increase of 19%. Natural gas realizations increased 1.5% year over year to $2.71 per thousand cubic feet (Mcf).International E&P: The segment’s income increased to $104 million, compared with the year-ago income of $59 million.

The increase is attributed to higher exploration, production, depreciation and impairment charges.

The long-term debt of the company was $6,488 million, leading to a debt capitalization ratio of 35.5%.Production GuidanceMarathon Oil expects fourth-quarter 2017 North America E&P output available for sale in the range of 255,000-265,000 BOE/d and International E&P (excluding Libya) output in the range of 120,000-130,000 BOE/d.Driven by the robust performance in the third quarter, the company has raised its production guidance for the full year to 350,000-360,000 BOE/d compared with the prior guidance of 345,000-360,000 BOE/d.

291,MRO,"Energy explorer Marathon Oil Corporation (MRO  -  Free Report) is set to release third-quarter 2017 results after the closing bell on Nov 1.In the last quarter, the Houston, TX-based company reported a wider-than-expected loss on lower production from the U.S. land markets. However, Marathon Oil has topped estimates in three out of the last four quarters with an average beat of 1.57%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Which Way are Estimates Treading?Let’s look at the estimate revisions in order to get a clear picture of what analysts are thinking about the company before earnings release.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 for loss for the current quarter has been revised downward by 13.33% over the last 30 days. Further, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 for loss has also moved south by 10.42% over the last 30 days.Factors to ConsiderMarathon Oil’s strong inventory of development projects poise it for growth in the coming years. The company has been improving the quality of assets and is well positioned to augur production.Optimizing its core Bakken and Oklahoma programs, Marathon Oil expects its 2017 production to grow by approximately 7% with U.S. resource play output increasing by 23-27%. The recent oil sands mining divestiture and Permian acquisitions are expected to boost the company’s prospects.Marathon Oil recently stated that its third-quarter 2017 average production for sale from the United States will be toward the high end of its guidance despite Hurricane Harvey’s impact. It had guided production of around 230,000-240,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day (BOE/d).The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarterly output is pegged at 237,000 BOE/d, higher than the 222,000 BOE/d reported in the prior quarter. The company foresees its global E&P operations, excluding Libya, to produce 345,000-360,000 net BOE/d. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total sales volume stands at 372,000 BOE/d as against 357,000 BOE/d in second-quarter 2017.However, the persistent weakness in the commodity price environment is likely weigh on Marathon Oil’s cash flows and revenues. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for average realized gas price in the international markets is pegged at 52 cents per thousand cubic feet (Mcf), lower than the prior quarter figure of 57 cents. The crude price realization in the international markets is estimated at $41.61 per barrel, lower than the $47.04 per barrel recorded in second-quarter 2017. Even for the North American segment, The Zacks Consensus Estimate for crude price realization is pegged at $44.24 per barrel, lower than the $45.81 per barrel in the prior quarter. Lower price realizations may put the company’s earnings under pressure.Further, 2017 capex budget of $2.2 billion doubles 2016’s level of spending. This might also hurt the near term financials of the company.Price performance in Q3During the quarter, Marathon Oil rallied more than 14% outperforming the broader industry’s 9% gain.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Marathon Oil is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is -11.54%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate stands at a loss of 15 cents, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at a loss of 13 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Marathon Oil presently carries a Zacks Rank #3. Though a favorable Zacks Rank increases the predictive power of ESP, a negative ESP makes the surprise prediction difficult. Conversely, we caution against Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks with Favorable CombinationThough an earnings beat looks uncertain for Marathon Oil, here are some firms from the energy space you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post earnings beat:Noble Midstream Partners LP (NBLX  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +10.48% and sports a Zacks Rank #1.

292,MRO,"Ohio-based independent oil refiner and marketer Marathon Petroleum Corporation (MPC  -  Free Report) reported strong third-quarter results on stronger fuel margin. The company’s earnings per share came in at $1.77, well above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.45. Meanwhile, earnings soared from the year-ago period's bottom-line figure by 556%. Specifically, refining margin of $14.14 per barrel increased versus $11.32 last quarter and $10.67 a year ago.Gasoline prices jumped to two-year highs in the wake of Hurricane Harvey that struck the U.S. Gulf Coast – home to more than 45% of domestic oil refining capacity – and caused weeks of disruptions, creating supply shortages. With oil prices essentially remaining unaffected, crack spreads soared.Marathon Petroleum’s revenues of $19,386 million went past the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $17,808 million and improved 17.8% year over year.Marathon Petroleum Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Marathon Petroleum Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Marathon Petroleum Corporation Quote Segmental PerformanceRefining & Marketing: Operating income from the Refining & Marketing segment – which is the main contributor to Marathon Petroleum earnings – was $1,097 million compared with $252 million in the year-ago quarter. The jump reflects wider gross margin.Total refined product sales volumes were 2,357 thousand barrels per day (mbpd), up from the 2,316 mbpd in the year-ago quarter. Moreover, throughput improved from 1,926 mbpd in the year-ago quarter to 2,017 mbpd. Capacity utilization, at 102%, was up from 100% in the third quarter of 2016.Speedway: Income from the Speedway retail stations totaled $209 million, same as the year-ago period.

294,MRO,"Exploration and production (E&P) company Marathon Oil Corporation (MRO  -  Free Report) recently stated that its third-quarter 2017 average production for sale from the United States will be toward the high end of its guidance in spite of Hurricane Harvey. It had guided production of around 230,000-240,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day (BOE/d).Due to Harvey, Marathon Oil had to stall its operations at the Eagle Ford assets located in the south of Texas, where the company has around 1,500 producing wells, toward the end of August. After inspections post-Harvey, the company declared there was minimal damage to its facilities. Marathon Oil resumed drilling and completions operations a few days later and reached pre-storm production level soon.Marathon Oil attributed this to its strong early production level from the new wells it brought to sales. The company anticipates production from Eagle Ford in third-quarter 2017 to be in line with previous quarter rates at around 100,000 net BOE/d.Moreover, the multi-billion company foresees its capital expenditure for 2017 to be in the $2.1-$2.2 billion range, dropping from $2.4 billion. The company's global E&P operations, excluding Libya, are expected to produce 345,000-360,000 net BOE/d.About the CompanyHouston, TX-based Marathon Oil is a leading oil and natural gas exploration and production company. At the end of 2016, Marathon Oil had approximately 2,096 million oil-equivalent barrels in net proved reserves (80% liquids). The company’s business is organized into two segments – North America Exploration and Production, and International Exploration and Production. In July 2011, Marathon completed the spin-off of its refining/sales business into a separate, independent and publicly traded company Marathon Petroleum Corporation (MPC  -  Free Report).The recent oil sands mining divestiture and Permian acquisitions will boost Marathon Oil's prospects and position the company to generate significant cash flows over the long term. However, the company's upside potential is expected to remain limited until crude prices stabilize.Price PerformanceMarathon Oil has lost 19.7% of its value year to date compared with 11% fall of its industry.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderMarathon Oil currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the oil and energy sector are Lonestar Resources US Inc.

295,MRO,"As per North Dakota’s oil regulator, the state’s daily crude output rose 1.4% in July after dropping 0.8% in the previous month. The North Dakota Department of Mineral Resources’ (""DMR"") latest data said that oil production in July averaged 1,047,526 barrels a day, up 14,653 barrels a day from June.Along With Oil, Gas Production Rises TooReflecting a healthy increase and trumping expectations, the newest numbers confirm the resurgence in volumes extracted from North Dakota, centered on the Bakken Shale formation. As daily output remained above 1 million barrels for the sixth month in a row, the state’s total number of producing wells numbered 13,981 at the end of July, a new all-time high.Interestingly, natural gas output was up 1.3% in July to 1,876,460 thousand cubic feet per day – another record – as operators scrambled to the core areas of the Bakken where wells tend to produce more gas along with crude.Despite the Increase, Production is a Shadow of Earlier HighsChurning out as high as 1,227,483 barrels/day in December 2014, the current production statistics highlight oil’s horror show that has seen prices come down from $110 per barrel in mid-2014 to around $50 now, in between falling to a 12-year low of $26.21 in February 2016. The commodity’s collapse has fueled spending cuts and layoffs while threatening the industry’s creditworthiness by hurting cash flows, drying up liquidity and narrowing profit margins.Rig Count Clawing Back SteadilySome 58 drilling rigs were active in the state in July, up from 55 in June and 50 in May. The all-time low of 27 was set in May 2016, while a year ago, North Dakota had just 31 rigs operating. A closely watched yardstick of North Dakota oil industry's strength, the steady rise in the number of units searching for oil and gas in the region indicates increase in drilling activities and essentially steady production. Notwithstanding recent gains, the rig count is still down considerably from the peak of May 2012 when North Dakota had 218 units drilling.Increase in Wells, Rig Count Supported by Enough Fracking CrewsEven as the rig count in North Dakota continues to rise and the number of producing wells in the state reach record highs, production was being stymied recently by the lack of hydraulic fracturing crews. However, the situation seems to have improved now.At present, there are around 24 or 25 frack crews in the state, sufficient to complete wells and keep pace with the rig count.Shale Industry Caught in a “Catch-22” SituationWhile more rigs in operation and stable production could be construed as positive developments for the state of North Dakota, the current oil prices of around $50 will render a lot of drilling as unprofitable. And at the crux of the matter is the rising flood of U.S. shale-driven production.Now at a financial equilibrium, the shale firms are putting more rigs and employees back to work. Throughout the downturn, producers worked tirelessly to cut costs down to a bare minimum and look for innovative ways to churn out more oil from rock. And they managed to do just that by improving drilling techniques.With these efforts, many upstream companies have repositioned themselves to adapt to the new $50 oil reality and even thrive at those prices. In other words, while OPEC's moves to trim output and rebalance the demand-supply situation has stabilized the market to a large extent, in the process it has incentivized shale drillers to churn out more.Therefore, the U.S. shale (including the likes of North Dakota and particularly the Permian Basin in Texas) is perhaps the biggest reason why crude prices are floundering again.What Lies Ahead?As one can conclude from the above discussion, the improvement in July production does not mean much with the oil bust now anticipated to last through this year and well into 2018. While the monthly output in the second-largest oil producing state after Texas is expected to stay above the psychologically important one million barrel a day mark for the time being, there are chances that volumes could fall below that figure if prices revisit the $45-a-barrel level.Dakota Access Pipeline: Can It Revive Production?While the oil weakness is expected to persist at least till the first half of 2018, there is one factor that might speed up the revival of Bakken output – the 1,100-mile-long Dakota Access Pipeline.Making good on his campaign promises to rev up infrastructure spending, President Trump ignored bitter opposition from environmental activists and signed executive order to smooth the way for Energy Transfer Partners L.P.’s (ETP) $3.7 billion Dakota Access Pipeline just a few days into his new Administration. As a result, disregarding the censure from environmental groups and the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, the sponsor brought the controversial conduit online in early June.With the project’s arrival, operators have scrambled to use the Dakota Access Pipeline to send a major portion of their product to market. In fact, around 78% of oil shipments out of North Dakota are now being carried by pipelines, with the costly railroad share dropping from over 24% earlier in 2017 to less than 10%.Market players believe that the pipeline has helped in bettering the region’s drilling economics by lowering transportation costs for operators. Set to carry about 500,000 barrels of oil daily, or more than 50% of North Dakota’s output, the commencement of the Dakota Access Pipeline has bridged the gap between Bakken players and producers in other U.S. oil producing areas like the Williston and Permian basins.This, industry observers hope, will set the ball rolling for Bakken’s production revival and help producers like Continental Resources Inc. (CLR  -  Free Report), Whiting Petroleum Corp. (WLL  -  Free Report), EOG Resources Inc. (EOG  -  Free Report), Hess Corp. (HES  -  Free Report), Marathon Oil Corp. (MRO  -  Free Report), QEP Resources Inc. (QEP  -  Free Report), SM Energy Co. (SM  -  Free Report).Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars? Here's another stock idea to consider.

296,MRO,"One thing the oil market downturn has taught investors: nobody has much visibility into the future. So, when you think of something as a clear line of sight one quarter, it can soon be overshadowed by an unforeseen event.To sum up, even as crude prices continue to make their way up, world oil supply remains in a glut and is likely to remain so through 2017. This might make any oil price strength short-lived.Regardless of the commodity’s price movement though, one oil-producing region that continues to attract investors is the low-cost Permian Basin spread over west Texas and New Mexico. According to some estimates, the region – that has been churning out crude continuously for nearly 100 years – has produced in excess of 30 billion barrels of oil since output began in 1921. Incredibly, despite that impressive output history, analysts maintain that its best days are yet to come. In fact, Permian Basin is key to the studies that say the United States has now overtaken industry giants Saudi Arabia and Russia in recoverable oil reserves.Permian Basin: A Hot Area for Producers   A sedimentary basin lying underneath the western part of Texas and the south-eastern part of New Mexico, the Permian Basin Shale covers roughly 75,000 square miles, almost half the size of California.Experts say that it’s cheaper to drill and complete oil wells in the Permian Basin, as compared to most other major fields. Moreover, there are certain parts of the shale play whose well-returns are the best in the U.S. With crude prices still down significantly from their 2014 levels, well returns have become a very important metric to gauge profitability.Permian’s attractive economics means that producers can still make money there at the current, $50-a-barrel price. This is mainly because of the region's extensive pipeline infrastructure, plentiful labor and supplies, and relatively warm winters that makes year-round work possible. Most other domestic share regions need prices above $60 to support new developments and expansions.As a result, the Permian currently constitutes the lion’s share of the industry's recovery. In 2016, more than a third of the total amount spent on all U.S. deals was spent on Permian land purchases and leases. No other major oil region in the country came close to this activity.Permian Deals GaloreIn January, ExxonMobil Corp. (XOM  -  Free Report) announced its intention to more than double its Permian Basin resource of 6 billion barrels of oil equivalent. The company aims to achieve this through the buyout of companies owned by the Bass family of Fort Worth, TX. Alongside an upfront payment of $5.6 billion, ExxonMobil will make a series of additional contingent cash payments of up to $1 billion. (Read: Exxon Mobil to Buy Bass Family Assets, Double Permian Yield.)Also, Noble Energy Inc. entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Clayton Williams Energy Inc. in a bid to expand its footprint in the Permian Basin. The transaction is worth $3.2 billion, post Noble Energy’s assumption of Clayton Williams’ net debt of $500 million. (Read: Noble Energy to Acquire Clayton Williams for $3.2B.)In February, Parsley Energy Inc. entered into an agreement with Double Eagle Energy Permian, LLC to acquire certain assets in the oil-rich Permian basin for $2.8 billion. (Read: Parsley Inks Permian Acquisition Deal, Updates Guidance)Toward the end March, Marathon Oil Corporation (MRO  -  Free Report) bought additional Permian Basin acreage for $700 million in cash. The followed the company’s decision to acquire 70,000 net acres in the lucrative region for $1.1 billion just weeks before. (Read: Marathon Inks Deal to Expand in the Permian Basin)According to analysts, deals of this nature could push up the value of the group as a whole. With its relatively low break-even cost, the Permian Basin is likely to attract more transactions of this nature in the near future. Also, with their new-found confidence, companies could soon be venturing into other oil rich areas. The new administration has already indicated that it would likely review regulations limiting drilling activities in Alaska and in other parts of the United States.Meanwhile, late last year, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) announced that it has discovered the biggest deposit of untapped oil in the U.S., located in the Wolfcamp shale formation in the Midland Basin portion of Permian Basin. (Read: USGS Just Discovered the Biggest Shale Oil Field in America.)Permian Basin Oil Stocks in FocusWith the hectic pace of land grab set to continue in the Permian basin and investor’s strong appetite for stocks focused in that region, we present five companies that investors should watch out for.Founded in 1954, Houston, TX-based Apache Corp. (APA  -  Free Report) is one of the world's leading independent energy companies engaged in the exploration, development and production of natural gas, crude oil and natural gas liquids. In particular, Apache’s recent Alpine High discovery in Delaware sub-basin, a section of the Permian, is expected to be a gamechanger for the company. Estimated to hold massive oil and natural gas reserves, the wells are said to have strong economics and top-tier returns.Second on the list is Pioneer Natural Resources Co. (PXD  -  Free Report). An independent oil and gas exploration and production company based in Irving, TX, Pioneer’s growth continues to be focused on the Permian operations. Its world-class assets in the region is likely to see year-over-year production growth of 30% in 2017.Denver, CO-based Resolute Energy Corp. (REN  -  Free Report) is another independent oil and gas finder in the U.S. with primary focus on its Permian Basin properties. Divided into the Appaloosa and Mustang project areas in Reeves County in the Delaware Basin, Resolute Energy’s Permian Basin drilling program continue to deliver compelling results. Second quarter production from the properties jumped an astounding 227% year-over-year, contributing meaningfully to cash flows.Next on our focus list is Cimarex Energy Co. (XEC  -  Free Report), an energy explorer with its exploration and production activities taking place primarily in two areas: the Permian Basin and the Mid-Continent region. The Denver, CO-headquartered entity is set to invest more than 60% of its exploration and development expenses in the Permian region this year and hopes to bring 61 net wells online.Finally, we have Tulsa, OK-based independent oil and gas operator WPX Energy Inc. (WPX  -  Free Report). Shifting its portfolio from Colorado's Piceance Basin to Permian’s Delaware basin, the company owns around 135,000 net acres in the oil-rich area. WPX Energy entered the Permian Basin in 2015 following the $2.75 billion acquisition of privately held RKI Exploration, gaining 92,000 net acres in the prolific play. Importantly, the company’s acreage acquisition cost at that time was much lower than current levels, providing further impetus to its returns.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!                   It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

297,MRO,"Reflecting the resumption of activities post hurricane Harvey, the U.S. Energy Department's inventory release showed that crude stockpiles recorded another large build, while product inventories (gasoline and distillate) fell sharply. In fact, market players welcomed the faster-than-normal return to normalized operations in South Texas region following the storm’s landfall nearly a month ago.The commodity was also supported by tensions in the Middle East over President Donald Trump's comments on Iran's nuclear deal and talks of an extension to the output cut agreement between OPEC and non-OPEC producers beyond March next year.Eventually, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures gained 1.9% (or 93 cents) to settle at $50.41 per barrel Thursday – the highest level since May 24.Energy Stocks GainThe bullish data sets encouraged buying in energy stocks, which lifted the Energy Select Sector SPDR – an assortment of the largest U.S. energy companies – almost 0.7% Wednesday. Some of the biggest gainers of the S&P 500 yesterday were oil and oil-related companies like Diamond Offshore Drilling Inc. (DO  -  Free Report), Chesapeake Energy Corp. (CHK  -  Free Report), Marathon Oil Corp. (MRO  -  Free Report), Devon Energy Corp. (DVN  -  Free Report), Apache Corp. (APA  -  Free Report) and Newfield Exploration Company (NFX  -  Free Report).Analysis of the EIA DataCrude Oil: The federal government’s EIA report revealed that crude inventories jumped by 4.6 million barrels for the week ending Sep 15, following an increase of 5.9 million barrels in the previous week. The analysts surveyed by S&P Global Platts – the leading independent commodities and energy data provider – had expected crude stocks to go up some 2.4 million barrels.Volume ramp-up from the import and production facilities shuttered in the wake of hurricane Harvey led to the big stockpile build with the world's biggest oil consumer.Despite the substantial climb in oil storage for a third straight week, current supplies – at 472.8 million barrels – are still marginally below the year-ago period. However, stocks are in the upper half of the average range during this time of the year.Meanwhile, stocks at the Cushing terminal in Oklahoma – the key delivery hub for U.S. crude futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange – was up by 703,000 barrels to 59.8 million barrels.The crude supply cover was up from 29.4 days in the previous week to 30.8 days. In the year-ago period, the supply cover was 30.2 days.Gasoline: Supplies of gasoline were down for the third week running as Gulf Coast refineries sidelined by Harvey continue to ramp up throughput. The 2.1 million barrels draw – above the polled number of 800,000 barrels fall in supply level – took gasoline stockpiles down to 216.2 million barrels. Following last week’s slide, the existing stock of the most widely used petroleum product is now 4% below the year-earlier level but is in the upper limit of the average range.Distillate: Distillate fuel supplies (including diesel and heating oil) went down by 5.7 million barrels last week, compared with analysts’ expectations for one million barrels decrease in supply level. The largest weekly fall since 2011 could be again be attributed to recovering refinery post storm-induced outages. At 138.9 million barrels, current supplies are 15.8% below the year-ago level but are in the bottom half of the average range for this time of the year.Refinery Rates: Refinery utilization was up by 5.5% from the prior week to 83.2%. While refinery runs rebounded from the previous week’s nine-year lows, it’s still a far cry from the pre-Harvey rates of 96.6% - the highest since 2005. With more units returning to activity over the coming weeks, we expect utilization and throughput to continue to rise.About the Weekly Petroleum Status ReportThe Energy Information Administration (EIA) Petroleum Status Report, containing data of the previous week ending Friday, outlines information regarding the weekly change in petroleum inventories held and produced by the U.S., both locally and abroad.The report provides an overview of the level of reserves and their movements, thereby helping investors understand the demand/supply dynamics of petroleum products. It is an indicator of current oil prices and volatility that affect the businesses of the companies engaged in the oil and refining industry.Want to Own an Energy Stock Now?If you are looking for a near-term energy play, Lonestar Resources US Inc.

298,MRO,"U.S. Gulf Coast refiners are slowly coming back online after taking a hit from Harvey. The downstream operators in the area are restarting operations while keeping a close eye on exploration and production companies to observe how much oil and gas can come to their refineries post-Harvey.The recovery period is dependent on the extent of damages. More than seven refineries in the area are currently operating at reduced rates. The situation has compelled several companies to revise their guidance for third quarter production.Companies That Revised GuidanceAt the beginning of the month, oil explorer and producer EOG Resources, Inc. (EOG  -  Free Report) reduced its third-quarter U.S. crude and condensate volume guidance range by 15,000 barrels per day as the Houston, TX-based company's operations in the Eagle Ford shale were affected by the storm. However, EOG Resources kept its guidance for the full year intact, hoping production would ramp up in due course. The company carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Upstream oil company Denbury Resources Inc. (DNR  -  Free Report) announced that five of its six fields in Eagle Ford were affected by the storm but managed to restart operations. While the Plano, TX-headquartered oil producer made 90% of its operations online, the effect on the company's production is still estimated at around 2,000-2,200 barrels of oil equivalent per day. The company presently has a Zacks Rank of 3.Amsterdam, Netherlands-based field service provider, Core Laboratories N.V. (CLB  -  Free Report) reported that strong wind and flooding damaged parts of its operations on the U.S. Gulf Coast. The company's clients were also hit by Harvey, which disrupted Core Laboratories' operations. The Zacks Rank #3 company previously expected third-quarter 2017 revenue to be in the range of $165.5-$170 million, which has now been revised to $161 million. Earnings per share for the same time period are now expected to be 44 cents compared with the earlier guided range of 54 cents to 56 cents.Houston-based energy company Carrizo Oil & Gas, Inc. (CRZO  -  Free Report) reported that its Eagle Ford Shale assets were not affected by the storm. Nevertheless, the company's sales volume decreased temporarily as third-party midstream facilities and Gulf Coast refineries related to the company were down for a brief period owing to Harvey. Zacks #3 Ranked Carrizo will update its production guidance after collecting more information on the stalled operations.Other Companies Affected by HarveyChesapeake Energy Corp. (CHK  -  Free Report) paused its drilling and completion of new wells in the Eagle Ford shale and evacuated staff from the production area. ExxonMobil Corp.

299,MRO,"It’s earnings time again and investors are back to watching the quarterly releases closely. This time as well, we expect the Energy sector to contribute the maximum to earnings growth for the S&P 500.Our proprietary data shows that through the April to June quarter of 2018, Energy will generate $19.5 billion in earnings, significantly higher than the last four quarters.Overall, the sector seems profitable with sufficient free cashflows to fund growth projects. Since the recovering crude price is constantly backing Energy, it will be wise to include the ‘oilier’ stocks in one’s portfolio.Crude Price Surges in Q2Per the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), the average West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude prices for the month of April, May and June of 2018 was recorded at a respective $66.25 per barrel, $69.98 and $67.87, significantly higher than the year-ago monthly prices of $51.06, $48.48 and $45.18.Notably, the average monthly crude pricing scenario through second-quarter 2018 was the healthiest in three years. Supply concerns emanating from Venezuela and Iran amid robust domestic economy were constantly backing oil prices.Energy Sector to Witness Highest Earnings GrowthHealthy oil price will likely be the prime factor driving the Energy sector in Q2. Among all the Zacks sectors defining the S&P 500, Energy is expected to be the only sector to witness triple digit year-over-year earnings growth of 139.7% in Q2. Importantly, excluding Energy, the S&P 500’s earnings growth in Q2 will likely drop to 15.7% from 19.1%.  It is evident that the recovering oil price, after the commodity hit its lowest level of $26.21 since 2003 in February 2016, has been acting in favor of Energy. From only $10.2 billion in 2016, the sector’s earnings jumped to $38 billion in 2017. We expect the sector to rake in $76.8 billion through 2018.Five Oil Stocks to BuyThe weekly U.S. field production data of crude by EIA clearly shows rising volumes of oil through second-quarter 2018. The surging crude production amid favorable commodity pricing environment is expected to support oil exploration and production companies in Q2.Choosing stocks with earnings beat potential might be a difficult task unless one knows the way to shortlist.

300,MRO,"On Jul 7, Penn Virginia Corporation (PVAC  -  Free Report) was upgraded to a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), implying that the stock will significantly outperform the broader U.S. equity market over the next one to three months.Year to date, the stock has rallied 128.8%, outperforming the 9.5% collective increase of the stocks belonging to the industry.Why the Upgrade?Over the past 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 earnings per share has been revised upward from $8.91 to $10.16. The consensus estimate for 2019 earnings rose to $15.09 from $14.30 over the same period. This adds to the company’s already impressive earnings profile. Penn Virginia has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the prior four quarters, the average positive surprise being 18%.  We expect the company to record earnings growth of 252.8% and 48.5% in 2018 and 2019, respectively.Penn Virginia is exclusively focused in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas in the prolific Eagle Ford shale. In the play, the company operates on roughly 83,100 acres of land with net 500 prospective drilling locations, helping it reach its target of driving production growth of 125% through 2018.  Almost 74% of the company’s production comprises crude oil. Hence, the ‘oilier’ nature of its volume mix positions it to benefit from strengthening oil prices. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude recently touched the $75-a-barrel psychological mark, reflecting more than 186% improvement from February 2016 when the commodity had hit its lowest level of $26.21 since 2003.Moreover, Penn Virginia has strong cost-control initiatives in place. Through 2018, the company is planning to lower operating cost per barrel by 14%, further boosting profits.Other Stocks to ConsiderOther prospective players in the energy space include Continental Resources, Inc.

This Oil and Gas - Integrated - United States stock has actually seen estimates rise over the past month for the current fiscal year by about 8.3%. But that is not yet reflected in its price, as the stock gained only 2.9% over the same time frame.Marathon Oil Corporation Price and Consensus Marathon Oil Corporation Price and Consensus | Marathon Oil Corporation QuoteYou should not be concerned about the price remaining muted going forward.

302,MRO,"On Jul 7, EOG Resources, Inc. (EOG  -  Free Report) has been upgraded to a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), implying that the stock will significantly outperform the broader U.S. equity market over the next one to three months.In a year’s time, the stock has rallied 40.1%, outperforming 26.7% collective increase of the stocks belonging to the industry.Why the Upgrade?Over the past 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 earnings per share has been revised upward from $4.99 to $5.18. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 earnings rose to $6.36 from $6.19 over the same period. This adds to the company’s already impressive earnings profile. EOG Resources has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the last four quarters, the average positive surprise being 30.1%.We expect the company to record earnings growth of 362.5% and 22.7% in 2018 and 2019, respectively.EOG Resources has a prime focus on the prolific domestic shale plays that includes Eagle Ford, Permian and Bakken. The shale resources have been driving the company’s production growth. In fact, for 2018, the company is expecting average daily production to lie between 685.8 and 728.5 thousand barrels of oil equivalent (MBoe/D), higher than 608.9 MBoe/D in 2017.The higher expected production seems lucrative, especially when the crude price is recovering. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude recently touched the $75-a-barrel psychological mark, showing more than 186% improvement from February 2016 when the commodity hit its lowest level of $26.21 since 2003. In other words, since EOG Resources’ production mix comprises of significant crude volume — 55.3% of total production during first-quarter 2018, the company is well placed to capitalize on the rally in oil price.Moreover, as compared with the industry, EOG Resources has significant lower exposure to debt.

303,MRO,"Transocean Ltd. (RIG  -  Free Report) announced the start of offering senior notes to potential investors. The notes, with aggregate pricing amount of $600 million, will carry an interest rate of 6.125% and are expected to mature by 2025.The company will conclude the note offering by Jul 20. It is to be noted that the notes could be called after Aug 1, 2021. The lien on the Deepwater Pontus will primarily give security to the senior notes and Transocean agreed to be the guarantor. Subtracting the costs of offering and discount for the initial buyers, the company will likely get net proceeds of roughly $586 million. Transocean intends to utilize the proceeds for partly funding the purchase or manufacturing Deepwater Pontus.Based in Steinhausen, Switzerland, Transocean is among the leading contract drillers for oil and gas wells, located off the coast. There has been high demand for the company’s technologically advanced rigs that are capable of operating in the harshest of environments. As compared to other drillers, the company has four times more backlog — around $12 billion. This will likely provide Transocean with significantly more cashflow than other players.The company’s pricing chart looks impressive. Over the past year, the stock has rallied 74%, outperforming the 24.9% collective gain of the stocks belonging to the industry.Presently, the stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

304,MRO,"Optimism over Q2 earnings coupled with a solid jobs report has shifted investors’ attention back to equities dissipating fears of a global trade war. This is especially true as earnings for the S&P 500 index are expected to grow 19% from the same period last year on 8.1% higher revenues. This would represent the third consecutive quarter of double-digit earnings growth, a trend that is currently expected to continue in the second half of the year.According to a FactSet data, S&P 500 earnings for the second quarter are expected to grow 20%. A strong economy and historic tax cuts will continue to drive earnings higher. Several economists expect economic growth to accelerate to an annual pace of 4% in Q2, double the growth of 1Q.Of the 16 Zacks sectors, 11 are expected to post double-digit earnings growth with energy (138.2%), basic materials (54%), construction (45%) and industrial products (24.5%) leading the way. However, sectors like autos and conglomerates are expected to have lower Q2 earnings than the year-ago level.Given this, it would be a good idea to zero in on the best stocks of the sectors that have a high chance of surprising in their upcoming release. These stocks could make great plays as the Q2 earnings season unfolds and will likely lead higher in the days to come.How to Choose Stocks?Earnings beat will definitely inspire investors’ confidence and propel the price of these sector stocks higher.

305,MRO,"West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude recently touched the $75-a-barrel psychological mark, showing a more than 186% improvement from February 2016 when the commodity had hit its lowest level of $26.21 since 2003. The surge in oil price is definitely a boon for upstream and midstream businesses of integrated energy companies.Healthy crude price will likely convince energy players to ramp up production in domestic shale plays. From storing and transporting new oil volumes, integrated energy firms are expected to get additional fee-based revenues from shippers.Moreover, the abundance of natural gas in the United States following the shale revolution will continue to back the integrated energy firms’ chemical/downstream activities since the players’ petrochemical crackers should benefit from cheaper natural gas feedstocks like ethane instead of naphtha — which is derived from the pricier crude.Industry Rewards Shareholders with Huge ReturnsLooking at shareholder returns over the past year, it appears that the crude price recovery was enough for boosting investors’ confidence in the industry’s prospects. The Zacks Oil & Gas-US Integrated Industry, part of the broader Zacks Oil and Energy Sector, has outperformed both the S&P 500 and its sector over the past year. We can see that stocks in this industry have collectively gained 44.3% over the past year, while the Zacks S&P 500 Composite and Zacks Oil and Energy Sector have rallied a respective 14.2% and 18.7%.One-Year Price PerformancePlenty of Room to RunIn order to determine the value of the oil sector, we have used the trailing 12-month Enterprise Multiple. This is because oil energy players typically shoulder significant debt pertaining to investments in growth projects and EV includes debt for valuing company or industry.Enterprise Multiple = Enterprise Value (EV)/EBITDAThe industry currently has a trailing 12-month EV/EBITDA ratio of 9.09. When compared with the highest level of 10.49 over that period, there is apparently room for more upside.Enterprise Value/EBITDA Ratio (TTM) The space also looks cheap when compared with the market at large, as the trailing 12-month EV/EBITDA ratio for the S&P 500 is 11.48 and the median level is 11.38.  Comparing the group’s EV/EBITDA ratio with that of its broader sector shows that the industry is trading at a considerable premium. In fact, the solid business potential has convinced investors to persistently pay premium for the industry as compared to the broader sector over the past few years.  Enterprise Value/EBITDA Ratio (TTM) Outperformance May Sustain on Strong Earnings OutlookPer our proprietary model, the industry’s trailing 12-month free cashflow as of Dec 31, 2017 was $6.4 billion, significantly up from $542 million in 2016. This reflects that the industry has sufficient cashflow left for financing growth projects without the need to rely on debt and equity capital.Moreover, the industry has considerable lower exposure to debt as compared to the S&P 500. This is reflected in the industry’s debt-to-capitalization ratio of 34.7% against the S&P 500’s 47.2%. Hence, apart from adequate free cashflow, the industry has sufficient space for sponsoring future developments by debt capital if need arises. While the ratio analysis shows that there is a solid value-oriented path ahead, one should not really consider the current price levels as good entry points unless there are convincing reasons to predict a rebound in the near term. One reliable measure that can help investors understand the industry’s prospects for a solid price performance is the earnings outlook for its member companies. Empirical research shows that a company’s earnings outlook significantly influences its stock performance.The Price & Consensus chart for the industry shows the market's evolving bottom-up earnings expectations for it as well as the industry's aggregate stock market performance. The red line in the chart represents the Zacks measure of consensus earnings expectations for 2019 while the light blue line represents the same for 2018.Price and Consensus: Zacks US IntegratedIndustry This becomes clearer by focusing on the aggregate bottom-up EPS revision trend. The chart below shows the evolution of aggregate consensus expectations for 2018.Please note that the $2.69 EPS estimate for the industry for 2018 is not the actual bottom-up dollar estimate for every company within the Zacks Oil & Gas-US Integrated Industry but rather an illustrative aggregate number created by our proprietary analytics model. The key factor to keep in mind is not the industry’s earnings per share for 2018 but how this estimate has evolved recently.Current Fiscal Year EPS Estimate Revisions As you can see here, the $2.69 EPS estimate for 2018 is up from $2.03 at the end of April and 55 cents at the end of August 2017. In other words, the sell-side analysts covering the companies in the Zacks US integrated industry have been steadily raising their estimates.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Solid ProspectsThe group’s Zacks Industry Rank is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all member stocks.The Zacks Oil & Gas-US Integrated Industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #18, placing it in the top 7% of more than 250 Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.On top of that, our proprietary Heat Map shows that the industry’s rank has been in the top 50% for the past eight weeks with an overall steady upward trend.The solid near-term prospects are strengthened further by the recovery in top and bottom lines that integrated energy firms have been showing since the start of 2017.Revenues: Zacks US Integrated IndustryNet Income: Zacks US Integrated IndustryBottom LineProspects for upstream businesses seem promising as the current crude rally is expected to continue on numerous factors.Possibility of higher oil output from Saudi Arabia and Russia will not be able to offset global supply concerns emanating from Venezuela’s supply and Iran’s sanction issues. This is constantly driving WTI crude price. On top of that, a booming domestic economy, as reflected from robust job additions and the increase in labor force participation rate, is fueling the oil rally.  Midstream businesses are also picking up pace given the mounting demand for new pipeline networks in the domestic shale plays. Also, integrated energy firms are investing in petrochemical crackers in the Gulf Coast areas for capitalizing on cheap domestic natural gas feedstocks like ethane.Overall, it seems to be the ideal time to bet on four integrated energy companies with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and positive earnings estimate revisions.ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report): This Houston, TX-based firm has gained 66% over the past year. The #1 Ranked company’s Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year EPS has been revised 15.8% upward over the last 60 days.One-Year Price Performance: COPMarathon Oil Corp.

306,MRO,"The tit-for-tat tariff threats have become real with the two largest economies in the world entering into a trade war on Jul 6. The United States and China slapped tit-for-tat duties on each other’s $34 billion of exports after months of rhetorical tariff threats, with Beijing accusing Washington of triggering the ""largest-scale trade war.""Though investors shrugged off this initial round of trade war, the worst is yet to come. Tariffs on another $16 billion worth of Chinese goods is expected to go into effect in two weeks. And if Beijing retaliates, Trump has threatened additional tariffs on $500 billion in Chinese goods. These events could result in a global recession, hurting global supply chains, increasing costs for businesses and consumers, and slowing down investments.However, the markets emerged unscathed since the start of the trade war on Friday and showed its resiliency on strong economic fundamentals. A number of prominent Wall Street strategists remained bullish about the outlook for American equities given the expectations of double-digit earnings growth, accelerated buybacks, pro-business policies, historic tax cuts and a strong labor market.Solid TrendsThe confidence in economy has only increase, following a robust June jobs data on the day that Trump finally levied tariffs on Chinese goods. This is especially true as the United States added more-than-expected 213,000 jobs last month, representing the 93rd straight month of additions and the longest recorded streak. With this, America is being considered as being near full employment. Though the unemployment rate rose slightly to 4% from 3.8% as a higher number of workers are looking for work and not all of them have found one, wages grew at a relatively solid annual clip of 2.7%.With solid job gains, the nine-year old economic expansion, which is considered the second largest-ever, remains on solid ground. The momentum in the manufacturing sector continues to pick up with American factory activity acceleration for the second straight month in June. Several economists expect economic growth to accelerate to an annual pace of 4% during Q2, double the growth of 1Q.Additionally, the historic $1.5-trillion tax cut will create an economic surge, boosting job growth and reflation trade. It will further accelerate earnings, leading to record dividend and buyback activities. Additionally, the tax repatriation will allow companies to bring offshore cash back home, paving the way for increased mergers and acquisitions. A combination of all these factors bodes well for the stock market.Further, the strategists believe that the tariff threats are just Trump’s policy to fetch a better trade deal for the United Stated with its major allies. Trade deficit narrowed 6.6% in May to a 19-month low amid uncertain trade policies, adding to the bullish view. It has now fallen for three consecutive months and is down year over year.Other than the United States, Europe and Japan are also showing signs of improvement thanks to government policies that are still supporting growth and investment. The improving sentiments across the globe are also boosting investors’ confidence despite the looming trade war.Given the bullish trends but political jitters, investors could be well served by focusing on the stocks having a top Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), VGM Score of A and strong Industry Rank.

This Oil and Gas - Integrated - United States stock has actually seen estimates rise over the past month for the current year by about 23%. But that is not yet reflected in its price, as the stock lost 0.1% over the same time frame.Marathon Oil Corporation Price and Consensus Marathon Oil Corporation Price and Consensus | Marathon Oil Corporation QuoteYou should not be concerned about the price remaining muted going forward.

308,MRO,"Energen Corporation (EGN  -  Free Report) recently provided an update that Carl Icahn has boosted its stake holding in the company. This time, the activist investor raised its ownership from 6.9% to 7.5%.Icahn has been boosting its stake in Energen in a bid to take over the company. In May, Icahn and Keith Meister — the hedge fund manager of Corvex Management — expressed intentions to acquire Energen, which is undervalued as per their estimates.With exclusive focus on the prolific Permian Basin, Energen’s volume mix primarily comprises crude oil. From 2012 to 2017, the company boosted Permian net production to 76.1 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (MBOE/D) from 30.8 MBOE/D. Through 2018, the explorer expects production to grow to 95.5 MBOE/D. The ‘oilier’ nature of its volume mix positions it well to benefit from higher oil prices.  The oil and gas explorer’s balance sheet is significantly less debt-laden as compared to the industry. The debt-to-capitalization ratio of Energen is 17.5%, lower than the industry’s 46.2%. Moreover, the company’s strong cost-control initiatives should boost its profits. For 2018, Energen estimates lease operating expense (LOE) per barrels of oil equivalent between $6.40 and $6.60, lower than $6.61 recorded in 2017.The pricing chart of Energen is also impressive, reflecting investors’ appreciation for the company’s developments. Over the past year, the stock has rallied 55.7%, outperforming the 25.2% collective gain of the stocks belonging to the industry.Headquartered in Birmingham, AL, Energen currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Meanwhile, better-ranked players in the energy space are Continental Resources, Inc. (CLR  -  Free Report), Murphy Oil Corporation (MUR  -  Free Report) and Marathon Oil Corporation (MRO  -  Free Report). All these stocks sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. Continental beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in all the prior three quarters, the average positive surprise being 80.5%.Murphy Oil surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in each of the last four quarters.We expect Marathon Oil to witness year-over-year earnings growth of 336.8% in 2018.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?

309,MRO,"The following is an excerpt from Zacks Chief Strategist John Blank’s full Jul Market Strategy report To access the full PDF, click here. What’s the story in July to focus on?It must be that is the U.S. economy is doing fine. But the global stock markets are reeling from the ramp up of multiple trade wars.I. An Excerpt from the Global Outlook—What’s sage advice on global large cap indexes, in terms of looming U.S. trade wars?First, there’s the view of many -- the China A-share descent into a bear market since early April 2018 is proof -- the U.S. is going to win that part of its global trade war.For my part, I would not be as sanguine. Retaliation by China and a number of other trade alliances and countries can hurt many U.S. stock groups.The U.S. has imposed or threatened tariffs on products from countries including China, Canada and Mexico, as well as the European Union. Talk has gone on non-stop for months.There have been a few signs of less U.S. aggression, but not much. On Wed. June 27th, the Trump administration decided against creating a new regime to review Chinese investment in the U.S. They will instead use an updated version of the existing national security screening process -- to try to block Beijing’s efforts to acquire sensitive U.S. technologies.That’s about it for the ‘cooler heads will prevail’ crowd.The U.S. is set to begin imposing tariffs on $34B in imports from China on July 6th. Mr. Trump has also threatened to levy tariffs on up to $500B more in goods from China. Beijing has promised to retaliate in similar fashion.Canadian retaliatory tariffs of $12.6B took effect on Sunday, July 1st. The Financial Times has reported the European Union has threatened $300 billion in fresh tariffs against American products if Trump follows through on levies targeting European automakers.Going in a bearish direction, global automakers have warned us. President Trump’s plans to impose a significant tariff on auto imports could raise prices of imported vehicles by as much as $6,000 per car and raise prices of locally made cars, too.So what do you advise your clients? How seriously do you take this looming U.S. trade aggression into your advice? Do you suggest they stay calm, and not react too much?  My advice is to focus on specific shares and share indexes that are already maintaining their momentum, positive or negative. All of this news is already priced into stocks, at this point in time. If a stock has been going up, it likely will continue, and vice versa.II. Excerpts on the U.S. Economy, from the San Francisco Fed—The U.S. economy remains on a solid growth path. Sustained strengthening of employment opportunities and consequent gains in household income have been fueling consistent growth in consumer spending. This in turn is supporting business expansion plans and further employment gains, creating a virtuous cycle of economic growth.The pace of real GDP growth has been on an upward trajectory in recent quarters. The economy grew 2.8% between the first quarters of 2017 and 2018, well above the 2.2% average pace of growth since the expansion began in mid-2009. We expect this pace to continue in 2018.The key tailwind propelling growth is federal fiscal stimulus. With the waning effects of this stimulus over the next few years and the expected tightening of financial conditions, we project that growth will slow to our estimated sustainable pace of just under 2% by 2020.If the current expansion continues past June 2019, it will be the longest in business cycle records dating back to the mid-1800s. The risks of stiffening headwinds remain, notably from rising tensions over international trade, but they are unlikely to be severe enough to push the expansion off course.III. Zacks Sector/Industry/Company Telescope for JulyIt’s July. Covering analysts have moved on to looking at the 2nd half of 2018 now.At the start of 2018, the price trend of the stock market was more positive than now. We are listless with Trade War concerns.As for estimate revisions, grouped together, we enter the 2nd half of 2018 with the “Bull Market Sectors” (Tech, Industrials, Energy, and Consumer Discretionary) at the top of Zacks sectors. “Bear Market Sectors” (Utilities, Telcos, and Consumer Staples) are at the bottom.In addition, small and mid cap stocks have outperformed large cap stocks so far in 2018. This is Bullish and Cyclical too.Short-term interest rates moved higher with Fed tightening, while long-term rates are flat, due to European “QE”. This has reduced the short versus long risk-free spreads. In turn, this has kept Financials at a Market Weight, as banks borrow short and lend long.(1) Industrials are Very Attractive again. Metal Fabricating is Hot, and Aerospace & Defense, Conglomerates, and Pollution Control all look good.Top Zacks Stock: Mitsui and Co. (MITSY  -  Free Report)The Mitsui Group is a global empire comprising more than 860 subsidiaries and associated companies with operations in chemicals, foodstuffs, general merchandise, iron and steel, machinery, nonferrous metals, textiles, energy, and real estate and service industries.(2) Energy is now a Very Attractive sector, with the rise in oil prices. Energy-Alternates, Oil & Gas Integrated, and Oil Exploration and Production are the spots to study.Top Zacks Stock: Marathon Oil Corp (MRO  -  Free Report)Marathon Oil Corporation is a leading exploration and production company with extensive operations across four core regions - Africa, Middle East, Europe and North America. (3) Consumer Discretionary rises back to Market Weight. The best industry niches are Non-Food Retail/Wholesale, and Autos/Tires/Trucks.Top Zacks Stock: America’s Car Mart (CRMT  -  Free Report)America's Car-Mart operates automotive dealerships and is one of the largest automotive retailers in the United States focused exclusively on the Buy Here/Pay Here segment of the used car market.The company operates its dealerships primarily in small cities and rural locations throughout the South-Central United States, selling quality used vehicles and providing financing for substantially all of its customers. (4) Info Tech is back to an Attractive sector. The Semis are hot, once again.(5) Materials are back to an Attractive sector. The leader is Paper, followed by Steel and Metals non-Ferrous, and Chemicals.(6) Health Care is still Attractive. The best niche is Medical Care.(7) Financials are Market Weight. The top niches are Investment Banking & Brokering and Insurance.(8) Utilities remain Unattractive.(9) Consumer Staples stay Very Unattractive. The best is Agri-business and Food/Drug Retail. But they are just Market Weight niches.(10) Telcos remain Very Unattractive.

310,MRO,"A common investing misconception is that all exploration and production players will gain from the current rally in crude prices. However, all oil plays in the United States are not positioned to capitalize on the recovering commodity.Scenarios have changed as explorers and drillers have redirected their focus to the prolific Eagle Ford and Bakken plays instead of the crowded Permian. With the current crude rally expected to sustain on the back of numerous factors, it would be prudent for investors to place a wager on Eagle Ford and Bakken players.Oil Rally to Carry OnAfter November 2014, WTI crude has again touched the $75-a-barrel psychological mark. The rally will likely continue since oil demand is expected to remain robust amid persistent shrinkage in global supply.Factors to Drive DemandMany analysts believe that the U.S. economy will grow at a healthy pace to support crude demand. According to the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, the gross domestic product (GDP) of the United States will grow at an annualized rate of 4.5% through second-quarter 2018. This is going to mark the highest growth since 2014.In other words, the Fed expects the economy to improve after the first-quarter 2018 slump, when GDP growth rate slipped to 2% from 2.9% in the final three months of 2017. Improved domestic economic growth should drive crude demand.In fact, the global demand for crude is likely to grow 1.4 million barrels per day through 2018, claimed the International Energy Agency.  Factors to Limit Supply The State Department recently announced that the Trump administration wants all companies to stop purchasing Iranian oil starting early November. If this isn’t followed, America will not hesitate to apply sanctions on the firms. Since Iran is the third biggest producer of oil among the OPEC members, supply concern pertaining to Iranian crude is constantly boosting oil prices.Also, Venezuela, touted to be among the biggest oil producers in Latin America, has been witnessing a steep decline in crude production, aggravating crude supply woes. In 2017, Venezuela reported the lowest oil production in a decade.Saudi Arabia Will Outpace Permian Drillers U.S. shale players are exposed to limited short-term domestic production possibilities — especially in the Permian Basin — following pipeline bottleneck problems. It is to be noted that among all the major plays contributing to the record U.S. production levels, the contribution of Permian is the highest.Per BP Capital Fund Advisors, the production in the Permian will outpace the pipeline transportation capacity of the Basin by 300,000 to 400,000 barrels per day (B/D) through 2018. The gap will expand further to 750,000 B/D through 2019, added the investment management firm.Moreover, the number of drilled but uncompleted wells surged by 100 in the Permian Basin through May, reflecting limited production possibilities in the domestic shale plays.On the flip side, Saudi-led OPEC players and Russia agreed in the recent Vienna meet to relax the 18-month production cut deal, thereby increasing production starting Jul 1. Notably, the United States urgently wants Saudi Arabia to raise production to make up for the global crude supply shortage to some extent.Overall, the Sheikhs are positioned to make the most of the oil price rally by ramping up production. Meanwhile, the Permian drillers with limited production possibilities are clearly at a disadvantage.Bet on Bakken & Eagle Ford ExplorersIt is debatable whether Saudi Arabia will be able to outpace all U.S. shale plays in terms of production. However, for the time being, we can focus on some of the promising plays in the United States where most of the drillers have started to gather.U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) predicts new-well oil production per rig from Eagle Ford to increase from 1,470 barrels a day in June to 1,503 barrels in July this year. Also, for Bakken, new-well oil production per rig will likely rise to 1,470 barrels a day in July from 1,463 in June. Meanwhile, in the Permian Basin, EIA expects oil production per rig from new-well in July to total 620 barrels a day, same as the prior month.  Hence, investors who are looking to gain from the bullish crude scenario can bet on stocks with significant exposure to either the prolific Eagle Ford or Bakken play. Since picking winning stocks is not an easy job, we have employed our proprietary Stock Screener to narrow down the search to the following five stocks. The companies either carry a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Headquartered in Houston, TX, ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report) is focusing more on the Eagle Ford shale play than the crowded Permian Basin, per CEO Ryan Lance.The #1 Ranked company’s prime focus on the Eagle Ford is reflected in the first-quarter 2018 production picture. Through the quarter, the company’s daily oil equivalent production from the Permian Basin was recorded at 19,000 barrels, considerably lower than 163,000 barrels from Eagle Ford. (Read more: ConocoPhillips Chooses Eagle Ford Over Permian: Here's Why).Houston, TX-based Marathon Oil Corporation (MRO  -  Free Report) has extensive acres of resources in the oil-rich Eagle Ford. The Zacks #1 Ranked firm’s year-over-year rise in production, available for sale, in first-quarter 2018 was aided by solid contributions from U.S. resource plays in the Eagle Ford.Formed in 1967, Oklahoma City, OK-based Continental Resources, Inc. (CLR  -  Free Report) has a premier position in the Bakken area. The shale play, which is ranked among the country’s largest onshore oilfields, produces premium quality of crude. In the Bakken, this Zacks Rank #1 company has a working interest in 1,576 net oil producing wells.Whiting Petroleum Corporation (WLL  -  Free Report), headquartered in Denver, CO, operates premium acres in the prolific Bakken play. Being placed among the top oil producers in the Bakken, the Zacks #1 Ranked firm has its most profitable growth projects in the play.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

311,MRO,"Posting its fourth quarterly gain in a row, oil prices ended June 2018 up more than 14% sequentially. The commodity continued its bullish path during the April-June quarter after it got off to a strong start this year with the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures climbing about 7.5% in the first three months of 2018.The first half of the year saw oil benchmark in the United States attain its highest settlement since November 2014 despite record high domestic production. Crude was supported by a variety of catalysts, including a series of buoyant weekly EIA crude inventory numbers, worries about tightening global supplies in the midst of strong demand, and doubts over OPEC’s ability to boost production.What’s encouraging is that the half yearly price appreciation extends an upbeat tone in crude trade into the final six months of 2018 following the futures contracts’ back-to-back yearly increases. To be precise, the commodity rose about 23% in the first six months of 2018 to finish June at $74.15 per barrel.Reasons for Oil's Half-Yearly SurgeSharp Inventory Drawdowns: The U.S. Energy Department's inventory releases have shown multiple weeks of strong inventory draws in the domestic crude stockpiles, a pointer to a tightening oil market. Oil inventories have generally trended lower in a year and a half. In fact, stockpiles have shrunk in 44 of the last 64 weeks and are down more than 90 million barrels in the past year. The gradual fall – stemming from a combination of lower imports and spiraling exports – has helped the U.S. crude market shift from year-over-year storage surplus to a deficit. At 416.6 million barrels, current crude supplies are 18% below the year-ago figure and 4% under the five-year average.Red-Hot Demand: The major factor fueling higher oil prices is the fast-growing demand for the commodity, which continues to tighten the market. The International Energy Agency (IEA) in its closely watched monthly oil-market report, said that global demand is likely to grow by 1.4 million barrels a day this year as well as in 2019.OPEC Supply Concerns: Oil prices have also been supported by OPEC’s recent plans for a smaller-than-expected output raise. In June, OPEC agreed to stabilize the market by making modest increase in crude output. At the Vienna meeting, top producers came together and decided to raise volumes by about 1 million barrels per day from July to make up for falling production in Venezuela. The consensus figure was well below some of the numbers that had been floated ahead of the meeting, while the actual addition is expected to be even lesser – at around 700,000 barrels a day – due to several member countries’ inability to boost exports.Dwindling Venezuela Output: Fast-falling production in Venezuela have added to the jitters. With the country tethering on the verge of an economic collapse, oil output has dwindled by more than 40% since 2016. Venezuela currently churns out around 1.4 million barrels per day, the least since the 1950s and much lower that its pledge per the OPEC-led supply cuts. Fresh U.S. sanctions on the Maduro regime will further strangle the Latin American nation’s struggling energy sector.Potential Decline in Iranian Exports: Oil prices have also run up on United States’ refusal to issue any waivers on cutting crude imports from Iran by Nov 4 when sanctions are imposed against the Islamic Republic. Last month, President Trump withdrew from a nuclear deal with OPEC’s third-largest producer and pledged to reimpose sanctions on Tehran. The action has stoked worries about an expected cut in Iranian oil exports – at 2.7 million barrels a day – by around one million barrels and lead to a supply shortage in an already tight oil market.How to Identify the Outperformers?The strong half-yearly rally does not necessarily indicate that all energy scrips would be wise picks. Moreover, with a wide range of energy firms thronging the investment space, it is by no means an easy task for investors to arrive at stocks that have the potential to deliver attractive returns. While it is impossible to be sure about such outperformers, this is where the Zacks Rank, which justifies a company’s strong fundamentals, can come in really handy.In particular, we have shortlisted five companies that have outperformed oil prices year to date and have a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).

312,MRO,"Marathon Oil Corporation (MRO  -  Free Report) stock looks promising at the moment. We are positive about the company’s prospects and believe that it is the right time for you to add the stock to portfolio as it is poised to carry the momentum ahead.Evidently, shares of Marathon Oil have increased 81% in the past year, vis-à-vis the stocks in this industry that have collectively gained about 41%.Let’s take a look into the factors that make this leading upstream player a compelling choice for investors right now.What’s Working in Favor of Marathon Oil?Strategic Portfolio Puts Up a Stellar Show: As most of the drilling activities in the United States are centered in the Permian Basin, the shale play suffers from lack of takeaway capacity and widening differentials. However, with Permian accounting for just about 4% of Marathon Oil’s total production, the company remains largely unaffected by infrastructural bottlenecks and differential issues of the region.Instead, Marathon Oil has accelerated its growth momentum in resource shales like Oklahoma, Eagle Ford and Bakken shale plays. These low-cost high-margin shale plays have less traffic than Permian, therefore leading to narrower differentials and higher pipeline capacity.In the last reported quarter, the company recorded production available for sale of 284,000 oil-equivalent barrels per day (BOE/d), up from 208,000 BOE/d in the first quarter of 2017. With enhanced completion designs and effective spacing strategies, it has been improving the quality of its assets, and is well positioned to improve production and revenues.In fact, Marathon Oil raised its 2018 production growth guidance for these shale plays to 25-30% from the prior projection of 20-25%. The firm’s strong development inventory will enable visible production growth over the coming years.Divestment Spree Streamlines its Portfolio: Over the past few years, the Texas-based energy explorer inked several deals to sell non-core assets that do not fit into the company’s long-term growth plan.In August 2015, the company divested its Wilburton, OK assets worth $102 million. In November 2015, Marathon Oil jettisoned Gulf of Mexico (GoM) assets for a total price of $205 million. In April 2016, the company inked a deal to divest its Wyoming upstream and midstream assets to Merit Energy for $950 million. Further, in October 2016, the upstream player signed a deal to sell some of its non-core assets in West Texas and New Mexico for $235 million. Additionally, in March 2017, the company exited the high-cost Canadian oil-sands operations for $2.5 billion. This year Marathon offloaded its oil acreage in Libya to France-based supermajor TOTAL S.A. (TOT  -  Free Report) for $450 million. Notably, Marathon Oil exited from seven countries since 2013.These strategic sell-offs not only bolstered its portfolio, but also boosted financials. In fact, over the past two years, the company garnered proceeds of around $5 billion from its divestment deals.Healthy Financials Bode Well: Marathon Oil’s balance sheet seems quite strong, with adequate liquidity and manageable leverage of around 31%, which increases financial flexibility and helps it to tap the profitable growth opportunities. Following the divestment of Libyan operations in March 2018, the company had a hefty cash balance of around $1.6 billion. While the company plans to grow its annual production, it has kept its capital expenditure budget for 2018 unchanged with the prior levels and is also gaining from operational efficiencies.Delivering on its commitment, MRO achieved cash flow neutrality last year and is poised for strong free cash flow generation through the end of the decade. Needless to say, with improving FCF generation, we don’t expect management to shy away from resorting to more shareholder-friendly moves including dividend hike and potential buybacks like most peers including Hess Corporation (HES  -  Free Report), Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (APC  -  Free Report) and Devon Energy Corporation, among others.Other Favorable ReadingsConsidering the above factors, it should not come as a surprise that Marathon Oil sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) along with a VGM Score of A. Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2 (Buy) offer the best investment opportunities for investors. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Investors should note that the company displays a decent earnings history, having surpassed estimates in each of the last three quarters. What’s more encouraging is the solid estimate revision that the company is witnessing of late. In the past 60 days, eight estimates have moved north, while none moved south for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings has been revised upward by 47.5% for the same period. The company expects long-term earnings per share to grow 15.10%, higher than the industry’s growth rate of 12%.Marathon Oil currently has an average trailing 12-month EV/EBITDA ratio — which is one of the best multiples for valuing oil and gas companies as they have large amounts of debt — of 6.87, which is cheaper compared with the industry average of 9.09.In ConclusionMarathon Oil appears to be a solid bet based on strong fundamentals, impressive portfolio/production profile and robust financials, along with healthy share price performance. Hence, if you haven’t taken advantage of the share price appreciation yet, it’s time you add the stock to your portfolio.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

313,MRO,"It has been more than a month since the last earnings report for Marathon Oil Corporation (MRO  -  Free Report). Shares have lost about 6% in that time frame, underperforming the market.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to the stock's next earnings release, or is it due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Second-Quarter 2017 ResultsMarathon Oil posted second-quarter adjusted loss of $0.24 per share, wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of $0.14. Lower-than-expected production from the U.S. land markets impacted results. The loss was also slightly wider than the year-earlier adjusted loss figure of $0.23.Quarterly revenues of $1,059 million surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $965 million. However, revenues were down from the prior-year figure of $1,103 million.Segmental PerformanceNorth America E&P: Marathon Oil’s North American upstream segment reported a loss of $107 million, wider than the year-ago loss of $70 million. Lower output impacted results.Marathon Oil reported production available for sale of 222,000 oil-equivalent barrels per day (BOE/d), down from 224,000 BOE/d in the second quarter of 2016. The deterioration was mainly due to reduced drilling and completion activities mainly in the Eagle Ford and Bakken Basins.The company realized liquids (crude oil, condensate and natural gas liquids) price of $39.00 per barrel, higher than the year-earlier quarter level of $35.07 per barrel, reflecting an increase of 11.2%. Natural gas realizations increased 55.6% year over year to $3.05 per thousand cubic feet (Mcf).International E&P: The segment’s income increased to $59 million, compared with the year-ago income of $55 million. Higher price realizations and increased production boosted profit margin.The company reported production available for sale (excluding Libya) of 127,000 BOE/d, up from the 120,000 BOE/d in the second quarter of 2016. The increase in output in Equatorial Guinea and U.K. was responsible for growth.The company realized liquids price of $37.11 per barrel, a 15.6% rise from the year-earlier quarter level of $32.11 per barrel. Natural gas realizations increased 7.5% year over year to 57 cents per thousand cubic feet (Mcf).Costs & ExpensesMarathon Oil’s total quarterly cost and expenses declined by 10.1% to $1,085 million in the reported quarter compared with the prior-year figure of $1,207 million. The decrease is attributed to the lower exploration, production, marketing and general/ administrative costs. However, the decrease was partially offset by higher depreciation expenses and other operating costs.Balance SheetAs of Mar 31, 2017, Marathon Oil had cash and cash equivalents of $2,614 million. The long-term debt of the company was $6,715 million, leading to a debt capitalization ratio of 35.1%.Production GuidanceMarathon Oil has raised its production guidance for the full-year 2017 and expects the production available for sale from the combined North America and International E&P segments, excluding Libya, to average 345,000–360,000 BOE/d, about 7% higher than 2016.Marathon Oil expects third-quarter 2017 North America E&P output available for sale in the range of 230,000–240,000 BOE/d and International E&P (excluding Libya) output in the range of 115,000–125,000 BOE/d.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then? It turns out, fresh estimate flatlined during the past month. There have been two revisions higher for the current quarter compared to two lower.Marathon Oil Corporation Price and Consensus  Marathon Oil Corporation Price and Consensus | Marathon Oil Corporation QuoteVGM ScoresAt this time, Marathon Oil's stock has an average Growth Score of C, though it is lagging a lot on the momentum front with an F.

314,MRO,"Canadian oil major, Cenovus Energy Inc. (CVE  -  Free Report) recently agreed to divest its heavy oil properties in Pelican Lake and other eclectic assets to Canadian Natural Resources Limited (CNQ  -  Free Report) for C$975 million ($787 million) in cash, putting earlier speculation to rest. The deal is expected to be over by Sep 30, 2017.Asset DetailsProduction of heavy oil in the Cenovus' Pelican Lake assets began in 1997 through horizontal wells. Polymer mixed water is used here to boost the production process and increase efficiency without causing damage to the environment.The concerned assets currently produce 19,600 barrels of oil equivalent (BOE) heavy oil per day in northern Alberta, where price per flowing BOE a day is C$49,800.  First-half operating profit from the Pelican Lake assets is estimated at C$74 million.Cenovus' wholly owned Pelican Lake property is located approximately 300 kilometers north of Edmonton. In this context, we would like to remind investors that Canadian Natural has its crude oil producing property near the oil project of Cenovus in Pelican Lake. Also, this is Canadian Natural’s second domestic acquisition this year after the buyout of the Athabasca oil sands from energy major Marathon Oil Corporation (MRO  -  Free Report).Deal RationaleThe deal is in line with Cenovus' strategy of divesting C$5 billion to back up the C$16.8 billion acquisition of Foster Creek Christina Lake assets from ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report) in March 2017. The company plans to use the cash to partially pay down the $3.6 billion bridge loan facility that was part of the ConocoPhillips deal.Investors should also know that with the deal, the first of the four key asset sales, the company plans to bring down its net debt to operating earnings ratio below 2 by 2019.Properties ready for divestiture include Suffield shallow-gas assets in southeastern Alberta, Palliser in Alberta, Weyburn in Saskatchewan. These three properties have the capacity to produce a total of 85,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. The Suffield gas assets can bring Cenovus around C$600 million. However, there are apprehensions that the sale of these properties may not bring the company the C$5 billion that it seeks. In that case, the company can divest its other non-core assets.The deal will enable the company to optimize its asset portfolio as well as strengthen its balance sheet following the Foster Creek Christina Lake acquisition.Effect of the Deal on Stock Price                                                     As soon as speculation of the deal surfaced, it reversed the downward movement of the stock. It has gained almost 13% in the past seven days. The company is aggressively pursuing its divestiture plan and this can push share prices higher in the coming days.  About Cenovus and Zacks RankCenovus is an integrated oil company headquartered in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. The company remains focused on growing its oil projects and establishing natural gas and crude oil production in Alberta and Saskatchewan. Cenovus continues to work on advancing technologies to reduce the amount of water, steam, natural gas and electricity used in operations and to decrease surface land disturbance.Cenovus presently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

315,MRO,"Per Bloomberg, oil producer Canadian Natural Resources Limited (CNQ  -  Free Report) might be the one to acquire Cenovus Energy Inc.'s (CVE  -  Free Report) asset in Pelican Lake, Alberta, Canada. Canadian Natural will pay C$1 billion ($807 million) for the property.Canadian Natural and Cona Resources Ltd. were among the major bidders for the oil project in Northern Alberta near Fort McMurray. The asset in focus uses polymer flooding technology to increase oil recovery. The technology helps Cenovus to mix water and polymer, which is used to extract oil efficiently.  The company is divesting Pelican Lake properties to reduce its debt related to the C$16.8 billion acquisition of Foster Creek Christina Lake assets from ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report) in May 2017.Asset DetailsCenovus' wholly owned Pelican Lake property is approximately 300 kilometers north of Edmonton.

The polymers boost the production process and increase efficiency without causing damage to the environment.Oil production from the Pelican Lake assets at present is 20,100 barrels per day. Operating cost in the world class property is below $12 per barrel.Importance of the Deal to Canadian NaturalThe Canadian oil exploration and production company has its crude oil producing property near the oil project of Cenovus in Pelican Lake. The company has experience in operating heavy oil and polymer based property. Hence, the deal will provide Canadian Natural a strategic advantage and an edge over competitors.Canadian Natural also aims to focus on creating a diversified portfolio of light, primary heavy, Pelican Lake oil and natural gas liquids. Should the Pelican Lake deal go through, it will be Canadian Natural’s second domestic acquisition this year after the buyout of the Athabasca oil sands from energy major Marathon Oil Corporation (MRO  -  Free Report).About Canadian Natural and Zacks RankCanadian Natural is an independent oil and natural gas exploration, development and production company based in Calgary, Alberta.

316,MRO,"Hurricane Harvey is expected to be classified a Category 3 hurricane before it strikes the coast of Southeast Texas this morning, jeopardizing the oil refinery industry located in  and around Houston, the 4th largest city in the United States. This is a major hub for oil refineries, both U.S.-based and from elsewhere around the world. Rainfall could reach up to 35 inches from this storm, and flooding is the major hazard for the refinery industry.The last time a major storm hit this region was in 2008, when Hurricane Ike cost the industry roughly $30 billion, as well as more than 100 lives. Currently, Hurricane Harvey mounting the 17-foot sea wall in Galveston, TX may have devastating affects to Galveston Bay and the Houston shipping channel, one of the busiest ports in the U.S. and home to several oil refineries, such as Valero ((VLO  -  Free Report) and Marathon ((MRO  -  Free Report) and foreign-based TOTAL ((TOT  -  Free Report) and Petrobras ((PBR  -  Free Report). (And all this without Glen Campbell around any longer to sing Galveston’s praises.)Tragedy aside for a moment, if you’re looking for something to bolster oil prices, you may have just found it.

318,MRO,"The U.S. Energy Department's inventory release showed that crude stockpiles recorded its biggest drop since Sep on continued strong refinery runs. With oil supplies falling for the seventh week, investor sentiment has turned slightly positive on dissipating fears about a meltdown to sub-$40 levels. Analysts also believe that the trend, if sustained, could help tighten the market significantly.However, the positive effect from the hefty crude inventory draw was more than offset by the steadily rising domestic oil output that continues to be the biggest headwind for the market. At 9.502 million barrels a day, production is at the highest level in more than two years, thereby cancelling out cuts from OPEC and its allies. Surprise builds in refined product inventories – gasoline and distillate – added to the pessimism.As a result, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures shed 1.6% (or 77 cents) to $46.78 per barrel Wednesday.Investors Dump Energy StocksThe federal data sparked widespread selling in energy stocks, which pushed the Energy Select Sector SPDR – an assortment of the largest U.S. energy companies – down almost 1% Wednesday.The two energy representatives in the 30-stock Dow Jones industrial average, ExxonMobil Corp. (XOM  -  Free Report) and Chevron Corp. (CVX  -  Free Report) were down 0.7%. Meanwhile, some of the biggest casualties of the S&P 500 were oil and oil-related stocks like Helmerich & Payne Inc. (HP  -  Free Report), Diamond Offshore Drilling Inc. (DO  -  Free Report), Hess Corp. (HES  -  Free Report) and Marathon Oil Corp. (MRO  -  Free Report).Analysis of the EIA DataCrude Oil: The federal government’s EIA report revealed that crude inventories slumped by 8.95 million barrels for the week ending August 11, 2017, following a decline of 6.45 million barrels in the previous week.The analysts surveyed by S&P Global Platts – the leading independent commodities and energy data provider – had expected crude stocks to go down some 3.6 million barrels. Continued strength in refinery crude runs led to the massive stockpile draw with the world's biggest oil consumer even as domestic production rose to the highest level since Jul 2015.The seventeenth inventory reduction in 19 weeks has helped the U.S. crude market shift from year-over-year storage surplus to a deficit. Nevertheless, U.S. still remains awash with excess oil. At 466.49 million barrels, current crude supplies are in the upper half of the average range during this time of the year.However, stocks at the Cushing terminal in Oklahoma – the key delivery hub for U.S. crude futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange – was up a second week (this time by 678,000 barrels) to 57.05 million barrels.The crude supply cover was down from 27.4 days in the previous week to 26.7 days. In the year-ago period, the supply cover was 31.2 days.Gasoline: Supplies of gasoline were up for the second successive week as demand weakened. The nominal 22,000 barrels addition – contrary to the polled number of 400,000 barrels fall in supply level – took gasoline stockpiles up to 231.13 million barrels. Despite last week’s increase, the existing stock of the most widely used petroleum product remains 0.7% below the year-earlier level but is close to the upper limit of the average range.Distillate: Distillate fuel supplies (including diesel and heating oil) went up by 702,000 barrels last week, as opposed to analysts’ expectations for 700,000 barrels decrease in supply level. The first weekly rise in five weeks could be attributed to fall in demand. At 148.39 million barrels, current supplies are 3.1% below the year-ago level but are in the upper half of the average range for this time of the year.Refinery Rates: Refinery utilization edged down by 0.2% from the prior week’s 12-year highs to 96.1%.About the Weekly Petroleum Status ReportThe Energy Information Administration (EIA) Petroleum Status Report, containing data of the previous week ending Friday, outlines information regarding the weekly change in petroleum inventories held and produced by the U.S., both locally and abroad.The report provides an overview of the level of reserves and their movements, thereby helping investors understand the demand/supply dynamics of petroleum products. It is an indicator of current oil prices and volatility that affect the businesses of the companies engaged in the oil and refining industry.Stock to BuyGiven the bearish numbers above, it shouldn't come as a surprise that most of the companies from this space are set to underperform in the near term. Furthermore, the Oil-Energy sector has a Zacks Sector Rank in the bottom 13% (14 out of 16), so there is little hope for a turnaround soon.

319,MRO,"The global oil sector has come a long way since it witnessed a sudden slump. Related industries, as well as their constituent companies, faced the impact of low oil prices. Some companies even had to file for bankruptcy, as staying in the business became harder with their then-available sources. Thousands of jobs vanished from the industry. The demand for products in the oil industry is something that takes a long time to change. Therefore, price rise due to increasing demand was something farfetched. The next available option was to cut back supply and generate a little scarcity, which would be enough to bring oil prices to a bearable level for the companies. Oil cartels like the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) had to cut back supply.Upstream companies were forced to drop their contracts with drilling service providers, forcing them to cold stack their rigs. The process again killed some jobs. To survive the crash, most of the companies went for cost reduction options like improving production technologies, exiting from unprofitable sites and merger and acquisition.Improved Production TechnologiesFor the short term, to maintain cash flow, companies have been resorting to cost cuts through several techniques. Apart from the layoffs, instead of drilling one well at a time, oil producers like Statoil ASA  have been using rigs that can move on tracks or legs to complete drilling of several wells at a time. Not only does this reduce the time for drilling but also increases efficiency. As a result, operating costs also decline.Companies have also been using new fiber-optic sensors below the ground to receive data, which allows them to make informed decisions. With the help of the sensors, the oil upstream companies get to know the optimum depth of hard rock penetration as well as the required well spacing in the region. The fibers also help in keeping a track of temperatures, pressure and vibration on equipment underground, which helps companies to pull out before potential damages.Large companies are shifting from diesel to natural gas coming from the same field to power operations. This reduces cost per well in a field. The whole oil turmoil has brought in these new efficiency measures in the industry to lower expenses.Exit from Unprofitable Sites Oil companies have been looking for reserves where extraction and production processes are cheap. They are selling high maintenance assets and shifting toward lower production costs plays. In this context, we can mention the mass exodus from the Canadian oil market to the Permian Basin to avail low extraction and production costs.Oil companies like ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report), Statoil, Royal Dutch Shell plc (RDS.A  -  Free Report), ExxonMobil Corp. (XOM  -  Free Report), Marathon Oil Corp. (MRO  -  Free Report) and others are leading the way. This is pushing the companies quickly toward stable balance sheets. Oil companies are discovering new oil reserves but choosing to operate on those whose production cost is less. Shell presently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Merger and AcquisitionSome companies are opting for mergers and acquisitions to reduce expenses, enjoy cost synergies and increase revenue streams through diversification, in the long run. The mergers and acquisitions ensure the survival of the fittest in the industry. A couple of examples (involving huge transaction amounts) include the $70 billion merger of Shell and BG group, the $30 billion merger between General Electric Co. and Baker Hughes Inc. and others.5 Trades Could Profit ""Big-League"" from Trump PoliciesIf the stocks above spark your interest, wait until you look into companies primed to make substantial gains from Washington's changing course.Today Zacks reveals 5 tickers that could benefit from new trends like streamlined drug approvals, tariffs, lower taxes, higher interest rates, and spending surges in defense and infrastructure.

320,MRO,"It was a week where both oil and natural gas prices suffered losses.On the news front, upstream biggies Pioneer Natural Resources Co. (PXD  -  Free Report) and Apache Corp. (APA  -  Free Report) came up with contrasting second quarter results, while pipeline firm Genesis Energy L.P. (GEL  -  Free Report) is set to enter the chemical industry with the acquisition of the alkali business of Tronox Ltd.Overall, it was a dismal week for the sector. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures edged down 0.3% to close at $49.58 per barrel, while natural gas prices declined 5.7% to $2.7740 per million Btu (MMBtu).Following the year’s best week, oil prices logged a slight drop this time around. The commodity was affected by lingering concerns over OPEC and its allies' success in rebalancing the market after a survey showed that the cartel's output climbed to the highest level of the year in July and its exports were at record levels. Meanwhile, domestic production rose to a 2-year high.However, most of the negativity was offset by the U.S. Energy Department's inventory release that showed a sharp increase in refinery demand. Investors also cheered a lower rig count as it pointed to the softening of shale drilling activities.  Natural gas also turned lower amid worries over the fuel’s tepid demand on the back of bearish weather predictions and a steady increase in production.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    Leading upstream energy company Pioneer Natural Resourcesreported second-quarter 2017 earnings, excluding one-time items, of 21 cents per share. The bottom line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 11 cents per share. Notably, the company had incurred adjusted loss of 22 cents per share in the year-earlier quarter. Significantly high commodity price realizations along with the Spraberry/Wolfcamp horizontal drilling program resulted in the strong quarterly performance.Total production in the reported quarter averaged 259.1 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (MBOE/d), up 12% year over year. The Spraberry/Wolfcamp horizontal drilling program of the company led to the outperformance. On an oil equivalent basis, average realized price was $32.56 per barrel in the reported quarter as compared with $28.95 a year ago.For 2017, Pioneer intends to spend $2.7 billion, lower than the prior projection of $2.8 billion. Of this, it has planned drilling and completion capex of $2.4 billion and spending budget for water infrastructure, vertical integration and field facilities of $275 million. Pioneer expects production in the range of 274 MBOE/d to 279 MBOE/d for the third quarter of 2017.(Read more: Pioneer Natural Q2 Earnings Top on Increased Drilling.)2.    U.S. energy firm Apache Corp. reported second-quarter loss per share – excluding one-time items – of 21 cents against the Zacks Consensus Estimate for a profit of a penny. The underperformance stems from a dip in output due to a conservative capital budget over the past two years. However, the bottom line improved from the year-ago loss of 26 cents amid higher realizations.The production of oil and natural gas (excluding divested assets and non-controlling interests) averaged 387,562 oil-equivalent barrels per day (BOE/d) (65% liquids), down 16% from last year.The average realized crude oil price during the second quarter was $46.89 per barrel, representing an increase of 9% from the year-ago realization of $43.14. Moreover, the average realized natural gas price during the Jun quarter of 2017 was $2.60 per thousand cubic feet (Mcf), up 27% from the year-ago period.After aligning its spending plans with the low-price environment during the oil rout, Apache is now looking to increase its capital investment after achieving cost rationalization. With returns-focused growth in mind, Apache announced a 2017 capital budget of $3.1 billion, representing a 60% increase over its 2016 spend.Keeping with the company’s planned shift in strategic objective, Apache’s oil and gas capital investments totaled $738 million during the Apr-Jun period, 85% higher than the $400 million incurred a year ago. (Read more Apache Reports Q2 Loss on Reduced Production.)3.    Oil and gas transportation and refining partnership, Genesis Energy, L.P. recently announced that it will enter the chemical industry with the acquisition of the alkali business of Stamford, CT-based Tronox Ltd. Per the deal, Genesis Energy will be shelling out $1.325 billion in cash to the chemicals and minerals maker for the assets.Investors should know that Tronox's alkali business, located at its Green River, WY. facilities, which is one of the biggest in the world, includes the trona and trona-based marketing, mining, exploring, processing, producing, and selling operations. It produces approximately 28% - 4 million tons - of the world's natural soda ash (sodium bicarbonate) output every year. It is used for various purposes like glass making, baking of goods, detergents, industrial chemical production, etc.Genesis Energy – carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) – believes the alkali business has a reserve life of more than 100 years. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The buyout will help Genesis Energy in terms of its current asset base and aid the partnership to serve the refineries and petrochemical facilities connected with its pipelines better. It is in line with Genesis Energy’s strategy to diversify its business.Per the partnership, the soda ash assets generate stable cash flow, which might help with its $3.02 billion debt, as reported in second-quarter 2017. The estimated EBITDA from the business for the last 12-month period, which ended on Jun 30, 2017, was $166 million. (Read more: Genesis Energy Eyes Chemical Industry with Alkali Unit Buyout.)4.    Houston, TX-based leading upstream energy firm Marathon Oil Corp. (MRO  -  Free Report) posted second-quarter adjusted loss of 24 cents per share, wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 14 cents. Lower-than-expected production from the U.S. land markets impacted results.Marathon Oil reported North American production available for sale of 222,000 oil-equivalent barrels per day (BOE/d), down from 224,000 BOE/d in the second quarter of 2016. The deterioration was mainly due to reduced drilling and completion activities mainly in the Eagle Ford and Bakken Basins.Marathon Oil’s total quarterly cost and expenses declined by 10.1% to $1,085 million in the reported quarter compared with the prior-year figure of $1,207 million. The decrease is attributed to the lower exploration, production, marketing and general/administrative costs. However, the decrease was partially offset by higher depreciation expenses and other operating costs.Marathon Oil has raised its production guidance for the full-year 2017 and expects the production available for sale from the combined North America and International E&P segments, excluding Libya, to average 345,000–360,000 BOE/d, about 7% higher than 2016.

321,MRO,"Energy explorer Marathon Oil Corporation (MRO  -  Free Report) is set to release second-quarter 2017 results after the closing bell on Aug 2.In the last reported quarter, the Houston, TX-based company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 12.50% on the back of increased price realizations and cost-control initiatives. As far as the company’s earnings surprise history is concerned, it has an impressive record. Marathon Oil beat estimates in the last four quarters with an average positive surprise of 20.47%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement. Marathon Oil Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Marathon Oil Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Marathon Oil Corporation QuoteFactors at playBeing an upstream firm, weakness in the commodity prices might lower exploration and production activities. Oil prices have been falling below the psychologically-critical $50 threshold again, erasing all the gains associated with the OPEC-led output cut. The continued rise in domestic production owing to higher shale output has dragged down prices. During the second quarter, the price of oil and natural gas declined by 8.4% and 5%, respectively. This might dent the company's earnings and revenues.The year-over-year decline in production and uncertainty regarding its low-cost Libyan operations are also causes of concern. Lack of growth opportunities is another threat. This also accounts for our bleak earnings outlook for the company.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Marathon Oil is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is -15.39%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at a loss of 15 cents, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at a loss of 13 cents.Zacks Rank: Marathon Oil currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Note that we caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Ranks #4 and 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some companies from the energy sector that, according to our model, have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Noble Corporation (NE  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +3.03% and a Zacks Rank #3. The company is likely to release earnings on Aug 3.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Enbridge Inc (ENB  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +38.24% and a Zacks Rank #3.

(APA  -  Free Report) reported second-quarter loss per share – excluding one-time items – of 21 cents against the Zacks Consensus Estimate for a profit of a penny. The underperformance stems from a dip in output due to a conservative capital budget over the past two years.

325,MRO,"Markets are a little more than halfway through the Q2 earnings season, with 57.2% S&P 500 members having reported results as of Friday, Apr 28.Picture Emerging Thus FarWe now have Q2 results from 286 S&P 500 members that combined account for 68.8% of the index’s total market capitalization. According to the latest Earnings Preview, total earnings for these companies are up 11.3 from the same period last year on 6.1% higher revenues, with 74.5% positive earnings surprises and 69.2% beating revenue estimates.Energy Earnings SoarThe ‘Energy’ sector has been off to a spectacular start. For the 48.5% sector components on the S&P 500 index that have reported Q2 results, total earnings surged 226.2% on 15.5% higher revenues. While 50% of the companies have been successful in beating earnings estimates, 81.3% outperformed the top line.Energy: First Half RecapLast year, 'Energy' was the strongest S&P sector performer, with a market-thumping 24% return. In particular, November's historic OPEC-led production cut deal to alleviate a supply glut managed to buoy oil prices and stabilize them around the psychologically important $50 per barrel threshold. The commodity was on a stellar run on optimism surrounding the agreement, and the outlook for oil stocks was getting better.The seemingly positive developments encouraged investors to bet on firming prices for 2017 with the oil industry finally hoping that 'this would be the year.' True to the strong sentiments, U.S. oil prices reached around $55 per barrel in late February, the highest level in 19 months.However, the situation is drastically different now, with the commodity floundering in recent weeks. By Jun 21, crude had cratered more than 20% from its February highs and officially plunged into bear territory. In fact, prices ended down 14.3% for the first half of the year – the worst performance since 1998.Let's take a look at how oil and gas prices behaved during the second quarter of this year.Strong Q2 Earnings Growth PredictionA look back at the Q1 earnings season reflects that the overall results of the Oil/Energy sector were spectacular, driving the aggregate growth picture for the S&P 500 index.The Jan-Mar 2017 period turned out to be a rather good one with both oil and natural gas prices benefiting from easier comparison figures from the year-ago period. While crude slumped to some 12-year low in the first quarter of 2016, natural gas futures dropped to its worst level in almost 17 years.As a result, the sector – whose year-earlier comparison was to an aggregate loss – came out swinging. For the sector components on the S&P 500 index, total Q1 earnings saw robust year-over-year dollar growth on 33.8% higher revenues. While 69.7% of the companies were successful in beating earnings estimates, 63.6% outperformed the top line.The picture looks rather encouraging for the upcoming Q2 earnings season as well. This is not surprising, considering that oil and gas are both averaging higher compared to the second quarter of 2016 when the energy companies reported unusually low bottom line. While earnings for the Oil/Energy sector are set to jump a massive 249.0% – the highest year-over-year growth among all sectors – the top line is likely to show an improvement of 16.5% from the second-quarter 2016 levels.Stocks to Watch for Earnings on Aug 2Let’s see what’s in store for four energy companies expected to come up with June quarter numbers on Wednesday, Aug 2, after market close.First, we have energy infrastructure provider The Williams Companies Inc. (WMB  -  Free Report). In the previous quarter, this Tulsa, OK-headquartered transporter of oil and gas missed estimates, weighed down by rising costs and expenses.Regarding earnings surprises, The Williams Companies has a decent record, having missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate just once in the last four reports. And our model indicates that the company is likely to beat on earnings this time around too.This is because, as per our proven model, a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to beat estimates. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.For the quarter to be reported, The Williams Companies has an Earnings ESP of +50.00% and a Zacks Rank #3, wh the right combination of two key ingredients. (Read more: Is Williams Companies Poised for a Beat in Q2 Earnings?)Simultaneously, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Williams Companies, Inc. (The) Price and EPS Surprise  Williams Companies, Inc. (The) Price and EPS Surprise | Williams Companies, Inc. (The) QuoteHeadquartered in Houston, TX, Occidental petroleum Corp. (OXY  -  Free Report) is another energy player set to report second-quarter 2017 results. The company – with significant exploration and production exposure, together with chemical and midstream operations – has a mixed track of having outperformed estimates in two of the last four quarters.However, Occidental Petroleum is not expected to add to its positive surprises in the to-be-reported quarter. This is because the company has a Zacks Rank #4 and an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. (Read more: Is Disappointment Likely for Occidental in Q2 Earnings?)Occidental Petroleum Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Occidental Petroleum Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Occidental Petroleum Corporation QuoteThen there is Houston, TX-based leading upstream energy firm Marathon Oil Corp. (MRO  -  Free Report) coming up with April-June operational results.As far as earnings surprises are concerned, Marathon Oil – whose business is organized into North America and International segments – has an excellent history, having gone past the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four reports. However, with an Earnings ESP of -7.14% and a Zacks Rank #4, our proven model shows that an earnings beat is unlikely for Marathon Oil in the upcoming quarterly release. (Read more: Will Marathon Oil Disappoint Investors in Q2 Earnings?)Marathon Oil Corporation Price and EPS Surprise   Marathon Oil Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Marathon Oil Corporation QuoteLastly, we have Concho Resources Inc. (CXO  -  Free Report) reporting second-quarter 2017 results. Coming to the earnings surprise history, this Midland, TX-headquartered energy explorer – with producing properties mainly in the Permian Basin of southeast New Mexico and west Texas – has been on a bull run: it went past estimates in all the last four quarters, resulting in an average positive surprise of 247.57%.Powered with the right combination of two key ingredients – an Earnings ESP of +2.33% and Zacks Rank #3 – our proven model shows that an earnings beat is likely for Concho Resources in the to-be-reported quarter as well.Concho Resources Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Concho Resources Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Concho Resources Inc. QuoteWill You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.See This Ticker Free >>
